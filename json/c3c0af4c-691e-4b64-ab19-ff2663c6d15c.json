He recognized the great deceiver by how he had cloaked himself in that blackness, the color of the north, the color of death. He had lured the stinking, filthy dogs over the great waters and across the marshes and maize fields to surround the twin jewels in the center of the world. The serpent wall had not kept them out; nor had all the warriors of the House of Eagles.</p><p>They had not, for Sokojotsin had himself opened the city to them. He had welcomed them, these foul creatures, and demonstrated his superiority by bestowing many gifts on them, and permitted them to dwell among the people so that he might know them as he had known the others who had come before them. But their priests had deceived him, and he soon discovered that none of them had ever walked the path of the beautiful death. In his anger Sokojotsin had released the thousand blades to kill many of them, and drive out the rest.</p><p>That rage had been his greatest mistake of all.</p><p>The dogs had run away in fear, but their greed soon overcame their cowardice. So they made treaty with and gathered his enemies, and with them marched on the city, and conquered it in the name of their faceless God. For all of seventeen days they had drenched that indifferent altar with the blood of those they had butchered. The rest they imprisoned so that they could be questioned . . . and questioned they had been, until they died of it.</p><p>Sokojotsin was one of the last left alive. Soon they would come for him, he knew. They would come and pierce him with their ugly blades, or separate his head from his neck. His heart would die in his chest. His death would have no meaning.</p> <p>He had railed at them through their smiling, cringing priests, roaring of his magnificence, of his splendor. He who had been bathed every fourth hour, who had never donned the same garment again, who had never fucked the same woman twice in a year, the sun god, the ruler of the universe, son of the silent death, the warlord and the rain, beloved of highest clouds and coldest air, the light of war, the skinner of souls.</p><p>No more. The dark metal of the gods had cast him down cruelly before the invaders, and he was undone. Now there would be no coming forth of flowers for him, no dances in his memory, no offerings of jade and serpentine. He would be tossed into one of their pits and left to rot among the peasants, without so much as a few grains of maize placed on his tongue.</p><p>He glanced at the pile of bread sitting beside the gap in the bars through which they pushed it each day. Green-gray mold covered it now. Dust and dead insects floated on the untouched water in the pail. They did not understand why he would not eat or drink, but they would not enter the cell to force it on him. Cowards, all of them.</p><p>\u201cSinner.\u201d</p><p>Although the scribe was one of the few dogs that spoke his tongue, Sokojotsin did not look upon his squat, robed figure hovering outside the bars. He would not pollute his eyes with the scribe\u2019s meekness.</p><p>\u201cSinner, I have been sent by the captain to ask you one last time,\u201d the scribe said in his pompous fashion. \u201cGive me the secret of the thousand blades, and your death will be quick and merciful.\u201d</p> <p>Sokojotsin caught one of the beetles burrowing happily into the heap of moldy bread and held the squirming bug between two of his broken fingers. \u201cThat I could be as you, little glutton, crawling the stones and cowering in shadows so that I might eat of the shit of these dogs.\u201d He crushed the beetle and tossed it to the scribe, who scuttled away.</p><p>\u201cYou have transgressed against the one and only God,\u201d the scribe ranted. \u201cYou are cursed for all eternity. This is your last chance to save your soul.\u201d</p><p>Sokojotsin closed his eyes against the burning light streaming into his cell and waited. They would next bring one of his nineteen children before him, or perhaps one of his wives. His beloved ones would not beg, but the dogs would threaten to rape the women before his eyes or cut the throats of his sons unless he confessed. That was their way.</p><p>\u201cMajesty.\u201d</p><p>The deep, soothing voice of his ambassador seemed to come from within Sokojotsin\u2019s dreaming, and he smiled a little until he smelled his blood. He opened his eyes to see his most trusted one standing on the other side of the bars.</p><p>Beads of blood welled on Tendile\u2019s cracked lips as he spoke. \u201cI am brought to beg you, Majesty; do as they will of you. Could I bite the tongue from my mouth, I would, but . . .\u201d He smiled, showing his torn, empty gums. \u201cThis kindness I would show myself, they have taken from me.\u201d</p><p>With some difficulty Sokojotsin rose and hobbled over to the bars. He could no longer stand straight, but neither could Tendile; nor would his most trusted one meet his gaze. \u201cLook upon me, pipiltin.\u201d</p><p>His ambassador\u2019s bloodshot, pain-clouded eyes shifted with such reluctance that compassion filled Sokojotsin\u2019s heart. \u201cSire, I am the rot of the temple before you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot so, my child.\u201d Sokojotsin fit his hand through the bars and graced his most trusted one with a touch to his swollen face. \u201cIt is I who sent you, and I who have failed you. You and all my people.\u201d</p><p>Tears trembled on the other man\u2019s lashes. \u201cMajesty, we have brought this disgrace. In our shamed eyes you are as the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour strong heart could never fail me,\u201d he assured him. \u201cSo I would see you end as beautiful as it is.\u201d</p><p>Too overcome to speak, Tendile nodded.</p><p>The scribe appeared beside his ambassador. \u201cEnough of this nonsense,\u201d he said to Tendile. \u201cTell him\u2014\u201d His words dissolved into a girlish scream as blood sprayed into his face.</p><p>Sokojotsin jerked his hand out of his most trusted one\u2019s chest, bringing with it Tendile\u2019s heart, which pulsed once more before it went still. He lifted it up to the sunlight, praising the warrior\u2019s soul before he brought it to his mouth and drank.</p><p>The bars opened, and spiked cudgels struck Sokojotsin over and over before the dogs dragged him out. Tendile\u2019s offering had given him enough strength to lash out at them, but he did not resist or strike back. He would not give them the dignity of death.</p><p>They hauled him through the prison they had made of his palace to the temple, where their captain stood and watched over Sokojotsin\u2019s metalworkers. The scribe spoke quickly in their graceless tongue while he pointed and capered around the bloody prisoner.</p><p>The captain jerked up Sokojotsin\u2019s head by his hair and spit out a handful of words.</p><p>\u201cYou have committed the mortal sin of murder,\u201d the scribe translated out loud. \u201cYou will burn for it and all your other transgressions unless you tell us now. Tell us the secret of the thousand blades.\u201d</p><p>Sokojotsin kept his eyes closed as he licked the last of the blood from his lips.</p><p>\u201cSo be it. May God have mercy on your evil soul.\u201d</p><p>They dragged him to the pounding stones, where they used dark metal to lash him in place. He would die on his knees, but in a few moments he would join those who had gone before on the star path, the most beautiful path of all.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me.\u201d</p><p>Sokojotsin felt the heat against his face, and opened his eyes to see the captain standing before him, his heavy gauntlets wrapped around the shaft of the vat dipper. Inside the deep bowl yellow-white molten ore bubbled, so hot that tiny flames danced around the edges.</p><p>\u201cOpen his mouth.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>June 1, 2010</p><p>\u201cShe says I don\u2019t understand women. Right before she gets up and walks out of the restaurant,\u201d Vincent O\u2019Hara said as he reached out the driver\u2019s window to empty the last inch of cold coffee from his thermal mug. \u201cJust like that. So I get to spend our first date sitting there by myself and eating seventy bucks\u2019 worth of lobster and prime rib.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand women.\u201d Charlotte Marena yawned as she flipped through the completed incident reports on her clipboard and signed the bottom of each. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask for a take-home box and go after her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hungry.\u201d Vince scowled at the sound of her chuckle. \u201cWell, I was, Charlie. Besides, if I\u2019d gone after her, she\u2019d have made a federal case out of whatever I did and starved me for a couple more hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you about dating a Botoxed bulimic,\u201d Charlie told him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not like that.\u201d Her partner sounded less certain now. \u201cYou\u2019re not always right about them.\u201d</p><p>She thought for a moment. \u201cLet\u2019s see, the last one was separated, not single. The one before that had just gotten out of rehab, and the one before her was already pregnant. So, yes, I am always right about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. So how could you tell this time?\u201d</p><p>Informing her partner exactly how she knew his new flame was a botulism and binge junkie wasn\u2019t an option. \u201cFirst two things I noticed about her.\u201d She pointed to the center of her forehead. \u201cNeedle marks.\u201d She brought her finger down and touched her lips. \u201cPerpetual Listerine breath.\u201d</p><p>Vince grunted. \u201cYou could have mentioned it after I slept with her. Which also didn\u2019t happen.\u201d He checked his watch before he moved into the turn lane. \u201cTime to pack it in. By the way, I did stop by her place on the way home to make sure she was okay. She wouldn\u2019t answer the door or her phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably too busy gorging on whatever she planned to puke up.\u201d She covered a yawn with her hand. \u201cYou should date someone on the job. We\u2019re too tired to be neurotic.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cYou keep turning me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for Taylor Lautner to be legal.\u201d She reached for the radio mike on the console. \u201cDispatch, this is Echo one-M-seven.\u201d After the dispatcher at EMSC responded by repeating their rig\u2019s call sign, she added, \u201cTen ninety-eight to switch Adam, en route SFGH.\u201d</p><p>After a short pause the dispatcher replied with, \u201cEcho one-M-seven, advise your twenty.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Charlie glanced at the GPS. \u201cDispatch, we\u2019re about two miles southwest of Doyle Drive bay-side.\u201d</p><p>The call came back at once. \u201cEcho one-M-seven, respond code one to GGB viaduct, report of multivehicle collision with injuries, eleven eighty-one, CHP on scene.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>GGB. Charlie\u2019s blood ran cold.</p><p>\u201cAh, great.\u201d Vince groaned as he rolled the steering wheel to make a U-turn and head toward the enormous, orange-red suspension bridge that could be seen from virtually any spot in the city. \u201cFucking East Bay commuters couldn\u2019t wait another fifteen minutes to get to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen-four, Dispatch.\u201d Charlotte flipped on the lights to avoid looking at the bridge. \u201cEcho one-M-seven en route, ETA two minutes.\u201d She couldn\u2019t let her phobia get the better of her, so she retrieved a war story for her partner. \u201cBe grateful. Last time Tom and I took an eleven eighty-one, we had to evac a pregnant woman with a fractured tibia from a bad fall. I had to push her gurney all the way from the end of the pier.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBig deal,\u201d Vince said. \u201cI could jog that in my sleep with two gurneys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe weighed four hundred pounds, screamed for her mama the entire time, and nearly ripped the restraints off,\u201d Charlie told him. \u201cOh, did I mention she was in hard labor, and the baby crowned by the time I got her streetside for the chopper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get all the best calls, Marena.\u201d Vince yelped as she punched his shoulder. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>As Vince sped toward the Golden Gate Bridge, Charlie removed their handhelds from the console charger and clipped them to their belts. After their last call, she\u2019d stowed their carry-ins in the back to swap out at shift change, and they were both running low on dressings. Fortunately she and Vince were both religious about checking and restocking their supply bins before shift start. \u201cI\u2019ll grab some more packing; anything else you need for your bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used my last collar on that HNR.\u201d Her partner swerved around a slow-moving semi and blew through a red light. \u201cTraffic had better be on point. I don\u2019t feel like dodging rubberneckers or lane hoppers.\u201d</p> <p>Providing quality EMS care to the citizens of any busy, overcrowded metropolitan city always presented major challenges, but since Governor Schwarzenegger had signed Assembly Bill 2917, the county\u2019s emergency medical services authority had been required to overhaul most of their existing licensing and response systems. The bill, which had been enacted to assure that all paramedics and EMTs were properly certified, licensed, and subject to criminal background checks, had put nearly half of the city\u2019s private ambulance services on probation for failure to comply with the new law. Many EMTs who had been concealing unsavory pasts had been fired, but others who felt outraged at the prospect of being fingerprinted and otherwise treated like criminals had simply quit, resulting in a severe shortage of qualified techs.</p><p>The fire department, the primary provider of the city\u2019s 911 medical services for the past fourteen years, had already been wrestling with call-management and response-time problems in every district. Unfortunately the state\u2019s response to its economic troubles was to institute a hiring freeze at the same time, which resulted in Charlie and her coworkers pulling mandatory double shifts every week. They were also coping with the department\u2019s new \u201cdynamic deployment\u201d policy, which required ambulances to be stationed at different grid points around the city versus waiting at their district stations for calls. It had improved their initial response time, but if a second incident call came in for the same area while they were responding to the first, then other rigs had to be diverted from their assigned points, which created instant gaps in the deployment grid.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help that one-third of the calls the department received every year were for nonemergency situations. Most of those callers turned out to simply need a ride to the hospital, and thought the fire department should provide free taxi service. Some days Charlie felt more like a bus driver than a medic.</p><p>The windshield turned white as the dense fog rolling in from the bay swamped them, erasing the bridge entrance road and making the two bridge towers appear as if they were nothing more than a couple of bright red clips sticking out of an old lady giant\u2019s fluffy white hair.</p><p>Vince flipped on the fog lamps before he peered ahead. \u201cYou see the HP?\u201d</p><p>Charlie spotted the muted red and blue lights flashing through the fog. \u201cLooks like he\u2019s up by the pylon.\u201d She ignored the tightening in her chest and picked up the mike. \u201cEcho one-M-seven, dispatch, please advise traffic response to eleven eighty-one GGB city-side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEcho one-M-seven, Marin County Sheriff currently diverting southbound at tollbooth,\u201d the dispatcher told her. \u201cCHP backup en route, ETA four minutes.\u201d</p><p>Marin County had shut down the tollbooths, which would keep commuters coming from the opposite direction toward San Francisco off the bridge, but the accident was located on the south end, where there were no tollbooths, and Highway Patrol was two minutes behind them. While northbound traffic was lighter in the mornings, rush hour still attracted thousands of drivers. Low visibility due to the fog added another dangerous obstacle, one that had the potential to turn a simple fender bender into a massive pileup.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that trooper doing, just sitting up there instead of setting up the barricades?\u201d Vince grumbled. \u201cHow much you want to bet he\u2019s some rookie tossing his last coffee and doughnut over the railing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bet against the Highway Patrol,\u201d she told him as she gnawed at one side of her bottom lip before she called in again. \u201cDispatch, Echo one-M-seven, ten forty officer on scene?\u201d They didn\u2019t usually radio the patrolmen directly, but the northbound lanes needed to be blocked off now.</p><p>\u201cEcho one-M-seven, OS is code six, not responding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d her partner said. \u201cHe\u2019s puking his guts out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr he\u2019s performing CPR.\u201d Charlie frowned. Even the greenest rookies knew to carry their handhelds with them when they left their vehicles. Something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cWhat else would keep him so busy that he couldn\u2019t respond to dispatch?\u201d Vince demanded.</p> <p>Charlie knew. \u201cJumper.\u201d</p><p>The Golden Gate Bridge held one grisly honor, in that it was the most popular place in the world to commit suicide. Roughly twice a month someone leapt from the deck and dropped two hundred and forty-five feet to the water below, where they almost always died on impact. Those few who survived hitting the water\u2019s surface, which at the height and speed of the jump was equal to crashing into a concrete wall at seventy-five mph, would then either drown or succumb to hypothermia.</p><p>A few years back Charlie had been disgusted to learn that a documentary maker had been given permission by the bridge authority to film the bridge as a monument, only to use the permit to secretly capture footage of twenty-three of the twenty-four suicides that had occurred that year.</p><p>Vince, one of the few people aware that Charlie actively avoided the bridge\u2014no one knew why\u2014was giving her the quick glances of a man trying to drive too fast and see whether his partner was going to lose it at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call for another rig,\u201d he said, reaching for the mike.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She put her hand on his to stop him. \u201cOdds were that it would happen sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlie, we gotta go on the bridge, and you\u2019ve got fucking bridge-a-phobia,\u201d he said. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m fine.\u201d No, she wasn\u2019t, but as much as she wanted to dump the call on someone else, she couldn\u2019t dodge her responsibility. Nor could she ask Vince to drop her off at the next corner and let him handle it alone. She would do her job, no matter how many ghosts were waiting for her at the scene.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never told the powers that be about this thing of yours, have you?\u201d Vince asked.</p><p>\u201cNot something you put on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9, partner.\u201d She rubbed her eyes. \u201cYou know, I won\u2019t even drive across the goddamn thing. I always take the ferry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood day to get over this shit, then,\u201d Vince said, giving her shoulder a gentle cuff. \u201cFerry\u2019s too fucking slow.\u201d</p><p>To keep from screaming, Charlie focused on the call and what possibly could have gone wrong. Highway Patrol responded to jumper calls, and often talked down the suicidal before they took the fatal leap. If the officer on scene was actively engaging the jumper, he might have temporarily turned down his radio to keep from spooking them.</p><p>But as they approached the S1 pylon, Charlie didn\u2019t spot anyone on the walkway or the deck railing. In fact, she could see the black Highway Patrol car with its distinctive white door and golden star emblem, and the trooper still sitting in it. He\u2019d parked it in front of a blue compact, a silver SUV, and what appeared to be a long black limousine. From the damage to both vehicles Charlie could see that the SUV had rear-ended the compact, crushing the trunk as well as crumpling its own hood. The limo sat facing the compact as if the driver had been driving in the opposite direction and had swerved over and stopped to render assistance.</p><p>Or the rich asshole told his driver to make a U-turn on the bridge and caused the accident, Charlie thought. That would be more logical.</p><p>She needed to learn what she could before the sun rose, so she closed her eyes and listened. The blare of the rig\u2019s sirens and her own fluttering heartbeat dwindled away and a different sound filled her thoughts.</p><p>The thought stream came roaring through her. Can\u2019t give in can\u2019t let her be shot he won\u2019t die she will the pain I can\u2019t stand it damn it let me think.</p><p>The agony he was feeling came along with his thoughts, and racked her with such intense pain that she almost doubled over. She managed to shut off the stream and looked at the CHP vehicle, but she couldn\u2019t tell whether the thoughts were coming from the trooper.</p><p>As Vince drove up behind the trooper\u2019s car, Charlie\u2019s eyes went into snapshot mode, taking in the scene with brief, intense glances. Car doors left hanging open. The flash of an orange taillight. Two bodies sprawled in the middle lane. A third lay half in, half out of the compact\u2019s driver-side door. She focused on the most important elements at the scene\u2014the victims\u2014and began to assess. Bloodied clothes, slack faces, awkward positions. None of them moved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Death. Once more, the bridge was covered in it.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Vince reversed, turning the rig so that they faced oncoming traffic, and switched on their front and side flashers. \u201cYou ready for this?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cGo.\u201d</p> <p>Charlie jumped out, running behind to yank open the doors and grab their carry-ins. She paused only long enough to stuff two handfuls of bandages into a side pocket before she trotted around and tossed Vince\u2019s bag to him. Her partner ran to the two victims in the road while she went to the officer.</p><p>\u201cOfficer, why are you . . .\u201d She stopped as she saw the telltale spiderweb of cracks around the small hole in the patrolman\u2019s front windshield, and the corresponding hole in the officer\u2019s forehead. She reached in to check for a pulse that no longer beat before she grabbed her handheld. \u201cDispatch, Echo one-M-seven, EMP Charlie Marena, ten ninety-seven S-one pylon, ten one-oh-eight, officer down, GSW to the head, request immediate assistance\u2014\u201d</p><p>Something cracked sharply, then whined in her ear as her radio unit exploded in her hand. At the same time a man\u2019s voice shouted, \u201cGet down.\u201d</p><p>Charlie wrenched open the trooper\u2019s door and crouched behind it, looking out at Vince, who was trying to shield the victims with his own body.</p><p>Another disjointed thought stream began jabbering inside her head: Golden giant midnight girl all here now master I see I can do this I can take them bring them have my reward live forever yes live forever at his side his forever always eternity yes I can do this forever and ever and ever.</p> <p>\u201cCharlie.\u201d Vince grabbed both bodies by the collars of their clothes and began dragging them toward her. \u201cShooter.\u201d</p><p>Staying crouched over as far as she could, she met her partner halfway and seized one of the bodies under the arms.</p><p>\u201cThe cop?\u201d Vince demanded.</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d She saw her patient\u2019s chest move and the blood oozing from the head wound of Vince\u2019s vic. \u201cBut these two aren\u2019t. Let\u2019s move it.\u201d</p><p>They managed to drag the two victims behind the patrolman\u2019s unit and grab Charlie\u2019s bag before another shot rang out. This time it shattered the back window of the limo.</p><p>As they went to work on the victims, Vince popped his head up to look around. \u201cDid you see where he is?\u201d</p> <p>There were no other vehicles at the scene, and hardly anyplace on the bridge where a gunman could hide. But the morning fog had effectively blanketed the bridge deck all the way past the south tower, so for all Charlie knew he could be standing out in the open on one of the walkways, or even atop the safety railing.</p><p>As the gunman fired again, she grabbed Vince\u2019s shoulder and jerked him down. \u201cCareful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways . . . right.\u201d Her partner swayed and then slumped over, blood streaking down his face from a long, deep gash in his scalp.</p><p>\u201cVince.\u201d</p><p>She eased him down and straddled him, working quickly to probe and then dress the wound as she tried to rouse him. \u201cO\u2019Hara? Come on, partner. No sleeping on the job.\u201d</p><p>His eyelids fluttered, and he groaned. \u201cFucker . . . caught me.\u201d He squinted at her. \u201cHow . . . bad?\u201d</p><p>She checked his pupils with her penlight, and felt a surge of relief when they reacted normally. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to be parting your hair differently from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, are you hurt?\u201d</p> <p>Hearing her name being called out by the man from the limo made Charlie frown. \u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d He must have heard her using her radio and assumed Charlie was short for Charlotte. \u201cStay where you are. Are you injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My driver was shot in the chest,\u201d he called back. \u201cHe\u2019s lost a great deal of blood.\u201d</p><p>The driver had to be the one whose thoughts and pain she\u2019d picked up. Or this driver might not exist and Limo Guy was the shooter, trying to lure her out in the open. Until she got closer to them she wouldn\u2019t know. \u201cSir, do you know where the gunman is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouth tower,\u201d he answered. \u201cLeft side.\u201d</p><p>Charlie glanced over the edge of the vehicle at the tower, but at first saw only fog and shadows. Then the first rays of the sun pierced the fog, and a tiny glint of light flashed from the base of the tower. A second later another window blew out on the limo.</p><p>Charlie\u2019s relief was short-lived. Limo Guy wasn\u2019t trying to make her victim number seven, but the man by the south tower would, and to be able to do this much damage from that distance meant he had the skills and accuracy of a highly trained sniper. Hearing the wail of approaching sirens didn\u2019t improve the situation; if the gunman had enough ammunition, he could shoot anyone who set foot on the bridge.</p><p>Somehow Charlie had to warn the cops.</p><p>Quickly she searched through the clothing of the two victims to look for a mobile phone, but found nothing. \u201cSir,\u201d she called out toward the limo. \u201cDo you have a phone with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are two in the car,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t leave James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Stay right there with him.\u201d She slung the strap of her carry-in over her neck and cinched it so that it pressed against her chest. She lowered herself to the ground on her forearms and knees, letting the fog waft over her before she began crawling toward the limo.</p><p>It seemed to take forever, and the roughness of the asphalt scraped through her sleeves and trousers. Charlie held her breath as she moved across each open gap, praying silently that the fog was concealing her movements as much as she hoped. By the time she reached the shiny front bumper of the big car she was shaking all over.</p><p>As soon as there was enough limo between her and the sniper, Charlie yanked the strap over her head and rose in a half-crouched position, moving quickly to the two men taking cover behind the rear wheel well of the limo. One was a slim, dark-haired man wearing a chauffeur\u2019s uniform with blood blooming on the right side of his jacket; the other man was a golden-haired, bearded hulk in a black trench coat. The hulk had the chauffeur cradled against his arm, and held a folded, red-splotched white silk scarf pressed against the wound in his chest.</p><p>He looked up at her with narrow black eyes that were all wrong for his Nordic golden hair and gorgeous mocha skin.</p><p>Something like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu came over her. Charlie would have sworn on a stack of Bibles that she had never seen the man before this moment. He was too big, too odd, too unforgettable, and yet . . . she knew him.</p><p>The jolt of familiarity had to be some kind of fluke, she thought, shrugging it off. She\u2019d seen someone like him once; that was all.</p><p>\u201cHe can barely breathe,\u201d the man told her.</p><p>She glanced at the blue tinge around the driver\u2019s lips and the distended veins in his neck, and her focus abruptly shifted back to her job.</p><p>\u201cWere you shot?\u201d she asked him as she tore open the chauffeur\u2019s jacket and used her stethoscope to check his heart and lung sounds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis lung has collapsed.\u201d She reached into her case and pulled out her pneumothorax pack. \u201cI have to bleed out the air trapped in his chest or his heart will fail. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Samuel, and you are Charlotte.\u201d He said her name precisely, and with a certain amount of satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cActually, I go by Charlie.\u201d She smiled to remove the sting. \u201cNow, let\u2019s put James here down on his back.\u201d</p><p>Once they had carefully lowered the driver onto the ground, Charlie pulled his clothing out of the way and took out the scalpel from the pack.</p><p>Samuel frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of operating on him. Not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m simply going to make a small incision so I can put in a tube to remove the air.\u201d As she lined up what she needed on the driver\u2019s chest, she saw Samuel\u2019s expression. \u201cI know this sounds scary, but I\u2019ve done it a hundred times and I haven\u2019t lost anyone yet. So don\u2019t freak out on me, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cHere we go.\u201d She made the incision, cutting through the skin and the underlying tissue, and then fed the decompression catheter into his body just above the ceph-alad border of the rib to avoid the intercostal vessels. Within a few seconds the driver\u2019s breathing became less labored, and his lips began to turn pink.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d She taped the catheter in place and checked his breathing sounds again before she turned her attention to the blood-soaked scarf. \u201cSam, I need you to move your hand now. When James was shot, did you see any blood spurting from his gunshot wound? Like a little geyser or fountain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was more of a small stream. A pulsing stream.\u201d As she reached for the edge of the scarf, he reluctantly took his hand away. \u201cIs it his heart?\u201d</p><p>She carefully lifted the side of the makeshift bandage and inspected the wound, noting the position of the small, neat hole and the seepage from it. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look that way. I think the bullet might have just nicked the lung. We\u2019ll know better when we get him to the hospital.\u201d She began dressing the chest wound. \u201cWhere exactly are the phones in the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne is in the front console by the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d he said, nodding in that direction, \u201cand the other is on the right side of the rear-facing seats in the back.\u201d</p><p>Neither would be easy to reach unless she opened the limo\u2019s doors and crawled inside. \u201cDispatch doesn\u2019t know about the sniper. I have to call this in before backup arrives.\u201d She cringed as a shot pinged off the roof of the limo. \u201cSon of a bitch. How much ammo has he got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe backseats are in his direct line of fire,\u201d Samuel told her as he moved to the other side of James\u2019s still form. \u201cI\u2019ll retrieve the phone from the front.\u201d</p><p>He was already moving toward the driver\u2019s door before she could argue with him. \u201cKeep your head down,\u201d she called after him.</p><p>The sniper fired three more times before Samuel returned with the cordless receiver. As glass shattered over their heads, he ducked, lost his balance, and nearly fell over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Charlie grabbed his sleeve and righted him. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only a bit awkward.\u201d He leaned on his left side and rubbed his hand over his thigh. \u201cNormally I use a cane to walk.\u201d</p><p>She saw the cane in question several feet away by the deck railing. The gold handle had been cast in the shape of a lion\u2019s head. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do without it for now.\u201d She put the receiver on speaker and dialed the emergency number for dispatch, which the shift supervisor answered immediately. \u201cThis is Echo one-M-seven, EMP Marena. We have five GSW casualties on the bridge with an active sniper at the base of the south tower, left side.\u201d She rapidly related the details of the wounded before she added, \u201cMy partner has been shot and I\u2019m taking cover with two of the vics.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStand by.\u201d The supervisor repeated the details she\u2019d given him over the police emergency band before issuing terse orders to reroute other rigs to the scene. Finally he said, \u201cEcho, we can\u2019t get to you until SWAT responds and secures the scene. Keep this line open and use your MCI protocols.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcknowledged, dispatch.\u201d Another window blew out over their heads, pelting them with broken glass. \u201cYou want to tell SWAT to move their asses, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re on the way,\u201d the supervisor promised. \u201cHang in, Echo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are MCI protocols?\u201d Samuel asked as she started an IV on the driver.</p><p>She tore off a strip of tape and rolled it over the gauze she\u2019d placed over the needle. \u201cIt\u2019s how we respond to a mass casualty incident.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou consider this a mass casualty situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny incident that has more patients than the on-scene responders can treat or transport is an MCI,\u201d she told him. \u201cThe protocol we use is called START, for simple triage and rapid treatment, which includes tagging everyone.\u201d She pulled her tags out of her bag. \u201cJames here gets a red tag, which means he\u2019s salvable but he needs immediate treatment.\u201d She taped the oversize tag onto the driver\u2019s sleeve and then clipped another onto Samuel\u2019s lapel. \u201cYou\u2019re walking wounded, so you get one of these.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at the green tag. \u201cI\u2019m not wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a tag for \u2018nothing happened to this guy,\u2019 so it\u2019s the next-best thing.\u201d She shoved the rest of the tags in her pocket, where she could easily reach them, and slung her carry-in strap over her neck. \u201cI have to get back and tag the others. You keep your head down, and yell for me if James starts having trouble again.\u201d</p><p>One of his huge hands clamped around her wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Samuel Taske was not accustomed to trying to restrain a woman with physical force. Aside from his size and strength, both of which bordered on superhuman, he had been taught virtually from birth to treat all females with gentleness and respect.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t consider it a hardship in the slightest. He adored everything about women: their scents and smiles, their instincts and intelligence. He often watched them with the wistful longing of a man who had already accepted that he would live out his life alone, thanks to the additional psychic gift that allowed him to see individual time lines as they stretched out far into the future. He had used it to examine his own future, which followed a solitary path that would never be crossed or entwined with that of a wife or children.</p><p>That he was prepared to break Charlotte Marena\u2019s wrist to keep her from leaving him had nothing to do with his feelings about women. He had come to this place, to this bridge, solely for the purpose of keeping her alive. If he had to put her in a cast to do so, he would.</p><p>\u201cSam, I have to do this,\u201d she was saying in a careful, gentle tone she probably used with people suffering some sort of mental crisis. \u201cI need to check on the other patients and make sure they\u2019re doing okay. It\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything for them if you\u2019re dead, Charlotte.\u201d He didn\u2019t release her. \u201cThe police will be here soon. I can hear the sirens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might have a hostage negotiator try to talk him down first,\u201d she said. \u201cThat kind of thing usually takes time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to entertain you with stories from my last trip overseas.\u201d He had to stop staring at her big dark eyes; he felt as if he were about to tumble into them. \u201cHave you ever been to Paris? Very old and stately. Amazing cuisine. Dreadful waiters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I have.\u201d Instead of lightening, her expression turned grim. \u201cMuch as I\u2019d love to hear all about your jaunts around the globe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOye, cabr\u00f3n.\u201d</p> <p>The high-pitched shout came from the tower beyond, and Charlotte\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI know you hear me, pendejo.\u201d A short laugh followed the shout, and then, \u201cHey, hermana, ese tipo tiene mucha lana, eh? Maybe after, he give you a big reward, eh?\u201d</p><p>Samuel frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t speak much Spanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. He says you have a lot of money,\u201d Charlotte said, her mouth tight. \u201cYou know this jackass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Half the truth was better than none. \u201cDo you think you can persuade him to cease fire?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte rubbed her eyes and sighed before she called out, \u201cSe\u00f1or, deje lo que est\u00e1s haciendo y esc\u00fa-chame.\u201d</p><p>From that point Charlotte spoke too rapidly for Taske to follow, but he took advantage of her focus on the sniper to remove one glove and ease his hand inside his coat. Dragging James out of the car had torn some of the stitches in his side, but thanks to his body heat the blood-soaked linen of his shirt had partially dried and was beginning to stanch the old wound. He\u2019d thought he might have to use it as an excuse to keep Charlotte with him, but now that she had engaged the sniper, there was no need to mention it.</p><p>Not that he wished to. Charlotte would want to know how he had sustained the injury, and he couldn\u2019t tell her the truth. She would never believe that he had been attacked by werewolves and wild animals, all of whom had been under the mind control of Lilah Devereaux, a powerful Kyndred friend whom Taske believed also held the key to a cure for his own condition. He\u2019d stalked Lilah, hiring detectives to hunt her down for him, but his foolish actions had nearly gotten them both killed. In the end Lilah had forgiven him, but Taske had yet to overcome his own shame.</p><p>The mellow contralto of Charlotte\u2019s voice felt soothing to his ears, and he allowed himself to rest against the side of the car and watch her. For the first time since his ability had manifested it had been maddeningly short on details; unlike the other people he had rescued over the years, this woman\u2019s time line had been shrouded in darkness. He\u2019d been unable to discern who she was, where she lived and worked, her surname, or any clue of what her destiny was, although he sensed it to be of critical importance to humanity. In the end he had been forced to act on the only thing he did know: that unless he saved her, a woman named Charlotte would be murdered on the Golden Gate Bridge by a suicidal man.</p><p>Until she had crawled out of the fog, Taske hadn\u2019t even known exactly what Charlotte would look like, another first for him. For some reason he had expected her to be a dark, petite angel with a beguiling smile, not a fierce-eyed Amazon with as many muscles as she had curves. No doubt her statuesque proportions had drawn some criticism from those who kissed the bony, wasted feet of current fashion, but she made him think of the glory of forgotten eras, when towering warrior queens had been worshiped as goddesses.</p><p>Acolytes of Apollo would have made her their high priestess; sunlight had scattered golden streaks through her dark brown hair and kissed her brown eyes with amber flecks. Her tanned skin had a delicious bloom to it, like the rose flush of a ripe peach. He had never met a woman who looked more vital and alive than Charlotte Marena, which made his mission all the more imperative. Something inside her made her glow like a beacon of hope; her mysterious destiny must be directly linked to hundreds if not thousands of other lives.</p><p>After she repeated the same question three times, Charlotte fell silent and listened. After a minute and no response from the gunman she shook her head and glanced at Taske. \u201cThis guy isn\u2019t a Chicano\u2014a Mexican-American,\u201d she tacked on as an explanation of the term. \u201cI can\u2019t place his accent, either. He\u2019s trying to talk like a street thug but he\u2019s using formal Spanish. He\u2019s also slurring his words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that significant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be caused by drug use or psychosis.\u201d She hesitated before she said, \u201cSometimes these guys go off because they\u2019re sick. Whitman, the guy who shot all those people from that tower in Texas back in the sixties, had an aggressive brain tumor.\u201d</p><p>Taske heard equal parts of frustration and regret in her voice, and saw the way she kept glancing toward the east. \u201cYou can\u2019t negotiate with a diseased mind, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Neither can the cops.\u201d She picked up the phone. \u201cDispatch, Echo one-M-seven, come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, Echo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease advise SFPD and CHP\u2014\u201d</p><p>The high-pitched voice from the tower interrupted her as the sniper shouted at them.</p><p>\u201cStand by, dispatch.\u201d She listened, frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat is he saying?\u201d Taske prompted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something about white willows.\u201d She turned her head. \u201c\u2018The time has come for us to go, by day or by night, down into the mysteries of death. I make my tribute,\u2019 or maybe \u2018my offering. . . .\u2019 \u201d</p><p>A shout came from the tower. \u201c\u00a1La Raza C\u00f3smica!\u201d</p><p>Her expression grew alarmed. \u201cOh, God, he\u2019s going to jump.\u201d She shot to her feet. \u201cSe\u00f1or, por favor, esc\u00fa-chame ahora\u2014\u201d</p><p>Charlotte stood too far away for him to pull down, and Taske forgot about the burning, twisting snake wrapped around his own spine as he shot up and staggered forward to shield her with his body. He had his arms around her when she cried out, but not because she had been shot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A man\u2019s limp body fell from the tower. At first Taske couldn\u2019t make sense of it, until he saw the blood streaking the slack face. An instant later the body slammed into the walkway railing before it flipped and disappeared over the side.</p><p>It seemed that the gunman had taken one final life\u2014his own.</p><p>Charlotte closed her eyes and turned her face against his chest. She didn\u2019t speak, but her whole body shook violently.</p> <p>He stroked her back as he stared at the now-empty tower. Although the pain searing his back and side had yet to abate, he felt a sense of overwhelming relief along with a terrible pity.</p><p>\u201cI need to check the others,\u201d Charlotte said as she stepped away from him, her voice still raw with emotion. \u201cCan you give me a hand and get the gurney from my rig?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to do nothing more than slide to the ground and stay wherever he landed, but he nodded and limped over with her to where her partner and the other victims lay. Every step sent a new jolt of misery along his spine and tore at the edges of the wound in his side. As she pulled her tags from her jacket he hobbled past her to open the back doors of the ambulance. He had to pause for a moment to catch his breath before he unbuckled the strap holding the gurney in place. Pulling it out of the back of the rig almost caused him to fall atop it, and he braced his hands against the side rail as he fought back the pain.</p><p>She has enough to deal with now, Taske thought, staring down at his whitened knuckles. I can wait until more help arrives.</p><p>Years of stringent self-discipline allowed him to move through the pain until it subsided enough for him to breathe again. With some difficulty he reached down to lock in place the wheels on the extending frame.</p> <p>Charlotte appeared on the other side of the gurney. If anything, she looked even paler than before. \u201cSam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you\u2014\u201d He stopped as he saw the man behind her, and the rifle he held pointed at the back of her head. He was the same man who had been shooting from the tower. Taske was so shocked to see him he said exactly what he thought. \u201cYou threw someone else off the bridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d The man jerked his chin at the open back of the ambulance. \u201cInside.\u201d</p><p>Before Taske could reply Charlotte said, \u201cDo what he says.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the gurney inside and used the open door to hoist himself into the back of the rig. The effort sent him to his knees, but he recovered quickly.</p><p>Charlotte followed, turning around at once to face the gunman. \u201cPlease stop this. Leave us here; we won\u2019t try to stop you. You can still get away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one escapes the master.\u201d The gunman\u2019s lips parted, showing beautiful white teeth that had been filed down to sharp points in a shark\u2019s grin. He slammed the doors shut.</p><p>Charlotte grabbed the inside handle, jerking on it. \u201cHe\u2019s jammed it,\u201d she said to Taske as she spun around, scanning the interior. She went still as the door to the front cab opened and closed and the engine started. \u201cNo, he can\u2019t\u2014Damn it.\u201d She pushed past Taske and went to the sliding window, pounding on it with one fist. \u201cHey, listen to me. You can\u2019t do this; those people out there are in\u2014\u201d</p><p>Something hissed, and she coughed and fell back against Taske.</p><p>He looked down at her chest, expecting to see blood and a bullet wound, not smoke pouring from a small metal canister in her lap. He held his breath and bent over, trying to grab it, but it rolled off her leg and disappeared under the gurney.</p><p>Taske\u2019s eyes burned as he dragged Charlotte to the back of the rig, where he heaved himself against the doors. Metal dented and groaned, but they remained locked. He slammed his shoulder into them until white fire enveloped his spine, felling him as it forced out the breath he was holding.</p><p>Taske coughed uncontrollably, but somehow managed to hold on to Charlotte\u2019s limp form. He dragged her close, trying to focus his bleary gaze on her still features. Even if the gunman didn\u2019t kill them both, Samuel knew from the warm wetness he now felt seeping from his side how unlikely it was that he would ever see her face again.</p><p>His last thought was of how utterly he had failed her. I wish I had been stronger, Charlotte. Then I might have saved both of us. . . .</p><p>Chapter 2</p> <p>The CEO of the most powerful biotech corporation in the world looked down the length of the conference table at the faces of his department heads. None were fool enough to avoid Jonah Genaro\u2019s gaze or show their emotions, but he could smell the fear hovering, an invisible, quivering cloud over their heads.</p><p>\u201cI have reviewed all the reports regarding the incidents in Denver and New York.\u201d He let the stack of files in his hands drop onto the table. \u201cAll they tell me is that this company has now failed three times to secure acquisitions vital to the successful development of the transerum.\u201d</p><p>One of his attorneys discreetly adjusted the knot in his tie. \u201cMr. Genaro, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to divert unwanted attention from the media and the federal authorities. I strongly advise that we consider a fresh approach to . . . acquiring . . . these particular assets for the project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Eliot Kirchner, Genaro\u2019s chief geneticist, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for some time that a select group is somehow communicating with one another, and we\u2019ve seen evidence of cooperative behavior. They could be organizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. The last thing these people want is for anyone to know what they are,\u201d Don Delaporte, Genaro\u2019s security chief, said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to start a members-only club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how do you explain the losses here in Atlanta?\u201d Kirchner demanded. \u201cBellamy had help escaping capture. So did the female shifter in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know Andrew Riordan interfered in the Bellamy case,\u201d Delaporte said, referring to Genaro\u2019s former technical supervisor. \u201cWe were unable to uncover any connection between him and Gerald King, who enabled the shifter to escape capture in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Evan Shores, the head of accounting, said.</p><p>Delaporte ignored him. \u201cNor was Riordan in any way involved with Tina Segreta\u2019s operation in Denver. You\u2019re seeing conspiracies everywhere, Doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Shores used a too-loud voice, and cringed a little as everyone turned to stare at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there is someone who was peripherally involved in two of the incidents.\u201d</p><p>Genaro sat down. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, an antiques dealer named Samuel Taske, sir.\u201d The accountant sat up a little straighter. \u201cBefore he died, Gerald King appointed him executor of his estate, as well as the legal guardian of his teenage daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing\u2019s daughter was already cleared,\u201d Kirchner snapped. \u201cShe\u2019s too young to fit the profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that, sir,\u201d Shores assured him. \u201cSamuel Taske also flew to Denver the day after you and Ms. Segreta arrived there.\u201d He pulled a sheet from his file. \u201cI have the hotel records.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know about Taske?\u201d Genaro asked.</p><p>\u201cWe ran a standard background check on him when he assumed custody of the King girl,\u201d Delaporte said. \u201cHe\u2019s the son of Davis Taske, the discount-supermarket-chain mogul. As the sole heir, Samuel Taske inherited fifteen billion dollars from his family\u2019s estate, which he has since doubled, mainly through the acquisition and sale of rare art and antiquities. He maintains a controlling interest in Taskecorp, but continues to work as an antiques dealer out of Boston. Tax records show that over the years Taske sold several works of art to King. Taske also gave the eulogy at King\u2019s funeral and called him his \u2018good friend.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Genaro turned to the accountant. \u201cWhy was Taske in Denver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say, sir,\u201d Shores admitted, \u201cbut his financial records show that he travels frequently around the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not unusual for a man who buys and sells antiques,\u201d Delaporte said. \u201cTaske is well-known in his business, and he\u2019s never tried to avoid publicity. Quite the contrary; we were able to access dozens of photos of him from newspapers and trade magazines.\u201d</p><p>Genaro, who knew the value of hiding in plain sight, wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cCan you tell me where he was when the New York operation fell apart?\u201d</p><p>Shores consulted his records. \u201cHe flew to New York a week before Gerald King died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt to find the daughter,\u201d his security chief said. \u201cShe ran away from home just after King was diagnosed with terminal cancer. After the old man died, Taske was the one who found her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this good friend of Gerald King\u2019s just happened to go to Denver at the exact same time we lost two of our acquisitions.\u201d Genaro sat down. \u201cMr. Delaporte, I want a complete investigation performed on Samuel Taske. Find out everything about him they don\u2019t print in antiques magazines. Mr. Shores, I want to see a complete breakdown on his personal and business financial records.\u201d</p><p>Shores nodded eagerly. \u201cHow far should I go back, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBirth, Mr. Shores.\u201d He regarded the rest of his supervisors. \u201cThe rest of you gather the peripheral data. I want to see lists of known associates, employee rosters, medical records, school transcripts, every single thing this man has done since he was removed from the womb. I expect prelim reports by close of business today. Now get out.\u201d</p><p>All of his employees except one quickly left the conference room. Kirchner lingered by the door and, once the last supervisor passed him, closed it.</p><p>Genaro didn\u2019t glance at him. \u201cI am not in the mood for one of your tantrums, Eliot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s fortunate that I\u2019m not planning to have one.\u201d He walked over and placed a slim jewel case on the table in front of Genaro. \u201cI received this last night from the lab in Denver. It\u2019s all the data they were able to recover from Segreta\u2019s laptop.\u201d</p><p>Genaro frowned. \u201cGive it to technical for analysis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll want them to analyze her final video phone conversation with you.\u201d He sat down in the chair beside him. \u201cYou had her sedate me and search me on the plane. Why?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course Tina had recorded everything; she hadn\u2019t been in the business of selling merely herself. \u201cShe led me to believe that you were working for outside interests.\u201d</p><p>Kirchner removed his jacket and began rolling up his sleeves.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten why I do this.\u201d Once he had bared his forearms, he turned his wrists out so that the old, dark lines marring his skin were visible. \u201cYou remember the conditions of my last employment. They kept me locked in that lab for years. They deliberately addicted me to heroin to keep me motivated. The only reason I\u2019m alive is because you purchased me. You took me out of there, cleaned me up, and gave me back my freedom.\u201d He extended one arm. \u201cThis is what\u2019s waiting for me out there. The abyss. Now, why the hell would you think I\u2019d repay you by voluntarily jumping back into it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf all my people, you are the one I depend on most,\u201d Genaro told him. \u201cLately you\u2019ve become temperamental and paranoid. I have to know the reason for it.\u201d</p><p>Kirchner drew his arm back. \u201cI am not experimenting on rats or monkeys, Jonah. For the sake of creating a successful transerum, I have sanctioned the kidnapping, torture, murder, and dissection of human beings. If we fail, all I have to look forward to are a few miserable years on death row before I\u2019m given a lethal injection. Or it\u2019s back to the abyss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not going to fail.\u201d He looked over as the conference room door opened and Delaporte stepped inside. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaske,\u201d his security chief said, crossing over to the wall monitor and accessing the public broadcasting feed. \u201cHe\u2019s just been taken hostage in California.\u201d</p> <p>Genaro watched the special news report on the Golden Gate Bridge sniper, who shot half a dozen motorists and killed a state trooper before abducting the antiques dealer and a paramedic from the scene.</p><p>\u201cThe first patrolmen responding to the scene did not attempt to stop the sniper, who used the paramedic\u2019s ambulance as his getaway vehicle,\u201d the news anchor said. \u201cAuthorities have issued an all-points bulletin for the stolen rig and the alleged gunman, who is said to be a Hispanic male in his mid-fifties. Police advise that the suspect is armed and should be considered extremely dangerous. Anyone with information as to his whereabouts should contact their local police, the California Highway Patrol, or the Crimebusters toll-free tip hot-line.\u201d</p><p>Delaporte switched off the monitor. \u201cI\u2019ve contacted our San Francisco office. The shooter isn\u2019t one of ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope not.\u201d Kirchner looked appalled.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re monitoring the situation,\u201d the security chief continued, \u201cbut the consensus is that this was a random act of violence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sniper shot everyone but Taske and the paramedic. There is nothing at all random about that.\u201d Genaro checked his watch. \u201cContact the flight crew and have them prepare the jet to fly to San Francisco in one hour.\u201d</p> <p>Delaporte frowned. \u201cSir, our office out there has an excellent team of investigators and operatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt they do.\u201d Genaro stood. \u201cThis time I will be able to personally assess their performance in the field.\u201d</p><p>Sirens wailed in Charlie\u2019s ears, sending invisible ice picks into her brain. Her lungs felt as if she\u2019d inhaled fire, and her heart thudded dully under her ribs. Something had been wrapped around her head\u2014a sack or a pillowcase. A sudden screech of brakes sent her sliding into something big, hard, and immovable; she felt soft hair brush across her face.</p><p>Hands yanked her away by the ankles and grabbed her waist to sling her over a strong shoulder. She heard and smelled seawater and gasoline before something stabbed into her hip. The burn spreading across her buttocks told her she was being injected with drugs; the subsequent sensation of nauseating euphoria and numbing paralysis made her heart flutter with panic.</p><p>Morphine . . . and some kind of sedative . . .</p><p>Blackness.</p><p>Charlotte felt the cocoon of softness around her falling away, and hot breath touched her cheek. She opened her eyes to see an enormous black cat staring at her behind silver bars scored with deep scratches. The big cat yawned and began licking its paw.</p><p>A man\u2019s voice spoke in a strange language, and was answered by a deeper, unearthly tone. Charlotte turned her head and saw two shadows, big and small, looming over a golden-haired giant\u2019s bloodied, unmoving body.</p> <p>The big shadow dropped down, lifting the golden head and pressing a goblet of red wine to the giant\u2019s lips. Some of the wine trickled down the sides of his face.</p><p>A third shadow merged with the smaller one, and in English Charlotte heard a woman\u2019s sulky voice ask, \u201cWhy does he try again? You know it will only kill the male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does as he wishes,\u201d the man snapped. \u201cThis one was not on the list anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the bridge Tacal sensed he was Chosen.\u201d The woman sighed. \u201cHe was very good at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte heard a choking sound, and the thud of the giant\u2019s body as it dropped back to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWe should keep him here until he dies,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThe children will only bury him, and then we will have to dig him back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe master says he stays with the female.\u201d</p><p>The woman laughed. \u201cThen perhaps she will save us the trouble and burn him.\u201d</p><p>When Charlie woke the next time, she found herself sitting in a chair. She looked down at the cheetah-patterned drape covering her from her neck to her knees before she glanced at the large mirror in front of her. She was in a beauty salon. Someone had taken her hair out of the braid and put it up in a fancy \u2019do with strands of golden pearls woven through the elaborate coils. She was also wearing dark red lipstick with a golden sheen, dark purple eye shadow, and enough black eyeliner and mascara to polish a pair of shoes.</p><p>She tried to grab the drape and pull it off, which was when she discovered that she was completely paralyzed.</p><p>In the chair next to hers the giant\u2014no, the Limo Guy . . . Sam, she remembered at last\u2014sat with his eyes closed and his chin tucked against his leopard-patterned drape. The elderly Latina trimming the back of his hair noticed Charlie watching and smiled.</p><p>\u201cBig and virile, isn\u2019t he?\u201d She came around and gently tipped Sam\u2019s head back. \u201cHe\u2019s a good match for you.\u201d</p><p>It took Charlie two tries to get the words out of her dry throat. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>The woman began carefully trimming away the big man\u2019s beard. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now, hija.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you were. I would be so proud to give him a girl child.\u201d She let the golden hair fall onto the shroud until she had cropped his beard close to his skin, and then reached for an electric razor. \u201cMen do such foolish things. Why does he cover such a handsome face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Charlie demanded. \u201cWhat are we doing here? Why can\u2019t I move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo impatient.\u201d The Latina made a clucking sound with her tongue. \u201cAll will be explained to you when you wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asleep.\u201d Everything that had happened on the bridge came rushing back into her head. \u201cI\u2019ve been drugged. I\u2019ve been kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been saved,\u201d the hairdresser insisted. \u201cYou should be grateful. You will have a beautiful life with this one. If he lives. I think he will. He is stronger than the others.\u201d</p><p>Charlie wanted to scream. \u201cLady, I don\u2019t even know that man.\u201d</p><p>The Latina gave her a knowing glance. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>Charlie saw the syringe in her hand and heard herself beg. \u201cPlease. No more drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the last dose, chica. I promise.\u201d The hairdresser stabbed the needle into Charlie\u2019s upper arm.</p><p>The drape rose up and wrapped itself around her head, smothering her into unconsciousness. For a long time she drifted, lost and aimless, until a beautiful warmth surrounded her. While she still couldn\u2019t see anything, she no longer felt as if she were alone.</p><p>What is going to happen to me?</p><p>Be careful what you ask, a deep voice whispered. You may not care for the answers.</p><p>Lines began stretching out through the darkness, radiating around her like a web made of amber light. In the center of them stood the big blond man from the bridge.</p><p>Samuel?</p><p>He turned toward her, his eyes closed but his mouth smiling. There you are. He held out his hand, and she saw her own reaching for it.</p><p>As soon as they touched she knew the warmth had come from him, for a deeper, richer wave of it swept up her arm. Are you doing this, or am I hallucinating?</p><p>A little of both, I think. He drew her closer. Charlotte, whatever happens, you must live. Fight for your life. Everything depends on it.</p><p>Everything? She felt bemused. Like what?</p><p>I can\u2019t see it yet, he admitted, caressing her cheek with the backs of his fingers. It\u2019s like you. I can only feel it. But it\u2019s very important that you live.</p><p>We all die, Sam. She didn\u2019t want to think about it. This is a great dream, though. She admired the shifting patterns of the lines. I could stay here with you forever.</p><p>That\u2019s not your destiny. He sounded tired now. Or mine.</p><p>I thought you couldn\u2019t see anything, she chided.</p><p>I know that I\u2019m dying, he said gently. I thought I\u2019d accepted it, but now . . . Why couldn\u2019t I have met you years ago?</p><p>We have. She didn\u2019t know how she knew that, only that it was the truth. On the bridge, I felt it. I\u2019d never seen you before in my life, but I swear I recognized you.</p><p>It was the same for me. He lifted his head and then put his arms around her. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll survive this, but when you wake up, look for me. Find me.</p><p>I will. The darkness was dragging at her, pulling her out of his arms. Samuel.</p><p>Don\u2019t be afraid, Charlotte. The light and the warmth dwindled, and the last thing she heard was his voice. Here or in the real world, I\u2019ll be watching for you. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Time passed unnoticed. The sound of the sea finally roused Charlie, but the sunlight on her skin and the decadent comfort of the fine linens swaddling her tried to lure her back to sleep. The fragrance of some exotic fruit rose from the pillow under her cheek, as if the sinfully soft bedsheets had been washed with pineapples or mangoes. She turned her nose into the delicious scent, and a firm, smooth texture brushed across her lips.</p><p>Skin. Naked skin.</p><p>She opened one eye and looked at the chest she was nuzzling. The golden eye of a bird tattoo stared back at her, and for a moment she thought she saw its scarlet-tipped black wings flutter where they had been inked over strong collarbones. She glanced down and saw its lower body had been fashioned out of curling flames.</p> <p>Not a bird, Charlie thought as she idly traced the blaze of fire and feathers with one fingertip. A phoenix.</p><p>A phoenix tattoo.</p><p>She pushed herself away from the chest. The man beside her lay sprawled over two-thirds of the enormous bed, his clean-shaven face still, his chest barely moving as he slept on.</p><p>It was Sam, the man from the bridge. But why was she in bed with him?</p><p>Charlie jerked off the scarlet cotton sheet twisted around her and saw only naked skin. She crawled away backward, not stopping until she went over the side of the bed and fell to her knees. Softness cushioned her shins, and she looked down at the black fur throw spread out over a floor made of clear blue water, coral, and tiny tropical fish. Only when she saw the ghostly image of her own wide-eyed face staring back at her did she realize the water was under a layer of crystal-clear glass.</p> <p>Slowly Charlie lifted her head. If she was in a hotel room, it was the largest she\u2019d ever seen: at least two thousand square feet, with a cathedral ceiling supported by innumerable lengths of smoothly polished bamboo. Primitive-looking motifs and murals covered the walls in bright primary colors, all of which darkened into an azure-purple ombr\u00e9 at the base, giving the impression that the entire room was melting into the gigantic aquarium of the floor. Irregular flat plates of multicolored stone had been stacked to form treelike columns that supported light fixtures of green glass blown in long, graceful curves that suggested palm fronds. Bowls woven from twigs and set on carved wooden pedestals held mounds of fresh fruit.</p><p>An odd dragging sensation on her scalp made her reach up and touch her hair, which had been taken out of the braid she wore for work and curled. She felt a long strand of beads woven through the curls and pulled it out, wincing as some hairs came with it. The beads turned out to be pearls, and as she remembered the dream she threw it away from her.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d she called out, angry now. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>Through the three-story glass panels of the exterior wall Charlie could see an extended patio deck, and beyond that real palm trees, fanlike palmettos, and clustered thatches of towering bamboo. A slate-lined path led down from the deck and through the tropical landscaping to a golden sand beach, where ivory-edged turquoise waves lapped lazily over long, scrolling bands of seashells.</p><p>Charlie had seen pictures of places like this. They were called resorts instead of hotels. There would be butlers instead of bellboys, personal chefs instead of vending machines, and if you had to ask how much the room cost per night, you couldn\u2019t afford it.</p><p>There was one person in the room who could, however, and she kept her eye on him as she looked around for some clothes. She found a pair of thick, soft, gold velour robes draped across the foot of a lounge chair and jerked one on as she came around the bed.</p> <p>\u201cSam. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuenos d\u00edas, Se\u00f1orita Marena.\u201d</p><p>Charlie whirled around, but no one else had entered the room. \u201cWho\u2019s there? Come out here where I can see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to S\u00e9ptima Casa,\u201d the man\u2019s voice said, and this time she spotted the intercom panel set into the wall beside a mural of dolphins leaping from the waves. \u201cThis is your new home. We will see to it that you and Se\u00f1or Taske live in complete comfort and happiness. As long as you abide by two simple rules, you will want for nothing.\u201d</p><p>Charlie exploded. \u201cWho the hell do you think you are?\u201d She turned toward the bed. \u201cIs this your idea of a practical joke? Because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny. Get up.\u201d She strode over and shook Sam\u2019s shoulder, but he remained limp.</p><p>\u201cThe first rule is that you must not try to escape,\u201d the man continued smoothly, as if she\u2019d said nothing. \u201cAny attempt at escape will result in immediate punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d She shook him harder. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p><p>The faintly snide voice went on. \u201cThe second rule is that you and your partner will have sexual intercourse at least once each day. If you fail to do so for any reason, again, you will be punished.\u201d</p> <p>Charlie stopped listening to the man as she felt something damp on her forearm, and turned it to see a fresh bloodstain. She pulled away the sodden sheet from a wide, bleeding gash in Samuel\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Now she saw the ashen tone of his skin and felt the cool moistness of it as she checked his pulse, which was weak and fluttered rapidly under her fingertips. She saw no swelling or bruising across his abdomen, and when she thumbed up his eyelids his pupils appeared enlarged.</p><p>Quickly she dragged down one of the pillows and elevated his legs before she tore a dry section away from the bottom of the sheet. Once she had folded and pressed it against the wound, she turned her head toward the speaker. \u201cThis man is wounded and in shock,\u201d she shouted. \u201cHe needs to be taken to a hospital. Immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuenos d\u00edas, Se\u00f1orita Marena,\u201d the man\u2019s voice said, exactly as he had before. \u201cWelcome to S\u00e9ptima Casa. This is your new home. We will see to it that you and Se\u00f1or Taske live in complete comfort and happiness. . . .\u201d</p><p>The voice was a looped recording, Charlie realized, and swore under her breath as she quickly inspected the wound. She saw no indication of internal injuries or serious bleeders, which was the only good news. She had no way to measure how much blood he\u2019d lost or how long he\u2019d been in shock.</p><p>Under her arm, Samuel\u2019s chest fell and didn\u2019t rise again.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d She couldn\u2019t find a pulse anymore, and tilted his head back, putting her ear down by his nose and mouth to listen and feel for a breath that never came. She opened his mouth to check his airway and found two fresh puncture wounds in his upper palate. She ignored them as she tipped his head back, pinched his nostrils shut, sealed her lips over his, and forced her breath into his lungs.</p><p>He didn\u2019t start breathing.</p><p>Charlie centered her hands on his chest and began compressions, counting under her breath until she reached thirty before giving him another breath. The muddy gray of his skin made her swear as she began the second set of compressions.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Sam,\u201d she told him as she worked his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re not dying on me, not here. Are you listening?\u201d</p><p>His body heaved under her hands as violent tremors racked his limbs. Just as quickly he fell still and coughed several times before he began breathing on his own. His features remained ashen in color, and against her skin she could feel his body temperature dropping.</p><p>Charlie kept her fingers pressed against his throat; feeling his sluggish pulse throb dully, she watched a little color return to his face. \u201cOkay, Sam, that\u2019s better. You just keep those lungs working.\u201d She glanced down at the wound in his side to check the bleeding, which had slowed dramatically.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know whether he\u2019d had a seizure or a stroke, but she couldn\u2019t be concerned with that now. The wound probably wasn\u2019t going to kill him, but the blood loss would.</p><p>She used the belt from the other robe to bind her makeshift bandage in place, and then ran across the glass floor to the arched open doorway opposite the exterior glass wall. She hurried out into a corridor filled with doors.</p><p>Judging by the vast interior dimensions and artful decor, they\u2019d been brought to someone\u2019s private mansion. As she hurried down the hall she began jerking open doors and glancing inside, but found the other rooms just as empty.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone here? I have a wounded man who needs a doctor,\u201d she called out several times, but the only thing that answered her was the echo of her own voice. At the end of the hall she opened the last door and then stopped, aghast to see that the interior had been outfitted to serve as a medical treatment room. Someone had installed an exam table, lab equipment, and glass-fronted cabinets filled with supplies. Her own carry-in bag sat on a rolling cart next to the table.</p><p>Charlie went to the refrigerated storage unit and opened the door. Inside were several vials of insulin, antibiotics, and other perishable drugs, along with enough units of blood to stock a small blood bank.</p><p>Sam\u2019s desperate need for a transfusion made her reach for the blood. The packaging looked unfamiliar, and none of the units had been labeled or typed, although different symbols had been drawn in black marker on each of the bags. She had no way to tell what sort of blood it was, nor the time to test it to see whether it was safe.</p><p>There was only one thing she could do.</p><p>She replaced the bag in the storage unit and slammed the door shut, turning to the cabinets to pull what she needed. After she stuffed the supplies in her bag she grabbed it and ran back down the hall.</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d she said as she pulled on a pair of gloves and began to set up. \u201cCan you hear me? I need you to wake up now. I\u2019m going to take care of you, but I have to know what happened.\u201d</p><p>She had to repeat herself several times before he stirred, and then at last his eyes opened. \u201cCharlotte.\u201d His voice barely registered above a whisper, and he grimaced as if it hurt to speak. \u201cSafe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d she lied. \u201cDo you remember how you got this wound in your side? Did someone stab you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAccident. In Denver. Weeks ago.\u201d His eyelids began to droop. \u201cSo tired . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go to sleep yet, Sam,\u201d she said, putting her hand on his cheek. \u201cLook at me. That\u2019s it. Can you tell me what your blood type is?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cO. Negative.\u201d</p><p>They were both universal donors with the same blood type; relief made her feel a little dizzy. \u201cThen I think it\u2019s your lucky day.\u201d</p><p>She prepped a pressure bag and filled half of it with isotonic saline, which would dilute her own blood but give his body the extra fluid it needed. Once she tied off his upper arm with a tourniquet, she inserted an eighteen-gauge needle into one prominent, distended subcutaneous vein. As soon as she saw the dark red flashback that confirmed the needle was in place, she taped it down and attached the tubing before starting on her own arm.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, Sam, here we go,\u201d she said as she inflated the pressure bag, hanging it from one of the knobs along the top of the headboard and releasing the clamp. Blood flowed from her arm through the tube into the bag, where it mixed with the saline and began to descend.</p><p>Charlie watched the drip chamber closely. The flow had to be continuous, but if she used too much pressure, the bag seams would split or the blood cells would lyse. Once she felt good about the flow rate, she took out her stethoscope and checked his heart and lung sounds. His pulse, while still slow, had grown stronger.</p><p>\u201cStill beating,\u201d he murmured. His face appeared less gray now, and his voice was a little stronger.</p><p>\u201cSo I hear. I like that a lot. Keep doing it.\u201d She didn\u2019t hear any arrhythmias that would indicate an allergic reaction to the transfusion. \u201cCan you feel this?\u201d She took her hand and squeezed the fingers on his right hand and then his left. Both times he nodded and moved his fingers. \u201cIs there any numbness on either side of your body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just . . . tired.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re entitled. Now, open up for me.\u201d When he did, she tilted his head back to inspect his palate, and saw the two wounds were much smaller than they\u2019d looked at first glance, and weren\u2019t punctures, as she had originally assumed. \u201cDo you remember how you hurt your mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He looked confused.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she assured him. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got a couple abrasions on the roof of your mouth, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>The urgency involved in providing medical care to a male patient always neutralized any normal interest Charlie might have felt toward him; whenever she worked on a man he was simply the patient. She took that distance for granted, as she was usually too busy trying to keep her patients alive to notice how attractive they were or what kind of body they had.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t happening this time, not with Samuel. Her eyes kept straying back to his face, but not to check his color or watch for signs of reaction. Without the beard masking the lower half of his face, his strong features were almost savagely handsome, from the high-def cheekbones down to the squared jaw. The mixed bag of his genetics had saved him from a thin line of a mouth and instead gifted him with the kind of full, sensual lips that made a woman think instantly of kissing.</p><p>As heart-stopping as Samuel\u2019s face was, his body proved even harder to ignore. His perfectly tanned skin looked sprayed on, it seemed so flawless, and the development of his upper body was nothing short of superb. She\u2019d known guys who spent half their lives gulping protein shakes and pumping iron who never achieved such beautiful muscles or physical symmetry.</p> <p>It won\u2019t matter what he looks like if he codes on me again.</p><p>Charlie forced herself to focus on her job. She couldn\u2019t afford to give him too much of her own blood, but she pushed it to the limit before she finished the transfusion and took out the suture kit.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sam, I\u2019ve got to stitch you up. Bad news is that I didn\u2019t find any local anesthetic I can give you for the pain. Good news is that I\u2019m really fast with a needle, but I need you to hold still.\u201d When he didn\u2019t answer her she glanced down and saw he\u2019d slipped back into unconsciousness. \u201cAll right, that\u2019ll work, too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Andrew Riordan parked his rental car on the street across from the marina and watched the cops taping off the access turn to the parking lot. A forensics team surrounded the abandoned ambulance, working silently as they removed plastic bags of evidence and dusted the surfaces for prints.</p><p>Earlier that day Drew had been sitting in his apartment in a small northern California town, sipping instant coffee and checking news reports, when he\u2019d caught the live coverage of the shooting on the Golden Gate Bridge. The moment he\u2019d learned that Samuel Taske had been taken hostage by the gunman, he\u2019d dressed, grabbed his go bag, and left, making the necessary calls from his car as he drove south toward San Francisco.</p><p>Samuel Taske was ranked by Forbes as the seventh-richest man in America, something that made him a very attractive prospect for kidnapping. What the public didn\u2019t know about the antiques dealer was that he was part of the Takyn, a very private, select group of people who had been genetically altered in infancy to become superhumans with extraordinary psychic abilities. Samuel, known by most of the Takyn as Paracelsus, was the second-oldest and probably the wealthiest member of the group, and had the ability to read the history of objects simply by touching them with his bare hands.</p><p>At first Drew had known Samuel only through the Internet site the Takyn used to communicate with one another, but over the past winter they had become close friends. The antiques dealer had spared no expense in helping Drew track down Rowan Dietrich, another member of the Takyn, after a motorcycle accident had left her stranded in New York City.</p> <p>Now Samuel was in trouble, and Drew would do whatever it took to get him back safely.</p><p>He put on his wireless mike and speed-dialed a number in Tennessee on his encrypted satellite phone. \u201cIt\u2019s Drew,\u201d he said as soon the man on the other end answered. \u201cI\u2019m in Monterey. They\u2019ve recovered the ambulance, but there is no sign of the shooter or the hostages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have received no word yet from Paracelsus,\u201d Matthias told him. \u201cZephyr is at the hospital watching over the driver, but he is still in surgery. We will move him as soon as he is stable enough for transport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the rush?\u201d Drew asked.</p><p>\u201cGenaro left Atlanta by private jet this morning,\u201d Matthias told him. \u201cHis pilot filed a flight plan for San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Drew took a penny from the change niche in the dash and rubbed it between his fingers. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel like a GenHance operation, boss. For one thing, they\u2019d never want this kind of publicity.\u201d The penny in his hand rose in the air above his palm and spun in a slow circle. \u201cWhat about the EMT?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know a little, mostly from the news,\u201d Matthias said. \u201cHer name is Charlotte Marena, twenty-nine, the daughter of Mexican immigrants. She is single, a graduate of UCLA, a licensed emergency care practitioner, and employed by the city fire department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d Drew didn\u2019t believe it for a second. \u201cAsk your lady if she would take a good look at Ms. Marena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa has already begun the background investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I\u2019ll contact you when I have news.\u201d</p><p>After ending the call, Drew reached under his seat and took out a large zippered case from which he removed a folded tie, a gun and shoulder holster, and forged credentials identifying him as an FBI special agent. Once he had switched out his fake IDs and strapped on the weapon, he turned and grabbed the jacket he kept on the backseat and got out, sliding on his sunglasses before donning the jacket and heading toward the patrolman manning the barricade.</p><p>\u201cOfficer.\u201d Drew showed him the phony ID. \u201cAgent Frasier from San Francisco. Who\u2019s in charge of the scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetective Goldberg.\u201d He pointed to a short, dark-haired man talking to one of the forensic techs. \u201cHe\u2019s coordinating with SFPD over the phone. How\u2019d you get here so quick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was on vacation in the area and got pulled.\u201d Drew glanced at the dock. \u201cAny sign of the hostages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey found some blood inside the rig,\u201d the patrolman said. \u201cNo cars have been reported stolen, so it might have been a prearranged drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Drew walked in the general direction of the detective, but once the patrolman had turned back to watch the road, he headed for the dock.</p><p>Most of the vessels docked at the pier were big, expensive, and fitted with canvas toppers, suggesting they were the weekend toys of suburb sailors. Drew spotted one elderly man sitting on a deck chair on an old but beautifully preserved sloop; he puffed on a cigar while he watched the cops in the parking lot. Every now and then he would shake his head a little.</p><p>Drew stopped by the stern of the sloop. \u201cAfternoon. Mind if I come on board and ask you a couple questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d the old man demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take you downtown, hold you as a material witness to a kidnapping, or question you for hours,\u201d Drew countered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d The old man gestured for him to approach.</p><p>He stepped over the starboard railing onto the deck and looked out at the parking lot before taking out a notepad. \u201cDid you see that ambulance when it arrived here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard the lead-footed ass driving it when he laid on the brakes. Sounded like he ran over a cat.\u201d He squinted up at Drew. \u201cYou\u2019re not local.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with FBI\u2019s San Francisco office.\u201d Drew looked down the row of boats and noted the empty slip at the very end. \u201cAbout what time did you hear the noise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight have been two, two thirty. I came up to see what all the commotion was.\u201d He drew on the end of the cigar and let the smoke waft slowly from his mouth into his nostrils. \u201cMexican fella pushed a cart covered with a mound of bloodstained sheets on it down to Wass\u2019s slip. Howie said he\u2019d gotten chartered to take some sportfishermen down to Mexico, but more likely he was hired to take the bodies out a few miles and dump them.\u201d</p><p>Drew stopped pretending to take notes. \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Mexican and Howie carried what looked like two stiffs on board and stowed them below. I didn\u2019t see Howie again after that. Greedy bastard probably got his throat cut.\u201d The old man carefully snuffed out his cigar. \u201cThe Mexican came up a bit later, cast off the lines, and headed out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you describe the people they carried on board?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThey had sacks over their heads. One was big, and the other had to be a woman. Even with the sheet wrapped around her, I could see she had a beautiful rack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were both unconscious?\u201d</p> <p>The old man nodded. \u201cThe big one was bleeding from the side. It was all over the sheet.\u201d</p><p>Drew knew a little about Samuel\u2019s condition, which had been slowly crippling him for years. Although the Takyn all had the ability to heal faster than normal humans, Samuel\u2019s weakened state combined with an open wound might prove too much for the big man to survive. \u201cWas that when you called the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t call them, son.\u201d</p><p>Drew eyed him. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo phone,\u201d the old man said, gesturing below. \u201cNo desire to get my throat cut, either.\u201d</p> <p>Drew glanced out at the bay. \u201cDid you see what direction he took the boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be heading south for Manzanillo, Mexico.\u201d The old-timer grinned at him. \u201cHowie stopped by last night to borrow some maps. He\u2019s never been down that far south, so I plotted the course for him.\u201d</p><p>Drew jotted down the name of the city. \u201cIs there anything else you can think of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best get out of here before the real cops see you talking to me,\u201d the old-timer said. \u201cOr you\u2019ll end up going downtown. I hope you find your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d Drew smiled a little. \u201cWhat gave me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething only an old shoemaker like me would notice.\u201d The old man nodded at the deck. \u201cNo FBI agent wears green sneakers, son.\u201d</p> <p>No drug, treatment, or therapy had ever succeeded in completely relieving the pain caused by Samuel Taske\u2019s deteriorating spine. He had spent years learning how to rest through meditation and napping for an hour or two, usually in an upright position in one of his custom-built ergonomic chairs. To wake from a deep, satisfying sleep and find himself flat on his back in a real bed was not only a novelty but something of a precious gift.</p><p>One he would begin paying for immediately, he thought as he lay as still as possible. As soon as he moved he would likely be in agony. At least Morehouse would arrive shortly with his morning tea and paper, and after administering his injection he would help him get up and into the whirlpool. . . .</p><p>Two fingers pressed against a bone in his wrist while a warm hand settled on his brow. None of them belonged to his house manager.</p><p>\u201cNo fever, no rash, no arrhythmias,\u201d a woman murmured. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you wake up, m\u00edo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt usually requires a pot of tea and the Wall Street Journal.\u201d He looked up at Charlotte Marena\u2019s face. Beyond her he could see bright colors and beautiful furnishings. \u201cHello again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Her smile lit up her tired face. \u201cWelcome back. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuzzled.\u201d Taske turned his head to the right and left to take in as much as he could, and made another discovery as he felt the smoothness of the linen pillowcase against his cheek. \u201cSomeone shaved off my beard.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t see any medical equipment around the bed. \u201cWe\u2019re not at a hospital, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where we are, Sam,\u201d Charlotte admitted. \u201cI was kind of hoping that you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to disappoint you.\u201d Luxurious and unique as it was, he didn\u2019t recognize the room. \u201cHow did we come to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I remember was passing out in the back of my rig.\u201d She straightened. \u201cYesterday I woke up here with you. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday.\u201d He frowned. \u201cI\u2019ve been unconscious that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least a day.\u201d She made a helpless gesture. \u201cMaybe two or three, or even a week.\u201d She looked as if she wanted to say more, and then subsided.</p><p>\u201cBut you woke before me.\u201d A vague memory of Charlotte\u2019s urgent voice came back to him, and without thinking he reached across his abdomen to touch the wound in his side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s already healed.\u201d She pulled down the sheet covering him to expose the unmarked skin over his ribs. \u201cThe stitches I put in popped out during the night. There isn\u2019t even a scar. Maybe you can explain that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d Taske had not enjoyed such a rapid recovery from a serious wound in years, but that was not the only revelation that stunned him. When he had moved, he had felt nothing.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>He frowned as he carefully drew his arm back and then moved his legs just enough to shift the lower half of his spine. \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte turned and touched his thigh. \u201cYou can\u2019t feel my hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have feeling in my legs.\u201d Still not trusting his body, he bent his arm to prop his weight on his elbow and roll onto his side. His muscles felt stiff, but the searing coil of nerves around his spine didn\u2019t offer even the slightest twinge. \u201cCharlotte.\u201d He stared at her. \u201cI need you to tell me precisely what happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I woke up yesterday I found you in shock from the blood loss. You were left here bleeding from a reopened wound.\u201d She ducked her head. \u201cYour heart stopped, and I had to perform CPR, but I got you back. I had to give you a vein-to-vein blood transfusion. Fortunately we have the same type. I\u2019m also tested regularly for my job, so don\u2019t worry about it. I know I\u2019m clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember your asking me about my blood type.\u201d She had given him her own blood; no wonder she looked so drawn and pale. \u201cWhat did you do to my back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She put her hand on his arm. \u201cYou probably wrenched it on the bridge. I\u2019ll see if I can find something for the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain. That is the problem. I\u2019m not in pain. Any pain.\u201d He laughed a little. \u201cCharlotte, somehow you\u2019ve healed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus healed the lame, Sam. I just gave you some blood.\u201d She looked uncertain. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t feel any pain at all? Maybe you\u2019re just riding an adrenaline high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter fifteen years of enduring it every day\u2014lately every hour of every day\u2014I know pain,\u201d he assured her. \u201cNot feeling it is incredible.\u201d He frowned. \u201cAnd impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, while I was working on you, you had some kind of seizure,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt could have been a small stroke, and that can cause nerve damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I would have some paralysis as well, which I don\u2019t.\u201d He looked down at himself. \u201cEverything seems to be working very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you were in shock, too. Sometimes a combination of these things can do some weird stuff to the body.\u201d When he would have sat up the rest of the way she pressed his arm. \u201cTake it slow. If you fall, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be able to pick you up without help.\u201d She put her arm around his back. \u201cAnytime you want to stop, just tell me.\u201d</p><p>As he moved into a sitting position, Taske\u2019s head remained as clear as his sight. He felt no discomfort, numbness, or any sensation other than that of his muscles coiling and uncoiling to accommodate his movements. As Charlotte stood up and watched him he eased his legs over the side of the bed, and then slowly rose. Expecting his knees to buckle, he put a hand on her shoulder, but his legs remained strong and steady.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve walked with a limp since I was a teenager.\u201d He took one step, and then another, and suddenly, effortlessly, he was moving across the room. It had been so long since he\u2019d walked without using a cane that his hand and arm felt odd, but not once did he lose his balance or stagger. Joy rushed through him, a genie released after a thousand years bottled up who had granted his dearest wish without even asking him. He turned around and strode to Charlotte, seizing her by the waist and lifting her off her feet to twirl her around.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He laughed. \u201cCharlotte, I can walk. My God, I think I can even run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrific, Sam.\u201d Her hands clamped on his shoulders. \u201cWould you put me down now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me.\u201d He laughed again as he lowered her back to her feet and pulled her against him in an affectionate hug. \u201cYou can\u2019t know what this means.\u201d He cradled her face between his hands. \u201cI thought I was a dead man\u2014no, I knew I was\u2014and now I wake up and I can walk.\u201d He stroked a hand over her tousled hair before he kissed her pretty mouth.</p><p>The delight pouring through him grew heated as he tasted the sweetness of her lips, and suddenly his excitement became urgent and dark. He filled his hands with her hair and nudged her lips apart, inhaling her startled breath and tasting her with his tongue. Her hands slid up his chest, pressing for a moment before they curved around his neck. He wanted to laugh again as he splayed his hands over her back and worked them down to the luscious curves of her hips. Before this he could only look at her and wish, but now that he was healed, now that he was strong, he could be like any other man, and take her to his bed, and give her hours and hours of pleasure. . . .</p><p>His bed was in Tannerbridge, not here.</p><p>Taske lifted his mouth from hers. Charlotte stood very still, her eyes wide and fixed on his face, her cheeks rosy. She appeared as appalled as he was astonished. He intended to apologize, instantly and profusely, but the words he spoke had nothing to do with regret.</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d He lifted a length of her hair to his nose, breathing in before he let the gold-shot strands fall back into place. \u201cYour scent, the feel of your skin, everything about you is new to me. We\u2019ve never met before I saw you on the bridge; I\u2019d swear to it. But . . . I know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I would remember meeting a guy your size.\u201d She eased out of his arms and turned her face away. \u201cMaybe in another life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReincarnation is a fantasy. This life is the only one we have.\u201d He didn\u2019t understand why she wouldn\u2019t look at him, until he glanced down at his body. Not only was he stark naked; he sported a monumental erection. He pulled the sheet from the bed and wrapped it around his hips. \u201cI do beg your pardon, Charlotte.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t apologize for kissing her, not with the taste of her still on his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot a problem.

Why do you prefer Charlie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte is too old-fashioned. Here.\u201d She brought him a large gold velour robe. \u201cI found a supply of men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothes. Mostly casual stuff, like this.\u201d She tugged at the edge of the cloth wrapped around her breasts.</p> <p>He studied the vivid orange sarong under the lacy white shrug she was wearing. Both made her look like a present waiting to be unwrapped, he thought, until the reason why she was wearing it dawned on him. \u201cHe took our clothes from us? He left us both here naked?\u201d When she nodded, he felt a surge of violent anger. \u201cDid he touch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She wrapped her arms around herself. \u201cI checked myself thoroughly, and I didn\u2019t find any bruises or other signs of an assault.\u201d</p><p>What she didn\u2019t say was that she still felt violated. Taske wanted to find their abductor and beat him senseless. Even better, now that his back had been healed, he could. \u201cWhere is this bastard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew.\u201d Her expression turned grim. \u201cI\u2019ve looked through the entire place, and there\u2019s no one here but us.\u201d She pointed to a speaker set into the wall. \u201cA man spoke to me through that yesterday, after I woke up. What he said repeated a couple of times, so it had to be a recording. He said this was our new home.\u201d Again she looked as if she wanted to say more, but lapsed into silence.</p><p>Taske looked around the room. \u201cDid you recognize any of the surrounding area outside the house?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go out,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBy the time I finished going through the house it was dark, and I really didn\u2019t want to leave you alone for long.\u201d</p><p>She averted her eyes, and a slight change in her stance suggested she wasn\u2019t being entirely honest with him. \u201cMy dear, surely you know you can trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Now she turned around and brought her hand up to her chest, pointing with one finger to one side of the ceiling and then the other. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling all right, maybe we can take a walk down to the beach.\u201d</p><p>Taske glanced up discreetly and saw the two security cameras mounted on swivel bases; she had turned her back on them to conceal her hand movements. As he deliberately walked back to the glass wall, he heard the faint whir of gears and confirmed with another glance that one of the cameras had followed his movements. Now he understood her odd silences; they were being actively monitored.</p><p>Taske hoped whoever was spying on them was close by. The fury streaming through his veins needed an outlet. \u201cI\u2019ll need to dress first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe clothes are in here.\u201d She gestured for him to follow her into a walk-in closet. Once they were both inside, she leaned close to whisper, \u201cThere are cameras in all the rooms and hallways. I don\u2019t know if he can hear us, but still, watch what you say.\u201d She reached for some clothes hangers and in a normal voice said, \u201cThese look like they\u2019ll fit you.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled on the denim cutoff shorts and the thin, bright blue tank top, and surveyed himself. \u201cI look like a Beach Boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry there aren\u2019t any Valentino suits.\u201d She took the robe and hung it from a hook. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and followed her out. She picked up a short length of polished, carved teak propped beside the arched doorway and held it like a club. \u201cWhere did you find that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt used to be part of a chair downstairs.\u201d She gave it a test swing. In a lower voice she added, \u201cI played softball in college. If he comes at us, just give me some room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he comes at us,\u201d he countered, \u201chand it to me.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a skeptical look. \u201cYou ever mix it up with anyone, rich man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne can use a cane for more than walking, honey,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Charlotte guided him to a narrow, spiral staircase made of tiled steps and sided in glass panels suspended between bamboo supports. As they descended he noted the display of primitive animal masks inlaid with turquoise, gold, and bone.</p> <p>\u201cMesoamerican,\u201d he murmured, pausing beside one likeness of a snarling jaguar. \u201cNot a relic, however. Quite new.\u201d He reached out to touch it before he stopped and glanced at his bare hand. He had been bare-handed since waking up and somehow had not noticed. That discovery shook him down to his heels. \u201cCharlotte, please lend me your bat for a moment, if you would?\u201d</p><p>She handed it over, and Taske closed his eyes as he curled his fingers around it. Since childhood he\u2019d never had to consciously use his ability; it manifested the moment he touched anything. Upon contact he could see the entire history of any object, from the moment it was created until the present date, no matter how old it was. His ability had enabled him to become one of the foremost experts on antiques in the world, but it had come with a heavy price. Just as King Midas had been cursed to turn anything he handled into gold, Taske saw the history of literally everything he touched.</p><p>Gradually an image came to him of Charlotte lifting a small chair and repeatedly striking it against a stone pillar until one of the legs snapped off. Beyond that he saw nothing, no image from the past, no vision of who had brought the chair to this place, or who had purchased it, upholstered it, carved or assembled it.</p><p>Taske opened his eyes, unsure of what to think as he handed it back to her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice artwork,\u201d she said, her eyes briefly shifting to the camera overhead watching them. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s outside.\u201d</p><p>Another glassed-over water floor, this one stocked with circular green leaves and pale white lilies, led them to a wide entrance hall with towering walls. Taske noted the display of odd-looking weapons, hung far out of reach, which had the same ancient design yet new appearance as the masks by the staircase.</p><p>Charlotte inspected the teak door before she tried the ornate brass latch and slowly opened it. An exterior stepped platform led down to a walkway of shell-studded polished coral, which wound around through tumbleweed-shaped agaves and billowing mounds of white sweet alyssum before it disappeared.</p><p>The area beyond the house stood lush, green, and entirely deserted.</p><p>Taske heard the sound of the sea clearly now. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019re somewhere on the coast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just do.\u201d She turned around, and for a moment the glory of her sun-gilded features took his breath away. \u201cNone of it rings a bell with you? Maybe it\u2019s someplace you went to work on your tan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear our whereabouts are a mystery,\u201d he said, \u201cand alas, the tan is congenital.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Alas\u2019?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo one says \u2018alas\u2019 anymore, Sam. Not for at least the last hundred years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother thing about the deterioration of the English language to mourn.\u201d Again he detected the note of scorn in her tone. He wondered what he had done to earn it, and how quickly he might dispel it. For some reason Charlotte didn\u2019t like him, and that would not do at all. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look at the beach. We might be able to see something from there.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte silently accompanied him down the coral path and along a grassy trail through a dense thicket of banana trees. As they passed one ripe bunch she stopped and inspected them.</p><p>\u201cThese look okay.\u201d She snapped off two, handing one to him, and proceeded to devour hers in a couple of bites before taking another and doing the same.</p><p>Her show of hunger worried him. \u201cIsn\u2019t there any food at the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to feed an army, but after the way they drugged us, I\u2019m not touching it.\u201d She sighed and tossed the peels away. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>The two bananas helped settle Charlie\u2019s empty, churning stomach, but every step she took away from the mansion made her anger burn brighter. Although Sam seemed as surprised as she was at waking up in this tropical paradise, she still couldn\u2019t get rid of the suspicion that he knew more than he was telling her. He\u2019d told her he was handicapped, which he was anything but, and then there was that business on the stairs with the mask and her club.</p><p>By the time they reached the edge of the walkway leading down to the empty pier she felt ready to explode. She took a moment to look for surveillance equipment before she turned on him. \u201cOkay. I need to know exactly what this is about. For real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d He studied her face. \u201cI see. You still have some doubts about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome?\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019m kidnapped, drugged, and dumped at a Club Med for millionaires. I wake up naked, with pearls in my hair, next to a cripple who is in shock from blood loss and nearly dies on me. Twelve hours later his wound disappears, and suddenly he\u2019s not a cripple anymore. In fact, he looks like he can run the hundred in five flat and tosses me around like I\u2019m a rag doll. So yeah, Sam, I have doubts. Not some; many.\u201d She moved her hand horizontally from left to right. \u201cImagine a mountain range of doubts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk down to the water,\u201d he suggested. \u201cThe sound of the waves should cover our voices.\u201d</p><p>The pristine, powdery amber sand spoiled her attempt to stalk down the beach, and that annoyed her almost as much as Sam\u2019s neutral expression. Once they were standing in the sea up to their ankles, she glanced back and went still.</p><p>Only the tiered, flat rooftop of the mansion was visible from the shore, but the beach itself curved away from them on both sides, hugging the landmass in an irregular circle before it vanished behind it. The only other structure in sight was the long wooden dock. The coast and roadways she had expected to see didn\u2019t exist, and over the very tops of the trees to the left she saw a distant green blur swaddled by ocean. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly it made sense why she hadn\u2019t been able to pick up any thought streams last night. \u201cWe\u2019re on an island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would explain why he didn\u2019t secure us in the house.\u201d Sam made a slow three-sixty turn. \u201cNo boats, no way for us to leave, and no way to call for help.\u201d</p><p>Now she noticed just how pristine the empty beach was: no litter, no lifeguard, not even a discarded cigarette butt. \u201cWho kidnaps two strangers and dumps them in a mansion on a deserted island? And why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish I knew.\u201d Sam glanced back at the house. \u201cYou said you heard a recording over the speaker in the bedroom. Was it the sniper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the voice was different. Educated, more polite. He also spoke Spanish and English, but his accent was strange.\u201d She wished she could erase what he\u2019d said from her mind, but his words still needled her. \u201cHe knew my name and yours. He called the house S\u00e9ptima Casa. He said it was our new home.\u201d</p><p>Samuel knew just enough Spanish to translate the name of the villa. \u201cThe Seventh House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all he said.\u201d Her voice went flat as she told him the rest.</p><p>\u201cSo if we follow the rules, become lovers, and don\u2019t attempt to escape, we will want for nothing.\u201d Sam seemed bemused by the bizarre demands. \u201cMay I ask you a personal question?\u201d</p> <p>She folded her arms. \u201cI don\u2019t care what the jerk said or how many pearls he puts in my hair; I\u2019m not sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never presumed that you would.\u201d He glanced down at her arms. \u201cCharlotte, by any chance were you adopted as a child?\u201d</p><p>Of all the things he could have asked her. \u201cThis is not the time to play \u2018Let\u2019s Get to Know Each Other.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He gave her a direct look. \u201cAnswer me, please. It\u2019s rather important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t adopted.\u201d Honesty made her add, \u201cNot legally, anyway. I was abandoned when I was little. An older couple found me and took me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this is none of my business,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cbut can you tell me how you came to be with your new family?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t have to tell him what had happened before she\u2019d met the Marenas. \u201cI was hungry, and my parents caught me in their backyard stealing tomatoes and peppers from their little vegetable garden. They didn\u2019t have any family or kids, so they took me in and pretended I was theirs. They\u2019d just moved to San Francisco, so none of the neighbors questioned it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they turn you over to the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the time, INS was having one of their crackdown sweeps through the city. Mama thought I might be a migrant kid, and was afraid I\u2019d be deported and end up in a Mexican border orphanage.\u201d She looked down and nudged a piece of conch shell with her toe. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have much, but they spent every penny they had to get me papers and stuff so I could stay with them and go to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are they now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlanting tomatoes and peppers in heaven, I hope. Papa died of a massive stroke my second year of college.\u201d She took in a deep breath. \u201cMama\u2019s heart gave out a few months later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d His hand moved up to her shoulder. \u201cI have one last question, and then I\u2019ll stop prying, all right?\u201d</p><p>When she nodded, he asked, \u201cWhen your parents found you in their garden, you had been tattooed, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She felt sick. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMay I see it?\u201d</p><p>She stepped back until she broke the contact between them and looked at the body ink curling over his collarbones. \u201cIt\u2019s not as pretty as yours.\u201d She shrugged off the white lace wrap and turned her back on him, showing him the dark purple oval and the six blunt triangles inked on her shoulder. \u201cMost people think it\u2019s a lopsided sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a turtle.\u201d He traced the center oval with his fingertip. \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you like it.\u201d She pulled on her shirt and faced him. \u201cNow tell me how you knew that I\u2019ve had it since I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not random strangers abducted purely by chance,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we were deliberately targeted, although I don\u2019t know how he could have known where we would be.\u201d He saw her confusion. \u201cMy parents also adopted me, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when your parents got you, you had that bird tattoo on your chest.\u201d Suddenly it all made sense. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d He tried to put his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>She shook her head, backing away from him. \u201cHe knew what we are.\u201d Wildly she looked around. \u201cThey\u2019ll be coming for us. We have to find a place to hide.\u201d Her stomach surged, and she stumbled away, falling to her knees as she heaved.</p><p>Sam knelt beside her and pulled back her hair, bracing her with his other arm as she emptied her stomach into the water. When the last of her heaving subsided, he dampened the hem of his shirt and used it to wipe her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d She staggered to her feet, breathing in deeply. \u201cThere\u2019s a biotech company that hunts people like us for our DNA. Sam, they\u2019ll kill us for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know very well what GenHance has been doing,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut if they had abducted us, I believe we\u2019d already be dead and dissected.\u201d</p><p>Another shock wave went through her. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI belong to a very private online group. People like us who have been sharing information about our unusual talents.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cAs, I suspect, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hands.\u201d She glanced at them and then his face. \u201cJesus. You\u2019re Paracelsus.\u201d</p><p>Colotl watched as the two newcomers rose from the sand and walked back to their villa. When they passed by his position, he did not breathe or move. The woman, as dark as the man was fair, appeared bigger and stronger than their women. She resembled one of the master\u2019s concubines, but she didn\u2019t move or speak like one. He found the moments when she had shown her anger to the man and then vomited into the sea particularly intriguing.</p><p>So was their body art. Phoenix and turtle. Colotl had never seen such markings, but he sensed the power radiating from both of them.</p><p>Once he heard them enter the house, he drew back into the green shadows and made his way to the cave, where the other men waited. Gathering like this was dangerous at any time, but the master\u2019s unknown sentinel seemed to be less vigilant during the day.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you not bring him?\u201d Ihiyo, always impatient, asked as soon as he joined them.</p><p>\u201cHe is an American.\u201d He knelt down to drink from the spring, but the reflection rippling on the surface of the water made him sit back on his haunches. He could hide from everything but his own face. \u201cSo is the woman. They speak like the steward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir scents are strong in the air. The woman has been bled.\u201d Tzinacan dropped a pebble into the spring. \u201cAnd the man smells of the master\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>Ihiyo and the other four men all began to talk at once. When their voices grew too loud, Colotl stood and lifted his hands for silence.</p><p>\u201cThey have only just arrived. For now, we will watch them.\u201d He glanced at Liniz. \u201cWhat did you see last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was afraid at first, but she composed herself quickly. She gave the man her blood by tube, and then sewed up a wound in his side.\u201d When Ihiyo made a rude remark, Liniz scowled at him. \u201cShe saved his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is what they want us to think,\u201d Ihiyo snapped. \u201cPici\u2019s time is coming. What will this woman do to her when it begins? What if she comes after your Xochi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she tries to do anything,\u201d Liniz said flatly, \u201cI will slit her throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrothers.\u201d Colotl rose and touched Liniz\u2019s shoulder briefly before he addressed the others. \u201cFor now, we will watch. Each of us, in three-hour shifts. The next boat will come tomorrow. Ihiyo, you are the closest; you will go first. Report to Tlemi before sunset. I need to know everything they do.\u201d</p><p>Ihiyo\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cWhat if no boat arrives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we will know a little more about them.\u201d Colotl gestured toward the narrow entrance to the cave.</p><p>\u201cGo now.\u201d</p><p>Each of the men picked up his bundles, shouldering them before he filed out. Only Liniz lingered, and when they were alone he took a small black stone blade from his pocket and offered it to Colotl. The stone\u2019s beveled edge reflected the light with tiny prisms.</p><p>\u201cI know what you are going to say,\u201d Liniz told him. \u201cBut as soon as I saw him stand, I had to make it. He is almost as big as the master.\u201d</p><p>Colotl tested the edge of the stone weapon, which sliced into his fingertip the moment he touched it. \u201cYou take too many chances, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIhiyo forgets that I would do whatever I must to protect what is mine.\u201d He held out his left hand and splayed the stumps of two missing fingers. \u201cDo not make the same mistake, brother.\u201d He removed a string of fish from the water and strode out.</p><p>Colotl used one of the hidden paths to make his way back to the other side of the island. He heard the sound of splashing as he emerged from the forest, and changed direction to walk into the water garden.</p><p>Tlemi\u2019s long red hair blazed in the sunlight as she stood naked in the center of the saltwater pool and fed bits of seaweed and fish to the baby sea turtles she kept there. The freckles that covered every inch of her resembled golden lace hugging her skin.</p><p>\u201cYou were a long time,\u201d she said without looking at him.</p><p>\u201cThe mangoes by the stream were not yet ripe.\u201d He dropped his bundle on the grass and stripped off his shirt and shorts before he stepped into the pool. Immediately a swarm of the small green-and-black reptiles surrounded him, bumping their bullet-shaped heads against his thighs. \u201cThey are growing fast.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think we should release them next week.\u201d She scattered the last of the food before turning to him. \u201cThe man is awake, and healed. The woman is weary. She did not sleep or eat.\u201d She rubbed her temple. \u201cHer mind is powerful. During the day it sleeps, but it becomes like a beacon after dark. If she suspects . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will see to it that she does not,\u201d he promised. He cupped her cheek. \u201cYou are flushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been hot this morning.\u201d</p> <p>Her smile didn\u2019t reach her eyes, and he understood the warning. \u201cThen I will have to keep you wet.\u201d He lowered his head.</p><p>Her fingernails dug into his arms as he kissed her, signaling a frustration he shared. Since Colotl was a boy he had known Tlemi was for him\u2014those choices had been made soon after they came to the master\u2014but unlike the others he had not resisted his duty. Not until they had come to the island.</p><p>She tasted of coconut and mint, and her warmth sank into him until he could feel her in his bones. Every time he touched her he wanted to be inside her, a need that he\u2019d assumed would dwindle over time. It hadn\u2019t; in the years since their first night he had grown obsessed with having her as often as he could.</p><p>She broke the kiss first, her breath rapid and unsteady. \u201cYou make me forget myself.\u201d</p><p>The passion should have been a gift. Instead it had become a burden they both carried.</p> <p>\u201cYou make me burn,\u201d he murmured against her lips. He eased his hand between her taut thighs and stroked her, watching her eyelids droop and her lips part. \u201cDo you need me now?\u201d</p><p>Sadness tinged her laugh. \u201cI need you always.\u201d</p><p>He picked her up in his strong arms and carried her out of the pool.</p><p>\u201cSe\u00f1or Frasier?\u201d</p><p>Drew looked up from the newspaper he couldn\u2019t read to see a woman he couldn\u2019t stop staring at. His eyes shifted from the top of her glossy black hair down to the open toes of her ivory pumps, and then traveled back up again to her heart-shaped face. Her irises didn\u2019t match\u2014one was the color of sand, the other as jet-black as her hair\u2014but the effect made it seem as if some unseen beam of light had caught her eye.</p><p>She appeared as immaculate as if she\u2019d just come from a photo shoot for a high-end fashion magazine. The cream color of her silk suit set off the tawny smoothness of her skin, and had been cleverly tailored to complement her petite proportions without overemphasizing them. The jewelry she wore was made from narrow, hammered gold and glinted discreetly from her ears, throat, and wrists. Dark red gloss accentuated her full lips, but if she wore any other makeup, he couldn\u2019t see a trace of it.</p> <p>Somehow he got to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m Agent Martin Frasier.\u201d The gray-bearded Mexican detective who had left him to wait in the empty office had said something in broken English about a translator. \u201cAre you the interpreter?\u201d Please say yes.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I do speak English.\u201d She put down the portfolio she carried and held out her hand. \u201cMy name is Agraciana Flores. I\u2019m an agent with La Procuradur\u00eda Federal de Protecci\u00f3n al Ambiente.\u201d</p><p>Drew resisted the urge to rub his hand against the side of his trousers before taking hers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t understand all that,\u201d he said as soon as he forced himself to let go. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re with the police department?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPROFEPA is in charge of governing and protecting Mexico\u2019s natural resources,\u201d she explained. \u201cI have been called in to consult on this case.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of the investigation involves Las Islas Revillagigedo, a group of islands off the coast that are under federal protection as a priority biosphere reserve,\u201d she told him. \u201cUnder our laws, no one is permitted within six nautical miles of the archipelago. My agency has been tasked to oversee any operation that takes place in their vicinity.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a cop; she was some sort of government conservationist. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I don\u2019t understand. What do these islands have to do with my case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is somewhat complicated.\u201d She glanced down at the cup in her hand. \u201cDetective Ortega suggested I bring you some coffee from the squad room, but I like Americans.\u201d She offered him the cup. \u201cI bring this from home for myself. It is a little like, ah, hot chocolate?\u201d</p> <p>Drew accepted the cup and took a sip. The thick, hot drink tasted dark and smoky, and was only slightly sweet. The tingle it left behind after he swallowed was unexpected but oddly satisfying. \u201cIt\u2019s very good. Thank you for not hating me and my countrymen.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile, but a delicate pink color appeared on her cheekbones. \u201cI hope you feel the same after we have discussed the case.\u201d She pulled out a chair and gestured to his. \u201cPlease, sit down. Is this your first visit to Manzanillo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Drew wasn\u2019t sure what to think of it, either. Down by the water the Mexican seaside town had reminded him of the more expensive parts of the Caribbean, all palm trees and white palatial hotels. But turning east he had left behind the glitz and glimmer and followed the narrow streets up the surprisingly steep hills into the heart of the city, where he expected the powerful sunlight to bring out every detail of the poverty and urban decay the tourists never saw. Instead he found a town as clean and charming as any theme-park resort. \u201cWhat\u2019s with that gigantic blue fish statue down at the oceanfront?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEl Monumento al Pez Vela.\u201d She smiled a little. \u201cSportfishing is very important to the local economy. We call it el camar\u00f3n\u2014the shrimp\u2014because of the way it is curled up. Are you staying in Obreg\u00f3n Garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t gotten a room yet.\u201d Drew had driven past some dazzling hotels by the twin bays, and stopped to stare at one that had been built as a replica of a massive Mayan temple, but they were too high-profile for his needs. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of that later.\u201d</p><p>From her briefcase she removed several slim files and some sketches, which she set between them in two neat piles.</p><p>Drew tried not to stare at the top sketch, which bore a striking resemblance to the photos of Samuel that he had pulled off the Internet. \u201cYou\u2019ve found the victims?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, we have not.\u201d She opened one file and produced a photograph of a boat. \u201cThis vessel was found abandoned at the public docks.\u201d She gave him the registration. \u201cIs this the boat that was stolen from Monterey?\u201d</p><p>He took out his notepad and compared the numbers. \u201cYes. Did you recover the victims?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was only one victim.\u201d She showed him another photo, this one of a dead man on his back, his face covered in blood.</p><p>Drew almost snatched the picture from her, but relaxed when he saw the man\u2019s black hair and small stature. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Samuel Taske.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have already identified him. His name is Pedro Tacal.\u201d She regarded him steadily. \u201cHe left Mexico City last week to visit a sister in Sacramento. We assume he was traveling back home when he was attacked and abducted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d Drew put down the ghastly picture. \u201cI\u2019d like to help with your investigation, but my priority is to find the Americans who were kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have not heard. . . . Of course, you have been traveling.\u201d She put away the photos. \u201cLast night Se\u00f1or Tacal was killed in front of dozens of people on the public docks, not far from where the boat was abandoned.\u201d</p><p>So that was the connection. \u201cDo you think he was killed because he saw the sniper and his victims?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot say why he was murdered.\u201d She hesitated before adding, \u201cBut the descriptions of Tacal\u2019s killers match those of the man and woman whom you claim were kidnapped in San Francisco.\u201d She checked her own notepad. \u201cSamuel Taske and Charlotte Marena. We have issued warrants under those names for their arrest.\u201d</p><p>Drew felt as if he\u2019d been kicked in the stomach. \u201cThese people were kidnapped, Agent Flores. If they killed anyone, it was in self-defense, probably while trying to escape. This Tacal must have been the sniper who abducted them.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAccording to our witnesses, Tacal was unarmed and begged for mercy. The American male\u2014presumably Taske\u2014bludgeoned him until Tacal lost consciousness, at which time his female companion shot him in the head. They then stole another boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit.\u201d Drew shoved out of his chair and began pacing the length of the room. \u201cSamuel Taske can barely walk, much less beat a man unconscious. Charlotte Marena is a paramedic and the first responder to reach the victims on the bridge.\u201d He turned and looked at her. \u201cNeither of them would harm anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not until last night.\u201d Agent Flores averted her eyes as her tone became brisk. \u201cYou can examine the sketches made by our artist; they are based on the descriptions of the witnesses and match the photos that were sent to us from the San Francisco police. I will also arrange for you to see the statements collected by the police. They, too, are very detailed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they are, but I don\u2019t read Spanish any better than I speak it.\u201d Drew dragged a hand through his hair. \u201cWhat are your people doing to find Taske and Marena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy agency has sent two of our patrol boats to search the islands and the waters surrounding the archipelago,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have also radioed all the ships in the area and asked them to report any sighting of the stolen vessel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will this take?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cDays, perhaps weeks. Assuming the suspects remain in the search area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo kidnap victims don\u2019t turn into murderers overnight,\u201d Drew said finally. \u201cI\u2019ll need to talk to these witnesses myself. In person, Gracie.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him. \u201cThen it is regrettable that you don\u2019t speak Spanish, Marty.\u201d</p><p>Before Drew could reply, Detective Ortega lumbered in and spoke sharply to Agent Flores, who said very little in return. Drew noted how the older cop\u2019s eyes kept drifting south toward Gracie\u2019s sternum, and the casual way he reached down to adjust his package. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as Ortega left, Gracie turned her attention back to him. \u201cI am instructed to tell you that Chief Ruiz has personally taken over the investigation.\u201d Her voice remained calm, but anger simmered in her eyes. \u201cOur assistance, while appreciated, is no longer required by the department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re kicking both of us off the case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d She gathered up her files and replaced them in her suitcase. She glanced at him, hesitated, and then added, \u201cI can recommend a reasonably priced hotel down by the water if you would like to rest for a day before returning to the United States.\u201d</p> <p>He took hold of her wrist. \u201cWhat I would really like, Gracie, is to find out what the hell is going on here. To do that, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>His touch seemed to shock her into stillness, and she stared at his hand as her face turned pink again. \u201cI am sorry, Agent Frasier, but I am in no position to disregard the expressed orders of my superiors.\u201d She started to say something else, and then pressed her lips together and tugged her wrist free. \u201cI hope you have a pleasant journey back to the States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cI think I will stay a day or two. You\u2019ve got your own car here, right?\u201d She nodded. \u201cGreat, then can I follow you to this hotel you recommend?\u201d Before she could refuse, he added, \u201cI get lost pretty easy, even in my own country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, Agent Frasier,\u201d she said after a long, silent look. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p> <p>Watching Andrew Riordan while his former employee charmed Agraciana Flores was almost as tedious for Jonah Genaro as the time and effort required to have the PROFEPA agent removed from the case. It would have taken even more time to acquire the kind of leverage needed to bring Flores under his control, however, and Genaro already had the chief of police and most of his men to do his bidding. As for Riordan, after being exposed as a spy he never should have walked out of GenHance headquarters alive, but he\u2019d preplanned his escape. That, combined with the extensive sabotage he\u2019d committed just before escaping, had allowed him to do the impossible.</p><p>Now Andrew was here in Mexico, unaware that he would never leave it alive.</p><p>It had taken too much time to trace the stolen ambulance to Monterey, where the sniper had escaped capture again by charter boat. Genaro had replaced the only witness at the marina with one of his own men, primarily to stall the police and the media. Fortunately his operative had spotted and recognized Andrew Riordan before he had come to question him, and had called Genaro directly for instructions.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s talking to one of the cops in the parking lot,\u201d the operative had said after snapping a shot of Riordan on his phone and forwarding it to Genaro. \u201cShould I take care of him, sir?\u201d</p><p>Another man would have told the operative to kill the traitor, but Genaro was more interested in why Riordan would risk exposing himself in order to find Samuel Taske and Charlotte Marena. After spying on GenHance for years, Riordan had destroyed valuable equipment and caused irreparable damage to their database before successfully fleeing Atlanta and disappearing completely off the grid.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Genaro had replied. \u201cTell him exactly what the old man said. Be convincing.\u201d</p> <p>Giving Riordan just enough information to send him to Mexico had created the bait. Now that he was here Genaro expected to reel in more than one catch.</p><p>\u201cHe sounds like a federal agent,\u201d Manzanillo Chief of Police Manuel Carasegas said as he watched Riordan through the two-way mirror. \u201cI think you may have the wrong man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Genaro told him. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did have his credentials checked, se\u00f1or.\u201d Chief Carasegas shifted his weight from one foot to the other. \u201cAgent Frasier is on active duty, and works for the FBI in Sacramento.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt there is an agent named Frasier in Sacramento, but this man is not him.\u201d As Agent Flores accompanied Drew Riordan out of the interview room, Genaro turned away from the mirror. \u201cMy team is not yet in place. Send two of your men to keep them both under surveillance.\u201d</p><p>The chief\u2019s bushy brows rose. \u201cYou do not wish me to arrest this man for impersonating a federal officer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Carasegas used the phone on the wall to call down to the squad room and dispatch two men. As he did, Genaro checked the time. He had brought with him several disposable cell phones, the purchase and use of which could not be traced back to him or GenHance, but the call he needed to make in five minutes also had to come from inside the police department, to add to the chain of evidence Genaro would use against Carasegas should the Mexican ever decide to run his mouth or otherwise renege on their agreement. \u201cDo you have a secure line in this building?\u201d he asked when the chief hung up the wall phone.</p> <p>Carasegas nodded. \u201cYou may use the private line in my office.\u201d</p><p>Genaro knew Carasegas probably kept the line tapped so he could acquire whatever blackmail he used to stay in power. A quaint tactic, one that had been obsolete for forty years on the other side of the border, but that, too, would serve Genaro\u2019s purposes.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He picked up the only bag he had brought with him from the States. \u201cI\u2019ll need the line and your office for the next thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should tell you that this additional surveillance will be expensive,\u201d the chief warned, his expression more calculated now. \u201cFor such sensitive work, I can use only certain men, and they expect to be paid well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere is five thousand U.S.\u201d Genaro removed two bundles of bills from his jacket and dropped them into the chief\u2019s hands. \u201cI will provide another five thousand when Taske and Marena have been recovered, and the final ten thousand when you place them and the man claiming to be Agent Frasier in my custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are very generous, Se\u00f1or Genaro.\u201d The money vanished into the chief\u2019s jacket. \u201cCome, I will show you to my office so you can make your call.\u201d</p><p>Charlie\u2019s legs didn\u2019t want to stay vertical anymore, so she walked up to where the sand was dry and sat down, hugging her knees with her arms. After a moment Sam came to sit beside her, and they both watched the waves as they rolled in.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known who I am?\u201d she heard herself ask.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who you are.\u201d When he saw her face, he added, \u201cUntil a few moments ago, I thought you were an ordinary woman caught up in a scheme to abduct me, or that you had been brought along only to provide me with whatever medical attention I needed.\u201d</p><p>A surge of bitterness made her smile. Of course he thought of her existing only to serve his needs. He probably thought the rest of the world did, too. \u201cWhat changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shooting on the bridge, being brought to this island, and the manner in which we\u2019re being treated now suggest that we were both deliberately targeted for reasons other than my wealth and your skills,\u201d he said. \u201cThis man knew we were Takyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could he have known that?\u201d Charlie demanded. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t work for GenHance, then what possible reason could he have for snatching us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He picked up a shell and tossed it at the water. \u201cBut until we have those answers, we will have to be cautious.\u201d</p><p>Samuel knew more than he was telling her. Charlie had spent years treating patients who deliberately concealed things out of embarrassment or fear; she knew when someone was holding out on her. At least she wouldn\u2019t have to play friends to coax it out of him. As soon as the sun set she was going to find out exactly what Samuel Taske was thinking, and there was no way on earth he could stop her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already met Aphrodite, Vulcan, and Delilah in real life,\u201d Samuel said tentatively. \u201cI doubt you\u2019re Sapphira; I believe she lives somewhere in Canada.\u201d He leaned forward, trying to catch her eye. \u201cAre you going to keep me in suspense?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to put him in traction for the next six months. \u201cYou were right about that new Melissa Ether-idge CD.\u201d She studied his face. \u201cI loved it.\u201d</p><p>At last he looked as stricken as she felt. \u201cYou\u2019re Magdalene.\u201d Unbelievably his expression went from shocked to amused. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing like I imagined you\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders stiffened. \u201cI expected you to be a little bald guy with horn-rimmed glasses and a pocket calculator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in my mind you were a freckled, ponytailed, much younger version of Julia Child.\u201d He tried to charm her with another of his slow smiles. \u201cYou are a remarkable cook. I could happily live on nothing more than your dessert recipes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d just become a type-two diabetic.\u201d To keep from punching him in the face, she turned her head back to watch the waves.</p><p>\u201cHave you met any of the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn real life?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re the first, and if we get out of this, you\u2019ll be the last.\u201d Disgusted with herself and him, she got up and dusted off her legs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset,\u201d Sam said as he followed her up to the stone path. \u201cAm I such a disappointment in person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. You don\u2019t have to impress me, Sam. Just help me get back home, and I\u2019ll adore you forever.\u201d She stopped outside the front entrance to the villa. \u201cMaybe we should try walking the beach, see if we can spot any boats out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should first try to establish communications with our captor,\u201d he said as he reached for the door latch. \u201cI may also be able to pick up some information from the interior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay?\u201d She glanced down at his hands. \u201cOn the Internet you said you had to wear gloves to keep from picking up everything about everything.\u201d Or did you lie about that, too?</p><p>\u201cMy ability isn\u2019t working as it has in the past. Here it seems to be limited, or perhaps muted. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound concerned. \u201cIf it is fading, I certainly won\u2019t complain, but I should use what I have left to see what I can learn about the man who brought us here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She heard the unasked question in his voice, but there was no way in hell she was confiding in him now. \u201cMy ability isn\u2019t going to help us.\u201d She walked inside.</p><p>He closed the door behind her. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to pry, Charlotte. I know how personal our talents are. But if there is anything you can do to improve our situation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing.\u201d It wasn\u2019t her fault she got stuck with the one ability that had absolutely no value on a deserted island, so why did she feel guilty? \u201cCome on; I\u2019ll give you a tour of the place.\u201d</p> <p>Inside the villa she took him to the large, well-equipped kitchen and showed him the generous quantities of food that had been stored for them. \u201cNo freezer, and no prepackaged or canned stuff in the pantry, but there\u2019s a tank over there with live lobsters and maybe some oysters or clams.\u201d</p><p>He sorted through the vegetables and fruit in the refrigerator bins. \u201cGarlic, asparagus, gingerroot, avocados, peppers, carrots, peppers, pineapples, strawberries. Odd assortment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bins in the cabinets are filled with root vegetables,\u201d she told him as he removed a gallon-size plastic container filled with an amber liquid and opened the lid. \u201cWhat\u2019s that? Apple juice?\u201d</p><p>He sniffed the contents. \u201cHoney.\u201d He frowned. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense. What other foods have you found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t found any sugar or flour or baking stuff, but there\u2019s a cabinet filled with spices over here.\u201d She opened the cabinet. \u201cThey\u2019re not labeled, but looks like lots of seeds, some dried herbs, different types of pepper.\u201d She took out a plastic bag packed with what looked like long black bean pods and another filled with purple and reddish brown beans. \u201cEither of these look familiar to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe long pods are vanilla bean, I believe.\u201d He eyed the other bag. \u201cThe other might be cocoa.\u201d When he put the container back in the fridge he took a black fig from the bin and began to break it open.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, taking it away from him and dropping it back in the bin. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s in this stuff.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIt looked like a fig to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fig that this wacko could have injected with more sedatives, or some kind of hallucinogen.\u201d She closed the door to the fridge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it hasn\u2019t been tampered with,\u201d he assured her, showing her his hands, and then looked up at the four large glass dome light fixtures. \u201cCharlotte, are all the lights in the house electric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything I\u2019ve seen is.\u201d She caught on to what he meant. \u201cHow do you have power on a deserted island?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf there were generators, I think we would have heard them when we were outside.\u201d He studied the primitive pottery displayed in the glass-fronted niches above the cabinetry, and then the empty counters below them. \u201cYou didn\u2019t find any cookware, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. All the dishes and utensils are plastic or foam, so cleanup will be easy.\u201d She wanted to ask him what he was thinking, but even a whisper might be picked up by hidden mics or the security camera in the corner of the ceiling. \u201cCome on; you\u2019ve got to see the living room in this place.\u201d</p><p>Charlie led him out of the kitchen and across the hall to the large room she had mentally dubbed \u201cthe pit.\u201d Bright orange, purple, and blue wall murals imitated a tropical sunset, and made a dramatic backdrop for three different pit groups in matching colored velvet, suede, and raw silk. Swags of metallic ribbons and silk flowers hung down over wide windows offering different views of the greenery outside.</p><p>\u201cIf it were any brighter in here, I\u2019d probably develop instantaneous cataracts.\u201d Charlie picked up one of the intricately embroidered pillows that had been scattered around the cushions. \u201cHow are you supposed to take a nap in a room like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think napping was the decorator\u2019s intention.\u201d Sam reached out and ran his hand over the purple velvet before turning his head to look back through the door at the kitchen. \u201cAre the other rooms like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome variations on the theme, but basically, yes. Nice furniture, bright colors, lots of fancy fabrics. No televisions, stereos, or other electronic gadgets that could tell us where the hell we are, but art on all the walls and plenty of color-coordinated fruit.\u201d She eyed the basket of pomegranates, tangerines, and plums on the low table in the center of one pit group. Something about the fruit nagged at her, but she didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a look at that speaker in the bedroom,\u201d Sam suggested.</p><p>Before they went into the bedroom upstairs, Charlie showed Sam the exam room.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s got everything you\u2019d find in a treatment room in any trauma center,\u201d she said as she sat on the end of the exam table. \u201cI could even run labs in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Sam peered into one cabinet. \u201cWhy would you need to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but this is the weirdest thing.\u201d She showed him the blood in cold storage. \u201cTwenty-eight pints\u2014enough to transfuse a dozen patients\u2014but not a mark on one of them. I can\u2019t even tell if it\u2019s human blood unless I run some tests.\u201d</p><p>Sam walked around the exam table. \u201cWhat are these?\u201d he asked, touching one of the corner universal socket clamps.</p><p>\u201cWe use them to attach add-ons and extensions to the table, like arm boards, IV pools, stirrups, that kind of thing.\u201d She bent over to open one of the drawers under the table. \u201cHe stowed the extensions under here.\u201d</p><p>His expression turned bleak as he turned his back on the security camera and took her hand. \u201cI could use a hug,\u201d he said, shifting his eyes up. As soon as she gave him a decidedly reluctant embrace, he put his mouth next to her ear and murmured, \u201cAny surgical equipment?\u201d Quickly she shook her head. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know whether she agreed, especially since the nearest hospital might as well have been on the surface of the moon. \u201cJust don\u2019t burst an appendix anytime soon, okay?\u201d she muttered back.</p><p>He kept one arm around her as they left the treatment room and went down the hall to the master bedroom suite. Once inside Samuel went directly to the wall speaker to inspect it, giving Charlie a moment to compose herself.</p><p>The stress of the last twenty-four hours combined with discovering that the rich, handsome stranger whose life she\u2019d saved was someone she had considered her closest friend in the world had begun to grind on her. Her EMT training was the only reason she hadn\u2019t dissolved into a puddle of helpless feminine goo, and now that Sam had miraculously recovered she wasn\u2019t too sure how much longer that would keep her from going all girly on him.</p><p>Some of it was on him, Charlie decided. He\u2019d kept far too much from her. Although the group had agreed that concealing their identities and locations was an important safeguard, she and Paracelsus had grown close enough to share more than a few intimate details of their lives. He\u2019d always listened whenever she\u2019d needed to vent, and had given her advice on how to handle the loneliness and depression that came with being Takyn. She\u2019d even trusted him enough to tell him about her last disastrous attempt at a relationship.</p><p>He told me he wanted to go to the nightclub so we could dance, she\u2019d typed one night via IM. But he only took me there because he had a bad day, and he wanted to get loaded and flirt with everything in a skirt. You know what he had planned? A threesome. Me, him, and some waitress he wanted more than me.</p><p>At least he showed you his real character before you got serious about him, Paracelsus had replied. Imagine how you\u2019d feel if you were living with him and he\u2019d brought that waitress home.</p><p>You\u2019re right, I know, and it\u2019s better that I found out before I got too involved. She hesitated before she added, Don\u2019t you get tired of it? Always being by yourself, never having anyone to love?</p><p>Of course I do, he admitted. Everyone does. When I feel lonely, I remind myself of how fortunate I am to have friends like you. I may live the rest of my life without a partner, but I never have to be alone. I carry you and the others with me in my heart, Magdalene.</p><p>Sure he does, she thought, pushing the memory out of her head as she went back to watching him examine the speaker. Right next to his platinum credit cards.</p><p>\u201cThis is wired to a radio receiver behind it in the wall.\u201d He gestured to the perforated plate. \u201cIt was not set up to transmit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t need it to.\u201d As a warning, she glanced up at the cameras.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that.\u201d He took her over to the glass wall, turning her so that they both stood with their backs to the cameras. \u201cWhen I touched the speaker, I saw the technician who installed the equipment. The cameras transmit only a video feed, and there are no other monitoring devices in the villa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the son of a bitch is watching us, but he can\u2019t hear us. I guess when you\u2019re making homemade porn you don\u2019t need the audio.\u201d She leaned forward to press her forehead against the cool glass and closed her eyes. \u201cGod, I hate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be exhausted.\u201d His hand cupped the back of her neck. \u201cYou should rest for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d She straightened at once. \u201cHe could come back in a few hours. What we need to do is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuenas tardes, Se\u00f1or Taske, Se\u00f1orita Marena,\u201d the man\u2019s voice said from the speaker. \u201cWe are happy to see you becoming familiar with your new home. As you have now discovered, you have everything you need to live comfortably at S\u00e9ptima Casa. Since Se\u00f1or Taske has completely recovered from his injury, you may now begin your new life together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur new life.\u201d Charlie wanted to throw something at the camera. \u201cYou don\u2019t decide how we live, you jackass. You hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSe\u00f1or Taske, if your companion has not yet informed you of this, there are two rules you both must obey,\u201d the man continued. \u201cThe first is that you must never attempt to escape the island. The second is that you and Se\u00f1orita Marena are to have sexual intercourse at least once each day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlie felt like screaming. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, you pervert? Can\u2019t you get off unless you watch someone else doing it? Why don\u2019t you just go buy some dirty movies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d Sam gestured for her to be quiet.</p><p>\u201c. . . ignore these rules,\u201d the man was saying, \u201cyou will be punished.\u201d</p> <p>Samuel waved his hands at the camera, and then said very slowly, \u201cWe must speak with you. Why are we here? What is the punishment for breaking the rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he can\u2019t hear us,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cHe may be able to read my lips,\u201d Samuel replied.</p><p>Several moments of silence passed, and then the man\u2019s voice spoke again. \u201cBuenas tardes, Se\u00f1or Taske, Se\u00f1orita Marena. We are happy to see you becoming familiar with your new home. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a recording, just like yesterday.\u201d Charlie sat on the floor, propping her elbows on her knees as she pressed the heels of her hands to her eyes. \u201cHow can he punish us when we\u2019re stranded alone on an island?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming we\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the pervert or anyone else was around, I\u2019d have sensed them last night.\u201d Aware that she\u2019d just given herself away, she got up, opened the sliding door, and walked out onto the patio.</p><p>Samuel joined her at the railing. \u201cEither your hearing is exceptional, or you\u2019re some sort of a telepath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTelepaths can communicate back and forth. I\u2019m more like a satellite dish. All I can do is pick up thoughts.\u201d She rubbed her tired eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t waste any time thinking of your favorite color, either, because it only works at night. During the day I\u2019m as oblivious as any other ordinary woman.\u201d</p><p>Her sarcasm seemed to elude him. \u201cA nocturnal em-path.\u201d He sounded thoughtful. \u201cDoes your ability have any other limitations? Range, for example?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twisted. \u201cNot many.\u201d Sunlight pierced the foliage beyond the patio, revealing something she hadn\u2019t noticed before. From the position of the sun, Charlie knew it would be setting soon. She glanced around until she spied the cover fitted over the large hot tub, and took his hand. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s see if that Jacuzzi over there works.\u201d</p> <p>He frowned. \u201cCharlotte, you really should try to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I plan to.\u201d She threaded her fingers through his. \u201cAfter we have sex.\u201d</p><p>PART TWO</p><p>Seventh House</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>September 29, 1987</p><p>Malibu, California</p><p>\u201cThe attorney called.\u201d Brent Collins handed his T wife a snifter, his hand shaking so badly that the inch of dark Calvados at the bottom threatened to slosh over the rim. \u201cThere is nothing more he can do for us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot since he\u2019s run through the retainer. Bastard.\u201d Randa Collins drank half the brandy before cradling the delicate crystal bowl between her manicured hands. She thought of the List, her mental tally of their wealthy, influential, and elite friends. Too many names had been crossed off in the past week, but there was always someone left. Someone in need of her personal attention . . . \u201cI\u2019ll get in touch with Howard. Under the circumstances, certainly he can arrange a reasonable loan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoward\u2019s dead, darling. He ate a bottle of pills last night.\u201d Brent put a hand on the top of her head briefly before wandering over to the deck window. \u201cRon\u2019s gone to hide in Barbados; Carl\u2019s already filed and intends to move in with his parents.\u201d</p><p>Randa refused to believe it was this bad, and set aside the drink. \u201cWhat about Jerry? He was your best friend at Yale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s testifying before Congress next week.\u201d Brent tucked his hands into his pockets. \u201cOne of the many conditions attached to his plea agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy?\u201d</p><p>The low, sweet voice grated against Randa\u2019s ears, and she had to take a moment to compose her expression before she turned to look at her daughter. \u201cEmily, you\u2019re supposed to be asleep by now.\u201d A resentful corner of her heart added, And you weren\u2019t supposed to be so big, or dark, or whiny.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The six-year-old hung her head. \u201cBut no one came to kiss me good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy and I have been busy.\u201d Randa rose, absently smoothing down the folds of her dress before she picked up the house phone and pressed nine. When Emily\u2019s nanny answered, she said, \u201cMary, Miss Collins has come downstairs. She needs to be taken back to the nursery.\u201d She ignored the nanny\u2019s hurried apology and replaced the receiver.</p><p>Brent walked over to crouch down in front of their daughter. \u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to forget you, sweetheart. Mommy and I just . . . needed to talk about things.\u201d She slipped into his arms and buried her face against his neck. \u201cDid you have another bad dream?\u201d</p><p>Under his chin, her untidy black mop moved from side to side. \u201cMiss Mary is upset. She\u2019s going away in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Randa\u2019s heels made sharp sounds as she strode across the imported marble and grabbed Emily by the arm. \u201cDid she tell you she was leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mommy.\u201d Her daughter cringed. \u201cIt was the fairies again. They told me she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake.\u201d She let go of Emily with a contemptuous fling of her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve told you a dozen times, there are no such things as fairies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRandie.\u201d Brent looked up and shook his head a little. To Emily, he said, \u201cYou just stop listening to those fairies and go to sleep like a good girl, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>The disheveled nanny came through the doors and hurried over to take Emily\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mrs. Collins. I thought she was already asleep. I did check on her before I went to bed, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you did. That will be all.\u201d Randa gave the door a direct look.</p><p>When the nanny began walking Emily out, the little girl dragged against her arm and looked back at her parents. \u201cYou\u2019ll come up to tuck me in, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>Brent smiled. \u201cIn a few minutes, sweetheart.\u201d As soon as the child and the nanny left, his expression faded into bleakness. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to call Chicago first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already did,\u201d Randa told him. \u201cThey won\u2019t take her back, not now. They\u2019ve destroyed the paperwork, but we have to deal with getting rid of her.\u201d She might as well tell him the rest. \u201cI called an adoption attorney, and he\u2019s been looking for a girl her age. He says he can place her with a wealthy couple in Mexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God.\u201d Brent whitened. \u201cRanda, she\u2019s just a little girl. None of this is her fault.\u201d</p><p>Randa knew her husband. Brent, an only child, had been worshiped by his parents since the moment he\u2019d been yanked from between his mother\u2019s legs, and after they died he\u2019d gone looking for new groupies. She\u2019d been happy to cater to him for the duration of their courtship, but she\u2019d never been interested in wasting her life playing his adoring fan. A child had been the logical answer, but rather than destroy her body she\u2019d arranged Emily\u2019s adoption.</p><p>Randa didn\u2019t care what happened to Emily now, but she had to think about her future. \u201cDarling, it\u2019s better this way. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be well treated by these Mexicans. After all, they\u2019re probably her people.\u201d</p><p>Brent began to pace. \u201cWe\u2019ll turn her over to the authorities. They\u2019ll put her in foster care here in the States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, drop her off at the nearest police station?\u201d Randa felt a surge of bitter amusement. \u201cI think they\u2019ll want to know who you are and where you found her. Are you going to tell them how we bought her, or why you can\u2019t take care of her anymore?\u201d</p><p>His expression turned stubborn. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be me. I\u2019ll pay Mary to take her to them after we leave in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She rested her head against her hand. \u201cWhere do you think we\u2019re going, lover? The money\u2019s gone. Our friends are wiped out. At least Howard only swindled you. If you\u2019d been in bed with him, they\u2019d be coming after you now.\u201d She saw his expression and shot to her feet. \u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake, Brent. How could you be so fucking stupid?\u201d</p><p>He hung his head. \u201cHoward needed more investors, and I had the connections. He made me a partner and tripled my percentage. It shouldn\u2019t have fallen apart so quickly. He swore to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwore to you?\u201d she shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, you idiot? Howard is dead, and Ron is testifying. That leaves you to be the fall guy. They\u2019re going to come after you for all this now. You\u2019ll be the one they splash all over the papers and parade on television and drag off to prison.\u201d</p><p>Brent wouldn\u2019t look at her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be like that for us.\u201d</p><p>Time to cut her losses. \u201cIt won\u2019t be for me.\u201d She looked around. \u201cWhere is my purse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wrong.\u201d Brent strode over to her. \u201cYou aren\u2019t leaving me and Emily now. We\u2019re a family, and whatever it takes, we\u2019re going to stay together. We need you. We love you.\u201d</p><p>Randa closed her eyes briefly before she smiled at him. \u201cDarling, this may come as something of a shock, but I don\u2019t need you. Or your shit. Or that little monkey-faced bitch.\u201d</p><p>He hit her, his open palm slamming into her face, and Randa stumbled away as she pressed her hand to her burning cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your husband. Emily is your daughter,\u201d he told her as he took hold of her arms. A strange calmness seemed to settle over him, erasing the lines of strain from his face and most of the emotion from his eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t abandon us.\u201d</p><p>She had never loved him, but now she hated him. \u201cIf you try to stop me, I\u2019ll testify against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still my wife.\u201d Brent\u2019s eyes grew sad. \u201cEmily needs her mother.\u201d</p><p>Randa would have laughed at that, but her husband\u2019s slim hands encircled her throat, choking off her voice and then her breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave us,\u201d he whispered again into her ear. \u201cWe\u2019re a family. We have to go together.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s distrust had been difficult enough for Samuel to manage, but her brisk decision to go to bed with him was nothing short of utterly confounding.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t wish to upset you,\u201d he said as she led him across the deck to the hot tub. \u201cBut I believe the stress of our situation has affected your judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlas, m\u00edo, you believe wrong.\u201d She knelt down to unfasten the cover and glanced up at him. \u201cWill you get the other side, please?\u201d</p><p>Automatically he walked around and bent to pick up the edge of the canvas cover, folding it back onto itself before he shifted it away from the Jacuzzi. The water inside the tub was clean and clear and, when Charlotte pressed a button on the tub\u2019s console, began to bubble rapidly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need the heat.\u201d She slipped her legs over the edge and lowered herself into the tub until the water reached her waist. \u201cNice and cool. For now, anyway. Get in.\u201d</p><p>He tried not to look at how her sarong soaked up the water. \u201cI should go and collect something for us to eat. You must be hungry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be shy.\u201d She held out her hand. \u201cCome on. I won\u2019t bite. Unless you want me to.\u201d</p><p>Samuel sat down on the edge of the tub, intent only on persuading her out of it. He didn\u2019t expect her to pull him into the water, or to wrap herself around him as soon as he planted his feet.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she said, linking her hands behind his neck. \u201cFeels good, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels amazingly good.\u201d So did she, and he gave himself a moment to enjoy the sensation of her voluptuous body pressed to his. \u201cYou\u2019ve a generous soul, Charlotte, and I am beyond flattered, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are gorgeous, but you talk too much.\u201d She leaned close to kiss his cheek, and whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s a man hiding in the brush about thirty yards off the deck to your right. Don\u2019t turn your head when you look.\u201d</p><p>Samuel spotted the shadowy figure at once. \u201cI see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe sun will set in a few minutes, and then I\u2019ll be able to do my thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe closer he is, the easier it\u2019ll be for me to read him. So let\u2019s give him a reason to stay there, all right?\u201d</p><p>Taske should have felt relieved, but he was too furious with himself and their captor. \u201cI could go and have a few words with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could be armed, and I don\u2019t have any more blood to spare.\u201d She drew him back to the wide bench seat under the water, reversing their positions and pushing him down so that his back was to the man watching them. \u201cTake off my top,\u201d she murmured, \u201cand throw it on the deck.\u201d</p><p>Taske did as she directed, his anger making him tear the lacy fabric in the process. \u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s good. Very convincing.\u201d As she straddled him, she brought her face close to his, keeping their lips only a whisper apart, but looked to the left of him. \u201cHe\u2019s moving closer,\u201d she breathed against his mouth. \u201cNow pretend I\u2019m a skinny little heiress and tell me how much you want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d He put his hands on either side of her waist, both to steady her and to keep her from rubbing against the erection straining under his shorts.</p><p>Her smile tightened. \u201cWith how I look I know it\u2019s a stretch, but try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant, why would I pretend you were someone else?\u201d He threaded his fingers through her thick hair as he looked all over her face. \u201cSeeing you, I understand why some men invaded countries and defeated armies and conquered emperors to have one woman. Helen of Troy must have been as strong and fierce and desirable as you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, she was?\u201d Her expression turned ironic. \u201cIn all the movies I\u2019ve seen about Troy, Helen is a gorgeous little blonde.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen\u2019s legend was born in the Mediterranean,\u201d he told her. \u201cEven today, most of the natives of that region are black haired and have dark complexions. In the art of her era, Helen is portrayed as a statuesque brunette. It was only much later that artists began painting her as a petite woman with fair hair and white skin.\u201d</p><p>She seemed amused. \u201cThat\u2019s what most men want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost men are fools,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>She ran her hands over his shoulders. \u201cAt least guys never have to worry about it. The bigger, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary.\u201d It infuriated him to think the men in her past had made her feel unattractive. \u201cDespite the strapping heroic figures that regularly grace the covers of romance novels, in reality most women find men built like me quite intimidating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen most women are idiots, m\u00edo.\u201d She glanced past him and said in a louder voice, \u201cI\u2019m glad you don\u2019t mind my size. Even big girls like me need love.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was only playing to their voyeur, but the fact that she considered herself unattractive infuriated him. \u201cHow could I mind having you in my arms? Since the first moment I saw you, I\u2019ve thought of little else.\u201d He stroked his hand down her arm. \u201cSeeing you makes me believe in things I know to be impossible. Answered prayers. Granted wishes.\u201d He traced the outline of her lips with his fingertips. \u201cWildest dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep talking like that, m\u00edo,\u201d she said, her voice shaking a little, \u201cand you\u2019ll break my heart.\u201d</p><p>He dragged her hand from his shoulder to his chest, pressing it over the heavy throb beneath his skin. \u201cThen you can have mine, m\u00eda.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as she took in a sharp breath, and Taske brought her parted lips to his. He felt her jerk beneath his kiss, but she didn\u2019t pull back, and then she was opening for him, her mouth sweet and hot. Suddenly he didn\u2019t care about the man watching them or what he thought. Putting on a show didn\u2019t matter, and merely tasting Charlotte wasn\u2019t enough. Taske wanted more, he needed more, and she gave it to him, caressing him with her lips and gliding her tongue against his.</p><p>Far too soon she tugged her mouth free of his, and Taske saw she was frowning. \u201cCharlotte, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She closed her eyes briefly before she murmured, \u201cI\u2019m not getting anything from him.\u201d</p><p>Although the sun no longer appeared in the reflection on the glass wall of the villa, Taske could see some light on the horizon. \u201cGive it a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me try something.\u201d She rested her hand against his neck. \u201cThink of your favorite color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d Taske watched her eyes widen as she brought her fingers to her lips, and knew she had heard his thoughts. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Kissed by a Rose\u2019 is the name of a song,\u201d she told him, \u201cnot a color.\u201d</p><p>The blush that darkened her cheeks, he decided, would be his second-favorite color. \u201cBut that\u2019s what your mouth feels like.\u201d</p><p>She looked as if she meant to argue, and then she glanced to the right and sighed. \u201cLooks like our voyeur took off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pick up any thoughts from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it. I can read anyone, but that man . . . Sam, it was like he wasn\u2019t even there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re certain that he\u2019s gone.\u201d When she nodded, he cradled her face between his hands. \u201cKiss me again, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lower lip. \u201cHe\u2019s gone. Show\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He pressed his thumb against her mouth, taking the place of her lip between the edges of her teeth. \u201cKiss me again anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t just read someone\u2019s thoughts.\u201d She drew in an uneven breath. \u201cI also get the emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know how I feel about you.\u201d He was glad; he didn\u2019t want to hide how much he wanted her anymore.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI feel what you feel, Sam. The physical sensations that go with the emotions. And right now, you\u2019re very . . .\u201d Her eyelashes swept down as she shuddered. \u201cHot and bothered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee how this feels,\u201d he said, bringing her mouth to his.</p><p>As Taske kissed her again, she groaned and plastered herself against him. Always in the past he had been forced to hold back, to temper his hunger along with his strength for fear of taking too much too fast. But nothing about Charlotte was flimsy or fragile, and she responded with equal passion, demanding as much as he wanted from her.</p><p>How long they kissed, Taske didn\u2019t know or care; he couldn\u2019t think beyond the fusion of their mouths and bodies. The strip of fabric binding her breasts floated away, and he pulled her in to feel the luxurious weight on his chest. The soft vise of her thighs settled her sex against him, and there she rocked gently, working with tormenting friction against the swollen ache of his shaft. His muscles bunched as he lifted her, lust blinding him as he suckled at one breast and then the other, scoring her with the edge of his teeth.</p><p>He released her when he felt her snarl her fists in his hair, but by that moment reason had vanished. All he could think of was putting his mouth on her.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d</p><p>He brought her down so he could feel his name on her lips. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d He dropped one hand beneath the water to clasp the top of her leg, gripping the taut muscle and smiling as she trembled with reaction. \u201cWhatever you want, whatever you need, Charlotte, let me give it to you. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d She panted against his mouth, her body shuddering as he followed the curve of her inner thigh up to the soft, full flower of her sex. \u201cI don\u2019t know if . . .\u201d She trailed off with a groan as he used his fingers to stroke her. \u201cGod, that feels . . . Oh, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>He took his hand from her, but only long enough to release the front of his shorts. He splayed his hand across her bottom, urging her closer so he could settle her against his shaft. \u201cThere you are.\u201d It had been so long, too long, and the feel of her silkiness on him was almost too much. He clenched his teeth as he ignored the burning ache in his balls. \u201cLook at me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is crazy.\u201d Her dazed eyes met his. \u201cWe don\u2019t know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do.\u201d He shifted his hips so that his shaft parted her folds and dragged along her inner tissues. He could feel the small protrusion of her clit as his cock head nudged over it, and shifted again. He moved just enough so that the heavy ridge of his glans slid over the little knot before he went still. \u201cGo ahead, Charlotte. Use me however you like. Let me feel your pleasure.\u201d He cupped her buttocks as her thighs tightened against his hips. \u201cIt\u2019s only fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not, you wicked man.\u201d Her hands clutched his shoulders as she moved, rocking herself slowly against him. \u201cBut, God, you feel so good.\u201d</p> <p>Taske braced himself, watching her face as she rubbed herself over him. Her sweet lips parted as her breath quickened and the water churned around them. The delicious glide of her sex tugged at his foreskin, pushing his own needs to the brink, but he held back, unwilling to find his own release until he saw hers.</p><p>When she came, it was with a long, graceful roll of her hips, her folds engulfing the straining head of his penis. It took every last shred of his control not to push in and pump himself deep. He drew his hips back, just enough to position the tip against her clit, and then with a groan that came from his heels let his climax jet against her.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d She came again, this time with a cry, writhing under his hands as the tremors racked her a second time.</p><p>Taske tucked her face against his neck and held her, soothing her through the aftershocks by stroking his hands along her spine. Her breathing slowed and her body gradually went limp, and when he murmured her name, she barely stirred.</p><p>Like an exhausted child, she\u2019d fallen asleep.</p> <p>Taske shifted her so that he could support her legs, and carefully stepped up and out of the pool. Water streamed down his legs as he stood for a moment and realized what he didn\u2019t feel. Yesterday lifting something as insignificant as a briefcase had been impossible for him. Now he held Charlotte without difficulty, without even thinking about it. He barely felt her weight at all.</p><p>As a boy Taske had been as healthy and active as any other child, and had spent every moment he could outdoors. When he\u2019d joined in games with other children, his size had given him some advantages, but his physical strength had never been anything out of the ordinary. Now something was changing him on the physical level, and from the surges of energy he felt, he suspected the process was continuing. As if whatever had healed him hadn\u2019t finished with him yet. He could almost feel the power growing inside him.</p><p>Taske looked at the villa, and then at the woman sleeping in his arms. Twenty-four hours ago he had thought only of saving one more life before he ended his own. Now, because of her, everything had changed.</p><p>Now it was time to find out why.</p><p>Drew stood on the whitewashed steps outside the hillside home of the fifth witness to Tacal\u2019s murder and watched as Agent Flores spoke to the old woman who had answered the door. After being unable to speak to four of the witnesses, he was convinced they were only wasting their time, but his companion had insisted on trying one more address.</p><p>Drew didn\u2019t mind letting her take the lead, not when she spoke the language and knew every street in Manzanillo. He\u2019d left his rental in the guest lot at the small but scrupulously clean hotel Gracie had recommended, and from there had let her drive them around town in her old but well-maintained Subaru, both out of deference to her and to have time to think over the situation.</p> <p>Someone had set up Samuel Taske and the paramedic for Tacal\u2019s murder; of that Drew had absolutely no doubt. Even if somehow Taske had been physically capable of beating a man unconscious, he was too intelligent and fastidious to do so in front of a crowd in a strange country. There was always the possibility that his friend had been drugged or had suffered some kind of psychotic break as a result of being abducted, but if that were the case, why would he stop and let the EMT finish the job?</p><p>At first the old lady seemed only a little suspicious, until Gracie asked a question and gestured toward the bay. A few sharp words, a shake of the head, and the elderly woman scurried back inside.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Drew said as the door slammed shut. \u201cThe witness left this morning on an extended trip and won\u2019t be back until sometime near Christmas. Again.\u201d</p><p>Gracie closed her notepad and tucked it away. \u201cI do not understand this. How could every witness to this one murder leave the city at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy not leaving and telling their families to say they did.\u201d He glanced out at the horizon, where the sky was darkening from deep purple to black. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. We might as well call it a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She gave him a perplexed look. \u201cWhat else would we call it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s American slang for \u2018it\u2019s time to quit,\u2019 \u201d he explained. \u201cOr \u2018it\u2019s time to go and have a drink with me.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She started down the steps toward the narrow street at the base of the hill, her heels clicking against the stone. \u201cWell, which is it?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned as he followed. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the interpretation up to you, Agent Flores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to work in the morning.\u201d She stopped to unlock the passenger door before she went around to the driver\u2019s side. She glanced across the car roof at him. \u201cAnd you are returning to the U.S. tomorrow, no?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t lie to the only person interested in helping him. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until I find out what really happened to these people. I\u2019d also like to know why you were taken off this case, and why you decided to help me anyway.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she looked as if she wanted to turn and walk off. \u201cBueno. One drink.\u201d</p><p>Gracie drove back toward the police station, but parked on the next block over in front of a small caf\u00e9. As soon as Drew stepped out he smelled coffee and burned sugar, and saw two women wearing colorful aprons removing trays of pastries from the glass cases inside. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019re closing for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Gracie gestured toward a small garden courtyard beside the building. \u201cGo, sit down.\u201d She went inside, and one of the women came out from behind the counter to hug her.</p><p>Drew watched them chat for a moment before he walked back to the courtyard and sat down at a table in one shadowed corner. A few minutes later Gracie joined him, a small tray in her hands.</p><p>He eyed a plate heaped with tiny pastries and two steaming mugs. \u201cMore hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaf\u00e9 de olla y conchas.\u201d She unloaded the tray before setting it aside and sitting down next to him. \u201cMexican coffee and pastries.\u201d</p><p>He tested the drink, which was dark, flavored with cinnamon, and came with a powerful kick. \u201cThat\u2019s not just coffee. I thought you had to work in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is why I bought the conchas.\u201d She selected one, nibbling at the edge of the shell-shaped pastry before she licked the crumbs it left on her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re staring at me, Agent Frasier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more interesting than the garden, Agent Flores.\u201d He reached over to rub his thumb over some sugar she\u2019d missed. \u201cSo why are you helping me?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cIt is only a professional courtesy. You would do the same if I were in your country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d do a lot more.\u201d Drew grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re blushing again. Admit it. You like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were a man,\u201d she countered, \u201cwe\u2019d be in a cantina, drinking and talking about women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were a man, I\u2019d be too busy crying. But we can talk about women, if you like.\u201d He sat back. \u201cWhat made you decide to become an environmental cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the right thing to do,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cMexico has not always been a poor country. When your ancestors were living in animal-skin tents and hunting with bows, mine were building temples to the gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually my ancestors were probably drinking, poaching deer, and thieving from the British.\u201d He studied her expression. \u201cYou take your job very seriously, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I do anything else?\u201d Idly she broke her pastry into small pieces. \u201cThe first invaders, the conquis-tadores, came here looking for gold. They burned our cities and butchered thousands trying to find it. Today the oil companies, the tourists, and the sportfishermen are not so brutal, perhaps, but they, too, have no conscience. If we let them do as they please, they will steal or destroy the few treasures we have left.\u201d Her lips twisted. \u201cIt would be easier if I were not a woman. Men in my country think we belong at home, cooking their meals and having their babies.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the police station across the street. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s why they took you off this case? Because you\u2019re a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not\u2014\u201d A ring from her mobile phone interrupted her, and she retrieved it from her case. As soon as she looked at the display she rose to her feet. \u201cExcuse me for a moment.\u201d</p><p>Drew watched her walk a short distance out to the curb, and then checked his own mobile. His signal status still stood at one-half bar; he\u2019d have to ask her what service she used so he could piggyback a call to their tower once he returned to the hotel.</p><p>Gracie returned after a minute. \u201cI am sorry to rush you, but that was the clerk from your hotel. He says a detective is there, waiting to see you.\u201d</p><p>Her back was to the streetlights, and her face shadowed, but Drew heard the tension in her voice and saw the rigid set of her slim shoulders. She wasn\u2019t looking at him, either.</p><p>His gaze shifted as a dark car pulled up to the front of the police station. Two men emerged and stood for a moment beside the car; one was the police chief.</p><p>The other was his old boss, Jonah Genaro.</p><p>Drew slid off his copper bracelet, holding it in his hand briefly before opening his fingers. His ability reshaped the dark metal cuff, straightening and elongating it before it blunted itself on one end and formed a point-tipped blade on the other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He moved quickly around Gracie, clamping his free hand over her mouth as he hauled her out of sight. \u201cHold still and don\u2019t make a sound,\u201d he murmured against her hair as he watched Genaro shake hands with the police chief before he got into the back of the car.</p><p>She shook her head and gripped his arm with her hands, trying to free herself.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Gracie.\u201d Drew let her see the copper blade and felt her stiffen against him. Although he\u2019d stab himself before he\u2019d hurt her, he couldn\u2019t let Genaro see either of them.</p> <p>Once the dark car left, the police chief went back inside the station. Drew waited another few seconds before he relaxed a little and removed his hand from Gracie\u2019s mouth, although he kept his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she demanded, pulling at his arm again. \u201cHave you gone crazy? Let go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy, and I\u2019m not hallucinating, either.\u201d He turned her around to face him. \u201cWhy is Jonah Genaro here in Mexico?\u201d</p><p>All the emotion left her face and her eyes went flat. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you mean, Agent Frasier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely woman, Gracie,\u201d he told her as he marched her back over to the table to retrieve the keys to her car. \u201cBut a lousy liar.\u201d</p> <p>When they reached her car he put the keys in her hands. \u201cUnlock the door.\u201d As soon as she did he opened it and hustled her inside, moving her over to the driver\u2019s seat as he climbed in after her.</p><p>\u201cThis is kidnapping,\u201d she said as he clipped her seat belt over her. \u201cYou will go to prison for many years, Martin. Our prisons are nothing like those in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompared to what Genaro has planned for me, trust me, it\u2019d be a vacation.\u201d He pushed the key in the ignition. \u201cAnd my name\u2019s not Martin. It\u2019s Andrew. Start the car.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. \u201cI will do nothing more for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll lock you in the trunk,\u201d he told her. \u201cStart the damn car, Gracie.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly she turned the key. \u201cI will take you to the airport. You can put me in the trunk there and leave on the next plane.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not helping.\u201d She lifted her chin. \u201cI am ridding myself of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenaro will have men at the airport waiting to take me,\u201d he assured her. \u201cAnd the border, and the docks, and every other way out of this fucking country.\u201d He pointed toward the bay. \u201cDrive toward the water.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him before she started down the road. \u201cSo what is your plan? Do you think you can steal a boat, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving Mexico until I find my friends.\u201d He was telling her too much, but he didn\u2019t care anymore. His seeing Genaro had completely changed the game. \u201cHow long has Jonah been in the city? Did he frame Taske and Marena for the murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know this man,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cTonight was the first time I have ever seen him in Manzanillo.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s instincts were never wrong, and they were telling him that she was speaking the truth. \u201cOkay, I believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say these people are your friends.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cAre you a criminal, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He watched the rearview mirror. \u201cActually I\u2019m an unemployed computer geek. Turn left at the next intersection.\u201d</p><p>Gracie made the turn and looked ahead. \u201cDo you even know where you are going, Andrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I said I was lousy at following directions? I lied.\u201d He checked the GPS on his mobile as they drove down a row of beachside cottages, and then pointed at the next open parking spot. \u201cPull in there.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Gracie parked he switched off the engine and pocketed the keys. As he opened his door he latched onto her arm. \u201cCome out this side.\u201d</p><p>Drew held on to her as he stepped up onto the sidewalk and glanced down both sides of the street. \u201cWhich one is yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, lady, you\u2019re a lousy liar.\u201d He glanced at her stubborn expression. \u201cI can start waking up your neighbors, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake them.\u201d She folded her arms. \u201cThey will be happy to call the police and have you arrested.\u201d</p><p>He saw the curtains in the window twitch and pulled her close. \u201cNot after they see this.\u201d</p><p>Gracie stood frozen as Drew kissed her, and then she tried to hammer on his chest with her fists. He held on to her and used his tongue to muffle the outraged sounds she made. He retreated when she tried to bite him, and grabbed a handful of her silky hair as she turned her head away. Then she was kissing him back, with all the fire and passion he\u2019d sensed seething under her all-business demeanor.</p><p>He eased back to look into her furious eyes. \u201cYou kiss like a wildcat fights.\u201d</p><p>Gracie slapped him. \u201cYou are a pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so.\u201d He caught her wrist before she could hit him a second time and held it between them. \u201cBut do you really want me dead, Agraciana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she snapped. Then, with visible resentment: \u201cNo, of course not. Unless you try to hurt me, and then I will kill you myself.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cWhy are you doing this? Why did this Genaro follow you here? Where does he want to take you?\u201d</p><p>With Genaro now in Mexico and his men probably searching the streets of the city, Drew had no choice but to trust her. \u201cTell me which place is yours, and we\u2019ll go inside and talk.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a long, doubtful look before she gestured toward a small, pale blue cottage at the end of the row. \u201cI will listen to what you have to say, as long as you do not try to kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Unlike her, Drew was an excellent liar.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Genaro left downtown Manzanillo and directed his driver to take him up into the hills outside the city. The dirt roads they followed weren\u2019t on any map, but neither was the private estate they led to.</p><p>A flat-faced young Mexican woman driving a golf cart stopped on the other side of the compound gates. She wore a large red poppy in her hair, and smiled at him, displaying a slight gap between her teeth.</p><p>\u201cYour driver will have to wait here, se\u00f1or,\u201d she said as she used a remote to open the gates.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Genaro noted the ubiquitous black-and-white maid\u2019s uniform she wore as he walked through. He stopped as she produced a handheld metal detector. \u201cI\u2019m not armed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not concerned with weapons.\u201d She passed the device over the front and back of his body before she stepped back and held out a small rectangular basket. \u201cYour watch, your wallet, and all of your electronic devices, please.\u201d</p><p>Impatiently he removed and placed the items in the basket. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d She gestured to the cart. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The girl said nothing, and held no interest for Genaro, so as she drove from the gates to the towering home they protected, he turned his attention to the surroundings. Enormous fires burned from tall braziers and cast flickering light over sprawling gardens and heavily laden fruit trees. The girl drove through a network of animal pens stocked with sheep, goats, and pigs before she circled around an artificial pond filled with waterfowl, and through a maze of flowering shrubs that perfumed the air with heavy sweetness.</p><p>It was what Genaro didn\u2019t see that held his interest. Thanks to the ongoing drug wars, the men who ran Mexico\u2019s enormous cartels were hypervigilant about their own protection, especially at home. Yet here there appeared to be no armed guards or any special security measures other than the fifteen-foot-high brick wall encompassing the property. Aside from a few old women working in the garden, he saw no people at all.</p><p>The girl stopped the cart at another gate, which stood open in front of a short stone path that led up to the main house.</p><p>\u201cOne moment, please.\u201d She got out of the cart and went to the gate, where a man emerged and escorted her back. Like the girl, he wore black and white, but instead of a uniform he wore a well-tailored suit. \u201cSe\u00f1or Genaro, this is Segundo. He will speak to Energ\u00fameno for you.\u201d</p><p>He got out of the cart. \u201cI can speak for myself, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one doubts that, sir,\u201d Segundo said, his voice as colorless as his appearance. \u201cBut can you do so in Nahautl?\u201d</p><p>Genaro glanced up at the house. \u201cYour employer doesn\u2019t speak English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnerg\u00fameno doesn\u2019t have to, Mr. Genaro.\u201d Segundo gestured toward the house. \u201cIf you will follow me, please.\u201d</p><p>The main house exceeded anything Genaro had seen since arriving in Mexico, and rivaled the size of his own estate in the States; the first floor had to be no less than thirty thousand square feet. From the first level unadorned adobe walls soared straight up, capped not by the ubiquitous terra-cotta tile but an enormous thatched palapas supported independently of the structure by pillars carved from whole tree trunks and inlaid with long rows of jasper and onyx spheres.</p><p>In Genaro\u2019s experience drug lords predictably built ornate, tasteless mansions and decorated them like brothels to compensate for their humble beginnings as dirt-poor peasants. Energ\u00fameno had dispensed with the usual flashy show of wealth and had aspired to more palatial surroundings.</p><p>Segundo led him into a winding passage lit by small torches and into a main reception area made up of freestanding glass walls. Behind each pane of glass a pedestal displayed intricately painted pots; masks made of jade, silver, and onyx; and tall, delicate crystal vases filled with gilt-edged white feathers.</p><p>Somewhere a dark, sultry-scented incense burned, and water rushed and splashed. Genaro didn\u2019t mind the torches or the noticeable absence of air-conditioning, but the pungent smoke brought back memories he didn\u2019t care to recall.</p><p>The steward stopped by a pair of crooked arrows hammered out of pure gold. \u201cMay I offer a suggestion, se\u00f1or?\u201d When Genaro eyed him, Segundo lost his smile. \u201cIn his presence, speak only the truth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy would I lie to your employer when I come here asking for his assistance?\u201d Genaro countered.</p><p>The steward spread his hands. \u201cThose who rely on deception often become incapable of honesty. Just as those who hold the truth sacred become intolerant of liars. Observe carefully, and you will see this for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Segundo led him through the treasure collection into a long, narrow room that curved around a crescent-shaped cage of gold. Inside the cage a black jaguar lay on its side and licked a paw. From the rounded distension of its black belly it was either overfed or a pregnant female. A mound of bones had been scattered around the floor of the cage, some shredded flesh still adhering to the gleaming white surfaces. Beyond the cage a wall of white, semitransparent silk formed a partition; the shadow of a large seated figure behind it flickered as if backlit by fire.</p> <p>Segundo faced him. \u201cYou may speak to Energ\u00fameno through me, Mr. Genaro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the opportunity to speak with you personally.\u201d He waited for the steward to translate before he continued. \u201cAs I said on the phone, I have come to your city for two Americans who were brought here from California. I am willing to offer you the compensation of your choice for any assistance you can give me in locating them.\u201d</p><p>After Segundo repeated what he\u2019d said in Nahautl, there was a long stretch of silence. Then from behind the silk curtain came an odd, resonant voice.</p><p>The steward eyed him. \u201cEnerg\u00fameno has not yet decided what is to be done with these Americans. He wishes to know why you want them.\u201d</p><p>Genaro kept his expression bland. \u201cThe man has information about people involved in a genetic experiment that I wish to duplicate. What he knows may be of great value to my company.\u201d</p> <p>Energ\u00fameno spoke again, this time issuing only a few terse words.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you not send hired men to do this?\u201d Segundo translated.</p><p>Genaro glanced at the remains of the jaguar\u2019s recent feast. One femur near the edge of the cage was too large to be from anything but a human being.</p><p>Those who rely on deception often become incapable of honesty. Just as those who hold the truth sacred become intolerant of liars.</p><p>\u201cSamuel Taske, the man who was brought here, is wealthy and resourceful,\u201d Genaro said. \u201cI was unwilling to depend on others to find and capture him. He\u2019s too important to my project.\u201d</p><p>Energ\u00fameno spoke again.</p> <p>\u201cWhat will you do with this man when you are finished with him?\u201d the steward asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t persuade him to work for me,\u201d Genaro said, \u201cI will have him killed.\u201d</p><p>The shadow elongated against the silk curtain.</p><p>\u201cIf you are concerned about the American authorities, don\u2019t be,\u201d he added quickly. \u201cOnce I take these fugitives back to America, I will see to it that there is nothing to connect either of them to you.\u201d</p><p>Energ\u00fameno spoke to the steward a final time before his shadow dwindled and then disappeared.</p><p>\u201cCertain preparations must be made,\u201d Segundo said. \u201cEnerg\u00fameno has ordered a meal prepared for you, se\u00f1or. This way.\u201d</p><p>Genaro followed the steward out of the reception room and through a curving corridor into a formal dining area. Two places were set: one at the head of the long stone table and one to the right. Bountiful platters of food had been set out, and the girl who had driven the cart stood waiting with a bottle of wine.</p><p>Genaro had no desire to eat or drink, but sat down in the chair the steward drew out for him. \u201cI\u2019ll just have water, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>Segundo inclined his head, and then left the dining room with the girl.</p><p>Genaro drank down half of the water in his glass. As unnerving as the interview had been, it had been worth the risk; Energ\u00fameno would be an invaluable ally.</p><p>The girl returned several minutes later to refresh his empty water glass. The gap in her teeth didn\u2019t seem as noticeable this time when she smiled at him, and the red poppy in her hair emphasized how dark and glossy it was. \u201cIs the food not to your liking, se\u00f1or?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for your employer.\u201d He nodded at the empty place setting.</p><p>\u201cEnerg\u00fameno prefers to dine alone.\u201d She sat down beside him and helped herself to a cluster of grapes. \u201cYou should have tried the wine. It is very good. We make it ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Genaro\u2019s satisfaction abruptly vanished, leaving behind a cold knot in his belly. He was not being feted; he was being stalled. \u201cPerhaps another time.\u201d He stood. \u201cI have some business to attend to in the city. Will you take me to my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She led him out of the house and to the waiting cart. As she started toward the gate Genaro felt his nausea fade, and realized he\u2019d overreacted to the situation, and had behaved abominably toward his companion. \u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me?\u201d She glanced at him, her lovely face amused. \u201cWhy would you do that, se\u00f1or?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was rude to you earlier,\u201d he admitted, his eyes drawn to the elegant way she handled the steering wheel of the cart. The girl had thin, delicate hands, one of which sported a tattoo he hadn\u2019t noticed before now. His penis stiffened as he imagined her clasping it in her pretty hands and stroking it. \u201cThat was unkind.\u201d</p><p>Her slim shoulders moved. \u201cI am used to it, and it never lasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved. \u201cQuinequia.\u201d</p><p>Looking at the silver dove that had been inked onto the back of her hand made his erection grow harder. \u201cCome back with me to the city.\u201d He had never begged a woman to do anything, but he knew he couldn\u2019t leave without her. He plucked the poppy from her hair and drew it down her cheek, caressing her with its soft petals. \u201cSpend the night with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnerg\u00fameno does not allow us to leave the compound.\u201d Quinequia stopped the cart by the front gates, taking the poppy from his fingers and replacing it in her hair. \u201cHere we are.\u201d</p><p>Genaro didn\u2019t see his car or driver, but ignored the police officer waiting for them. \u201cIf you won\u2019t come with me,\u201d he wheedled, \u201cI\u2019ll stay here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is also not permitted, se\u00f1or.\u201d She nodded to the officer, who came over and took Genaro\u2019s arm, pulling it behind his back. \u201cEnerg\u00fameno wishes you to go with this man. He will take you where you belong. As soon as you walk through the gates, you will forget me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he heard himself say in a slurred, dull voice as the cop handcuffed his wrists behind his back. \u201cForget.\u201d</p><p>Quinequia smiled. \u201cVery good, Jonah. You should do well where you are going.\u201d She patted his shoulder before taking out a handheld radio and speaking into it in Spanish.</p><p>As the cop helped Genaro out to the battered police car, he glanced backward at a young, flat-faced Mexican woman who stood watching them. \u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>The cop grinned. \u201cJust some girl with bad teeth.\u201d</p><p>An insect buzzing in Charlie\u2019s ear made her frown and swat her hand. When the bug only got louder she opened her eyes and stared through the mesh of damp hair at sunlight-gilded bamboo. Her heavy limbs didn\u2019t want to move, not when the memory of nearly having sex with Samuel Taske came back to her. Even worse, she\u2019d enjoyed it more than all the other times when she\u2019d had real sex with the men she\u2019d known. Which should have made her feel pathetic, and oddly didn\u2019t.</p><p>Samuel had stripped her out of her wet sarong but had wrapped her in one of the robes, a gesture she found curiously touching. Always a gentleman, aren\u2019t you, m\u00edo? She\u2019d have preferred to see him sleeping on the other side of the bed, which lay empty, as did the rest of the room.</p><p>The buzzing sound distracted her again, but this time she realized it wasn\u2019t being made by an insect. The faint, high-pitched noise came from outside the sliding doors, which had been left open. She saw Samuel dressed only in a pair of cutoffs and standing with his back toward her, and got out of bed, belting the robe as she went out onto the deck.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wake me?\u201d she asked as she came to stand beside him.</p><p>\u201cYou needed the rest. You were exhausted.\u201d He glanced down at her. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRested and annoyed.\u201d She glanced back at the position of the sun, and estimated it was an hour after dawn. \u201cHow long have you been up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never went to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tonight it\u2019ll be your turn to crash.\u201d The buzzing sound grew annoyingly loud, and she peered out at the water. \u201cThat sound, is that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boat coming toward the island,\u201d he confirmed, turning her back toward the room. \u201cYou should get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She watched him retrieve a shirt from the closet. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>He pulled the shirt over his head. \u201cI have some preparations to make for our visitor.\u201d</p><p>The flatness of his voice both spooked and reassured her at the same time. \u201cThere\u2019s a pair of suture scissors in my bag, in the treatment room. The blades aren\u2019t very long, but they\u2019re sharp and made of surgical steel.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and went to the door, where he retrieved her teak chair-leg club. \u201cMeet me in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Charlie went into the closet, ignoring the skimpy female clothing as she sorted through what had been stocked for Samuel. Most of the garments were far too big for her, but she found some black stretch swim trunks that covered her from waist to knees, and paired them with a red tank, the hem of which she stretched out and knotted over her right hip.</p><p>No shoes had been provided for them, so she went downstairs barefoot, and found Samuel pouring a pot of watery soup through a strainer into one of two clear plastic bottles.</p><p>The smell made her wrinkle her nose. \u201cYou\u2019re making soup, m\u00edo? At a time like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recommend tasting it,\u201d he said as he strained the rest of the liquid into the second bottle. Once he set the pot and the strainer aside, he screwed on the bottle tops. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlie couldn\u2019t hold back her laugh. \u201cSam, those are enema bottles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they are.\u201d He wrapped one with a cloth before he handed it to her. \u201cTuck it in your waistband behind your back. You\u2019ll have to be close to use it, but just go for the eyes.\u201d He saw her expression and smiled. \u201cI made it by boiling together onions, lemon juice, and several types of chilies. Consider it a kind of homemade pepper spray.\u201d</p><p>Now she understood why he\u2019d used enema bottles, which were made out of thin, very flexible plastic designed to administer the liquid contents with a gentle squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019re brilliant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m stupid. I should have spent last night fashioning spears and setting up pit traps.\u201d He also handed her the suture scissors. \u201cYou\u2019re an expert on where to inflict the maximum damage with these. I\u2019ll fare better with the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill him,\u201d she warned as she pocketed the scissors. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one who can tell us where we are, and how to get back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe we\u2019re somewhere off the coast of Mexico,\u201d Sam told her. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve touched thus far in the house was brought over from the mainland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ability is working again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and then.\u201d He tucked his wrapped bottle into the back of his shorts before he picked up the club. He also handed her a length of tourniquet hose. \u201cOnce I have him pinned, bind his hands with this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She looped the hose around her wrist and wove the ends in a loose knot. \u201cBut if he has a gun, we stay out of sight.\u201d When he started to argue she held up her hand. \u201cYou saw what he did on the bridge. He can take you out with one shot, and then I\u2019ll be alone with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that happens,\u201d he said flatly, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to kill him.\u201d</p><p>She had never imagined harming another person; it went against her calling to heal and everything she believed in. She had thought those beliefs had protected her, too, until that morning on the bridge. \u201cCount on it.\u201d</p><p>They left the villa and went quickly down the walkway toward the water, stopping at the edge of the sand. Samuel led her behind a cluster of sea grape bushes and crouched down there with her, parting the branches to look down at the dock.</p><p>The boat, a large ocean cruiser, lay anchored several hundred yards away from the pier. A tall man stood at the helm, and another walked along the deck railing, a rifle parked on his shoulder. Neither of them was the gunman.</p><p>\u201cHe brought friends,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWhy are they just sitting out there?\u201d</p> <p>A metallic click answered her, and Charlie felt the rounded end of a gun pressed firmly against her nape.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d a pleasant voice said in English. \u201cPut your hands on top of your head.\u201d</p><p>Charlie glanced over at Samuel, who had a rifle pressed against his back, before she slowly lifted her hands into position.</p><p>\u201cVery good. My name is Segundo, and I am in charge here. Mr. Taske, you may drop that chair leg. Very good.\u201d In Spanish, he said, \u201cTake the bottles and the scissors.\u201d</p><p>Once they had been divested of their only weapons, Segundo told them to stand up. \u201cNow, keep your hands on your head and walk down to the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was my idea,\u201d Samuel said quickly. \u201cMs. Marena had nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo polite,\u201d Segundo said in a mocking tone. \u201cStill, you\u2019re already protective of her, which is excellent. It is a pity that you didn\u2019t consider her welfare before we arrived, but I doubt it will happen again.\u201d</p><p>Without warning Samuel spun around and tried to snatch the rifle from the man behind him. A hard arm clamped around Charlie\u2019s neck as she was dragged back. A third man shot Samuel in the chest with the prongs from a Taser.</p> <p>\u201cSam.\u201d She fought wildly to free herself, until Segundo pressed a blade under her chin.</p><p>\u201cBe very still now,\u201d he told her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to slit your throat unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u201d</p><p>Even while Samuel was being jolted by the shock device, he managed to wrench the rifle out of the guard\u2019s hands. A fourth man hurried up and shot him with another Taser, and the combined jolts sent Samuel to his knees. Although he was shaking helplessly now, the guards kept pumping more electricity into him.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell them to stop,\u201d Charlie begged. \u201cWe won\u2019t try anything else. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Segundo waited another moment before he called off the guards. Samuel wavered, almost falling over before they grabbed his arms and with difficulty dragged him along the path to the beach.</p><p>\u201cDo you work for the man who brought us here?\u201d Charlie asked.</p><p>\u201cTacal?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cNo, dear girl. And you needn\u2019t worry about him; he\u2019s been dealt with and won\u2019t trouble you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are we here? What is this place?\u201d When Segundo didn\u2019t answer, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re doing, but you can\u2019t keep us. We\u2019re American citizens. We have rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt always surprises me how Americans believe they are entitled to freedom,\u201d Segundo said as he forced her to follow them. His colorless voice took on a slight foreign accent. \u201cEven when your lives depend on obedience and submission, you resist. You fight.\u201d He stopped halfway down the beach and gestured toward Samuel\u2019s sagging form. \u201cAnd then you are shocked when you\u2019re made to suffer for it.\u201d</p><p>Finally Charlie placed his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re the man who made the recordings that have been playing over the speaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have an excellent ear, Ms. Marena. I hope your tolerance for pain is equally developed.\u201d To his men he said, \u201cPare aqu\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>Samuel\u2019s head drooped as the guards forced him back down on his knees in the sand. One of them produced a bottle of water and poured the contents into Samuel\u2019s face, causing him to sputter and cough.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had enough,\u201d Charlie said as Segundo maneuvered her to stand a foot in front of Samuel. \u201cI\u2019ll take whatever punishment you had planned for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we never punish the men, dear girl.\u201d Segundo beckoned to the largest of the guards. \u201cWe just make them watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe consequences of your actions.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou and Mr. Taske did put on a convincing performance last night, but you did not, in fact, have sexual intercourse. That is a violation of the rules, for which you will now be punished.\u201d</p><p>The big guard came over and grabbed her by the throat. Charlie lifted her leg, driving the side of her foot into the guard\u2019s knee at the same time she plowed her fist into his solar plexus, jerking her arm back quickly and hooking a third punch up to deliver a crunching blow to the nose. As he howled and clutched his face, she went for one of the guards holding a rifle, only to be tripped by Segundo.</p><p>\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve taken some self-defense classes.\u201d He hauled her up from the sand and wrenched her arms behind her back, pinning them in the awkward position. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that will only make this worse for you.\u201d</p><p>Before she could get her weight balanced, a broad hand slapped her, the open palm cracking as it slammed into her cheek. Pain shot across her face, and she tasted blood.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d Samuel surged up, trying to get his feet under him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Sam.\u201d She braced herself as she looked at the guard she\u2019d punched. In Spanish she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, you coward? You afraid to fight a mere woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a fight, Ms. Marena.\u201d Segundo tightened his grip on her arms, pushing them up until Charlie thought the pressure would snap her bones. \u201cThis is simply an old-fashioned beating.\u201d</p><p>Samuel surged up, knocking the guards away from him as if they were rag dolls. \u201cTouch her again and I\u2019ll put you in the ground.\u201d</p><p>Segundo took out a pistol and pointed it at Samuel. \u201cYou were both informed of the rules, Mr. Taske.\u201d</p><p>Samuel\u2019s eyes shifted as he measured the distance between them. \u201cDo you believe you can kill me before I reach you?\u201d</p><p>Charlie caught her breath. \u201cSam, no.\u201d</p><p>Sand shot up in a fountain as a bullet struck the ground beside Samuel\u2019s right foot. Charlie looked out and saw the man on the deck of the boat pointing a rifle at them.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I won\u2019t, but the marksman on our boat will.\u201d Segundo smiled. \u201cMake no mistake, Mr. Taske. You are the expendable half of this equation. If you continue to interfere, we will remove you from it and give Ms. Marena to another partner.\u201d</p><p>Charlie met Sam\u2019s gaze. \u201cLet them do what they want.\u201d When he started to speak, she shook her head. \u201cI need you alive, m\u00edo. Don\u2019t leave me alone with them.\u201d</p><p>Samuel\u2019s big hands knotted into fists as he looked back at the boat and then at Segundo. \u201cYou\u2019d better practice looking over your shoulder, because one day I will be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, old boy, I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t. The only way either of you will ever leave this island is in dismembered pieces in a biohazard shipping container.\u201d Segundo gave him an insulting smile before he nodded to the guard with the bloody nose.</p><p>Charlie had grown up in the barrio; she knew how to take a beating. She kept her chin tucked in and hunched her body over as much as her pinned arms would allow. The guard started in on her upper body with fast jabs of his fists, pummeling her shoulders, upper arms, and ribs. Knowing any cry she made might provoke Samuel into doing something foolish, Charlie bit down on her torn lip to keep anything but air from leaving her mouth.</p><p>Her eyes blurred as he suddenly switched to hitting her in the face, bruising her cheeks and drawing blood from her mouth and nose. After a dozen punches her vision blurred and her eyes began to swell shut. Still she refused to make a sound.</p><p>Some cold, clinical part of her kept a running inventory of the contusions and lacerations being inflicted on her, and gradually she realized something: The guard was deliberately avoiding hitting her breasts, her belly, or anyplace below her waist. He was also pulling his punches to keep from breaking bones or knocking out her teeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A guttural roaring sound swelled in her ears, punctuated by a dull thud and the sound of a body hitting the ground. Through the watery slits of her eyes she saw Samuel facedown in the sand, and that was the blow she couldn\u2019t take. The cry that burst from her lips rang out as she collapsed.</p><p>Sand, blood, tears, pain; that was her new world until she heard Sam\u2019s voice calling her name.</p><p>A shadow fell across her as Segundo bent down and turned her face toward him. \u201cThe next time you or your man break the rules, Ms. Marena, I will allow three guards to spend ten minutes with you to do whatever they like. I\u2019m afraid they like many unpleasant, painful things. Mr. Taske will also be tied up and made to watch every moment of it. Please nod if you understand.\u201d</p> <p>Charlie moved her head up and down.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d He released her and straightened.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d Samuel crawled up beside her, blood streaking his face. He wrapped his arms around her and drew her into him as he looked up. \u201cShe needs a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, man\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doctor here.\u201d Segundo slid his pistol into his waistband. \u201cI suggest you take Ms. Marena up to the house and see to her wounds. The rules are still in effect, as they will be for the duration of your life on the island. You will not attempt to escape, and you have until dawn tomorrow to have sexual intercourse.\u201d He snapped his fingers, and the guards followed him up the beach.</p><p>Charlie pressed her hot, throbbing face against the coolness of Samuel\u2019s chest, and a string of wretched, horrible laughs came out of her. \u201cHave sex. Like this.\u201d The laughter became sobs.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d He held her with one arm as she wept, and gently wiped the blood and tears from her face. \u201cI have to get you up to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She forced her eyes open. \u201cWhere did they shoot you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one shot me. One of them clouted me with the end of his rifle.\u201d He reached up to touch his temple. \u201cIt\u2019s just a cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m in no shape to dig a slug out of your head.\u201d She struggled into a sitting position, moaning a little as her ribs and shoulders protested the movements. \u201cI think I can walk. With some help, maybe.\u201d</p> <p>Samuel carefully lifted her, holding her by the waist until she straightened, and then swept her up into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even bleeding now.\u201d He walked slowly across the sand with her, but when he reached the walkway he picked up the pace. \u201cHow well do you heal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakyn fast.\u201d She grimaced as she touched her lip. \u201cBy tomorrow I\u2019ll just have some bruises and scabs. Sam, those men didn\u2019t bring us here to ransom us, or to chop us up and sell our parts to GenHance. But you already know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI considered the possibilities.\u201d He looked down at her. \u201cThere\u2019s only one explanation that makes sense of this place, the rules, and some of things Segundo said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not hostages, and this isn\u2019t a prison.\u201d As much as she hurt, part of her had gone numb, just as it had that day long ago when she had crawled out of San Francisco Bay. \u201cIt\u2019s a menagerie.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>The sound of the tide mingled with birdsong as the sun rose over the bay and illuminated the row of cottages hemming the edge of the beach road. Drew Riordan\u2019s voice took on a slight rasp as he finished explaining to Agent Flores exactly why he\u2019d impersonated a federal agent and come to Mexico to find Samuel Taske and Charlotte Marena.</p> <p>Drew did hold back some details, like the exact nature of Takyn abilities, but to justify his actions he had to tell her about GenHance and why the biotech corporation was hunting them. Now that Genaro was in Mexico and had to know Drew was here, he needed Gracie\u2019s help more than ever.</p><p>As for what Gracie thought, he couldn\u2019t tell. She sat very still, wearing the perfect poker face as she listened to every word.</p><p>Once he had finished, he noticed that Gracie had turned to watch the sunrise through the back windows of the cottage. For the first time in hours Drew became aware of his surroundings. Gracie\u2019s front room, airy and spotless, all snow-white and dark blue. Everywhere he looked there was some reminder of the sea, from the watercolors of boats she had hung in long parallel rows along the walls to the sun-bleached fishing nets she had wound around her curtain rods. A curio cabinet displayed a collection of polished abalone shells: all perfect specimens. Misty hunks of sea glass occupied a beautiful bowl carved out of driftwood next to an old brass ship\u2019s compass, its needle still dutifully pointing north.</p><p>\u201cYou live here so you can be close to the water,\u201d he said as he sifted his fingers through the bits of wave-polished glass. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have guessed that about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy papi\u2014my father\u2014is a fisherman. I grew up by the sea.\u201d She sounded wistful.</p><p>\u201cYou miss your home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Sometimes I wish I could live there again. Life in the village is . . . not so complicated.\u201d Her mouth tightened. \u201cBut I can never go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you on bad terms with your folks or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapi understands what I do, and why. He only wished different for me.\u201d She forced a smile. \u201cDo your parents know about how special you are?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey found out when I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>Telling Gracie that he was the result of an illicit genetic experiment performed on him as an infant didn\u2019t bother Drew. Being made Takyn hadn\u2019t been his choice, and feeling shame over the gifts it had bestowed on him would be the same as regretting winning the lottery. But for a moment he wished he could be an ordinary guy who didn\u2019t bring along the kind of baggage that would scare the hell out of any woman.</p><p>\u201cHow did they treat you after they discovered what you were?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThey were worried, and probably a little terrified, but they definitely wanted to protect me. I guess if anything, it brought us closer together.\u201d He thought of the last conversation he\u2019d had with his mother, just before leaving Monterey. \u201cI don\u2019t get home too often, but maybe after this is over I\u2019ll have a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you are not caught, or arrested,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cOr, if this Genaro is as vicious as you say, killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything I\u2019ve told you is real, Gracie.\u201d He leaned forward, holding her gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s happening right now. I\u2019d love to walk away, especially now that I\u2019ve seen Genaro here, but I can\u2019t. If I don\u2019t find Samuel before they do, my friend will end up on a dissection table. I can\u2019t allow that.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an odd look. \u201cEven if it means sacrificing your own life for his?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I do this right, nobody dies.\u201d He grinned. \u201cUnless you still want me dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead, you would be of no use to anyone.\u201d Abruptly she stood. \u201cWe have much to do. I will make us some breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your amazing hot chocolate included?\u201d he asked as he followed her into the tiny kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIf you like.\u201d She handed him a pan and a container of milk. \u201cI will show you how to make it.\u201d</p><p>They worked side by side at her tiny stove, and while Drew stirred the hot chocolate to keep it from scalding he watched her set out eggs, black beans, chopped ham, and a small block of cheese. \u201cIs that going to be an omelet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething better.\u201d She broke four eggs into a skillet, frying them before removing them to a plate and taking a jug from the fridge. She poured yellow batter from the jug into the pan, forming a large circle, which she flipped over until it was golden brown. She scooped two of the eggs to top the pancake, and then deftly added the rest of the ingredients.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you could make a pancake into a burrito,\u201d he told her as he hunted through her cabinets for two cups.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a pancake or burrito.\u201d She transferred the contents of the pan to a plate before she started on a second serving. \u201cI\u2019m making huevos motule\u00f1os.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean \u2018Mexican Eggs Benedict\u2019 ? \u201d</p><p>She gave him a dry look. \u201cIt means eggs Motul-style.\u201d</p><p>As Gracie finished cooking, Drew set the little kitchen table and filled their cups with the hot chocolate. She brought the plates over and sat down beside him.</p><p>Drew breathed in the tantalizing aroma rising from the plate. \u201cOh, God. I\u2019m never going to be able to eat Taco Bell again, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d she advised him.</p><p>From the first bite of the spicy, eggy concoction, Drew fell in love, and wolfed down his portion at starving-man speed.</p><p>\u201cWe should go to my village,\u201d Gracie said unexpectedly. \u201cIt\u2019s not far from the city, and my father has a good boat. There is an English scientist who lives on a small island near the zone. He was given permission to put cameras in the protected areas to record the island birds that he studies. If your friends are hiding there, he may have seen them land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to him,\u201d he said, \u201cbut what about your job here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am due some leave time.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem concerned.</p><p>When he noticed Gracie only picking at her meal he put down his fork. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re dieting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very hungry. I should change and pack some things for the journey. Here.\u201d She pushed her plate toward him and got up to walk out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cGracie.\u201d As she stopped, Drew saw how she kept her back toward him, and the rigid set of her shoulders. As much as he needed her, he had disrupted her life and put her in an impossible situation. He had to give her an out. \u201cIf you\u2019re having second thoughts, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll take off on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said this Jonah Genaro, he will do anything to catch you and kill you,\u201d she said. \u201cMy duty is to preserve life.\u201d</p><p>Drew frowned. \u201cGracie, you don\u2019t have to do anything. I\u2019m not your responsibility.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glanced back at him, her expression unreadable. \u201cYou are now, Andrew.\u201d</p><p>Knowing Charlotte would not suffer through days of pain as an ordinary human would provided little consolation for Samuel. By the time he carried her up to the treatment room, her bruises had appeared, and many of the dark, angry splotches shaped themselves into blurry copies of the guard\u2019s fingers, palms, and knuckles. Both of her eyes had been blackened, and her eyelids had swelled together, effectively blinding her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t waste time fumbling about with the medical supplies. Once he set her down gently on the table, he said, \u201cTell me what to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can start by getting out the scissors I have in the side pocket of my bag and cutting off this shirt.\u201d She held out her arms. \u201cStart at the shoulder seams, then go straight down the middle.\u201d</p><p>Samuel found the scissors and carefully snipped through the fabric as she had instructed. It fell away from her in pieces, revealing so much bruising on both sides of her abdomen Samuel caught his breath.</p><p>\u201cI know how bad it looks,\u201d she said, wincing as she felt along both sides. \u201cNothing\u2019s broken, though. Are there any tears in my skin or bulges under it?\u201d</p><p>He circled around her. \u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She extended her arms, turning her wrists and then flexing her elbows. \u201cHe got me a few times with his fingernails. Do you see the scratches?\u201d</p> <p>He was already counting them. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet some gauze pads and the big brown bottle on the second shelf in the corner cabinet.\u201d When he brought them over, she felt the shape of the bottle and nodded. \u201cWet the pads with this and use them to scrub out the scratches.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to throw the bottle across the room, and had to force back his anger as he opened it. \u201cHow do you do this every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis? This is nothing, m\u00edo. Imagine finding a fifteen-year-old girl sitting in a puddle of her own blood after her boyfriend slices her open. While you\u2019re working on her, you have to listen to her beg you not to call the police. Her intestines are spilling into her lap, and forget the ER; you know she\u2019s going to bleed out before you can get her into the rig. You listen to her cry, not for herself, but for him. Because, of course, he loves her, and he didn\u2019t mean to do it.\u201d Her head drooped. \u201cAfter your shift is over, you go to the gym and punch a bag until you can\u2019t feel your hands anymore. Or you find a bar and get drunk, or you pick up a stranger. Or you go to church and get on your knees and pray to the Holy Mother to give you the strength to go back to work the next day.\u201d</p><p>He tucked some loose hair back behind her ear. \u201cSomehow I can\u2019t see you going to a bar or a gym.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like church.\u201d She sounded defensive. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet. Peaceful. People don\u2019t go there to hurt each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably why they call it a sanctuary, honey.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cNow let me finish these scratches.\u201d</p><p>Once he cleaned the last of the scrapes on her arms, Charlotte was able to open her eyes enough to view his handiwork. \u201cVery good. That leaves my face, which must look like a Halloween mask.\u201d Gingerly she began palpating her chin, cheeks, and eyelids. \u201cFeels like two black eyes, a swollen nose, a fat lip, and ear-to-ear bruises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sums it up.\u201d He pulled her hand away from her face. \u201cYou\u2019re sure nothing is broken?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth and closed it, and then felt the sides of her face. \u201cHe came close with that last punch, but no, everything still works. You just need to wash off the blood and make up a cold compress for my eyes and nose.\u201d</p><p>There was still sand mixed with the blood in her hair, he realized, from when she had fallen on the beach. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d He picked her up in his arms. \u201cLet\u2019s take a bath first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just want to see the rest of me naked,\u201d she chided.</p><p>\u201cConsider it fair play. After all, you\u2019ve seen me in all my glory, such as it is.\u201d He walked down the hall to the master suite and took her into the adjoining bathroom. Once he set her on her feet, he turned on the shower and adjusted the temperature to lukewarm before removing her shorts and stripping out of his own clothes.</p><p>After he guided her into the stall, which was just big enough for both of them, he turned her back toward the spray. \u201cI\u2019ll wash out your hair first, and then your face.\u201d</p> <p>Samuel shifted to one side to draw her hair back, and saw how rigidly she was holding herself. \u201cIs the water too cold?\u201d He glanced down at the dark pink\u2013tinted streams emptying into the drain. \u201cOr too warm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t the water.\u201d She reached out and groped for his chest, bracing her hand against it. \u201cHow did they know what we planned to do?\u201d</p><p>He had hoped to hold off this conversation until Charlotte had rested and healed a little more. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey knew everything. They found us as if they already knew exactly where we would be,\u201d she countered. \u201cThey even knew in which pocket I had put the scissors. Sam, the cameras aren\u2019t the only things watching us.\u201d</p><p>He had his own suspicions, but he didn\u2019t want to alarm her. \u201cPerhaps it was the man by the deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he\u2019s like us? Like me?\u201d She tapped her temple. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way they could know what we didn\u2019t do in the hot tub.\u201d</p><p>He heard the fear and anger in her voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be concerned about this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d She turned her face into the spray, rinsing off the blood to reveal her battered features. \u201cTake a good look at me, Sam. Just one of them did this. Tomorrow it will be three. Do you know how much damage can be done to the human body in thirty minutes? I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, listen to me.\u201d He put his hands on her waist. \u201cWe\u2019re not spending the rest of our lives on this island. We are going to escape, and we are going home. But for now, the simplest solution\u2014the safest one\u2014is to take the path of least resistance.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slumped. \u201cYou mean we follow the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her forehead against his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, isn\u2019t it? How hard this is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been some time since I\u2019ve had the pleasure,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut it\u2019s not something one forgets how to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re handsome, and any woman would want you, but that isn\u2019t making it easier for me.\u201d She looked down at the tiles. \u201cI feel like doing this will break my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not zoo animals.\u201d He bent down and touched his mouth to the corner of hers. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to have sex, Charlotte. We\u2019re going to be lovers, and that is no small thing for either of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sounded bitter. \u201cMen like you don\u2019t take women like me as lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen like me . . .\u201d He trailed off as the bruise beside her mouth lightened from reddish purple to a yellowish brown and then faded away altogether. \u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the bruises on your face just disappeared.\u201d He brought her fingers up to the spot. \u201cRight here, where I kissed you. Just how quickly do you heal?\u201d</p><p>She tested the skin. \u201cNot this fast. Do it again.\u201d When he put his mouth to the same spot, she turned her face so that his lips trailed across her swollen cheek. \u201cTell me what you see.\u201d</p><p>Samuel watched the swelling sink down and the bruising fade everywhere his mouth had touched. This time he felt the surge in his blood: a kind of effervescent thrill that bewildered him. \u201cYou\u2019re healing in seconds. How are you doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201d Her hand moved across the surface of her cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from you. You kissed me and made it better. How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He touched her face again. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to do anything like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said your ability was fading. Maybe something else is happening to it.\u201d She lifted her face. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips to one swollen eye and then the other, drawing back to watch as the purplish skin around them cleared and her eyelids returned to normal size. As her eyelashes parted and she gave him an astonished look, he saw splotches of blood that had hemorrhaged beneath her corneas seep away and vanish.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling any pain when I do that?\u201d He still couldn\u2019t accept what he was seeing with his own eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt. It feels only . . . warm.\u201d Her gaze shifted as she looked up. \u201cSam, the cut on your head is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He seized her hand and almost dragged her out into the bedroom, where he brought her to the bed. \u201cLie down on your back.\u201d When she did he knelt beside her, and felt her immediately tense. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to rush you into sex. There may be limits to this new ability, and I want to heal you everywhere you\u2019re hurt while I\u2019m still able to use it. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you, m\u00edo,\u201d she said. \u201cJust stop if you feel strange or weak.\u201d</p><p>Samuel brought her bruised knuckles to his lips, kissing each one before turning her hands over and brushing his mouth over the cuts her fingernails had made in her palms. Her hands went from battered to unmarked in less than a minute.</p><p>The first scratch he kissed, a thin but ugly gouge across the inside of her wrist, seemed to pull in on itself and submerge into her flesh. Hairline pink scars took their place, flattening and turning white before they, too, slowly erased themselves.</p><p>Charlotte held still as he worked his way up one arm and across her shoulder, but when he reached the bruises on her throat, she took a sharp breath.</p><p>Instantly he lifted his head. \u201cDid that hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d She caught her bottom lip between her teeth for a moment. \u201cKeep going.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t touch her. \u201cYou are feeling something that you\u2019re not telling me.\u201d He glanced down and saw the tight pucker of her nipples, surrounded by a distinctive flush. \u201cCharlotte.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just warm.\u201d She crossed her arms over her bare breasts. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is making me hot. Understand?\u201d</p><p>He bent down and kissed her bottom lip. \u201cShould I stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do, m\u00edo,\u201d she said, her voice wry, \u201cthen I will be rushing you into sex.\u201d</p> <p>He turned his head to put his tongue to her palm, and felt a dark satisfaction when she shivered. \u201cHold that thought for a little longer, honey.\u201d</p><p>Samuel turned her head to one side to have a better look at the uneven ring of contusions left by the guard\u2019s brutal hand. As he stroked his fingertips over them, they seemed to come apart, ugly beads falling from a broken necklace. He deliberately cupped her throat with his hand, and when he lifted his palm the bruises were gone.</p><p>\u201cIt seems I don\u2019t have to kiss you to make it better.\u201d He studied his hand. \u201cTouching works just as well.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte looked up at him. \u201cCan you do both?\u201d</p><p>Her question made him go still. \u201cThat might not be wise.\u201d</p> <p>Charlie knew healing wasn\u2019t supposed to be an erotic experience. She\u2019d monitored enough patients to know that at best it was a tedious, pain-racked process. While she didn\u2019t understand how Sam had acquired an ability that bypassed all that, or why, she wanted more. In fact, she wanted everything she could get, and since they\u2019d agreed to become lovers, he should have been happy to give it to her.</p><p>Unless he\u2019s been lying.</p><p>He\u2019d told her that he found her attractive, and yet now, when she asked for more, it had turned him off. Since they were both naked on a bed with nothing between them but a towel, it had to be something he was feeling, something she wouldn\u2019t be able to know for sure until after sunset.</p><p>Samuel was an educated, courteous man with exquisite manners. However he felt, he\u2019d never insult her. And what had he called it, having sex with her?</p><p>The path of least resistance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you want. That\u2019s all you have to say.\u201d Charlotte sat up and reached for the sheet to cover herself. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a break now, and later\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He yanked the sheet away from her, and was on top of her so fast she didn\u2019t have time to inhale.</p><p>\u201cNo breaks, Charlotte,\u201d he said in a low, rough tone she\u2019d never before heard him use. \u201cWe have to finish this right now.\u201d He lowered his voice and his head, murmuring the rest against her ear. \u201cBecause the moment you\u2019re better, my beautiful darling, the very second you\u2019ll have me, I\u2019m going to put myself inside you, and make love to you, and not stop until we\u2019re both too tired to move. That is what I want.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she liked him this way: so hungry for her that he forgot his pretty manners. He was gripping her wrists, so she nudged him with her shoulder until he lifted his head. She saw the frustration in his eyes, and recalled something he\u2019d mentioned earlier. \u201cHow long has it been for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThen you should get a move on, m\u00edo.\u201d</p><p>His hand held her face as he covered her mouth with his, taking away the soreness and rawness as he healed the split in her bottom lip. From there he followed the curve of her lip and then the line of her jaw, soothing away the soreness and creating a deeper, more immediate ache.</p><p>There was so much of him to touch and explore that Charlie couldn\u2019t wait for him to finish. As soon as he let go of her wrists she had her hands in his hair. It looked baby-soft but felt thick and heavy, a snare for her fingers. Each strand caught the light and held it captive, glittering like something spun by an enchanted fairy-tale creature.</p><p>He rubbed his head against her hand, a low sound rumbling from his chest as she worked her fingertips against his scalp. \u201cThat feels good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d Charlie admired his eyes. The amber lashes framing them didn\u2019t curl, but spiked down over the darkness of his irises. This close she could see tiny starbursts around his pupils, so pale a silver they could be easily mistaken for reflected lights. \u201cFinished yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost.\u201d He bent his head to her shoulder, first kissing away the pain and then following the curve up to her neck with the velvet stroke of his tongue.</p><p>Charlie worked her hands down his broad back, finding the edge of the towel he\u2019d tucked around his hips and loosening it until she could tug it away. The last barrier gone, she pulled him over on top of her, arching up into him, wanting to feel him everywhere, from the wide vault of his chest rubbing against her aching breasts to the sculpted columns of his legs gliding against the tense muscles all along her thighs and calves.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d He pushed his fingers under her, lifting her bottom as he settled himself between her thighs. His hands were shaking now, and as soon as the rigid shaft of his penis touched her, he felt the liquid heat of her arousal and groaned. \u201cI was going to try to take this slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been years, right?\u201d Was she breathless, digging her nails into his shoulders, and twisting under him like a shameless, greedy thing? It seemed she was. \u201cTry slow next week.\u201d</p><p>Samuel lifted her again, reaching down between their bodies to position himself before tightening his buttocks. As she felt the delicious press of his cock head parting her folds, she braced her heels and moved with him, welcoming that first slow breach and the steady penetration that followed. He filled her until the stretching ache made her gasp, and then held himself inside her, his jaw tight and his breath warm on her lips.</p><p>He was asking her something, and she was so absorbed by the way they had melded together that she\u2019d gone deaf. She looped an arm around his strong neck, bringing his mouth across that last inch separating their faces and nipping his bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cNext week,\u201d he muttered, gathering her up as he answered her gentle bite with a hungry, soul-wrenching kiss.</p><p>Samuel\u2019s hips recoiled, and she clenched against the drag of his steady withdrawal, aching to hold on and savor the thrill of being completed by his flesh in hers. Last night she\u2019d climaxed rubbing against him and only imagining how it would feel; now she knew and it was so much more, the incredible heat and power of him rolling through her as he stroked back in. And how amazing it felt, the taking and giving, the softness of her sex swelling around him as he worked his shaft deeper, the muscles of his back knotting and growing slick with sweat under her hands.</p><p>Charlie had her hands in his hair again when he took his lips from hers, and bowed her back, offering her breast. As he sucked at her he pushed in hard and fast, startling a cry from her; he added to the torment by cupping the flushed globe and kneading it in time to the tugging pull of his mouth. She bucked beneath him, shocked soundless by the sudden explosion of her orgasm, and then he was taking her like a wild man, driving into her as she shuddered and refusing to let her come down, his fingers gliding down over her belly to work her clit as he brought her over again.</p><p>The room spun and time blurred as she came a third time, his name spilling from her lips as she shuddered under him, and Samuel\u2019s big frame shook, but instead of coming he tried to draw out of her completely.</p><p>Instinctively Charlie knew what he meant to do. \u201cNo.\u201d She clamped her legs around him, pushing herself against him. \u201cI need all of you.\u201d</p><p>That sent Samuel into a frenzy, and he clamped his hands on her buttocks, jerking her up and holding her there as he gave her the last hard, uneven strokes before he went deep and stilled. She felt his semen pulsing and spreading inside her body, warm and thick, and curled her arms around his shoulders to hold him as he buried his face in her hair.</p><p>They lay like that until Samuel murmured something and rolled onto his side, still keeping her pressed against him. Sweat streaked the sides of his face, and as she smoothed back his hair he trailed a line of kisses over her brow.</p><p>\u201cI know why you grow your hair long.\u201d She made rings of it around her fingers. \u201cCutting it makes your barber feel like a butcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFindley trims it for me every morning,\u201d he told her as he rolled onto his side to run his hand down her arm. \u201cIt grows very fast, sometimes as much as twelve inches in a day. So does my beard.\u201d He frowned as he touched his jaw, over which dark gold stubble was just beginning to show. \u201cAt least, it did before we were brought here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beard was interesting, m\u00edo, but I like you better without it.\u201d A strange tenderness welled inside her as she rested a hand on his hip. \u201cSo what do you think of all this?\u201d</p><p>He propped himself up on one elbow. \u201cTrying slow actually may have to wait until next month. Possibly Christmas. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to sleep with more cripples.\u201d She laughed as he scowled and tickled her. \u201cAll right, ex-cripples.\u201d</p><p>Samuel bent his head to hers, and Charlie\u2019s gaze wandered, coming to an abrupt stop at the glint of a lens. Like all the others in the room, it was aimed directly at the bed.</p><p>They\u2019d forgotten about the cameras.</p><p>As she closed her eyes to enjoy Samuel\u2019s kiss, Charlie lifted her hand from the back of his neck and extended her middle finger.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>In the kitchen of her home, Tlemi set out what she would prepare for their midday meal: mangoes, smoked fish, and some of the herbed flatbread Xochi had learned how to bake. After watching the Americans she had no appetite, but if she didn\u2019t feed Colotl, he would forget to eat, as he did so often now.</p><p>This place was making them all sick, not in body, but in spirit.</p><p>Living on the island had once made Tlemi feel as if she had come to paradise. Before they had been brought here, all they had ever known had been the darkness of the master\u2019s domain. Tlemi\u2019s oldest memories were of long, moonlit nights playing with Colotl and the other children in the gardens while the abuelas had tended the flowers or gathered fruit under the braziers. When the roosters crowed they were brought inside and sent to sleep in the cool, dark rooms in the lower levels.</p><p>As she began slicing the mango, Tlemi remembered the delighted laughter that had spilled from her lips when she and Colotl had risen from their bed to watch their first sunrise on the island. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In those early days after the master had sent them to live apart from him, they had been like little children again, running and playing and laughing with delight over each new discovery. It frightened some of the other women, but Tlemi felt she had been given all the gifts she could ever want: a beautiful home, good friends, and being Colotl\u2019s woman. Even the price she had to pay for their new home had not weighed on her, not at first.</p><p>That had been a precious time, one that had ended brutally when the master had sent Segundo to them to explain their duties, and Mocaya had been found out.</p><p>The steward had come with his brutes and a man they had never seen before, a doctor from America. As soon as it was Mocaya\u2019s turn to go to the seventh house and be examined, she had tried to flee. The men had run her down like a dog and dragged her back, and then the doctor sedated her, making her unable to keep her body changed as it was. That was when the secret she had been hiding had been revealed: she had been born with the body not of a woman, but of a man.</p> <p>What Tlemi remembered most about that terrible day was how Segundo had smiled, just before he shot Mocaya in the head. He offered the same smile a week later when he brought Pici to Ihiyo.</p><p>Pici had cringed as Ihiyo exploded with rage, and then Segundo had pistol-whipped him into silence. As Ihiyo bled on the sands, the master\u2019s steward had leaned over him and advised him to close his eyes while he did his duty.</p><p>Fortunately Pici was a petite, helpless girl who cried easily, and had appealed to something in Ihiyo. Or perhaps Ihiyo wanted to live more than he wanted to be with another man. Tlemi knew he didn\u2019t close his eyes when he was with Pici, but every night, after she fell asleep, he wept for Mocaya.</p><p>Like many things she knew about their friends, Tlemi had never revealed it to them. Not even to Colotl, who had been Ihiyo\u2019s friend since they were boys. He would have understood, but he already blamed himself for not knowing Ihiyo and Mocaya\u2019s secret. It was why he had been so stubborn about the Americans.</p><p>\u201cTlemi?\u201d</p> <p>She looked over to see Colotl watching her from the doorway.</p><p>His long moonlight hair and silver eyes always seemed to glow against his brown skin, which was as dark as hers was pale. He had taken off his shirt and hung it around his neck, and from the sand still clinging to his ankles she knew he had been walking along his lines, not to check them but to think.</p><p>\u201cYou are back early.\u201d Then, because she knew exactly why he had come to speak to her, she added, \u201cHe has seen to her.\u201d</p><p>Some of the tension around his mouth eased. \u201cDid she fight him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, picking up the knife to finish slicing the mango. Knowing their lives depended on it, she had agreed to watch the Americans, but what she had witnessed troubled her. They were all well aware of why the master had sent them here, and if he discovered what the big man could do . . .</p><p>\u201cCan you bring that down to the beach?\u201d Colotl asked. \u201cI need to check my lines.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. Once he left, she took out a basket, placing the fruit and smoked fish in smaller containers before adding them and two of the colorful napkins Delores had embroidered.</p><p>Colotl met her on the pathway outside, taking the basket from her and lifting the lid. His eyes narrowed as soon as he saw the red napkins covered with intricate designs in black thread. \u201cIt looks very good. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it will please you.\u201d She patted his shoulder twice before walking with him to the sand. Along the way she felt the air around them go completely still, although the trees overhead still swayed gently in the breeze.</p><p>A small crab scuttled toward her toes, his front claws snapping, only to encounter something that knocked him onto his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Colotl asked as soon as the barrier was in place.</p><p>\u201cThe American man.\u201d She shook out the big coverlet and placed it on the sand. \u201cHe has changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like Mocaya,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cHis gift has changed. He healed the woman\u2019s injuries.\u201d</p> <p>Colotl stopped by one of the poles he had driven into the sand and knelt down, making a pretense of testing the fishing line knotted to it. Without looking at her, he muttered, \u201cDid he use his blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he used kisses and touching. It is the gift, not the master\u2019s curse. He lives. He walks in the sunlight. He will not turn.\u201d Tlemi felt impatient. \u201cYou have to call the others together and tell them what he is.\u201d</p><p>His expression turned impassive. \u201cWhy would I do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColotl, please.\u201d She dropped down beside him. \u201cWith the gifts he has been given, the American could help us.\u201d</p><p>He made a bitter sound. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is still like us.\u201d When he gave her a narrow look, she sighed. \u201cIf the master had brought him into his domain, he would be our brother. What does it matter now, anyway? Here we are no different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo different? We don\u2019t even speak the same language.\u201d He stood and began reeling in the line. As it emerged from the surf, fish caught on the hooks knotted to it began flopping.</p><p>Tlemi knew exactly how they felt.</p><p>\u201cPici\u2019s time is coming. Soon,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cShe is too small and weak. You know what will happen if she dies. They will just bring another woman, and this time I think Ihiyo will go mad. Colotl.\u201d His silence made her sit down on the sand and stare at the water. \u201cVery well. Who will dig the grave for her? You, or me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d he demanded, taking her by the shoulders and dragging her to her feet. \u201cKill you to save them? I don\u2019t know them. You are the other half of my soul. I can\u2019t live without you. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much time do you think we have left together?\u201d She picked up a piece of seaweed and idly wound it around her wrist. \u201cOne season? Two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She eyed him. \u201cThe master will not wait forever.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing at first, and then his mouth flattened. \u201cIf it comes to that, we will give him what he wants.\u201d</p><p>Tlemi had been taught to be obedient. She loved Colotl, and she deferred to his judgment in all things. Except this. \u201cNo. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it is easy for me to say?\u201d he demanded. \u201cTo even think? But if I have to choose\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Segundo will have to bring you another woman,\u201d she promised him, \u201cbecause on that day I will go into the water, and I will swim out to where it is dark, and I will not come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTlemi.\u201d His voice broke on her name. \u201cI cannot lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never do it,\u201d she said simply. \u201cNot for him, and not for you. But you know your duty, Colotl. Tie me up. Lock me away. I still have fingernails, and teeth. My veins are not so deep.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand as if to strike her, but Tlemi didn\u2019t flinch. In all their years together, Colotl had never once touched her in anger.</p><p>His hand moved slower than it should have, not to slap her face but to caress her cheek. \u201cIf you go into the dark water, so do I.\u201d</p><p>All of the fight poured out of her as sobs tore at her throat. \u201cColotl. Please. This could be our only chance to live. To be free.\u201d</p><p>He hauled her into his arms and held her as she wept. When Tlemi had no more tears, he used his shirt to dry her face.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot do this without the others,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI will speak to them about the American tomorrow. If they refuse\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tlemi thought of Pici\u2019s desperate eyes. \u201cThey will not.\u201d</p><p>As Samuel brought the tray into the master suite, Charlotte rolled onto her side and looked at him. Although she smiled, her eyes were once more guarded and watchful.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering where you were.\u201d She glanced at the fruit salads he\u2019d prepared. \u201cDinner in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the patio, I think,\u201d he said, scooping up her robe and handing it to her.</p><p>She muffled a yawn with the backs of her fingers. \u201cYou want to watch the sunset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot especially.\u201d He waited for her to rise before walking outside with her. \u201cBut if you stayed in bed, we probably wouldn\u2019t be dining until well after midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr dawn.\u201d She sat on the edge of one lounge and tightened the robe\u2019s belt around her waist. \u201cAre you a vegetarian?\u201d</p><p>He sat across from her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d She accepted the plate he offered and picked up a slice of mango. \u201cYou did notice that there\u2019s no protein in our convenient little pantry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m planning to do a little fishing in the morning.\u201d He set his plate aside to watch her eat, which she did with delicate greed. She also kept her gaze averted from his face, which made him wonder what was going on in her head. \u201cAre you having any second thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d She bit into a strawberry and licked the red juice from her lips. \u201cWe\u2019re consenting adults, we agreed on this together, and having sex with you will save me a lot of pain and suffering. It\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>He wondered whether she would feel the same in nine months. \u201cWhatever happens here, Charlotte, I want you to know that when we return to the States, I\u2019ll look after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s decent of you, m\u00edo, but I take care of myself.\u201d She stood. \u201cWe should look around outside for the source of the electricity. They may have some tools or other things stored in a utility building that we can use.\u201d She went back inside.</p><p>To give her some time for herself, Samuel ate and watched the sunset. He didn\u2019t want to think about the possibility of pregnancy, much less discuss it out loud, but he couldn\u2019t keep the speculation out of his head. They would be having sex at least once a day, and he had yet to find any form of protection they could use. If Charlotte had been on the pill for birth control, she no longer had access to it. That meant they could conceive a child together in as little time as a few weeks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Charlotte emerged, dressed in two sarongs she had folded and fashioned into an impromptu halter dress. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d Her smile was a masterpiece of irony as she took his hand in hers. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d As she spoke, she used one fingertip to trace three letters on his palm: I, U, and D. \u201cWe\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>The relief he\u2019d expected didn\u2019t come over him; instead he felt a moment of stunning disappointment before he cleared his thoughts. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want this, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with you and the sex for the duration.\u201d She gestured around them. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here. I\u2019m useless here.\u201d</p><p>He realized she was referring to their isolation. \u201cIs it so different from being back in the States?\u201d When her expression became incredulous, he added, \u201cYou told me once in chat that you hardly ever use your ability, although you never mentioned why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside from it being a complete violation of someone else\u2019s privacy,\u201d she countered, \u201cit\u2019s too painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing your ability hurts them?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a bitter smile. \u201cOh, they don\u2019t even know I\u2019m in their heads, m\u00edo. It does a number on me. When I listen in, I not only hear everything someone thinks, but I feel what they feel. If they\u2019re pissed off and I\u2019m tapped in, I\u2019m flooded with their rage.

If they\u2019re in pain, I suffer, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a price, isn\u2019t there?\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt must be terribly unpleasant for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnpleasant?\u201d Her cheeks darkened and her eyes flashed. \u201cDo you know how many times ordinary people think about things like punching out their spouse, stabbing their boss in the chest, or ramming their car into the back of someone who cuts them off? Or how it feels to have the same urges pouring into you?\u201d Before he could answer her, she waved a hand at him. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t. People like you never have to deal with the real world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He understood her anger, but not her contempt. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018people like you\u2019 ? \u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople with limos and chauffeurs and no-limit credit cards,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t have to work, or worry about the bills, or live paycheck to paycheck. I figured you were pretty comfortable from some of the things you told me online, but you\u2019ve got a lot more than that, don\u2019t you? How much are you worth, Sam? Do you even know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the moment I might as well be penniless,\u201d he countered, \u201cand you\u2019d be surprised to know what I\u2019ve dealt with, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making me feel guilty,\u201d she snapped. \u201cNot after the way you\u2019ve been stringing me along all this time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStringing you along?\u201d Now he was completely lost.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you think it was hilarious when I told you how you could save money by making your own tortillas?\u201d Her upper lip curled. \u201cWhat do you really do when you\u2019re hungry? Ring a bell? Have some maid bring you a gourmet meal on a silver tray with cloth napkins and a rose in a crystal vase? Before we were dumped here, you probably never stepped one foot in a kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have someone who cooks for me,\u201d he informed her gravely. \u201cLately he\u2019s also had to bring my meals to me on a tray, but not because I choose to eat in bed. Until this morning, I\u2019ve been so weak that when I wake I can\u2019t sit up without a shot of morphine and two men to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right; you\u2019re a cripple.\u201d She looked him over. \u201cFor some reason I keep forgetting that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it difficult to grasp as well,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut you saw me on the bridge. Did I look as if I could run the hundred in five flat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you were bleeding from an open wound. Something else you forgot to mention.\u201d She rubbed her temples as if her head ached. \u201cBesides, whatever pain you were in was nothing compared to your driver\u2019s. That guy was in agony, but even then all he could think of was protecting some woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read James\u2019s mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked up his thoughts when we got to the scene,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so bad I nearly passed out.\u201d</p> <p>A shrewd look came into his eyes. \u201cYou can read someone\u2019s mind even when they\u2019re unconscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do dreams or the subconscious,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me to read anyone, they have to be awake and alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d His mouth hitched. \u201cJames was shot before you arrived. I\u2019m afraid he never regained consciousness.\u201d</p><p>It took her a moment to put it together. \u201cThat was you?\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cWhen the sniper opened fire on us, I had to drag James out of the car. At the time I was in no condition to do so.\u201d</p><p>She drew back, visibly appalled. \u201cThat didn\u2019t come from your wound. What made you feel that kind of pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Sam, tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy back,\u201d he said reluctantly. \u201cOne side effect of my ability has been causing damage to my spine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that should have healed.\u201d</p><p>All of the Takyn had accelerated immune systems that allowed them to recover from injury many times faster than ordinary human beings\u2014all but Samuel.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger, it did,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you why, but as I\u2019ve aged my ability to heal like you and the others has been compromised. For some time now my health and mobility have been steadily declining. Last summer my doctors told me that the damage had begun to accelerate.\u201d</p><p>Her voice went low and husky. \u201cHow long did they give you to live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve months.\u201d</p><p>New anger flared in her eyes. \u201cWhat the hell were you doing on that bridge? If you were in that much pain, you should have been in a hospital.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to hear about the gift of his foresight, not yet. \u201cI received information from an anonymous source that one of the Takyn named Charlie would be killed on the bridge that morning. I couldn\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d When she started to speak he shook his head. \u201cIt was supposed to be my final act of courage.\u201d He thought of Lilah, and the utter stupidity with which he had behaved toward her, for which he could never atone. \u201cOr perhaps one last attempt at redemption.\u201d</p><p>She looked sick. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell me your condition was that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing you could have done. I\u2019ve investigated and tried every possible treatment; even one I should never have considered,\u201d he admitted. \u201cNothing slowed the deterioration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who healed you? And don\u2019t tell me you did it yourself,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen I woke up last night you\u2019d almost bled out. I nearly lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who to thank\u2014or blame\u2014for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can run some blood tests later.\u201d She glanced through the window and quickly released his hand. \u201cWe should go before we lose the last of the light.\u201d</p><p>Samuel helped her collect the plates, carrying them downstairs to the kitchen. After he put them in the disposal bin under the sink, the lid closed with a snap and he heard the sound of suction. When the sound stopped, he lifted the lid and saw that the bin had been emptied.</p><p>\u201cIt seems we won\u2019t have to argue over who takes out the trash.\u201d He inspected the interior of the bin before he looked through the window over the sink, but saw nothing outside. The previous day he\u2019d also noticed no cables or wires leading to the house. \u201cThey must have buried everything under the soil when they were building the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would protect against storm damage.\u201d She removed two candles from a drawer and turned on the stove, lighting the wicks in the gas flame. She sniffed, and then bent over and blew out the flame but left the dial on. \u201cI have a gas stove at home. It doesn\u2019t smell like this.\u201d</p><p>Samuel went over and breathed in. \u201cThis isn\u2019t commercial-grade methane.\u201d He switched off the dial and looked again at the bin, this time crouching and thrusting his hand inside before he found the lid latch and pushed it down. Powerful suction yanked at his arm before he released the latch to shut it off. \u201cThe land surrounding the house elevates in the back, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I could see. There\u2019s a lot of landscaping back there.\u201d She peered up at him. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never cared for our dependency on foreign oil, so over the years I\u2019ve invested in a number of ventures researching and inventing alternative fuel sources. Solar, wind, and water.\u201d He stood up. \u201cAnd garbage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to see the generator to be sure, but I think I know what they\u2019re using for power.\u201d He checked the window again. \u201cWe\u2019re almost out of light. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte followed him from the house to the back, where the land rose in a gentle slope toward tiers of shrubs and small trees. Samuel went first, pushing his way through the stiff branches of the sea grapes and squeezing through the narrow gaps between palmettos, holding back as much as he could for Charlotte.</p><p>When they reached the top of the slope, he saw sharp-edged saw grass that appeared to have been heaped together atop a long, narrow mound. Beneath his feet he felt a faint vibration that told him he was in the right place.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he told her, before he waded into the grass, keeping his pace slow and holding his arms up over the thorny blades. In the center of the mound he found a depression, and when he pulled away the grass he uncovered a heavy door made out of teak with a combination lock on the latch.</p><p>He placed his hand on the lock, closing his eyes as he coaxed his flagging ability to show him the last combination used. Once he had the numbers, he also knew enough about the structure to support his theory, but opened it anyway.</p><p>A huge wave of sound blasted out, startling birds out of the trees overhead. Samuel squinted as a light inside snapped on, illuminating two enormous machines painted bright orange. Only one of the pair was running, but the sounds it made confirmed Samuel\u2019s suspicions. Both machines were powerful, gas-driven industrial generators, known in the States as \u201cthunder pumpkins\u201d for their appearance and distinctive roar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A hand covered with bleeding scratches pushed the door closed, and he turned to find Charlotte beside him. \u201cI told you to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI yelled, but you couldn\u2019t hear me over all the noise.\u201d She pointed toward the house. \u201cOur Peeping Tom is back.\u201d</p><p>Samuel swept her off her feet and carried her through the saw grass back to safer ground, and then scanned the area. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe went inside the house.\u201d She caught his wrist. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t walk right in there for kicks. Maybe he wants to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sun has set.\u201d He eyed the dark windows. \u201cYou still can\u2019t read his thoughts now?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s some kind of phantom.\u201d</p><p>Samuel didn\u2019t believe in ghosts. \u201cThen it\u2019s time we find out why he\u2019s haunting us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p> <p>Cold water flooding over his face hurtled Jonah Genaro back to consciousness.</p><p>\u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>The boot that collided with his ribs was neither vicious nor merciful; its owner used just enough force to inflict the maximum amount of pain without causing serious injury. Genaro felt no surprise when he looked up to see rusting bars and the bored features of the uniformed prison guard.</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d the guard repeated. \u201cEl jefe wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>Genaro made a personal inventory as he stood; they\u2019d taken his shoes, socks, belt, tie, and jacket. He\u2019d also been stripped and re-dressed; his shirt remained crookedly buttoned. The air in the cell stank of old urine and despair; graffiti that ran the gamut from pathetic to obscene littered the cracked paint covering the cinder-block walls.</p><p>The last thing he remembered was drinking some water while he waited for Energ\u00fameno in his dining room. Whatever drug they had used, it had been completely tasteless.</p> <p>The guard kept one eye on him as he unlocked the cell door, and then stepped back to make a terse gesture for Genaro to go out first. He walked over the filthy concrete floor into the outside corridor. Wherever he was, it was a popular dumping ground; at least ten men occupied each of the other cells, all of which had been built to comfortably accommodate only two.</p><p>Every eye watched them as they walked down the corridor; not one of the inmates uttered a sound.</p><p>The guard escorted him through a maze of cell corridors, holding areas, and guard stations, using different keys to gain access whenever they came to another barrier. On his hip he wore a truncheon that needed cleaning and a .38 automatic in an old leather holster; the outlines of a backup clip bulged in his pocket.</p><p>The guard knocked on a door that had been painted more recently than the fifties, and waited until a voice called out something in Spanish. He opened the door and gave Genaro a push inside.</p><p>The office contained all the cheap trappings of desperate self-importance: framed official-looking documents and photos of minor politicians smiling stiffly at the cameras, their hands clasped in the big-knuckled grip of a pudgy, balding man in an ill-fitted suit. The Mexican flag stood proudly displayed next to a small shrine to the country\u2019s current president. A glass-fronted case held the curiosities of the confiscated: homemade tattoo machines, electrical wire garrotes, and blades fashioned from toothbrushes and utensil handles.</p><p>Behind the desk sat the pudgy man featured so prominently in the wall photos. Today he wore a slightly better suit, but his comb-over was disordered and a red welt marred his right, pockmarked cheek.</p><p>\u201cI am Warden Delgado.\u201d The warden did not look up from the paperwork he was pretending to read. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>Genaro glanced at the stained leather upholstery of the chair in front of the desk, and saw how many gouges had been left in the wooden arms. The guard shuffled forward to stand behind it, fingering the grip of his truncheon, and glare at Genaro.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d Genaro asked the warden.</p><p>\u201cYou are a prisoner.\u201d Delgado sounded bored. \u201cIf you do not sit down in the next five seconds, you will be a prisoner with a crack in his head, bleeding on my floor.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Genaro occupied the chair, the guard cuffed his right wrist to the chair and withdrew from the room. The warden continued his farce of busywork until the door opened again, this time admitting Carasegas.</p><p>\u201cYou remember our police chief?\u201d The warden stood, stacking some papers that he tucked into a folder before he walked around the desk. To the chief, he said, \u201cHe is waiting for your call.\u201d</p><p>Genaro noted the shift in the warden\u2019s tone as he spoke to the chief. Delgado was trying to project machismo when in reality he was terrified\u2014and not of Genaro or the chief.</p><p>Carasegas nodded. \u201cI will contact him as soon as I\u2019ve finished with the prisoner.\u201d</p><p>Genaro watched Delgado leave and the chief take his place behind the desk. \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were arrested for murdering Pedro Tacal.\u201d Carasegas tucked his hands behind his neck and sat back, idly rocking in the executive chair. \u201cWith great remorse you confessed to me the details of your crime, and tomorrow you will plead guilty before a judge. You will be sentenced to life without parole and placed in solitary confinement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I being framed for this murder?\u201d Genaro asked.</p><p>\u201cYou will have no phone or legal privileges,\u201d the chief continued, as if Genaro hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cAny records pertaining to you and your incarceration will be destroyed. By next week no one, not even I, will know where you are.\u201d</p><p>Genaro inclined his head to acknowledge the chief\u2019s threat. \u201cIs there some sort of financial arrangement we can make in order to divert this unhappy fate of mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think your money can buy you anything, eh, gabacho ?\u201d Carasegas indulged in a big belly laugh. \u201cMaybe it can in America, but you are in my country now.\u201d He snapped his fingers. \u201cLike that you could be gone. Forever. They wouldn\u2019t even find your bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you intended to keep me incarcerated,\u201d Genaro said, \u201cyou would have taken my clothes and left me to rot. If you wanted to kill me, I\u2019d already be dead. So tell me, who is your employer, and what does he really want from me?\u201d</p><p>A flicker of unease passed over the chief\u2019s features before he leaned forward to put his folded hands on the desk. \u201cYou will give me the names and current locations of all the people you intended to use for this special project of yours.\u201d</p><p>Energ\u00fameno must have arranged this, Genaro thought. No one else had the knowledge or the resources to pull it off. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also have a scientist working for you.\u201d The chief took a folded note from his pocket and read from it. \u201cDr. Eliot Kirchner. You will call him and tell him to come to Manzanillo.\u201d He pushed the phone on the desk to the edge. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Genaro picked up the receiver with his free hand and dialed a number. \u201cEliot? There\u2019s been a complication. I need you to fly down to Manzanillo.\u201d He listened to the empty line for a moment. \u201cIt can\u2019t wait. Take the next flight out. I\u2019ll have someone meet you at the airport.\u201d He paused. \u201cGood, then I\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d He hung up the receiver and regarded the chief. \u201cI\u2019ll need access to a computer to retrieve the data you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no computers here.\u201d Carasegas frowned. \u201cCall the doctor back. Tell him to bring it with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKirchner doesn\u2019t have access to my personal database. No one does except me.\u201d He twisted his cuffed wrist. \u201cIf you want the data, I need to use a computer with Internet access. Perhaps if we were to return to my hotel, I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you back to the station,\u201d Carasegas decided. \u201cYou\u2019ll use my computer, and if you try anything, anything at all . . .\u201d He snapped his fingers.</p><p>The police chief made two calls while a guard arrived with Genaro\u2019s shoes and jacket. He was uncuffed only long enough to put them on, but as soon as he smoothed down his lapels he held out his wrists.</p><p>As Genaro suspected, the jail was some distance from the city, and it took Carasegas thirty minutes to make the drive back. Along the way he told Genaro how little his power, influence, and wealth meant south of the border.</p><p>\u201cYou Americans always come down here expecting movie Mexicans in their sombreros and ponchos, holding their dirty hands out for a few pesos.\u201d He snorted. \u201cWe are smarter than you thought, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certainly more resourceful than I anticipated,\u201d Genaro conceded, keeping his eyes on the rearview mirror. \u201cDoes your employer plan to collect my targets himself, or send you after them?\u201d</p><p>Carasegas\u2019s smug smile evaporated. \u201cThat is not for you to know, gabacho. As soon as you give me the list of names, you are leaving Mexico, and if you are smart, you will never return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure this will be my final visit.\u201d Genaro saw a white cargo van come up alongside the chief\u2019s car, where it paced him for a moment before dropping back and merging into the traffic behind it. \u201cI think I\u2019m having a reaction to the drugs you gave me. Would you pull over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He produced a liquid cough. \u201cThen you have no objection to my vomiting on your seats?\u201d</p><p>Carasegas swore as he veered off the road and came to a stop on the shoulder. He marched around to the back door, opening it to pull Genaro out.</p><p>\u201cYou Americans with your weak bellies,\u201d the chief started, only to stop and look back as the cargo van pulled up behind them. The driver climbed out and called something in Spanish, to which the chief answered casually. The distraction kept him from noticing the second van that pulled off the road in front of his car.</p><p>Genaro watched his men pour out of both vans; all of them were armed with automatic weapons. By the time Carasegas had gotten out his pistol he was surrounded.</p><p>The police chief eyed him. \u201cHow did you send for them? Did you use some code when you called the scientist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never actually called Eliot, and I believe it\u2019s my turn to ask the questions.\u201d He held out his wrists, and one of the men removed the handcuffs. \u201cWho are you working for, and where is he?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s for me to know.\u201d A sly look came into his eyes. \u201cI can take you to Energ\u00fameno. You could ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be talking to him soon enough.\u201d Genaro stepped closer. \u201cHow did he learn about my project?\u201d</p><p>The chief grinned. \u201cYou told him yourself, fool.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo Energ\u00fameno is your boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure he is.\u201d The chief laughed. \u201cOr maybe I do it for a favor for your mother, after I fucked her.\u201d</p><p>Genaro nodded to one of the men, who shoved the barrel of his weapon into the chief\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019ll ask you one more time. Who told you to do this, and where can I find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere.\u201d Carasegas\u2019s face lost all expression. \u201cEverywhere. He is God.\u201d He lifted the gun in his hand and pressed the end under his chin, pulling the trigger.</p><p>Genaro put up his arm to block the spray of blood and brain matter, lowering it to watch the chief\u2019s body tumble backward onto the grass. He removed his bloodstained jacket and handed it to one of the men. \u201cPut the body in the van, and get rid of the car. Give me a phone.\u201d</p> <p>Delaporte answered before the first ring ended. \u201cMr. Genaro? Are you secure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the moment.\u201d He walked up to the first van. \u201cI need you to find out who paid off the drug lord and Carasegas to frame me for murder. Whoever it was knows about the transerum and the Kyndred.\u201d</p><p>As they approached the house, Charlotte began to sweat. Behind Samuel\u2019s watchful, handsome face a lot of unspoken rage seethed, and it was pouring into her like liquid fire.</p><p>At the door she touched his arm. \u201cLet me go in and talk to him,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cSo he can attack you first? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need some answers, m\u00edo.\u201d She nodded at his knotted fists. \u201cBefore you beat the daylights out of him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go in together.\u201d When she started to argue, he shook his head. \u201cAnd if he attacks, you will step aside and let me deal with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>They slipped inside the villa, pausing as Samuel listened. No sound gave away the intruder\u2019s location, but Charlie felt an odd sensation crawl over her skin, something like the frigid air one felt when opening the door to a freezer, minus the actual chill.</p><p>She exhaled and watched with wide eyes as her breath briefly became a white mist before it dissipated. When she looked down, she saw the water in the floor had frozen in places, the ice shaped like footprints.</p><p>Samuel pointed in the direction they took toward the staircase, the steps of which were lightly coated in frost, and then looked up at the ceiling.</p><p>She nodded and followed him up the stairs. The patches of ice led down the hall to the master suite, where the door stood open.</p><p>Samuel moved quickly, taking a position to one side of the door and gesturing for Charlotte to stand opposite. Glancing inside, she saw the man walk out of the bathroom and cross over to the patio doors, where he stepped outside.</p><p>Without warning Samuel went after him, and reached him before Charlie could catch up. The man turned as Samuel reached out to grab him, and then stood still as Sam\u2019s hands passed through his body.</p> <p>Samuel tried to seize him again, and then drew back his hands, both of which were coated with ice. Impatiently he clapped his hands together, smashing the ice away before he eyed the apparition. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>The man replied with a few sneering words.</p><p>When Samuel glanced at her, Charlie shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not Spanish. It sounds Indian.\u201d To the ghost, she said, \u201c\u00bfHabla ingl\u00e9s? \u00bfEspa\u00f1ol?\u201d</p><p>The man eyed her, his body becoming more transparent. In mangled Spanish, he asked, \u201cYou woman doctor?\u201d</p><p>Charlie doubted she could explain the difference between an EMP and an MD to a ghost, so she went with her instincts. \u201cYes, I am a doctor.\u201d</p><p>He came at her, passing through Samuel as if he weren\u2019t there. \u201cPici no die.\u201d He tried to touch her, but his arms began to disappear, and he uttered something in his own language before he stepped back. \u201cYou save.\u201d</p><p>Charlie nodded. \u201cWhere is Pici? How can I help her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d The man pointed toward the back of the villa. \u201cTell Colotl.\u201d As soon as his arm dropped his body faded away into nothingness.</p><p>Charlie saw Sam sitting on the deck. \u201cWhat happened? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m defrosting.\u201d Samuel brushed at the ice crystals already melting on his chest. \u201cWhatever that thing was, contact with it causes instant frostbite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me have a look.\u201d Charlie knelt down beside him, brushing away the slush on his chest to expose the stiff, dark skin beneath. As she palpated the area, Sam\u2019s flesh became more pliable. When she lifted her hand, it had already lightened to a deep pink, and then assumed its normal light caramel color. She checked the rest of his torso, finding the same process ongoing. After another minute passed, all the damaged skin had healed.</p><p>She extended one of his arms, putting her own beside it. Scratches from walking through the saw grass still made angry, crisscrossed slashes over her skin, while his didn\u2019t have a mark on it.</p><p>\u201cYou should have said something.\u201d Sam ran his hand down her arm, healing the scratches. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary. You not only can heal me; you\u2019re healing yourself.\u201d Charlie felt a tickling sensation at the base of her neck, and brushed at it. \u201cNiman achtopa yah in Ihiyo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIhiyo was the first to go.\u201d She felt a surge of impatience at having to translate it into English for him. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have tried to catch him. You should have just waited. He would come to you himself soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Samuel peered at her. \u201cWho is Ihiyo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one of importance.\u201d He wanted to play, she could tell, and the hunger came into her, full and ripe. She fluttered her eyelashes at him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a little later, after we talk.\u201d He looked into her eyes. \u201cHow are you feeling right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like having you in me.\u201d She climbed over him, pushing him back against the deck. \u201cBut we can play here, too.\u201d She pulled her shirt up over her head, flinging it away before she drew his hands up to her aching breasts. \u201cAhmo tl\u00e4cacemeleh. He is not pretty to look at. Not like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d He cradled her face between his hands. \u201cCome back to me.\u201d</p><p>A different emotion streaked through her, leaching away the strange lust and making her crawl backward away from him. \u201cIe ixqujch. No more, please.\u201d</p><p>Samuel caught her before she could escape and brought her up onto her knees, shaking her a little. \u201cCharlotte, can you hear me? Something is trying to take control. You have to shut them off. Get them out of your head. Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Charlie pushed her way through the alien emotions, panting as she emerged and slammed up her mental barriers behind her. \u201cJesus.\u201d She sagged against him.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s doing this to you?\u201d Samuel demanded as he helped her to her feet. \u201cIs it Segundo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They\u2019re so strong. Coming at me from all directions.\u201d She huddled against him as echoes of the thought streams hammered all around the mental walls she had erected. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can . . .\u201d She choked on bile as a tangle of fear, anger, and terror tried to push through. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He brought her face close to his. \u201cDon\u2019t panic. You know what you have to do. Look at me, yes, like that. I\u2019m right here with you.\u201d</p><p>While Samuel talked to her, Charlie used him as her anchor, keeping her thoughts trained on him as she reinforced her mental barriers.</p><p>At last she felt secure enough to relax a little. \u201cI\u2019m clear of them. For now, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He kept his arm around her and lifted her chin to inspect her face. \u201cDoes it always do this to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been keeping my guard up the way I do at home. With just you and me here, I didn\u2019t think I had to.\u201d She exhaled slowly as the intense nausea receded. \u201cUsually I feel people long before I can read them, but this time . . . it was like they just materialized out of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019re on the island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know they are. Where, I\u2019m not sure exactly. They\u2019re together in a group, and they\u2019re close, but . . .\u201d She shook her head and swiped at the tears clinging to her lashes. \u201cThere were too many voices to sort out at once, and all of them were speaking in that odd language. Maybe I can try to sweep for them a little later\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after what they just did to you,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou spoke to me in a language I\u2019ve never before heard.\u201d He bent to pick up her shirt. \u201cAnd you were definitely not yourself,\u201d he added as he helped her pull it on.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to jump you. I did jump you.\u201d She looked down at her hands, which were clenched. \u201cPart of it was me but not me. As if someone had helped themselves to my libido.\u201d Her lips twisted. \u201cThen something shifted and I was terrified and . . . sick to my stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second person you sensed was ill?\u201d</p><p>She made an uncertain gesture. \u201cYou scared me, and all I could think about was getting away, throwing up, and soaking my feet. They were killing me.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her toes. \u201cCould one of these people be hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She frowned as she tried to recall the emotions that had overrun her mind. \u201cThe first surge was really strong. Almost primitive. As if men and sex are all she thinks about. The second wave was the complete opposite. She wants to get away. Be left alone with . . .\u201d The thought dissipated, and she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDid either of the women think about what they were doing on the island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex Kitten just wanted you, or, for that matter, any guy with a pulse.\u201d She frowned as a fragment of imagery came back to her. \u201cThe girl who was sick and scared, she wasn\u2019t reacting to only you.\u201d She looked back at the villa. \u201cIt\u2019s this place. Seeing it was what made her feel sick. Something inside.\u201d She grabbed his hand. \u201cCome with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlie led him through the master suite and down the hall, but stopped just outside the door to the assessment room. She looked in at the empty table, and then released his hand, walking slowly toward the end of the upholstered seat. She reached under and pulled up one stirrup and then the other, curling her fingers over the metal supports.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was in here,\u201d she murmured as the images coalesced in her mind. \u201cOn the table, staring at the ceiling. An older man was giving her a pelvic exam. She was in so much pain.\u201d She pushed the table toward the wall, and glanced down. Dark reddish brown stains colored the grout between the white tiles in a two-foot area. \u201cOh, God. I think that\u2019s her blood.\u201d</p> <p>Samuel knelt down and touched the grout. \u201cThere was a pool of it.\u201d He made a circling gesture. \u201cAbout three feet in diameter. The doctor mopped it up.\u201d</p><p>Charlie stepped back. \u201cShe was hemorrhaging. Maybe from an illegal abortion.\u201d She winced as the thought streams outside her barriers became more intense and focused. \u201cSam? They\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere on the island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She covered her face with her hands, pressing her fingers against her eyelids before she dropped her arms. \u201cThey\u2019re standing right outside the front door.\u201d</p><p>Samuel gave her a narrow look. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can feel them.\u201d She showed him the goose bumps covering her forearms.</p><p>He rested a hand on her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d stay here while I go down to see what they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d</p><p>Charlie saw the torches through the downstairs windows, but when she stepped outside with Samuel the group waiting for them shocked her into silence. Twelve men and women, dressed in ragged clothing, stood in two rows: the men in the front and the women behind them. She saw blondes, brunettes, and several redheads, with skin tones ranging from alabaster to ebony. From what she could make out of their features they were all of multiracial lineage, although it was obvious they all shared some Caucasian characteristics.</p><p>Not one of them, however, appeared to be Mexican.</p><p>One of the men with the darkest skin stepped forward and touched his chest as he said, \u201cColotl.\u201d He made a broad gesture encompassing the others. \u201cAmigos.\u201d He pointed to Charlie and then Samuel. \u201c\u00bfUs-tedes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Samuel Taske,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThis is Charlotte Marena. Do any of you speak English?\u201d</p><p>Colotl uttered a few words to one of the other men before he spoke to Samuel again. \u201c\u00bfCurandero?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asking if you\u2019re a healer.\u201d To Colotl she said, \u201cYo soy m\u00e9dica. \u00bfAlguien est\u00e1 lastimada?\u201d</p><p>The red-haired woman standing behind Colotl murmured something to him, and he raised both hands palms out toward Charlie before speaking to Samuel again. \u201c\u00bfManos curativas?\u201d He pointed at Samuel\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d Sam said softly, \u201cI believe they know about my newfound ability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether they do or not, we shouldn\u2019t volunteer anything just yet.\u201d She looked at Colotl, asking him the same question as before while pressing a hand to her chest and mimicking a pained expression. She then repeated the question in English. \u201cIs someone hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt.\u201d Colotl glanced at the other men. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She recalled what the apparition in the house had said. \u201c\u00bfPici est\u00e1 contigo?\u201d</p> <p>Colotl beckoned to the smallest of the women, who shuffled over to stand beside him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what our visitor meant by \u2018woman doctor.\u2019 \u201d Charlie\u2019s eyes shifted to the high, swollen mound of her abdomen. \u201cA doctor for a woman. A pregnant woman.\u201d She moved toward Pici, who cringed and huddled against Colotl. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, sweetie. I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMomento.\u201d Colotl turned his head and spoke to the others, and one by one the other women began to step forward into the light from the torches.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Samuel muttered under his breath.</p><p>Charlie looked down the row of females, unwilling to accept what she was seeing but unable to deny the evidence. \u201cSam, we\u2019re not here to be displayed.\u201d Of the twelve women, eleven were in various stages of advanced pregnancy. \u201cWe\u2019re livestock.\u201d</p><p>PART THREE</p><p>Night of Tears</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>September 29, 1978</p><p>Mexico City, Mexico</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure what you saw was gold,\u201d Foster Stanton said as he hunched over to follow Chavez into the narrow shaft. \u201cYou could be wrong, you know. It might be copper, or pyrite inlay, or some sort of resin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this,\u201d the electrician promised. \u201cI know the difference.\u201d</p><p>Stanton knew he was betting his professional reputation\u2014not to mention his personal liberty\u2014on the word of an almost illiterate utility worker. But since Chavez had been a member of the original work crew that had accidentally unearthed an eight-ton stone disk carved with the relief of an ancient Aztec goddess, the archaeologist had no choice. No one from Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Anthropology and History allowed anyone but their own people to work the site, and their lack of funding and equipment had brought the dig practically to a standstill.</p><p>Fortunately the electricians who had been rerouting the city\u2019s power conduits were still permitted access, and Chavez had vouched for Stanton. Removing the artifact would be much more difficult, but first Stanton had to determine whether the find was even worth his trouble.</p><p>The electrician stopped, tucking his flashlight under his chin as he grabbed a panel of particleboard and moved it aside.</p><p>\u201cThrough here, se\u00f1or,\u201d Chavez said, holding up his flashlight to illuminate the low entrance he had uncovered.</p><p>Stanton saw the crumbling condition of the mud-covered walls and hesitated. \u201cHas anyone been in here to reinforce the ceilings?\u201d An odor wafted out and he almost choked. \u201cWhat is that smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s from the old sewer pipe. The ceiling will hold.\u201d Chavez gave him a disgusted look. \u201cWhat are you, afraid? You want a priest to bless the place first?\u201d</p><p>Stanton held a handkerchief over his nose and mouth as he bent over and ducked into the small chamber. The air inside smelled of decay, not human waste, but he forgot about the bile rising in his throat as soon as Chavez trained his light on the partially dug pit in the floor, and what gleamed through the disturbed earth. \u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p>The statue appeared to be a life-size sculpture of a Mesoamerican nobleman. Stanton fell to his knees, bruising them on the shells surrounding the edge of the pit, and reached in with a trembling hand to brush away more soil. He uncovered the leg of the statue from knee to hip, where he discovered the jagged edges of the top of the limb where it had separated from the torso.</p><p>He jerked up his head to glare at Chavez. \u201cDid you hack off the leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, se\u00f1or. I found it just as you see.\u201d The electrician winced and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cIt is too heavy for the two of us to carry out. We will need more men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolid gold.\u201d Stanton felt exactly what Carter must have the first time he laid eyes on the riches contained in Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d He laughed as he started digging around the leg with his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s miraculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must go now.\u201d Chavez slapped a hand against his arm. \u201cThere are too many bugs down here. I can feel them biting me.\u201d</p><p>The archaeologist barely heard him as he finished uncovering the entire limb. Unlike other burial tributes, this one was incredibly lifelike, as if it had been cast directly from a living human leg. \u201cYou go up. I have to see more of it.\u201d</p><p>Carefully he stepped down into the pit and straddled the lower portion of the statue in order to uncover the head. Like the leg it had been raggedly detached from the torso, and the sculptor had not bothered to adorn it with precious gems or intricate inlay, but the spectacularly rendered features and minute detailing\u2014even the closed eyelids had two rows of tiny, curling lashes\u2014were breathtaking.</p><p>\u201cSe\u00f1or.\u201d The electrician yelped and dropped the flashlight. \u201cSomething is wrong. Something is\u2014\u201d His voice dissolved into a cry as he stumbled into one of the walls, and dirt rained down atop Stanton and the pit.</p><p>\u201cHold still, you idiot, before you bring the whole place down on our heads. Here, take this.\u201d He grabbed the flashlight and aimed the beam at the sound of Chavez\u2019s whining.</p><p>The beam illuminated bloody hands pressed over the electrician\u2019s face. When he dropped them, Stanton saw dozens of deep cuts crisscrossing the man\u2019s features, as if someone had slashed him repeatedly in the face. As more wounds appeared, as if his flesh were being cut from the inside, his eyes rolled back and he toppled over next to the pit.</p><p>Stanton pushed himself up, in the process dislodging a huge, round shell on the edge of the pit. The shell rolled in atop the statue, and when he turned the flashlight caught the three black holes bored in it and the two rows of teeth gleaming through a fringe of black.</p><p>Shells don\u2019t have teeth, Stanton thought. Or mustaches.</p><p>Stanton jerked back and his hand landed in something wet. He looked down to see a stream of blood flowing over his fingers, and followed it up to the electrician\u2019s body. More poured from the wide gap in his throat and ran over the edge of the pit. When he looked back down he saw he was kneeling in a crimson pool.</p><p>Soil shifted, revealing more gold.</p><p>Pain sliced across Stanton\u2019s forehead as he scrambled backward, trying to crawl out of the pit. The warm wetness that ran into his eyes blinded him, but he kept pis-toning his legs and arms, splashing in the blood that now ran down his chest and forearms and thighs, until he slipped and fell backward, slamming his head against a column of stone.</p><p>He brought up his numb hands, wiping his eyes clear so he could see what was happening to him. He couldn\u2019t be dying, not like this. Not in a dirt pit with more ancient gold than he\u2019d ever seen. No one would ever know that he\u2019d been the one to discover it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d he pleaded, reaching up toward the shadow hovering over him. \u201cAy\u00fadame, por favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u00e4mpa tihu\u00e4llah?

Let me see it.</p> <p>Stanton\u2019s killer spoke as if he were the ancient C\u00eb-Acatl.

The old man didn\u2019t wave back. \u201cIs it because I\u2019m American?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gracie used a frayed pull cord to start an outboard motor that was only slightly less ancient than the boat.</p><p>He joined her and ran a hand over his scalp. \u201cIs red hair considered unlucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf red were an unlucky color, we would not have it on our national flag.\u201d She moved to the helm and steered the boat away from the dock.</p><p>As they moved out into the bay, Drew looked out over the bow, but all he saw was endless ocean. \u201cHow long will it take us to reach this Englishman\u2019s island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few hours.\u201d She nodded to the cramped recess leading belowdecks. \u201cMy father has a bunk down there. You should go and sleep while you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd leave you to sail through stormy seas by yourself?\u201d He grinned. \u201cNot a chance, sweetheart.\u201d</p> <p>She adjusted the controls before she turned to him. \u201cThe sea is calm, you are exhausted, and I am not your sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep last night, either,\u201d he reminded her, but his smile faded as he saw the whiteness of her knuckles as she gripped the wheel. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Gracie, not if it\u2019s going to cause trouble with your family. We can turn it around right now and go back. I\u2019ll hire one of the other fishermen to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will take you near the islands. They know the law. If we\u2019re stopped, I can use my credentials.\u201d She checked the navigational equipment before sitting down in the captain\u2019s chair. \u201cPapi is not angry at you. It\u2019s me.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s always me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed he didn\u2019t exactly break out the champagne when we showed up.\u201d Drew sat down beside her. \u201cIs it because you left home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family never approved of my going to school and getting a job in the city,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThey wanted me to marry. Papi even had a husband picked out for me.\u201d</p><p>Longing and jealousy ricocheted inside him, two pin-balls covered with spikes. \u201cWas this husband-to-be a fat, ugly old widower with six kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEduardo? He was young, slim, and handsome. No children, but no desire for an educated, working wife.\u201d She sounded depressed, but when she looked at him her eyes twinkled. \u201cNow he is older and a little fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he has six kids?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cFour.\u201d</p><p>It might have been the way the sun was gilding the tips of her eyelashes, or the sheen of sea spray on her cheeks, but in that moment Drew knew he had never seen and would never again see anyone as beautiful as Agraciana Flores. \u201cYou could have both, you know,\u201d he heard himself say. \u201cThe family and the career. Lots of women do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen in your country.\u201d She caught a piece of her hair that escaped from the colorful scarf she\u2019d tied around her head and tucked it under the edge. \u201cHere we are not so liberated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should consider emigrating, then.\u201d He reached out to trace the curve of her cheek, and was startled when she whipped her head away. \u201cGracie?\u201d</p><p>She stood up, gripping the wheel tightly. \u201cThere are some bottles of water in an ice chest below if you are thirsty.\u201d</p><p>Every time he got close to her, Drew realized, she pushed him away. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She gave him a direct look. \u201cWould you bring one for me, please?\u201d</p><p>Drew gave up and went below to retrieve the water. The cramped space had been made into a tidy little living space, complete with a narrow bunk, an ancient but clean cookstove, and a tiny bathroom. It should have been hot and airless, but the old man had rigged some sort of ventilation system, and a steady stream of cool, salt-tinged air wafted in Drew\u2019s face.</p><p>He noticed a crate stashed in one corner that had been filled with magazines and books, all written in Spanish but obviously about sailing and fishing.</p><p>\u201cSo Papi likes to read.\u201d He picked up one paperback and thumbed through it before something fluttered out of the pages. He bent to pick up a small photograph of a petite, dark-haired child in a red dress standing with a younger version of Papi in front of the old boat.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still your girl, isn\u2019t she, old man?\u201d He noticed what he first assumed was a sleeve was actually a bandage on the child\u2019s right arm. \u201cBut who the hell hurt her?\u201d</p><p>He knew he should have replaced the photo, but he gave in to the impulse and tucked it into his pocket before grabbing a bottle of water.</p><p>Gracie had reverted back to her cool, distant composure when he rejoined her on deck, and thanked him politely when he handed her the bottle. \u201cI apologize for my temper. I never discuss such matters with a stranger.\u201d</p><p>The photo in his pocket, the image of the child she had been, felt for a moment as stiff as the line of her back. Drew thought of the bandage on the little arm, the unsmiling old Mexican, and all the bits from the sea Gracie had used to decorate her cottage. When they\u2019d arrived at her childhood home, the way she had hesitated, just for a fraction of a second, before speaking to her father was almost as telling as the cold indifference the old man had shown both of them. Drew knew love and fear, and saw both in Gracie, but there was something more. Something had caused a serious rift between her and her family, and he sensed it had nothing at all to do with her working in the city.</p><p>He was also tired of being shut out by whatever it was. \u201cCan you stop the boat?\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cWe should keep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will, in a minute,\u201d he lied.</p><p>Gracie throttled down, shutting off the engine before turning to him. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a stranger to you. Not since last night.\u201d Drew took her hands in his. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say.\u201d She tried to extract herself from his grip. \u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong.\u201d He held on. \u201cI told you my life story. You know me better than my mother. I\u2019m your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not friends with liars or impostors,\u201d she flared.</p><p>Suddenly Drew understood her aloofness and what she might be hiding behind it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anyone, do you? Ever since you left the village, you\u2019ve been alone.\u201d</p><p>Gracie paled, and then her shoulders drooped. \u201cThere is no time for friends,\u201d she said, her voice thin and hurt. \u201cWhat I do is more important. I protect what I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d The boat rocked a little as he snatched her off her feet and carried her down belowdecks.</p><p>\u201cDrew, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>Her expression became alarmed. \u201cNo quiero. Drew, I don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need the translation. I get it.\u201d He put her down on her father\u2019s bunk, and pinned her there on her back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do caveman things like this. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cThen why are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of us has to, and you never will.\u201d He tore open his shirt, popping buttons in the process, and pushed her hand flat against his damp chest. \u201cNow tell me I\u2019m a stranger.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers flexed against his skin. \u201cYou\u2019re a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stranger you kissed,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cLike I was the one you\u2019d been waiting for all your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was how you kissed me.\u201d She shifted under him. \u201cThe only ones who are waiting for you are your friends.\u201d</p><p>He touched his mouth to a delectable spot beneath her jaw. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that I\u2019m not the man of your dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no dreams.\u201d Her hand trembled as she ran it up to his neck. \u201cAndrew, please. When you leave, we will never see each other again. Don\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He let go of her and rolled onto his side. He waited for her to get up and hurry away, but when she sat up he put his hand on her shoulder. \u201cI just want you to know one thing.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at him.</p><p>\u201cYou will see me again. Once my friends are safe, I\u2019m coming back here.\u201d He ran his hand down the length of her back before drawing it away. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>Drew expected Gracie to run off again, not spin around and grab him. Before he could react she was on top of him, her mouth on his, her hands pushing his shirt away from his chest, her legs bracketing his. Astonishment paralyzed him as she poured all her passion into the kiss, her tongue sliding against his, her fingernails scoring his skin as she freed his arms.</p><p>Abruptly she sat up, bracing her palms against his chest as she looked down at him, her hair falling around her beautifully flushed face. \u201cSo? This is what you want, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He gripped her hips, shifting her so she could feel his pounding erection. \u201cIt\u2019s yours, sweetheart\u2014but only if you want it.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed herself against him, her eyelids drooping and her lips parting. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Drew lifted his hips to take his wallet out of his back pocket. As he flipped it open and reached into the billfold, Gracie\u2019s expression changed to outrage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou dare try to give me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtection.\u201d He took out the two condoms he always carried and placed them in her hand. \u201cBut if you want the money, you can have that, too. My credit cards are phony and the car\u2019s a rental, and my laptop will self-destruct the minute you try to use it. I don\u2019t have anything else to offer.\u201d He thought for a moment. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give you all the Battlestar Galactica T-shirts I brought with me. Including my favorite blue \u2018What the Frak?\u2019 one that Katee Sackhoff signed for me at the last SF convention.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together for a moment. \u201cStar-buck signed your T-shirt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou get the Syfy channel all the way down here?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI buy the DVDs from eBay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the perfect woman.\u201d He pulled her down, meeting her lips halfway with his while he helped her with her buttons. Under the prim blouse she wore a pale lavender bra edged with dark purple lace. By the time he discovered that her panties matched, he had her under him again, her thighs around his hips and the words she murmured in Spanish rushing in his ears. He left her only long enough to strip down to his skin, and then she rose to her knees behind him, her hands sliding around his waist as she pressed her cheek against his back.</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d she said when he tried to turn around. She already had one of the condoms unwrapped, and deftly rolled it over the head of his penis and down the length of his shaft. Her fingers gently combed through the thatch of red hair before stroking over the aching swell of his sac.</p><p>\u201cI should mention,\u201d he said, gritting his teeth, \u201cthat I\u2019m not made of ice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo? You have two condoms. We use the other and start again.\u201d She fisted his cock, giving it a delicious squeeze before she climbed off the bunk, winding herself around him so that the bits of satin she wore slid against his hot skin. Before he could tear them off, she hooked her thumbs in the sides of her panties and pushed them down, kicking them off.</p><p>\u201cGracie.\u201d He picked her up, bringing her lips to his mouth, and her arms and legs went around him as she lifted her hips and nudged him into place. Drew wanted to go slow, but she was already melting over him, her slick heat parting and engulfing him as she rolled her hips.</p><p>The bunk was too far away; the floor was too hard. Drew held her against him and walked up on deck, ignoring her startled sound as he carried her back to the bench seat under the stern canopy.</p><p>\u201cSomeone will see us,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot unless they point a telescope at us.\u201d He caressed her cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t you like how it feels?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cToo much.\u201d</p> <p>Seeing her naked in the sunlight was almost as satisfying as laying her out on the cushioned top of the bench. She spread her thighs and pulled him in between as he crouched over her, positioning himself until he lodged just inside her. As he stroked in, he bent down to kiss her, giving her his tongue as well as his cock.</p><p>She arched, gripping him as she drew him in, working him into what felt like a hot, wet vise. When their body hair tangled Drew shuddered and groaned, enduring the pulsing tightness in his groin to fend off the urge to come so he could give her what she needed.</p><p>She tugged at him with her hands and her body, her voice almost a whimper, her sex so damp now her movements sounded like kisses. \u201cAhora, por favor, Andrew. Please, now.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her small breasts with his hands, working his palms over her nipples as he drew back and thrust in, watching her through narrowed eyes. Her face bloomed with color and pleasure, her eyes dilating as she arched up into him, her body shivering. The heat made them both sweat, but it only intensified the sensations as their bodies danced. He tossed aside finesse and fucked her, slow and deep, in and out, building on her response until she was writhing, out of control, her thighs tightening as she pushed her breasts into his hands and went rigid. Drew bent his head to latch onto one tight nipple, scoring it with his teeth, and she came with a wild cry, squeezing him like a wet fist.</p><p>Drew pushed in deep, hearing his own groan as he followed her, coming so hard his ears rang. She caught his mouth with hers and drank the sounds he made, her hands smoothing over his wet hair until he drifted down back to earth.</p><p>He lifted his head to see her looking at him with desperate eyes. \u201cHey.\u201d He smoothed back her hair to kiss her brow. \u201cGod, did I hurt you? I couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel wonderful. I have never . . .\u201d She glanced up and abruptly eased out from under him. \u201cWe should go now.\u201d She hurried across the deck and disappeared below.</p><p>Drew rubbed a hand over his face and looked up at the underside of the canopy. The shadow of a seagull passed over it before the bird landed atop the outboard motor. It seemed to be watching him. \u201cSee anything you like?\u201d</p> <p>The seagull opened its beak, uttered a sound like a bray of shrill laughter, and flew off.</p><p>The twelve islanders seemed to defer to the dark-skinned man with the silver hair as their leader, Samuel noticed, the men silently looking to him for cues. The redheaded Caucasian woman standing beside him\u2014the only female who wasn\u2019t showing signs of pregnancy\u2014also seemed to have some influence over the group, as most of the women kept watching her.</p><p>It took Charlotte a few minutes and a great many hand gestures to discover why they had come to the villa, and even then she was not quite clear. \u201cThey want to talk to us, but only if we go down to the beach with them. They also can\u2019t stay long. I think he\u2019s only giving us an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey must know about the cameras.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI think we should go with them, although I don\u2019t know how effectively we can communicate. Colotl doesn\u2019t understand what weeks and months are, but it\u2019s obvious that they\u2019ve been on the island for a while, definitely much longer than we have. Maybe they can give us some idea of what this is about.\u201d</p><p>Samuel had already assessed the other members of the group. None of them was carrying weapons, but all of the men were in prime physical shape. If they attacked en masse, he wouldn\u2019t be able to fend off all of them. \u201cShould they decide they want to do more than talk, I want you to run to the house and barricade yourself in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know I\u2019m a medic and you can heal,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cWith eleven pregnant women on this island, attacking us would be like trying to shoot two golden geese for dinner. There\u2019s also the obviously genetic connection we share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019re Takyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that or we\u2019re on the island of Unwanted Multiracial People who all decided to get pregnant at the same time.\u201d She glanced at the group\u2019s leader. \u201cColotl is starting to look worried. We should hold off on discussing this in English until later.\u201d</p><p>The redheaded woman came to Charlotte and touched her arm. As she did, Samuel saw the tattoo of a scarlet spider on the inside of her wrist. \u201cMe llamo Tlemi. V\u00e1monos, por favor.\u201d</p><p>He offered Charlotte his arm, and together they followed the islanders down the path to the beach. The men thrust their torches into the sand, creating a wide circle in which they sat with their respective female companions. Only Colotl and Tlemi positioned themselves in the center, and gestured for the Americans to join them.</p><p>Samuel sat down across from them with Charlotte. The circle of flames illuminated their faces, and he realized they were quite young, probably in their early twenties. Following his instincts, he tugged down the collar of his shirt and showed them his tattoo. Charlotte followed suit, turning slightly as she pulled down the shoulder of her wrap to reveal her stylized turtle. She touched it and then reached out to Tlemi, pointing to the spider on her wrist.</p><p>Colotl nodded and lifted his braid, turning his head to show the silver scorpion inked on the back of his neck.</p><p>All around the circle the other islanders did the same, showing animal tattoos in various colors. Samuel found it interesting that all of the women had been inked on their forearms and the men on their napes.</p><p>\u201cTakyn,\u201d Charlotte said, touching her ink and then Samuel\u2019s before making an encompassing gesture at the islanders. She then said something in slow, simple Spanish, to which Colotl only looked puzzled. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand the words for \u2018mother\u2019 or \u2018father.\u2019 If they were raised in a Mexican orphanage, they\u2019d speak Spanish.\u201d</p><p>Colotl and Tlemi exchanged a look before he nodded to her. To Charlotte, she said, \u201cI speak little English. Segundo teach me so I know what he say.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte exchanged a glance with Samuel before she said, \u201cSegundo had us kidnapped from America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe from America,\u201d Tlemi said quickly, nodding toward the others. \u201cBorn America. We babies, master buy us, bring us Mexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains why none of them appear to be native Mexican,\u201d Charlotte told him. To Tlemi, she said, \u201cWho is this master?\u201d</p><p>Tlemi\u2019s expression changed from cautious to fearful, and she shook her head. \u201cNo talk master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll just tell me his name\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colotl repeated sternly.</p><p>\u201cAll right, no talk master.\u201d Charlotte held up both hands palms out in a mollifying gesture. \u201cWhy are you here on the island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend us here, live free, have babies,\u201d Tlemi said slowly. \u201cNot free. Never leave. Segundo come\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colotl spoke sharply to her, and she snapped back. He glared at Samuel.</p><p>\u201cColotl afraid talk Segundo,\u201d Tlemi said, obviously angry. \u201cI no afraid.\u201d She turned to Samuel. \u201cYou heal with hands. I see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you see this?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cWatch you. In your eyes.\u201d She pointed to her temple and then to Charlotte\u2019s face. \u201cSee her heal, in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s admitting that she\u2019s the resident telepath,\u201d Charlotte murmured to him.</p><p>\u201cA remote viewer, perhaps.\u201d Samuel glanced at Colotl. \u201cTlemi, how long have you and the others been on the island?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She conferred briefly with Colotl, who at last nodded. \u201cHere eight moons.\u201d She made a circle with her fingers.</p><p>Charlotte mimicked the gesture. \u201cEight moons that look like this?\u201d When the other woman nodded, she dropped her hands and looked at the other women. \u201cEight months. Sam, most of them must be in their third trimester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you live?\u201d Sam asked Tlemi.</p> <p>She pointed to the villa. \u201cWe have house.\u201d She moved her hand from one side of the island to the other, and then counted on her fingers before she added, \u201cSix houses. Yours seventh house.\u201d</p><p>Samuel grew thoughtful. \u201cHe must have had one built for each couple. I wonder why he went to so much trouble and expense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a crazy person,\u201d Charlotte muttered before she spoke to the other woman. \u201cTlemi, I hear others in my mind, the way you see them.\u201d Charlotte tapped her temple. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I hear any of you before tonight?\u201d</p><p>Tlemi glanced at Colotl before she said, \u201cWalls.\u201d</p><p>Samuel frowned. \u201cThere are walls on the island?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cColotl gift make walls.\u201d She turned to speak to her companion, which made him mutter under his breath. \u201cWatch.\u201d She nudged him. \u201cHe show.\u201d</p><p>Samuel felt the air grow cool and heavy as a curtain of mist formed between them and the island couple. It swirled for a moment before the fog as well as Colotl and Tlemi faded from sight.</p><p>Charlotte reached out, flattening her palm against an invisible surface. \u201cIt feels like water, but it\u2019s as solid as glass. I can\u2019t push my hand through it.\u201d She closed her eyes briefly. \u201cI can\u2019t sense either of them. They\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo gone.\u201d The unseen curtain dropped, and Tlemi smiled at her. \u201cGood wall, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very good wall.\u201d Samuel had the feeling that making things disappear wasn\u2019t the only thing Colotl could do with his gift. \u201cTlemi, how are we being watched? We know it\u2019s not only the cameras.\u201d</p><p>She shifted, visibly uncomfortable. \u201cMaster watch. Master know everything you do. Always.\u201d</p> <p>He saw a flicker of alarm in Colotl\u2019s eyes, and abruptly changed the subject. \u201cWhom do you need us to heal? Is it Pici?\u201d</p><p>The smallest woman blurted out something before clinging to the scowling man beside her.</p><p>\u201cPici small.\u201d Tlemi made a circling gesture over her own pelvis. \u201cBaby big.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte glanced at the fearful woman. \u201cI\u2019ll have to examine her, but if I\u2019m understanding her correctly, Pici may be too small to deliver her child vaginally.\u201d To Tlemi she said, \u201cWon\u2019t Segundo take Pici to a hospital?\u201d</p><p>The other woman shook her head. \u201cNo leave island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you perform a C-section, Charlotte?\u201d Samuel asked her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s major surgery, and I\u2019m not an obstetrician. But I\u2019ve assisted on several, and I know the procedure.\u201d A strange look passed over her face. \u201cI think it\u2019s my fault that we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Samuel thought of the medical room. \u201cThey seemed to be prepared for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a licensed midwife, Sam. I\u2019m just working fire rescue until I can find the right obstetrical practice to join.\u201d Her expression turned bleak. \u201cLast month I had to submit all of my personal identification, school transcripts, and professional certifications for state verification. My parents made sure I was legal, and I\u2019ve always passed every background check, but anyone taking a close look would realize Charlotte Marena didn\u2019t exist until she was in first grade.\u201d</p><p>Tlemi was trying to follow their conversation, Samuel noticed, and he smiled at her. \u201cWe can help Pici.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make them any promises,\u201d Charlotte warned. \u201cAside from the fact that I have only the bare minimum in medical supplies, I have no anesthesiologist, no nurses, and no safe blood for transfusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood.\u201d Tlemi nodded and extended her arm, pointing to the crease of her elbow. \u201cSegundo take from us.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte peered at her arm. \u201cShe has a fresh needle mark.\u201d She looked at the other woman. \u201cWait a second. Are you telling me that the blood inside the house is yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSegundo take, moon and half-moon.\u201d She showed her the spider tattoo. \u201cMark on bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God.\u201d Charlotte looked appalled. \u201cThat bastard has been stockpiling their blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d Colotl said his name carefully, and then spoke to Tlemi in their language.</p><p>\u201cColotl say we go,\u201d she said. \u201cYou help Pici?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Samuel looked directly at the other man and held out his hand. \u201cAmigo.\u201d</p><p>Colotl clasped his hand, and then spoke to the others. The men rose, helping their women to their feet, and after taking their torches began to head in different directions. Only Colotl and Tlemi remained behind.</p><p>Once the other islanders were out of sight, Colotl brought a circle of mist around them and then nodded to Tlemi.</p><p>\u201cSegundo watch you,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cTell master everything you do, we do. Colotl, I not know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man came and watched us last night,\u201d Charlotte told her. \u201cCould he be reporting what we do to Segundo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll men watch you. Take turns. Colotl send. Protect. Segundo know other way.\u201d She tapped the side of her head. \u201cLike me, like Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a telepath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see in men eyes, but not Segundo. His eyes . . .\u201d Tlemi made a helpless gesture. \u201cNot like us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d Colotl took a folded black cloth from his pocket. He opened it, revealing the surface, which was covered with intricate embroidery.</p><p>At first Samuel thought it was only a gift, until Colotl tapped one square on it and pointed to the villa.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a map of the island,\u201d he said to Charlotte as he studied it. He pointed to six other squares. \u201c\u00bfCasas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed.\u201d Colotl pointed to a circle in the center of the map. \u201cCueva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCueva means cave,\u201d Charlotte told him.</p><p>\u201cSamuel. Colotl.\u201d Colotl pointed to the circle on the embroidered map and then the moon. \u201cAqu\u00ed ma\u00f1ana por la noche.\u201d</p><p>After Charlotte translated, Samuel turned to Tlemi. \u201cWhy does Colotl want me to come to the cave tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk. Plan. Segundo not know cave, not see night.\u201d She paused, searching for words. \u201cCharlotte. We leave island, go together, keep secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she told Tlemi before she eyed Samuel. \u201cThey want us to help them to escape.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Genaro watched as the last of the Manzanillo police officers were stripped of their uniforms and marched into the holding cell. His own men, now dressed in the confiscated uniforms, silently followed him to the largest of the interrogation rooms, which his team leader, an experienced ex\u2013Army Ranger named Evan Marlow, had converted into a command center.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve set up checkpoints on all the roads leading out of the city,\u201d Marlow told him as he came in to examine the operation. \u201cThe local news station is broadcasting the fugitive serial killer story on the hour. We\u2019ve set up our own switchboard, and have our interpreters fielding calls from concerned citizens, government officials, and satellite agencies, but I doubt we can hold them off for longer than forty-eight hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet Delaporte on the phone.\u201d Genaro eyed the row of computers his techs were using to trawl for information. \u201cWhat about Energ\u00fameno?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe compound is deserted. We\u2019re questioning some of the old women who were left behind, but they claim they know nothing.\u201d Marlow nodded toward the satellite images posted on the wall. \u201cAll of the vehicles we spotted at the compound yesterday are missing. It could be that the target decided to move to safer ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun a property search and see what else he owns, then send the chopper for aerial recon.\u201d Genaro accepted a mobile phone from one of the techs. \u201cDon? Thank you for the timely rescue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you\u2019re all right, Mr. Genaro.\u201d His security chief sounded as if he hadn\u2019t slept all night. \u201cWe have a cleanup crew en route, ETA six hours. Dr. Kirchner is under twenty-four-hour guard. With your permission, I\u2019d like to fly down there and supervise operations myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you in Atlanta.\u201d Genaro walked out of the operations room and down the hall to Carasegas\u2019s office, where he sat down in the dead cop\u2019s chair. \u201cI also need leverage against Energ\u00fameno.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hiding his assets with dummy corporations and bogus investments, most of them administered by a British expat named Foster Stanton,\u201d Delaporte said. \u201cStanton started out as an academic, but was sliding into the antiquities black market when he dropped off the grid back in the late seventies. He resurfaced a few years ago, about the same time Energ\u00fameno began buying up dozens of land parcels and most of the agricultural and municipal waste disposal companies in central Mexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaste disposal?\u201d Genaro frowned. \u201cAre they fronts for drug operations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they appear to be legitimate. He could be using them for money-laundering purposes, but that\u2019s the other thing.\u201d The chief sighed. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to connect any drug activity at all to him. No suppliers, pipelines, storage facilities, labs, or a single skirmish with a rival operation. In Mexico that\u2019s unheard-of, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dummy cartel would be an effective smoke screen for a more lucrative enterprise.\u201d He grew thoughtful. \u201cBefore Carasegas shot himself, he claimed he wasn\u2019t working for Energ\u00fameno, but for God. That order of delusional fanatics you investigated, the ones posing as Catholic priests, what were they called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLes Fr\u00e8res de la Lumi\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want everything you already have on them, and see if they\u2019re operating in Mexico.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat order is based in Europe, sir,\u201d Delaporte said, sounding doubtful. \u201cWe\u2019ve yet to find any of them operating in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may be using the churches here as cover.\u201d Genaro picked up the crucifix statue Carasegas had on his desk. \u201cThis country is obsessed with religion.\u201d He tossed the cross into a drawer.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019ll call you when I have new information.\u201d Delaporte disconnected the line.</p> <p>Marlow appeared outside the door\u2019s window, knocking once before looking in. \u201cThe owner of the caf\u00e9 across the street is at the front desk. She claims Riordan and a woman had coffee there before leaving together last night. She claims she doesn\u2019t know who the woman was, but she\u2019s lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she speak English?\u201d When Marlow nodded, Genaro stood and took off his jacket. \u201cBring her to me.\u201d</p><p>The caf\u00e9 owner, an older woman still wearing a flour-dusted apron and hairnet, came in accompanied by Marlow. She glanced around, her expression curious.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere is Chief Carasegas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chief is out conducting a search of the city.\u201d Genaro indicated the chair in front of the desk. \u201cSit down, please.\u201d As soon as she did, he glanced at Marlow, who closed the door and came to stand behind the chair. \u201cYou reported that you saw the serial killer bring a woman to your caf\u00e9 last night. Who was she?\u201d</p> <p>The woman shrugged but averted her gaze. \u201cI tell your man, I never see her before.\u201d</p><p>Genaro weighed the time-saving benefits of having her taken to one of the interrogation rooms and beaten until she talked. However, she had come to the station on her own, and her business was located across the street. For those reasons he would have to use persuasion. \u201cSe\u00f1ora, this man has already murdered three people over the last two days. As soon as he is finished using this young woman, he will kill her, too. Help us save her life.\u201d</p><p>The caf\u00e9 owner looked uncertain. \u201cBut she tell me that he is friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe she was trying to protect you, ma\u2019am,\u201d Marlow put in. \u201cShe knew if she asked for your help, you would be in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerd\u00f3name, mi Madre.\u201d She paled and crossed herself. \u201cHer name Agraciana Flores. She come from my husband\u2019s village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a PROFEPA agent named Flores assigned to the Tacal case,\u201d Marlow said.</p> <p>\u201cS\u00ed,\u201d the woman said, nodding eagerly. \u201cAgraciana work for people protect islands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you anything about the man she was with, or where they were going?\u201d Genaro asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, se\u00f1or. She have caf\u00e9 with him, and then drive away together.\u201d The woman wrapped her arms around her waist.</p><p>\u201cWhich direction did they go?\u201d Marlow prompted.</p><p>\u201cShe take bay road.\u201d She gestured in the general direction, and then gave Genaro a stricken look. \u201cAgraciana have beach house there. Maybe he make her take him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll call Chief Carasegas and let him know to check on Ms. Flores,\u201d Genaro lied. \u201cThank you for helping us. Marlow, would you show the lady out?\u201d</p><p>After the caf\u00e9 owner left, Genaro returned to the command center to make several calls, where Marlow joined him a short time later.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve put a man on the caf\u00e9 to watch for Flores and Riordan,\u201d the team leader said. \u201cBut they\u2019re probably hunkering down at her beach house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt Riordan would be that stupid. Flores called her office this morning to request two days off.\u201d He paused as one of the techs handed him a sheaf of fax copies of the PROFEPA agent\u2019s government personnel file and several police reports.</p><p>\u201cShe told her supervisor her mother was ill.\u201d</p><p>Marlow\u2019s brows rose. \u201cSo she is helping him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven that Flores\u2019s mother disappeared ten years ago, and was declared dead by her husband in 2008, that is a reasonable assumption.\u201d</p><p>Genaro went to one of the computer stations. \u201cI want to see this police report.\u201d He handed a fax to the tech, who performed a search and opened the file on the screen, translating the page into English.</p><p>Marlow scanned the report. \u201cLooks like she disappeared on her way home from work.\u201d</p><p>Genaro tapped an address on the screen. \u201cDisplay this on a map.\u201d</p><p>The tech brought up a satellite image of the city with one small red balloon.</p><p>Marlow glanced at Genaro. \u201cHer mother was working at Energ\u00fameno\u2019s compound when she disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Genaro thought of the old women he had seen in the gardens. \u201cOr she never left.\u201d</p><p>Charlie silently followed Samuel back to the villa, but as soon as they were inside she stopped and focused. The islanders had spread out in all different directions, their emotions muted, their thoughts intense. \u201cEverything is working now. I can feel all of them out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we need a cup of tea.\u201d He led her into the kitchen. \u201cCan you hear what they\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoud and clear, now that Colotl has dispensed with his shields.\u201d She pressed her fingertips to her temples. \u201cOnly problem is, they\u2019re all thinking in that odd language. I can\u2019t understand a word of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a linguist, but what I heard sounded almost archaic,\u201d he said as he took out a pan and filled it with water. \u201cIf it is an obscure or dead language, this master Tlemi spoke of probably used it as a control measure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would it control them?\u201d She joined him at the stove.</p><p>\u201cIf any of them escaped his custody, speaking an uncommon language assured they wouldn\u2019t be able to easily communicate with outsiders.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cHow old were you when you were adopted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThe Marenas thought I was about five or six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant your first family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. Probably a baby.\u201d Charlie went over to the fridge. \u201cDo you want some fruit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d He took out two cups and a tin, opening the lid to sniff the contents before spooning some into the cups. \u201cWhen my parents adopted me, I was about a year old, but I had already learned to speak a few words.\u201d</p><p>She could imagine what a beautiful baby boy he must have been, and felt a pang of longing. \u201c\u2018Mama\u2019 and \u2018Dada\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother told me later that they had no idea what I was saying, but she wrote down in my baby book the words I spoke by how they sounded.\u201d He watched her arrange some pineapple slices on a plate. \u201cA few years ago I had the sounds analyzed. It turned out that my cradle language was Chinese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of the other Takyn mentioned that they spoke odd languages as kids.\u201d She sealed the plastic container before returning it to the fridge. \u201cI couldn\u2019t speak Spanish when I met the Marenas, and they didn\u2019t speak any English, but I understood their thoughts perfectly. I also don\u2019t have a problem with any other non\u2013English speaker\u2019s thoughts. So why can\u2019t I understand the castaways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps because you\u2019ve never before been exposed to this particular language.\u201d He added hot water from the pan to the cups before he picked them up from the counter. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go and talk in the living room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the pit of decadence and depravity?\u201d She grimaced. \u201cAll that red makes me nervous.\u201d</p><p>He seemed surprised. \u201cI thought most women find it romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe women who don\u2019t work in the medical field,\u201d she said. \u201cAll it reminds me of are severe injuries, bio-hazardous material, and blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should still make use of the room occasionally.\u201d He turned his back on the kitchen camera. \u201cIf we are going to plan a successful escape, we\u2019ll have to keep up appearances.\u201d He shifted his eyes up.</p><p>That reminded her. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of your going by yourself to this cave tomorrow night,\u201d she said as she followed him to the living room. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how Segundo is getting his information; they could have an informer among them. And even with Colotl\u2019s shields, eventually he will find out about whatever you and the men have planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be risks,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut, Charlotte, consider the alternative. As much as I would enjoy having a child with you, I will not allow either of us to be bred like animals.\u201d</p><p>He always came up with something she couldn\u2019t argue with, and while he was right, she still felt annoyed. Even the way he remained standing, politely waiting for her to sit down first, got on her nerves.</p><p>Deliberately she set the fruit on a table and moved around the room. \u201cWhy does someone buy twelve American children of mixed blood, raise them to speak a language no one understands, and then strand them on an island to fend for themselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could be attempting to create a gene pool,\u201d Samuel said as he sipped his tea. \u201cOr he purchased one that had already been created. Aside from the placement of their tattoos and the racial diversity, the way they interacted with each other gave me the impression they were a unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll but Pici,\u201d Charlie pointed out. \u201cShe isn\u2019t tattooed on the forearm like the other women. She\u2019s also younger than the others by at least five years.\u201d She idly picked up a red satin pillow and plucked at the corner tassels. \u201cIf that\u2019s his goal, he\u2019s going to need more livestock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven couples aren\u2019t a viable gene pool?\u201d When she nodded, Samuel asked, \u201cWhat if every man impregnates every woman and each of their unrelated female offspring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not enough. Even if you could convince the couples to play musical beds and breed with the next generation to produce a superhuman population, you have to allow for infertility, stillbirths, genetic anomalies, and diseases,\u201d she told him. \u201cEven under ideal circumstances with near-perfect reproduction, you\u2019d have to start with at least two hundred unrelated couples. Otherwise inbreeding is inevitable within a few generations.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Samuel grew thoughtful. \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t intend to create a superhuman subspecies?\u201d</p><p>She eyed him. \u201cThen what\u2019s he going to do with the offspring? Sell them the same way their parents were? Who would want . . .\u201d She stopped as she realized the obvious answer to her own question, and the pillow fell from her hands. \u201cNot GenHance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could be a potential buyer, but to me this operation has all the hallmarks of a long-term investment. Consider our accommodations and our duties.\u201d He made a sweeping gesture. \u201cOne does not keep livestock pampered in a mansion in order to supply a slaughterhouse.\u201d</p> <p>Samuel was choosing his words too carefully again. \u201cYou\u2019ve figured out why they\u2019re here, and you\u2019re keeping it from me.\u201d</p><p>His expression never changed, but a guarded look came into his eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t yet obtained enough facts to make a reasonable hypothesis, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ass, you haven\u2019t.\u201d She came over to him. \u201cI want to know. Now, you can tell me yourself, or I can climb inside your head and stay there until you forget not to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you keep your secrets safe from me?\u201d he countered. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem quite fair, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat secrets? You know about my job, my ability, my parents forging my records. When we were chatting online I confided in you about everything. God, I even told you about the men I\u2019ve dated.\u201d Charlie threw up her hands. \u201cWhat more do you want to know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened to you before the Marenas took you in? Who was your first family?\u201d As she began to reply he shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve already said that you can\u2019t remember, and I know it\u2019s not the truth.\u201d</p><p>All the fight went out of her, and she turned away. \u201cDon\u2019t make me go there, Sam. It\u2019s not a nice place. I just want to forget about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t.\u201d He came up behind her and put his arms around her. \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019ve never told anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about it. The way Aphrodite talked, it sounded like she\u2019d been kicked quite a bit. I thought she might understand. But every time I tried . . .\u201d She hesitated and leaned back against him. \u201cIt\u2019s always been like a nightmare that I could wake up from and forget for a while. Telling someone else makes it real again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFacing it is the only way to get past it,\u201d he suggested as he guided her over to the sofa and sat down with her. \u201cIt helps to have a friend there when you do.\u201d</p><p>She rested her forearms on her thighs as she hunched forward. \u201cI was adopted by a couple in California. They were young, beautiful, knew all the right people\u2014like an eighties version of Brad and Angelina\u2014and they had money. Lots of money.\u201d She gave him a sideways glance. \u201cYour kind of money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t everything, Charlotte,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cIt was to my parents. You and I probably had very similar childhoods. The big, fancy room filled with toys. The private nanny, the catered birthday parties, the designer clothes, the carefully selected friends.\u201d She smiled a little. \u201cFor me, it was like being part of a fairy tale. King and queen for parents, me their little princess, all of us living in a castle high up on the hill. It was almost like what they tell us heaven is. Of course, I knew we\u2019d live happily ever after, because that\u2019s how my nanny said all fairy tales end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours didn\u2019t,\u201d he guessed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Charlie swallowed against the tightness in her throat and turned toward Samuel. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand why my mother was so angry that night; I didn\u2019t know what investment scams and fraud were. I didn\u2019t even realize my father had strangled her and my nanny that night, just before we left the house. I was six years old, and my daddy was taking me on an adventure. My first.\u201d Tears spilled over her lashes. \u201cHis last.\u201d</p><p>Samuel pulled her closer. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Charlotte. You don\u2019t have to say another word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Let me, before I change my mind.\u201d Quickly she wiped her eyes and forced herself to go on. \u201cMy father drove up to the Golden Gate Bridge and took me on the walkway. When he picked me up and climbed over the railing, I thought he wanted me to see the water. Then he kissed me, and he told me we\u2019d be together forever.\u201d She stared at nothing. \u201cHe jumped off the bridge with me, Sam.\u201d</p><p>Samuel muttered something and pulled her onto his lap. She linked her hands behind his neck and pressed her hot face against his cool skin.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t remember hitting the water, which I know was a blessing. The next thing I knew I was clutching my father\u2019s shirt as we floated away in the dark. I couldn\u2019t wake him up, and I couldn\u2019t swim, so I just held on and cried.\u201d She shivered, remembering. \u201cThe water was like ice. When we reached the shore my arms and legs were so numb I could barely crawl. Once, I looked back, but my father was gone. The current had taken him away.\u201d</p> <p>He stroked her cheek. \u201cYou must have been terrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to hide in the bushes for a day and a half, until I was too hungry to sleep. That\u2019s when I heard the first voice in my head, and saw an old woman out walking her poodle. She was tired and annoyed with the dog for peeing on her carpet. I followed her to her house, and when she went inside, I stole some oranges from a tree in her backyard. I crawled behind the lawn mower in her shed to eat them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy back and my head hurt, but after two days I was fine.\u201d She sighed. \u201cJust cold. Always cold and hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did you live like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a couple of weeks. People in that part of the city liked to garden, so I found plenty of fruit and vegetables to steal, and sheds and crawl spaces where I could hide and sleep.\u201d She realized that the nausea she normally felt when she thought about her father and the bridge wasn\u2019t affecting her now. Samuel had been right; it did feel better to talk about it. \u201cI ran away from everyone who saw me, of course. I didn\u2019t understand their thoughts, and I was afraid. I thought they\u2019d know I let my daddy drown, and they\u2019d put me in jail, or take me back to the bridge and throw me off again. Crazy stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suffered the unthinkable, honey, and you survived it. That\u2019s not crazy at all.\u201d He kissed her brow. \u201cWhat made you decide to stay with your second family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama Marena.\u201d As always, simply saying her name made a sweet warmth spread through Charlie. \u201cI heard her thoughts as soon as she saw me from the kitchen window. All this love and longing; she thought I was a little lost angel that God had sent to her. When she came out of the house, she had an old quilt in her hands. She sat on the steps and smiled while she waited for me to come to her. When I did, she wrapped me up and carried me inside. She made me warm milk and honey, and sat with me in her rocking chair, singing to me until I fell asleep. I was hers from that day on.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand in his. \u201cIs she the one who named you Charlotte?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAt first she called me Charlatana, probably out of wishful thinking. When it came time to fill out my papers she got a baby book from the library and looked for an American name that was close to that. Charlotte was the result.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Charlatana mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalkative.\u201d Her lips twisted. \u201cAfter Mama found me, I didn\u2019t speak or make a sound for months. She assumed I was mute, not that it made a difference to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds like a wonderful woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama would say she was nothing special.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t beautiful or young, and she\u2019d never gone to school. To make a few bucks every week she sold cookies and cakes to the local bodegas. But she saved my life and my soul, Sam. She took care of me, and cherished me, and protected me until the day she died. I\u2019ll never know love like that again.\u201d</p><p>A strange look came over his face. \u201cAre you so sure of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read minds, and I know people rarely love anyone but themselves,\u201d she assured him. \u201cThey say the words to their husbands and wives while thinking about how much they hate them. They tell their kids they love them while they seethe with resentment over how much work they are, or how young they are, or all the advantages they have. You know what most people really love? Things that make them feel good, or help them stop thinking about how miserable they are. Alcohol. Drugs. Sex. Food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel good, Charlotte.\u201d He cupped her chin to tip her face up so that she felt his words on her lips. \u201cDoes that make it all right to love you?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>\u201c It\u2019s just sex, Sam.\u201d Charlie started to climb out of his lap, but he closed his arms around her to hold her there. \u201cPhysical attraction and mutual pleasure are powerful things, and they can seem like love, but they\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs spectacular as it is, I wasn\u2019t referring to the sex. I mean you, the woman you are, the soul inside this beautiful body.\u201d He studied the stubborn set of her jaw. \u201cYou don\u2019t accept that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re in a desperate situation, possibly one that will kill us, and you need hope.\u201d She glanced down at his arms. \u201cI\u2019m all you\u2019ve got to hang on to right now. It doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m holding on to you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a woman who can know anyone\u2019s thoughts and emotions, sometimes you can be remarkably imperceptive.\u201d He brought her hand up to his face. \u201cRead me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo point.\u201d The problem with her ability was that it pierced through every lie, even the ones people told themselves. If Samuel had to cope with their situation by convincing himself that he had feelings for her, she wouldn\u2019t take that away. She patted his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m happy with our being friends with benefits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally. You believe I love only money and sex, and you\u2019re determined not to let anyone hurt you again.\u201d He turned his head and kissed her palm. \u201cIf you are correct in your assessment, you should find no surprises in my head. Only you, naked, atop large stacks of thousand-dollar bills.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe it would be best to bring him back to reality, Charlie thought as she slid her hand down to the side of his throat and covered the strong pulse there with her palm. \u201cOkay. Think about me.\u201d</p><p>Samuel kept his eyes open and locked on hers as she let the barriers drop and reached out to him. Reading someone she was touching at the same time always quickly established a connection, but this time the thought stream came over her, wide and shocking clear and relentless, as if she\u2019d stepped into a waterfall.</p><p>Charlotte so bright and quick but so lonely like me waited so long to find us never knew how it would be so complete see me as I am not as I appear we could be so much together I want that I want Charlotte see her shine in the night every night my treasure in the dark</p> <p>As Samuel\u2019s thoughts flooded her, Charlie felt the heat of his passion entwined with something stronger, an emotion she hadn\u2019t felt since the day Mama had wrapped her in that old soft quilt. It encircled her and wove through her, that silvery white light, so pure and perfect that it took her breath away. The other sensation it brought was one much older than Mama or that night on the bridge, one she had consciously forgotten on one level but that still lingered in some tiny corner of herself, waiting to be needed again.</p><p>The connection between them felt stronger than before, effortless and consuming, and while she no longer needed to touch him to maintain the link, her hands glided around his neck. The steady pulse beneath his skin quickened as she trailed her fingertips along the cords and muscles, following them to his broad shoulders. There was so much of him in her head that she could feel the heavy, rough delight he experienced as he became aroused, the way his blood heated and his muscles coiled while he fought back the urge to respond.</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d she whispered against his cheek.</p><p>\u201cWith every breath I take.\u201d Desperation tinged his thoughts as he caught her hands. \u201cCharlotte, if you keep\u201d\u2014he groaned as she brought his hands to her lips before she pressed them to her breasts\u2014\u201cdoing this, we won\u2019t be discussing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can still use your mouth,\u201d she promised as she stripped off her top. Somehow she had gone from cuddling with him to straddling him. A wanton impulse made her shimmy against him, and he responded by squeezing her breasts. From the anxiety that shadowed his thoughts, she knew he worried he was being too rough. \u201cNo, it feels good, m\u00edo. I love the way you touch me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeducing me won\u2019t change how I feel about you,\u201d he said as he slid his hands down to her waist. \u201cYour body is lovely, and you give more pleasure than I can put into words, but that\u2019s not all you are to me, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we have.\u201d She pushed her hips back and forth to rub her crotch against him. \u201cEnjoy it, m\u00edo.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her closer. \u201cIf I had any pride left, I\u2019d resist your charms and stalk out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a one-minute head start before I chase you down and molest you,\u201d she said, smiling. She bent down to touch her lips to his in a lingering kiss as she opened the front of his shorts and slipped her hand inside. \u201cOn second thought, no, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The curl of her fingers around the straining spike of his penis made him shudder, and as she caressed him Charlie watched his eyes. Tiny silver lights, like shards of a mirror, glinted inside the black of his irises, growing brighter with every stroke of her hand. Playing with him made her own sex clench in anticipation, and feeling his desire in her mind fueled her own arousal.</p><p>Charlie shifted backward until her feet touched the floor, dragging his shorts over his hips and pulling them down out of her way. When she straightened, his bobbing erection grazed the tip of her breast, and she turned slightly to catch it between the curves of both. She cupped her breasts from the sides and worked them against him, dipping her head to kiss the gleaming dome. As soon as her lips touched the straining head, his mind filled hers with his particular longings.</p> <p>\u201cYou like me to kiss you here.\u201d She teased him with a flick of her tongue along the ridge of his glans. \u201cOr maybe you want something more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want everything you\u2019ll give me.\u201d He watched her, clenching his teeth as she rubbed her lips back and forth across his cock head. \u201cBut more of this particular attention may bring things to a very rapid end.\u201d</p><p>She smiled against him. \u201cI hope not, m\u00edo.\u201d</p><p>As she engulfed him with her mouth, Samuel shuddered, his fists bunching in the cushions beneath him. Charlie sucked lightly, working the flat of her tongue against the tight satin of him, her fingers spreading over his bulging thighs. She closed her eyes as she bobbed her head, sliding her lips down to take more of him, and felt his hands threading through her hair. She drew up, letting him pop out of her mouth and taking a moment to admire the slick bulb before glancing up to see sweat trickling down the sides of his face.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou like how it looks as much as how it feels.\u201d She licked him. \u201cThat excites me. So does knowing I have you exactly where I want you.\u201d</p><p>He offered her a tormented smile. \u201cThen have me, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>As Charlie drew him back in, Samuel tried to say something more, but his words dissolved into a low, rumbling purr. He was like some huge predatory feline, sprawled there under her hands, his fingertips kneading her scalp as she sucked him. Being part of a lover\u2019s mind had never before tempted Charlie, but now she felt both sides of desire, the bold and wanton brightness of her emotions twining with his darker, primal hungers.</p> <p>The wet friction and seductive pull of her mouth made his penis swell even larger, distending the veins beneath his skin and producing creamy pearls of semen that she sipped away. She cupped his testicles as they tightened, sweeping the pad of her thumb over the bulging heat as she took as much of him as she could manage, holding him in her mouth and sealing her lips around his shaft. His hands snarled in her hair, and she heard his purr become a guttural roar as the first pulse jetted out of his cock.</p><p>Tasting and teasing him had aroused her more than Charlie realized; when she drank from him it brought her right to the edge. She released him and pressed her cheek against his thigh, her hand slipping down between her own thighs.</p><p>Samuel swept her up onto the sofa and pressed her back, pushing her sarong up over her hips before he thrust his hands under her bottom. He brought her up to his mouth, parting her with his tongue to find her clit. He dragged his tongue against it as he thrust two thick fingers into the clenching ellipse of her vagina. His thumb went lower, nudging and then pressing in between the curves of her bottom.</p><p>It proved too much for Charlie\u2019s self-control. Her hips heaved up as she shattered under his mouth, her body bowing as the wrenching delight put her on the rack and held her shaking and pleading. Samuel rode her through one climax and pushed her to the next, his fingers plunging in and out of her contracting sheath, his tongue working against her clit in a relentless abrasion until the pleasure took her again, hurtling her over the edge into pure bliss.</p><p>He moved up over Charlie, taking her in his arms and turning her so that she lay atop him. While her skin cooled, he stroked his hands up and down her back in a soothing motion. Although aftershocks still jittered through her limbs, she couldn\u2019t move. She did put up her barriers, slowly, reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in my mind anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been with enough men to develop a healthy appreciation for sex and all its pleasures, but she\u2019d never read their thoughts in bed. If all men felt the same things Sam had, she\u2019d really been missing out.</p><p>Or it\u2019s just him, and I\u2019m in real trouble now.</p><p>\u201cBeing hurt doesn\u2019t scare me, you know,\u201d she heard herself say. \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy pain and suffering, but I know it\u2019s unavoidable. What I can\u2019t do is give my heart away to anyone who says they love me. The last time I did that, I ended up getting thrown off that goddamn bridge.\u201d</p><p>His hands stilled on her back. \u201cI\u2019m not your father, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d She propped herself up on her elbows and looked down at him. \u201cI care about you, Sam, more than I should. You\u2019re gorgeous and interesting and kind, and I could fall in love with you so easily. But trust is just as important, and for me that takes a long time. Mama loved me the moment she saw me, and I knew it\u2014I felt it\u2014and still I made her wait a year before I even said one word to her. So if you really want my heart, you\u2019re going to have to give me more than just time. You\u2019re going to have to earn it.\u201d</p><p>Samuel took her hand in his. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Charlie felt that echo of familiarity again, and stared at their joined hands. She could feel the same bewildered emotion coloring his thoughts. \u201cSo have you remembered when we met? Was it in a hospital? Emergency room? I was working in D.C. for a while; maybe our paths crossed there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He studied the weave of their fingers. \u201cWe held hands like this. It was dark. Cold. There was someone there with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014cold hands,\u201d she finished his thought, and closed her eyes as his description sent her spiraling into some murky place she had forgotten. \u201cThere were needles, too. Monitoring equipment.\u201d He\u2019d gone very still. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d His eyes searched her face. \u201cI think we first met in a lab. The place where they changed us.\u201d</p><p>The Englishman\u2019s island appeared deserted, but as Gracie brought the boat to the long, empty floating pier, Drew got the sense that their arrival had not gone unnoticed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s this guy\u2019s boat?\u201d he asked as he stepped off to help her with the mooring lines.</p><p>\u201cHe keeps it in a cove on the other side of the island.\u201d She tested the lines before taking his hand and climbing up onto the pier. Her eyes shifted to three birds circling overhead before she gestured toward the trees. \u201cHis house is over here.\u201d</p><p>Drew tried to hold on to her hand, but Gracie walked away, leaving him to follow. It wasn\u2019t until they were following a narrow sandy path through the thick brush and soaring palms that he noticed the steel poles scattered around them. Each had cameras perched atop it on a swivel base, and all of the lenses were moving slowly to follow them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drew stopped by one of the devices, and the camera stopped moving. \u201cGracie, we are being watched. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Englishman is obsessed with his birds, so he puts cameras everywhere. They are programmed to track movement.\u201d She glanced back at him. \u201cCome, Andrew. If your friends are out here, he\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>The lack of expression on her pretty face and the flatness of her voice made him wonder just what was going on in her head.</p> <p>As she started off again, he called after her, \u201cAre you mad at me because we made love?\u201d</p><p>She spun on her heel and strode back to him. \u201cThat was private. You will not speak of it to anyone. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAct like it never happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please.\u201d Her voice broke on the words, and she hurried away.</p><p>\u201cNot in a million years, lady.\u201d He took off after her, catching up just as Gracie reached the house. His anger faded as he looked up at four stories of what appeared to be a tiered pyramid. \u201cIs this a temple?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She skirted a statue of a reclining primitive figure with a bug-eyed face and an empty bowl in his hands. \u201cBefore he came to the islands, the Englishman was an archaeologist. He is an expert on Aztec culture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you gave him his own pyramid?\u201d He glanced at the intricate carvings in the stone. \u201cHow did you get it here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a replica, Andrew.\u201d She moved toward an opening in the center of the lowest level.</p><p>He caught her arm before she went inside. \u201cHow can he live in something like this? It doesn\u2019t even have windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaves me the annoyance of having to wash them, my boy.\u201d A tall, slim man stepped out of the shadowy interior and smiled at Drew. \u201cYou\u2019ll be Agent Frasier.\u201d He extended his arm. \u201cFoster Stanton, at your service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Stanton.\u201d He accepted the handshake, which was as guileless as the other man\u2019s expression. \u201cThis is some place you have here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI found myself inspired by the Barcel\u00f3 Karmina Palace hotel. Since that was modeled after a Mayan temple, I felt the Aztecs merited a similar homage.\u201d He swept an arm in a theatrical gesture. \u201cPlease, I\u2019ve a lovely tea waiting for us. Do come inside.\u201d</p><p>Drew couldn\u2019t think of anything he wanted to do less than have tea inside the pseudo temple, but Gracie had already disappeared inside, leaving him with the smiling Englishman. Instinctively he scanned the immediate area, his mind reaching out for any copper he could use, but the house and the surrounding grounds seemed completely devoid of it and all other metals.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a touch claustrophobic, old boy,\u201d Stanton said, \u201cwe can talk out here.\u201d</p><p>His polite offer made Drew feel like a paranoid moron. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Stanton showed off his long white teeth. \u201cThen follow me to the best homemade crumpets you\u2019ll find this side of Devonshire.\u201d</p><p>The interior of the structure was a series of high stone corridors illuminated by freestanding halogen lamps fashioned to look like burning torches. Aztec artifacts occupied most of the curved, lighted niches in the walls, but as Drew passed and got a closer look at them, he realized they were too new to be anything but replicas. From the dust patterns in the empty niches it was clear that several had been recently removed.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you switch from archaeology to bird-watching?\u201d he asked the Englishman.</p><p>\u201cI discovered I had an affinity for our feathered friends,\u201d Stanton told him. \u201cI wasted much of my youth scrabbling after bits and baubles left behind in forgotten tombs. The only history of any real value is that which we make ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Drew eyed a tall stone vase from which golden peacock feathers sprouted, and frowned. \u201cHow do birds factor into your philosophy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen nearly every other living thing on the Earth became extinct, birds survived by evolving and occupying the skies.\u201d The Englishman\u2019s voice took on a dreamy softness. \u201cThey\u2019ve become the watchers of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess they have.\u201d Stanton, Drew decided, had spent too many months behind his binoculars. His attention was diverted as they entered a wide, circular room furnished like the lobby of an exclusive hotel. Gracie stood by a wheeled cart while she filled three delicate porcelain cups with tea from a matching pot. On a low table an assortment of platters held cakes, pastries, and finger sandwiches.</p><p>Drew saw another woman walking out of the room: a younger girl dressed in a white blouse and black shirt. Another woman came in a few moments later carrying another plate of fruit. She was older than the first but wore the same garments, as if they were some type of uniform.</p><p>\u201cGracias, Conchita,\u201d Stanton said to her. \u201cThat will be all.\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded and left just as silently as the girl had, her movements as slow as if she were walking through water.</p><p>\u201cIs that your wife and daughter?\u201d Drew asked.</p><p>\u201cGod, no. They\u2019re part of my staff.\u201d Stanton accepted a cup from Gracie and sat down in one of the tapestry-covered chairs. \u201cYou really must try the crumpets. They\u2019re obscenely appetizing.\u201d</p><p>When Gracie tried to give him a cup of tea, Drew shook his head. \u201cI thought you were a recluse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy studies require a great deal of my time.\u201d He sipped from his cup before setting it down. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t deny an old man some creature comforts?\u201d</p><p>For the first time Drew realized just how young Stanton looked; he couldn\u2019t be a day over thirty. \u201cAgent Flores said you\u2019ve been living in Mexico since the seventies. Did you come here with your parents when you were a kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d Stanton sat back. \u201cDo you have any children, Agent Frasier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m single.\u201d Drew glanced at Gracie, who remained waiting by the cart as if she were just another servant. \u201cDr. Stanton, we came here looking for some Americans who were kidnapped. Have you seen any strange boats in the area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince my island borders the reserve area around Las Islas Revillagigedo, I don\u2019t see many boats at all,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cHowever, my employer recently took a tour of the islands and mentioned seeing a boat docked at one of the islands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Drew asked.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say, now that I think about it. But never fear.\u201d The Englishman smiled. \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us tonight, and you can ask him yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d Drew turned to Gracie. \u201cIf we leave now, we should be able to check all of the islands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave before dinner. Conchita,\u201d Stanton called out, and when the older woman appeared, he asked, \u201cWhat are you preparing for the evening meal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamarones rancheros, se\u00f1or,\u201d the woman said, staring at the floor.</p><p>\u201cAh, shrimp saut\u00e9ed with vegetables and spices\u2014one of her finest dishes,\u201d Stanton said, sounding pleased, and shooed away the servant. \u201cQuite worth the wait, Agent Frasier, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>As Conchita passed Drew, he saw a mark on the side of her neck: a light brownish yellow bruise surrounding two small round scabs. \u201cMaybe another time, thanks. Agent Flores?\u201d</p><p>Gracie gave Stanton a strange look. \u201cWe could return in a few hours to have dinner with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven the amount of agitation Agent Frasier is trying so valiantly to conceal, I think that highly unlikely, my dear. We will have to resort to plan B.\u201d The Englishman rose and nodded past Drew, who turned to see two men armed with steel machetes.</p><p>Drew finally understood the missing artifacts, and why he couldn\u2019t sense any copper around him. Before they arrived, Stanton must have removed everything Drew might use with his ability.</p><p>\u201cWhy the elaborate charade?\u201d he asked the Englishman. \u201cYou could have had her kill me on the boat.\u201d</p><p>Gracie started to say something, and then shook her head before she spoke to Stanton in rapid Spanish.</p><p>\u201cOur dear Agraciana is many things, Mr. Riordan, but she\u2019s not an assassin,\u201d Stanton told him. \u201cAs it happens, she has gone to great lengths to see to it that you live a very long and extremely pleasant life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what your boss told you?\u201d Drew demanded. \u201cGenaro lied. He only wants revenge, and my DNA. He\u2019ll cut my throat the minute you turn me over to him, and then kill the rest of you to cover his tracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFortunately for all of us we don\u2019t work for Jonah Genaro. But we\u2019ll discuss that later, over dinner.\u201d Stanton nodded to the men who flanked Drew. \u201cTake him downstairs and lock him up.\u201d</p><p>The gleam of the sharp machete blades and the confident grip of the hands holding them convinced Drew that making a break for it was not an option. That left Gracie, who accompanied them to a stairwell in the outer corridor.</p><p>\u201cWhatever fairy tale Stanton told you is bullshit,\u201d he said as she climbed down the steps in front of him. \u201cI know too much about your operation now. He can\u2019t afford to let me live.\u201d</p><p>Gracie didn\u2019t reply, and once they reached the bottom of the stairs she switched on a light, illuminating a damp stone cellar and a row of human-size cages.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Drew said, eyeing some irregular dark stains on the stone floors inside the steel cages. From them he sensed minute traces of copper mixed with another metal, and guessed they were blood. \u201cWhat\u2019s next on the agenda? Interrogation? A beating? Both?\u201d</p><p>Gracie unlocked the center cage and held the barred door open. \u201cInside. Now.\u201d</p><p>He moved into the cell, watching as she locked him in and spoke to the guards, who retreated back upstairs. \u201cDoes Papi know you use his boat to do Stanton\u2019s dirty work, or do you lie to him, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father knows.\u201d She turned her back on him. \u201cIf you cooperate, you will not be hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for that.\u201d He paced around the small space, trailing his fingers across the bars. \u201cI appreciate the meaningless sex, though. Every guy should have one last decent bang before he\u2019s executed and cut up for spare parts. Is there a bonus involved, or was fucking me expected as part of services rendered?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drew expected Gracie to shout, or laugh at him, or leave him to rot. Instead she came over to his cage, gripping the bars as she pressed her brow against them; her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cI was six years old when they took my mother,\u201d she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \u201cShe went to work one morning and I never saw her again. When I was old enough to be useful, Stanton came to see Papi. He showed him pictures of Mama. She was older, but we recognized her. She was taking care of some American children. He said as long as we did what we were told, Mama would be safe.\u201d She opened her eyes. \u201cI did not marry Eduardo. I went away to school, and earned my degree, and took a job in the city.\u201d</p><p>His anger wavered. \u201cSo they forced you to become a civil servant and protect the environment. Any particular reason why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStanton promised me all I would have to do was protect the islands and the other children.\u201d Her hands slipped down the bars. \u201cAs soon as you told me what you were, I had no choice. No one can lie to our master. He looks into our minds. He knows everything the children think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat children are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Your friends. The others like you.\u201d Slowly she pulled up her sleeve and turned her forearm over, using her nails to dig into and then peel away a layer of flesh-colored latex. Beneath it was an old tattoo of a stylized dolphin. \u201cAnd me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been at this all day,\u201d Samuel said from the doorway of the treatment room. \u201cYou should stop for the night and go to bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhile you run off by yourself to meet the boys at the mystery cave?\u201d Charlotte placed some rolled bandages on a shelf according to size. \u201cYeah, I should sleep like a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201d He noticed the towels she had folded and placed on the counter next to an instrument tray. \u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are eleven, possibly twelve, pregnant women on this island, Sam. Any or all of them could require medical treatment at any moment.\u201d She closed the cabinet. \u201cSince I\u2019m the only one who can do that, I have to be ready.\u201d</p><p>She had been on edge ever since last night, when he had suggested their first meeting had been at the lab where as infants they had been genetically altered. Samuel knew the shared memories had disturbed her, but when he\u2019d tried to discuss them, she\u2019d told him she was too tired. When he\u2019d woken up to a half-empty bed, he\u2019d found her using the lab equipment in the treatment room.</p><p>Now he glanced at the slides and vials she had placed in a rack beside the microscope. Each was stained dark red. \u201cYou\u2019ve been testing blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took a sample from each of the bags.\u201d She picked up a clipboard. \u201cAll of it is human, disease-free, and type O negative.\u201d</p> <p>His brows rose. \u201cWe all share the same blood type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry; that\u2019s all we have in common.\u201d She gestured toward a complicated-looking piece of equipment. \u201cThat uses microfluidics and nanotechnology to pull DNA from a blood sample and type the sequences. None of us are related.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drew some blood samples from you the first night we were here,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAfter what we remembered last night, I\u2019m very glad that I did.\u201d</p><p>Now he understood why she had been so distant. \u201cYou thought we might be siblings. Charlotte, we look nothing alike.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cBrothers and sisters don\u2019t always resemble one another, and considering we\u2019re both larger than average, I had to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel better now that you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She tossed the clipboard on the counter and headed for the door. \u201cDo you want to eat before you leave? I can throw together a salad or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d He moved into her path. \u201cWhat else is bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She came up short. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you alone like this,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ll skip going to the cave and instead follow you around the villa and harass you unmercifully for the remainder of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you will. I had to get stuck on Pregnancy Island with the only man in the world who wants to talk about my feelings.\u201d She shoved him aside and stalked down the hall to the master suite.</p><p>Samuel followed her, and watched from the doorway as she began tearing apart the bed. \u201cAm I sleeping on the couch?\u201d</p><p>She ignored him as she tossed aside the coverlet and sheets. When he came over to her, she glared at him. \u201cWill you just stop? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me help you.\u201d He removed the fitted sheet to reveal the bloodstained mattress.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s expression changed, and she climbed onto the mattress, stretching out in the center and looking down at one particular stain. She sat up quickly. \u201cThat son of a bitch.\u201d She stood up, walking off the mattress.</p><p>Samuel glanced at the stain, which was located halfway down the left side of the mattress. He could touch it and discover exactly whose it was and how it had gotten there, but Charlotte appeared to already know. He went to stand beside her at the glass wall, where she was staring out into the night.</p><p>\u201cI always check myself twice a week,\u201d she said in a hollow voice. \u201cI forgot until this morning, and when I felt for the strings they weren\u2019t there. So I ran an ultrasound on myself, and my uterus was empty. It\u2019s gone. Under the circumstances I should have expected it, but things have been so insane that I didn\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but what\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy IUD.\u201d She gave him an ironic look. \u201cThey must have removed it here while I was unconscious. That\u2019s my blood on the left side of the mattress.\u201d</p><p>Samuel slipped his arm around her waist, and after a moment she rested her head against his shoulder. \u201cHow much time do we have before you could conceive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. It\u2019s not like the pill,\u201d she added. \u201cOnce it\u2019s out, I\u2019m unprotected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could be pregnant now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I am, I won\u2019t test positive for a couple more days. And if we keep having sex . . .\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>Samuel knew beneath the anger she was frightened, enough that she might consider taking desperate measures. \u201cHoney, listen to me. If you discover that you are carrying my child, I want to know. Before you decide to do anything about it, please talk to me.\u201d</p><p>She looked puzzled for a moment, and then her expression filled with disgust. \u201cMy God. You think I\u2019d abort our baby without telling you? What kind of woman do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>The tightness in his chest eased. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has the right to force us to have a child,\u201d she snapped. \u201cBy doing this they\u2019ve violated both of us. But if there is going to be a baby, Sam\u2014and there probably will be\u2014then it belongs to us, not them. We have the responsibility, and we decide what to do about it, together.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t mean to say it, but the words spilled from him. \u201cI want our child to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d She gave him a tired smile. \u201cNow go talk to the friendly natives, and find a way to get us the hell off this island.\u201d</p><p>Drew sat in one corner of the cage and watched a beetle creeping down one of the bars. Dusty threads from an old spider\u2019s web clung to its legs and wound around its dark green carapace, hampering its movements. He reached out as it slipped and caught it in the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cNothing to eat down here, pal,\u201d he said, and he gently freed it from the webbing. \u201cNot yet, anyway.\u201d</p><p>With no windows, the only light in the room came from the single bulb hanging overhead, but Drew\u2019s Takyn abilities included an acute sense of night and day, and told him the sun would be setting in a few minutes. His imagination kept bouncing between two images: the dolphin tattooed on Gracie\u2019s forearm, and the bruised wounds on Conchita\u2019s neck.</p><p>Dinnertime.</p><p>To build even a small replica of an Aztec temple required serious money, as did collecting artifacts made from pure gold and kidnapping Americans right off the street. Gracie had called the mystery man \u201cthe master,\u201d and claimed he could read her mind. It all added up to one big, ugly reality that Drew wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to face.</p><p>\u201cIf you see Samuel, tell him I\u2019m sorry I screwed up,\u201d he told the beetle as he set it on the floor. \u201cBut don\u2019t mention it was because of a girl. That\u2019ll make me look like a real chump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew, it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>He looked up to see Gracie unlocking the door to his cage. Her face appeared pale and drawn, but there were no marks on her neck. But then, why did he care if there were? \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe master is here.\u201d She opened the door. \u201cHe wishes to see you.\u201d</p><p>He eyed the two armed men standing behind her. \u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they will hit you and drag you upstairs,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>He stood and stepped out, recoiling a little as she took hold of his arm. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make a run for it,\u201d he lied.</p><p>\u201cThe master would never let you escape.\u201d She pressed her forearm against his and curled her fingers over his palm, and that was when he felt the length of the blade under her sleeve, and the tingle that told him it was made of solid copper. \u201cYou must accept this if you want to live.\u201d</p><p>Drew moved closer, using his body to hide her arm from the guards. \u201cSo it\u2019s do or die, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will have only one chance to do the right thing.\u201d She fiddled with her hair, dropping her hand long enough to slip the copper dagger from her sleeve to his before she moved ahead of him. \u201cI hope you will.\u201d</p><p>Drew dropped his arm to his side as he used his ability to reshape the copper blade into a cuff of metal wrapped around his wrist. The leather-and-wood hilt he slipped into his pocket as they made their way into a wide, dark room lit by burning torches. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stanton had installed a shallow indoor pool in the center of the room and edged it with a deck of tiny, brightly colored tiles that formed an intricate mosaic of a flowering garden. Reflected on the surface of the pool was a wall made up of curved, shallow recesses. Only a dozen or so were illuminated by built-in lights, but those held small, primitive ceramic statues of male and female figures, each with the head of an animal.</p><p>Drew saw Stanton behind a sheer curtain at the other end of the pool, where he was handing an ornate goblet to a large, shadowy figure sitting on an odd-looking bench. The Englishman spoke in a low voice to the shadow before he emerged and dismissed the guards.</p><p>\u201cMr. Riordan.\u201d Stanton offered him a chilly smile. \u201cOur most gracious master has decided to forgive you for your transgressions against him, and will permit you to rejoin your brothers and sisters. From this day he expects you to serve him with the love and the loyalty of a devoted son.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe does.\u201d Drew glanced at the curtain. \u201cMaybe you should tell him that I\u2019m an only child, I already have a terrific father, and . . . oh, yeah. I don\u2019t serve bloodsucking monsters.\u201d</p><p>Stanton scowled, but before he could speak, a deep, rasping laugh echoed around the room.</p><p>\u201cThis one has a bold heart,\u201d the laughing voice said in heavily accented English. The figure lumbered to his feet, sweeping aside the curtain with a flick of his hand. \u201cCome closer, boy. See what the beautiful path makes of a god.\u201d</p><p>At first Drew thought the flickering of the torches made the peculiar patterns of light and shadow on the towering body approaching him. The man appeared to have painted his skin white and black, and bedecked himself with so much heavy jewelry that his movements sounded metallic. Then Drew saw that his skin wasn\u2019t painted, and the gold on his body wasn\u2019t jewelry.</p><p>The gold was his body.</p> <p>What might have once been human stood nearly seven feet tall and wore an open white linen robe over a black loincloth. His legs and arms were partly covered in pale, dead-looking flesh that had turned black around the rough gold that formed his joints and most of his muscle. From collarbones to waist no skin was visible; his torso appeared to be solid metal. Gold also slashed across his face, covering one eye and bisecting his nose and one corner of his mouth. The hair growing from his scalp fell around his ghastly face in long, two-toned strands that were black hair at the roots and then became thin gold wire.</p><p>Drew expected to smell decay from the exposed dead tissue, but the only scent that came from the master was hot and acrid, the way metal smelled when it overheated.</p><p>Suddenly the copper Gracie had slipped him felt too tight around his wrist. \u201cHow did this happen to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot easily.\u201d The bottom half of the master\u2019s ravaged face split to show two rows of golden teeth. \u201cYou are not afraid? Most men cower when they look upon me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can cringe and whimper with the best of them,\u201d Drew said, \u201cbut I\u2019m more interested in finding out what\u2019s happened to my friends. Did you abduct them? Are they here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Taske and Ms. Marena have joined the master\u2019s other children,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen to it that they now have a very happy and comfortable life together. Don\u2019t you agree, Agraciana?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Gracie, who stood pale and silent beside Drew, looked at the floor. \u201cThe master is very good to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo good he has to kidnap people to get them to join the family?\u201d Drew looked into the golden eye of the living statue. \u201cWhat\u2019s really going on? Are you keeping them somewhere so you can feed on their blood? Is that how you\u2019re able to live in this condition?\u201d</p><p>The master laughed again. \u201cI am a god, boy. When Cort\u00e9s realized he could not end my life, he had his men dig deep beneath the temple, and there put me in the ground. Five hundred years I lay trapped in the earth, waiting for my children to come for me. But I was forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found him under a temple some workers uncovered in Mexico City,\u201d Stanton said, his voice filled with pride. \u201cIt was my blood that brought the master back to life.\u201d</p><p>Drew had never been much of a history buff, but even he remembered the name Cort\u00e9s. \u201cSo you were an Aztec.\u201d</p><p>Gracie drew in a quick breath, and the master\u2019s smile faded.</p><p>\u201cThis is the last king of the Aztecs, Mr. Riordan.\u201d Stanton gave Drew a pitying look. \u201cThis is Motecuhzoma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the past,\u201d the master said, making a dismissive gesture. \u201cNow I am Energ\u00fameno, returned to life and restored to my people. I have found my children, and saved them from the dogs who would butcher them. With my protection and care they will be safe, and in return, they will give me back my House of Eagles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Eagles were once the king\u2019s warriors,\u201d Stanton explained. \u201cThey devoted their lives to battle in his name.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s stomach turned. \u201cHarvesting their DNA to make your Eagle soldiers is a waste of time. My ex-boss has been trying to do the same thing for years, and he still isn\u2019t able to make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not cutting them up the way Mr. Genaro does, Mr. Riordan,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cWe\u2019re allowing them to reproduce naturally. This guarantees that their offspring will inherit their unique attributes.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cAre you saying that you\u2019re breeding them? Like farm animals?\u201d</p><p>The Englishman shrugged. \u201cIn a few weeks the first child will be born, at which time it will be brought to the master to be trained as its parents were. As soon as the rest of the women give birth, we will take their children, switch their partners, and begin again. Within fifty years we will rebuild the House of Eagles with an army of superhuman warriors, ready to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo fight for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy kingdom,\u201d Energ\u00fameno said.</p><p>\u201cOur warriors will take back the land stolen by Cort\u00e9s and those who came after him,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cWhen Mexico has been purged of outsiders and interlopers, then he who was Motecuhzoma will resume his rule. Your sons and daughters will be among those who restore our king to his throne, Mr. Riordan. They will change history.\u201d</p><p>Digging up the rotting Aztec vampire had probably driven Stanton crazy, Drew decided, and abandoned the idea of reasoning with him. \u201cLook, Your Majesty,\u201d he said to Energ\u00fameno, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what was done to you. No one should be made to suffer. . . .\u201d He gestured toward the vampire\u2019s grotesque body. \u201cBut this happened hundreds of years ago, and the men who invaded your kingdom are all dead. The world has changed and moved on. We\u2019re civilized now. No one goes around conquering other countries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Energ\u00fameno seemed amused. \u201cI have been watching man since I was set free, and it seems that very little has changed since my first rule. You have better weapons and larger armies, but you still battle over land and power. You invade distant lands and kill those who oppose you. I have watched these wars being fought on your television. CNN.\u201d</p><p>Drew felt frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, boy. When it comes to war, it is always very simple. What you take belongs to you.\u201d He made a sweeping gesture. \u201cThis land and its people are mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter who you were, the Mexican government won\u2019t hand their country over to you,\u201d Drew warned. \u201cThey have their own military, and they can call on the American government for help. Your \u2018children\u2019 may have powerful abilities, but they\u2019re no match for the kind of weaponry used today. Don\u2019t start a war you can never win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already begun, and we are winning,\u201d Stanton said smugly. \u201cThe master has brought all of the major drug traffickers in Mexico under his control, and is using them to eliminate their smaller competitors and take over key territories. Doubtless you\u2019ve seen the news reports about how vicious the street fighting has become over the last few years. The effectiveness of our campaign has convinced authorities on both sides of the border to virtually abandon these regions. Once the police and the foreigners retreat, our patrols see to it that they don\u2019t return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can live the life of a prince, boy,\u201d Energ\u00fameno said. \u201cOr I can feed on you until your veins run dry. How will it be?\u201d</p><p>The thought of Mexico being gradually turned back into the Aztec empire seemed as improbable as America handing its states back to the British. But an hour ago Drew would never have believed anyone, human or otherwise, could survive being buried alive for five centuries. Stanton couldn\u2019t pull off this war on his own; without Energ\u00fameno, he would be powerless. And while Drew had never used his talent to kill, he knew he couldn\u2019t permit the vampire to force the Takyn to breed his new army.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the master,\u201d the Englishman snapped.</p><p>The dark kyn are difficult, but not impossible, to destroy, Matthias had once told him. Some of the old texts claim that a dark metal is poisonous to them, and that complete decapitation will kill them.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind being treated like a prince.\u201d The copper band around Drew\u2019s wrist grew warm as he used his ability to fold it over and over, increasing the metal\u2019s density as much as he could before stretching it out into a razor-edged, foot-long blade. \u201cDo I get to pick out my own princess?\u201d</p><p>Gracie turned and slapped his face, at the same time giving him a desperate look. He nodded slightly and let her shove him away from her. As he pretended to stumble toward Energ\u00fameno, the copper blade tore through his sleeve before whirling across the space between them.</p><p>The Aztec shouted as he threw up his arm and the blade buried itself in a section of decaying flesh. Yellow-streaked blood poured from the wound as Drew pulled the blade back and brought it around, this time sending it toward the vampire\u2019s neck.</p><p>As Stanton shouted and lunged at Drew, Energ\u00fameno moved in a blur of motion, seizing Gracie and using her body as a shield for his own.</p><p>\u201cDrop the blade.\u201d Golden knuckles bulged as the vampire clamped his hand over Gracie\u2019s mouth. \u201cOr I will tear off her head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drew knew that if he didn\u2019t act now, he would probably never get another chance. He also knew he wasn\u2019t fast enough to take off Energ\u00fameno\u2019s head before the vampire did the same to Gracie.</p><p>Logic dictated his choice, but love made it for him.</p><p>The copper blade hung motionless for a moment before Drew released it from his control and it fell to the stone floor.</p> <p>Energ\u00fameno heaved Gracie at Stanton, who ripped the scarf from her throat and stuffed it into her mouth. As he pinned her arms behind her he said, \u201cI will kill them for you, master. You can watch as I drain their blood and feed their carcasses to the fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t Agraciana\u2019s idea,\u201d Drew said. \u201cI used my ability and forced her to do it.\u201d</p><p>Gracie uttered a muffled shriek as the vampire grabbed the front of Drew\u2019s shirt, lifting him off his feet and spattering the front of his shirt with the odd-colored blood dripping from his wound.</p><p>\u201cThis one has value to me,\u201d Energ\u00fameno said. \u201cHis sons will become my personal guard, and his daughters will serve as my concubines.\u201d He glanced at Gracie. \u201cSince he has already chosen his woman, she can bear them for me.\u201d He threw Drew to the ground and stepped over him. \u201cTake them to the island.\u201d</p><p>Samuel slipped out of the villa just after sunset to meet with the other men, and while Charlie was tempted to follow him, she knew she had to keep up an act for the security cameras. So she tidied their bedroom, cleaned and sterilized the test materials she had used in the treatment room, and then moved down to the kitchen to start making a vegetable stew for their evening meal.</p> <p>Giving herself busywork didn\u2019t stop her from brooding over the possibility that she was pregnant. Some women claimed they knew the moment they conceived, but Charlie didn\u2019t feel any different from the way she had before they were abducted. It was also the wrong time of month for her to be fertile; her MC always ran like clockwork. According to her mental calendar she wouldn\u2019t ovulate for another week.</p><p>I should have told him that, she thought as she added some chopped tomato to the pot of boiling water. But then I wouldn\u2019t know how he felt about having a baby with me.</p><p>Children had always been in her plans for the future, but only as part of her professional career. Ob-gyn had always been Charlie\u2019s calling, and she had spent all of her spare time studying and acquiring the certifications and licensing she needed to go into practice as a midwife. Seeing patients through the long, uncomfortable months of pregnancy and helping them bring their babies into the world was the kind of work she had wanted to do since the very first infant she had delivered.</p><p>Sharing in those small miracles would also make up for the fact that there would never be any of her own.</p><p>The experiments performed on Charlie had saddled her with an unwanted ability and an irreversible genetic taint; she had always considered it a moral imperative to ensure that she remained childless. Being Takyn had also ruled out the possibility of adoption; as long as there were men like Genaro eager to exploit her gift, any child she brought into her home would never be safe.</p><p>Making those decisions had been wrenching, but had also given Charlie a sense of security. Now Segundo had stolen that from her.</p> <p>That was what Samuel could never understand: just how deeply violated Charlie felt. Assuming she was still protected had made becoming Samuel\u2019s lover a little easier for her; discovering her IUD had been removed had brought everything crashing down on her head. If she hadn\u2019t already conceived, every time they had sex the odds that she would become pregnant would multiply exponentially.</p><p>And we will be having sex, she reminded herself viciously. Every day, or Segundo hands me over to the guards.</p><p>A hissing sound brought her back to the reality of her stew boiling over the sides of the pot. Quickly she turned down the heat and reached for the paper towels. Her hand faltered as fear and despair spread through her thoughts, as black as a cloud of ink in clear water.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have a baby on this island. Not against her will. Not knowing that the moment it was born Segundo would take it away from her. Nor could she abort her own baby, or kill it after it was born.</p><p>Charlie walked slowly out of the kitchen, blindly following the wordless thought stream in her head. It dragged her feet across the glass floor and into the red living room, where she went to the largest of the windows and opened it.</p><p>The sound and smell of the sea came rushing in with the night breeze, cooling her hot face and the stinging tears beading on her lashes. The only place she had ever felt safe was in the water, where nothing mattered but time and tide. The problems that seemed so enormous on land melted away in the sea, which did not care about them or her. To the water she was something to be swept away, filled and taken apart, until her bones sank and buried themselves in the rich silt.</p><p>She heard a low, almost monotonous keening sound coming from her throat as she wrapped her arms around her waist and rocked, heel to toe.</p><p>Charlie immersed herself in the overwhelming bleakness, allowing it to settle over her so that it dissolved away the ravenous fear that had been tearing at her heart for months. Her hand crept to her belly, and while she didn\u2019t understand why it was flat instead of swollen, she could feel the life kicking inside her. She couldn\u2019t go on like this; it had to end as it should have, in the darkness of the sea she loved, where she would walk into the waves and swim out into the night, away from the island and everyone on it, until she was too tired to turn around and make it back to shore. . . .</p> <p>But I hate the water.</p><p>It was seeing her hand on the doorknob that wrenched her out of the thought stream, and Charlie staggered back, one hand over her mouth as bile surged in her throat. Her shoulders struck the wall, and she slid down, pressing the heels of her palms to her eyes until the last echo of the other, suicidal mind dissipated.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, no.\u201d She struggled to her feet. \u201cPici.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>The trek to the cave gave Samuel a tour of the island\u2019s flora, although he had yet to encounter any animals other than birds. Insects and reptiles were also noticeably absent, as were any signs of previous occupation. While the brush and trees grew in thick profusion, enough so that they regularly hampered his progress, the layer of decaying vegetation on the ground seemed remarkably thin.</p><p>He stopped in a gap between some palmetto plants and knelt down, gathering up a handful of the browned, fan-shaped leaves they had shed. Beneath them he found no ants, maggots, or other insects; only bits of twig and crushed shells speckled the brown dirt. On impulse he tossed aside the leaves and dug his fingers into the soil, scooping away a handful. The new layer he exposed appeared comprised of small, light brown leaves and larger chunks of silvery wood, with hardly any soil at all.</p><p>Not soil, but mulch.</p><p>Samuel kept digging down, finding a layer of gray-white gravel under the mulch. Beneath that his fingers uncovered black powder mixed with dark gray ash.</p><p>He brought a pinch of it to his nose. \u201cCharcoal?\u201d</p><p>The walls of the small hole he\u2019d dug grew wet and began to collapse in a puddle of dark brown mud. He thrust his hand in one last time, feeling for the next layer and grabbing a handful of it. When he brought his hand out of the tannin-tinted water, he saw that he held a chunk of thin, tightly compacted rotting paper.</p><p>The newspaper pages were falling apart into a pulpy sludge, but he could still make out some of the print, and a date: 29 Septiembre 1989.</p><p>Samuel sat down beside the hole, dropping the decomposing newspaper onto the ground as he looked around him again. It took thousands, perhaps millions, of years for the Earth to form an island, usually from the eruption of an underwater volcano or the accumulation of seashells deposited on shallow-water reefs, where they were cemented together by coral.</p><p>This island was neither.</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at Colotl\u2019s dark, frowning face, and watched as Tlemi emerged from behind him. Both of the islanders carried bags made of net and filled with folded cloth.</p><p>\u201cWhy you dig ground?\u201d Tlemi asked. \u201cWe wait; we think you not find cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found something else.\u201d He stood and brushed off his hands. \u201cThe master made this island, didn\u2019t he? It\u2019s some kind of artificial habitat.\u201d</p><p>Tlemi looked helpless as she shook her head, obviously not understanding him.</p><p>Colotl\u2019s eyes shifted to the hole in the ground, and he muttered as he bent to fill it back in and cover the spot with a palmetto leaf.</p><p>\u201cNo dig holes in island, Samuel,\u201d Tlemi said. She pointed to the ground and then pinched her nose as she grimaced. \u201cBring bad smell, make us sick.\u201d</p><p>He turned to Colotl and made a broad gesture. \u201cThe whole island\u201d\u2014he pointed to the covered hole\u2014\u201cis like this?\u201d</p><p>Colotl hesitated, and then nodded.</p><p>The implications made his stomach turn. \u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>Tlemi touched his arm. \u201cWe go to cave, talk safe there.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and followed the islanders through the brush until they reached a densely wooded thicket of pine. In the center of it a twenty-foot-tall, grass- and vine-covered mound rose, and it looked impenetrable until Colotl took hold of a section of dead vines that turned out to be woven over a bamboo frame. Behind it a narrow opening led into the mound.</p><p>Samuel saw flickering light and stepped inside. The gap was so narrow he had to turn sideways to fit through, but after several feet it opened out into a wide area of rough stone surrounding a bubbling spring.</p><p>The water here was clear and smelled sweet. Samuel nodded to the other men standing around it as he knelt down and looked at his reflection. Beneath the surface a series of white PVC pipes fed streams of fast-moving water into the pool.</p><p>None of it made any sense to him. \u201cWhy did the master make this cave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiniz, Colotl make,\u201d Tlemi said as she took a napkin from her bag. \u201cClean water to drink.\u201d</p><p>She opened the napkin, which had been embroidered with an outline of the island, inside which were a dozen circles around specific symbols. The circle representing the cave had three wavy lines inside it; others held different geometric shapes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tlemi pointed to the wavy lines. \u201cWater.\u201d She moved her fingertip to the others. \u201cFood, cloth, blade, club, arrow, spear. We make, hide. Save for leave island.\u201d</p><p>Samuel tapped the symbol she had identified as \u201cblade.\u201d \u201cHow many of these did you hide here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI not know number words. Every moon make two. Now have this many.\u201d She held up all her fingers, curled them over, and extended five on one hand and one on the other.</p> <p>Sixteen blades would arm everyone on the island, but they wouldn\u2019t be enough to overcome Segundo\u2019s guns. \u201cHow many of the other weapons did you make?\u201d</p><p>One of the men said something to Colotl, who went over to speak in a low voice to him.</p><p>\u201cSame as blades. Make two, every moon.\u201d She took out another napkin and opened it to show the island embroidered again, but this time with a network of lines that indicated the topographical features. At three points around the island, stitched lines radiated out, ending in small crescents.</p><p>\u201cSegundo boats.\u201d Tlemi pointed to the crescent shapes, and then traced the stitched lines over to the outer edge of the island. \u201cCome this way.\u201d She tapped a ridge of lines on the island parallel to the approach. \u201cWait, watch here. Segundo come, use arrow, fire.\u201d She made an arc with her finger from the ridge to the crescent.</p><p>Samuel shook his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t burn the boat; we\u2019ll need it to get everyone off the island.\u201d</p> <p>Colotl rejoined them. \u201cSamuel.\u201d He turned and spoke quickly to Tlemi, who argued with him before heaving a sigh.</p><p>\u201cLiniz, Ihiyo worry.\u201d She touched her lips. \u201cYou open mouth, show teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe men want to look at my teeth?\u201d he asked, just to be sure. When she nodded, he stepped forward into the light, turning to Colotl as he opened his mouth.</p><p>The islander bent his head to look inside, and then gestured for Liniz and Ihiyo, who came over and did the same before Ihiyo muttered something.</p><p>Colotl drew the blade from his belt, but instead of attacking Samuel he slashed it across his palm and held the bleeding wound up in front of Ihiyo\u2019s face.</p><p>Samuel held still. \u201cWhat is he doing, Tlemi?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShowing Ihiyo blood not make you change.\u201d She gave him a hesitant look. \u201cYou no want drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t drink blood.\u201d And why would Ihiyo and Liniz think he would?</p><p>Before Samuel could ask, scuffling footsteps came from the outer passage. Instantly the men spread out while Colotl pushed Tlemi behind him.</p><p>Charlotte emerged into the cave, her hair a wild tangle, her face shiny with sweat. \u201cThank God.\u201d She hurried over to Tlemi. \u201cWhere is Pici?\u201d</p><p>Her question caused Ihiyo to surge forward, but Colotl caught his arm.</p><p>\u201cPici sleep,\u201d Tlemi said.</p><p>Charlotte shook her head. \u201cNo, she\u2019s wide-awake.\u201d She turned to Samuel. \u201cSomeone has to take me to her, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Charlotte?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy thought stream crossed hers, and I felt everything she was feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cPici is going to kill herself. Tonight.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Charlotte uttered Pici\u2019s name, Ihiyo shoved his way past them and ran out of the cave.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she called after him, and then turned to Samuel. \u201cShe\u2019s not inside. She\u2019s walking on the beach. I don\u2019t know where.\u201d</p><p>Her voice trembled, and Samuel realized Pici\u2019s decision to drown herself must have brought back memories of her adoptive father and the horror he had put her through on the bridge. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her in time,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Once they left the cave, Samuel scanned the surrounding area. Even if they all scattered, the island was too large for them to search every inch of shoreline. \u201cCharlotte, did she think of a particular place when she left the house? A favorite swimming spot, or a cove, or something?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cShe just kept walking and looking at the water.\u201d Her eyes shifted up. \u201cShe could see the moon, but that doesn\u2019t help.\u201d She closed her eyes and concentrated. \u201cDriftwood. She had to walk around piles of it.\u201d</p><p>Tlemi spoke quickly to Colotl, and then said to Samuel, \u201cWe know where she is.\u201d She pointed to the west side of the island. \u201cColotl will guide us there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll hold on to me,\u201d Charlotte said as they followed the islanders into the brush, \u201cI can try to reconnect to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d When she gave Samuel a surprised look, he added, \u201cThere are some things you should never have to feel again, honey, and this is one of them.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip before she nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not her fault. She\u2019s so young, and she\u2019s afraid for the baby.\u201d</p><p>Colotl guided them along a barely perceptible trail through several thickets and groves before the vegetation began to thin and Samuel could hear waves washing up on the sand. As they emerged into the open, Samuel saw Ihiyo running ahead of them toward the water. He was shouting Pici\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re too late,\u201d Charlotte whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not.\u201d Samuel kicked off his shoes and took off after Ihiyo.</p><p>Colotl and some of the other men followed him in, but as soon as Samuel dived into the waves he shot ahead of them, cleaving through the rough water with broad, powerful strokes. He passed Ihiyo, who was still shouting, and turned his head from side to side until he spotted her. She was already a hundred yards offshore and swimming steadily away from the island.</p><p>Samuel didn\u2019t waste his breath trying to call her back, but headed directly for her, crossing the distance between them as quickly as he could. Pici looked back, and when she saw him she stopped swimming and sank beneath the surface.</p><p>Water closed over Samuel\u2019s head as he submerged to go after her. Moonbeams filtered down around him, silvering the silhouette of an awkward shape. Bubbles poured from Pici\u2019s mouth as she rapidly sank toward the dark bottom.</p><p>Pressure became a vise around Samuel as he swam down after her, reaching out and snatching the drifting material of her robe and using it to pull her limp body into his arms. He kicked with all his strength, driving both of them rapidly toward the moonlight.</p><p>As his head broke the surface he dragged in oxygen, turning Pici so that her back was pressed to his chest. She didn\u2019t move for several moments, and then she coughed out some water and began breathing.</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d he told her when she made a weak attempt to push away his arm. Once he was sure he had a good grip on her, he used his free arm and his legs to propel them back toward the beach.</p><p>Colotl met him halfway to the shore and flanked Pici, helping to support her. He spoke sharply to her, but when she didn\u2019t respond he looked over her head at Samuel.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all right,\u201d he told the islander, nodding at the same time. \u201cCharlotte will look after her.\u201d</p><p>Ihiyo and the rest of the men converged on them as they reached the shallows, and Pici\u2019s distraught partner let out a terrible wail as he saw her condition.</p><p>\u201cTlemi,\u201d Samuel called. \u201cTell him she\u2019s alive. Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She pushed her way through the men and placed her hand on Pici\u2019s throat. \u201cLet\u2019s get her out of the water.\u201d</p><p>Samuel carried her up onto the sand, where several of the women had spread out some palm fronds. Remembering the recovery position Charlotte had used on Findley, he lowered Pici down gently onto her side.</p><p>Charlotte knelt beside her and checked her pulse, then put her ear to the other woman\u2019s chest and listened. \u201cHer lungs are clear.\u201d She placed her hands on the sides of Pici\u2019s distended belly, moving them slowly over the mound until she felt something. \u201cThe baby\u2019s active.\u201d</p><p>Ihiyo fell to the sand on the other side of Pici, his face stricken with fear.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get her warm and dry,\u201d Charlotte said to Tlemi. \u201cWhose house is nearest to here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d Tlemi told her, pointing past the driftwood piles.</p><p>Colotl helped Ihiyo to his feet while Samuel lifted Pici. The other islanders walked ahead, lighting their path with torches as they made their way down the beach.</p><p>Charlotte paced Samuel as she kept an eye on Pici\u2019s face. \u201cThis is not over yet,\u201d she murmured to him. \u201cI need to give her a complete examination and then monitor her for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are your concerns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside from the fact that she\u2019s suicidal, trauma like this often results in premature delivery.\u201d She glanced out at the water. \u201cIf she has the baby tonight, by tomorrow morning they\u2019ll know, and they\u2019ll come to take it.\u201d</p><p>Samuel looked down at Pici\u2019s young, pale face. \u201cNot if we convince them that she drowned herself tonight.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte stopped in her tracks and closed her eyes briefly before she turned to him. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could have given me superstrength.\u201d Drew crawled across the bottom of the hold. \u201cOr eyes that shoot laser beams. Yeah, that would be better; I\u2019d just have to wear sunglasses all the time. I look good in shades.\u201d</p><p>The nylon cords they\u2019d used to bind his wrists and ankles had been knotted so tightly they cut into his flesh with every move he made, but he ignored the discomfort as he inched across the rough planks toward the shape huddled in one corner. Gracie hadn\u2019t moved or spoken since the guards had tossed her below with him, but he was pretty sure she was conscious.</p><p>\u201cI bet you got a cool ability,\u201d he continued, wincing as his knee rammed into a nail head protruding from the deck. \u201cLike you can walk on water, or breathe it, or something like that, right?\u201d</p><p>Gracie uttered a muffled sob.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me anything right now. Unless you\u2019re a mermaid.\u201d He reached her, and shuffled around until he cradled her body with his. \u201cIf my kids are going to have fins or scales, I should know that now. I mean, after I figure a way to get that gag off you.\u201d</p><p>Gracie made a choking sound as she turned and pressed her face against his chest as she wept. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, sweetheart.\u201d He rubbed his cheek against her hair. \u201cI\u2019ll get us out of this.

At last she lifted her face, working her jaw until the gag slipped down over her chin.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Drew caught an edge of the scarf still stuffed in her mouth and tugged until it fell to the deck, and Gracie released a long, shuddering breath.</p> <p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re taking us to the island.\u201d Her voice rasped out the words.</p><p>\u201cIs this the same island where they dumped Samuel and Charlotte?\u201d He felt her nod. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cNo, Andrew, it is not good. It is the end of our freedom. We\u2019ll be kept there as prisoners, having children for the master until we die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you, that rotting piece of shit can\u2019t make us do anything.\u201d He pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She hiccuped a laugh. \u201cI gave up my life for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think you decided to take it back.\u201d He strained at the cords around his wrists again, and felt them loosen a little. \u201cSamuel Taske is one of the smartest men I know, and I\u2019m no slouch, either. So, tell me about the others like us. How many are on the island with my friends now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cThey lived with the master until a year ago, but he kept them secluded. I saw them a few times when I went to his estate at night. They are strange.\u201d</p><p>Drew had been counting on recruiting some of the former orphans. \u201cHow strange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey speak an old language\u2014he would not let them learn Spanish\u2014but it is how they walk and move and work. They do everything together, perfectly.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cAt first I thought they were like machines, but it is more than that. They act as a group, not as individual people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the master train them to do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Seeing them always made me think of a herd of wild horses running together, or a pack of wolves hunting down prey.\u201d She sighed. \u201cStanton said that I was supposed to be one of them, but something went wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>He almost had one hand freed. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think I can\u2019t do anything like the others. That I am defective.\u201d Her voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cBut they\u2019re wrong.\u201d She made a low, keening sound.</p><p>Drew went still as he heard a heavy thump on the outside of the hull. \u201cGracie, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLos delfines saved me when the men threw me away.\u201d As several other thuds sounded, she tucked her head under his chin. \u201cNow they always come when I call them.\u201d</p><p>He heard what sounded like high-pitched, chattering squeals, and remembered the tat on her forearm. \u201cAre you talking about dolphins?\u201d He felt her nod. \u201cYou can communicate with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can bring them to me, and make them do what I wish.\u201d She lifted her head. \u201cThey will ram the boat until it sinks. They will drown Segundo and the others. All I have to do is think it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means I\u2019ll die, too.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cI won\u2019t let them harm you. They will take us back to shore.\u201d</p><p>Drew yanked his hand out of the cords and touched her cheek. \u201cWe have to get to the island and free the others. Your ability can help them escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe others, they hate me because I am different, and because I have been serving the master,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cWhen they see me, they will kill me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the cords from his other wrist before he put his arms around her. \u201cThat walking corpse forced you to work for him. If they don\u2019t understand that, I\u2019ll be happy to explain it to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d Gracie let out another, lower sound, and the thuds on the hull stopped. \u201cWhen I\u2019m on land I can\u2019t call them, Andrew. It only works when I\u2019m in the water, or on it.\u201d</p><p>Drew heard the boat\u2019s engines throttling down. \u201cThen if things don\u2019t go well on the island, we\u2019ll go for a swim.\u201d</p><p>Light shone down on them as the door to the hold opened, and Drew put his hands behind his back, winding the cord between them.</p><p>\u201cStay behind me if you can,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>The machete twins had been sent down to retrieve them, and, after cutting the cords around their ankles, they hauled them up and gestured for them to go above.</p><p>Burning torches held by Segundo and the men illuminated the deck, which had been stripped of everything but the pilot\u2019s helm and a giant, ornate chair where Energ\u00fameno sat covered in a cloak of gilded white feathers.</p><p>The boat had been docked at a narrow, dark pier. Drew could see a ribbon of glittering sand and the silhouettes of palm trees. A bamboo-covered ridge rose some twenty feet above the shore, mostly covering some kind of dark structure, but there were no signs of light or life.</p><p>The vampire rose from his chair and walked to the stern. \u201cMy children do not come to greet me. Where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never come at night, master,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cThey are probably sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel them near. They do not sleep.\u201d Energ\u00fameno climbed out onto the deck and bellowed something in his native language, and then waited as if expecting a response.</p><p>Nothing moved or made a sound, but Gracie suddenly pushed Drew down on the deck.</p><p>Something hissed over Drew\u2019s head, and he saw a flaming arrow slam into the chest of one guard and knock him over the side. The night air became streaks of flame as more arrows appeared, some sizzling out in the water but others hitting the deck, the side of the boat, and the vampire\u2019s feathered cape.</p><p>Drew grabbed Gracie and dragged her behind the chair, looking around it as Energ\u00fameno tore off the flaming cloak and threw it in the water.</p><p>The pier began to rock wildly, the posts lifting as if trying to pull themselves out of the water.</p><p>\u201cTake off your shoes,\u201d he said as he pulled his off, and shrugged off his jacket.</p><p>Another guard fell to the deck, his clothes on fire, his hands clutching the arrow buried in his neck.</p><p>\u201cTime for a swim.\u201d Drew pulled Gracie behind the burning man and jumped over the side with her.</p><p>The shock of the cool seawater dissipated almost at once, and he put his arm around Gracie as he swam away from the boat. She kept pace with him, only tugging at his arm to steer him toward shore. Once they reached the shallows, he planted his feet and looked back to see Stanton using a fire extinguisher to put out the flaming deck, and the vampire striding across the undulating pier toward the shore, where a group of men carrying spears and clubs rushed out of the trees and surrounded him.</p><p>\u201cYou dare attack me?\u201d Energ\u00fameno shouted, outraged. \u201cI am your father.\u201d</p><p>The biggest of the men stepped forward and said in a calm voice, \u201cWe are your captives, not your children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Samuel.\u201d As Drew slogged the rest of the way through the water to the beach, he peered at the giant confronting the vampire. The man sounded like Samuel, but his beard was gone and so was his slow, limping gait. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>The vampire gestured all around them. \u201cI created this paradise so that you might live long and happy lives here. Is this not what a loving father provides?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou imprisoned us here. You\u2019ve treated us like animals,\u201d Samuel countered as he moved closer. \u201cThat is not love, but enslavement of the worst kind.\u201d</p><p>Energ\u00fameno scanned the faces of the other men, and spoke to them in his strange language. A dark-skinned man came to stand beside Samuel, and leveled the spear in his hands at the vampire\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cThis ends,\u201d Samuel said, \u201ctonight.\u201d</p><p>Whatever they had planned to do went awry as another man rushed past them, shouting furiously. Before he could club the vampire, Energ\u00fameno moved his hands through the air, and the man was flung backward onto the sand.</p><p>Drew started toward the group, but Gracie yanked him back. \u201cYou can\u2019t go near the master when he\u2019s like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip trembled as she looked away. \u201cYou will see.\u201d</p><p>The group converged on the vampire, only to be knocked away by some invisible force. Whatever the vampire used, it was fast and effective. In less than a minute Samuel was the only man left standing.</p><p>\u201cYou are stronger than the others.\u201d Energ\u00fameno sounded almost proud. \u201cIt will not save you. You are still mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the same, once,\u201d Samuel said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I was. But no more.\u201d The vampire made one last gesture, a mere flick of his fingers, and Samuel\u2019s shirt seemed to explode, falling in tatters on the sand around him.</p><p>The big man staggered back, but somehow remained standing.</p><p>\u201cThis is what happens when you displease me,\u201d Energ\u00fameno said in a louder voice. \u201cI will no longer provide for you and receive nothing in exchange. If you do not wish to starve, then you will give me one child on each night of the full moon. If no child is brought to the boat, then no food or comforts will be given to you.\u201d He looked at Samuel. \u201cAnd you . . . you are never to come into my sight again. If I ever see you again, I will take you and your woman apart, inch by inch.\u201d</p><p>Drew watched Energ\u00fameno\u2019s regal stride as he returned to the boat, where Stanton started the engines and headed out to sea. As Samuel bent to check the first man the vampire had cut down, more figures came hurrying out of the shadows. One, a dark-haired woman carrying a case, dropped on her knees beside Samuel.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Drew told Gracie.</p><p>Drew ran to the injured, stopping a few feet away when two of the men who saw him coming brandished their clubs. \u201cSamuel.\u201d</p><p>The big man turned. \u201cAndrew?\u201d His gaze shifted to the men. \u201cNo, he\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d Drew quickly tore off his shirt and turned his back to show them his ink. As the men lowered their clubs, he joined Samuel. \u201cSorry. I intended this to be a rescue, but the bloodsucker shanghaied . . .\u201d His voice died away as he saw the gashes and cuts on Samuel and the other men, who looked as if they\u2019d been run through a meat grinder. He glanced at the unconscious form on the ground, whose torso had lacerations so deep and wide Drew could see some of his internal organs. \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can pray later.

Before she called for her nanny, she listened for the voices of the fairies who told her everything, but for once they were silent.</p> <p>The door to her bedroom opened, but instead of her nanny it was Daddy. The fairies told her how happy he was to see her, and that everything was going to be all right now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be asleep, you little minx,\u201d her daddy teased as he sat down next to her.</p><p>Emily hugged him. \u201cIs Mommy still mad?\u201d The fairies had told her terrible things about her mother, that she was going to hurt Daddy and make Emily go away, but Emily didn\u2019t believe them.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. She\u2019ll never be mad at you again. I promise.\u201d Her father picked her up. \u201cHow would you like to go for a car ride?\u201d</p><p>Daddy\u2019s mouth was smiling, but he felt so sad about Mommy that the fairies started crying in Emily\u2019s ears. \u201cWhy is Mommy sleeping on the floor downstairs?\u201d</p><p>He gave her an odd look before he said, \u201cShe\u2019s very tired.\u201d</p> <p>Daddy carried her out into her nanny\u2019s room, where Emily saw her nanny was also sleeping on the floor. \u201cSo is Miss Mary,\u201d he whispered in her ear.</p><p>Emily smelled something bad and wrinkled her nose. \u201cDid Nanny mess in her bed?\u201d</p><p>Daddy didn\u2019t answer her, and neither did the fairies, who were still crying. He carried her down to the garage, where he put her in the front seat of his car.</p><p>Emily, who was never allowed to sit in the front, looked all around her. Daddy\u2019s car was beautiful, and Mommy said she must never touch, but she couldn\u2019t help stroking the polished wood in front of her. As soon as Daddy got in she snatched her hand back.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cSomeplace wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Daddy drove through the city toward the park where Nanny sometimes took her to play, but he didn\u2019t stop there. He went past it toward the big water.</p><p>The fairies were sobbing so much that Emily had to press her hands against her ears to talk. \u201cCan\u2019t we go back to the park, Daddy? I want to go on the slide.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou like sliding, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt makes me feel like a bird.\u201d Sometimes she flapped her arms on the way down, hoping she would rise in the air and soar over her nanny\u2019s head, but that never happened.</p><p>Daddy drove into a little parking place by the water and stopped the car.</p><p>When he came around to open her door and help her out, he said, \u201cI need you to hold my hand now, Emily, and don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the big red bridge. \u201cAre we going up there?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll see the whole city.\u201d</p><p>Emily skipped alongside her father as he led her to the entrance of the walkway. He had to boost her over the little gate, which was locked, and then he jumped over it, pretending to fall and making her laugh.</p><p>\u201cGood thing I don\u2019t have to do that every day,\u201d he joked, dusting off his trousers before he took her hand again. He pointed toward one of the big towers. \u201cLet\u2019s walk up there.\u201d</p><p>Emily would have told him how much she liked going out at night and walking on the bridge, but the fairies wouldn\u2019t shut up. They were yelling in her ears so loudly that her head began to ache, and her footsteps dragged.</p><p>Daddy noticed. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not; it\u2019s just . . .\u201d Mommy had said the fairies weren\u2019t real, and she didn\u2019t want to make her father angry, not when they were having so much fun. She lifted her arms. \u201cPick me up?\u201d</p><p>Her father bent and hoisted her up in his arms, holding her close. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Daddy carried her all the way to the tower, and then turned to look back at the city. It was so much prettier at night, with all the lights sparkling like jewels.</p><p>\u201cPut your arms around my neck and hold on tight.\u201d When she did, her father climbed up on top of the railing.</p><p>Emily glanced down at the dark water far below. There was nothing for her father to hold on to, and if he slipped, they would fall. \u201cDaddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Emily. We\u2019re going to be together now.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cTogether forever.\u201d</p><p>The fairies began to scream.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201dCharlotte stripped off her bloody gloves and dropped them in the trash bin beside the table before she moved back and leaned against the wall. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can do for now.\u201d</p><p>Samuel had spent the last hour working with her on Ihiyo\u2019s internal injuries. They had discovered that while his healing ability could heal minor wounds, it would not repair damaged arteries or organs. \u201cWill he make it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a surgeon.\u201d Her head drooped. \u201cHalf of what I did I\u2019ve only read about in books. But he\u2019s stable, for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will watch Ihiyo, Charlotte,\u201d Tlemi, who had been assisting her, said. \u201cYou should go see to the men.\u201d</p><p>Samuel caught her arm as she headed for the door. \u201cIf you need to monitor him, I can check on the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d She looked at Tlemi, and pointed to the monitor beside the table. \u201cIf the numbers on there start changing, yell for me.\u201d</p><p>Samuel accompanied Charlotte downstairs to the living room, which they had converted into a makeshift infirmary. Nearly all of the islander men had been wounded by the bizarre creature who had brought Drew to the island, but most of the injuries had proved non-life-threatening.</p><p>Charlotte went first to Colotl, who despite dozens of wounds remained conscious, and whose chest and arms were swathed in bandages. After checking his pulse and temperature, she lifted one edge of his chest dressing.</p><p>\u201cThis looks a lot better.\u201d Knowing he didn\u2019t understand her, she gave him a smile and a nod before meeting Samuel\u2019s gaze. \u201cThe edges of his wounds are starting to pink up and close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey heal like we do,\u201d Sam\u2019s red-haired friend said as he approached Charlotte and held out his hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to introduce myself during the bloodbath. I\u2019m Drew Riordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlie Marena.\u201d She ignored his hand and gave him a hug. \u201cSorry I snapped at you on the beach. What that thing did freaked me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here, sister.\u201d He patted her back before drawing away. \u201cIf you have everything under control here, I\u2019ve got to go and get my woman. She\u2019s still hiding out down by the beach.\u201d</p><p>Samuel frowned. \u201cYou brought one of the other Takyn with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I found one when I came here. Long story.\u201d He glanced at Charlotte. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Samuel noticed Liniz\u2019s woman, Xochi, giving Drew a troubled look as he left. \u201cCharlotte, did you see the woman on the beach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Drew jump off the boat with someone.\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment, and surprise and something like pain flickered across her face. \u201cI can\u2019t read her. Ah.\u201d She rubbed one of her ears.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t think like a human being.\u201d She shook her head a little, as if to clear it. \u201cAll I get from her are these piercing sounds. Kind of like what bats make, I think.\u201d</p><p>Xochi appeared beside her. \u201cAgraciana.\u201d She pointed in the direction of the beach, and then covered her ears and shook her head.</p><p>Charlotte smiled at her. \u201cHoney, I have no idea what you\u2019re trying to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out when Drew returns.\u201d Samuel rested a hand on her shoulder, and then reached out to touch Xochi\u2019s arm. As soon as his palm touched her skin, he felt her voice inside his head, this time speaking flawless English.</p><p>\u2014must tell Tlemi that the outcast is here so she can warn them about her\u2014</p><p>Charlotte flinched under his hand. \u201cSam, this woman is dangerous. She\u2019s some kind of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutcast, I know. I can hear Xochi\u2019s thoughts.\u201d He noticed the island woman\u2019s astonished face. \u201cAnd I think she can hear ours as well.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Samuel. Your mouths are speaking your language, but I hear you in mine. Xochi\u2019s thoughts grew frantic. The woman who came to the island with your friend is not one of us. She serves the master.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s mouth flattened. \u201cWhat exactly does she do for this bastard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI obeyed him,\u201d a cool voice said.</p><p>Samuel turned around to see Drew with a petite dark-haired woman. Although her clothes were damp and her hair disordered, she projected an aura of calm disdain.</p><p>The islanders all reacted in sync to her presence, the men struggling to get to their feet while the women formed a protective line in front of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Charlotte demanded.</p><p>A flood of voices answered her inside Samuel\u2019s head, their replies terse and angry.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Agraciana,\u201d Samuel said.</p><p>The woman ignored him and turned to Drew. \u201cWe have to leave. If I stay here, they will kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d Colotl staggered over to him, grabbing his arm as his legs gave way. Charlotte caught him from the other side, and as soon as she touched him his voice echoed inside Samuel\u2019s mind. Agraciana\u2019s voice is her weapon. She can seduce or kill with it. You must silence her before she uses it on us.</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake, shut up.\u201d Charlotte\u2019s blunt order silenced Colotl and the other thought streams. \u201cNow, look. I don\u2019t care what Circe here can do; I didn\u2019t spend the last three hours patching you guys up just so you could turn into pigs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI agree with my lady. There has been enough violence for one night, my friend.\u201d Samuel gestured for the other islanders to stay where they were before he spoke to Agraciana. \u201cWhy did you obey the vampire?\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cWell, for one thing, he\u2019s been holding her mother hostage since Gracie was a kid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell them anything.\u201d Agraciana folded her arms. \u201cI can defend myself.\u201d</p> <p>Samuel watched as she scanned the room, focusing on a bowl of figs. A strange aqua light flickered in her dark eyes as she uttered a short, high sound, and the bowl shattered, spilling smashed figs onto the table.</p><p>Colotl surged forward, fighting Samuel\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d Agraciana said. She tilted her head, studying his face, and then laughed. \u201cNo, hermano, Energ\u00fameno never made me. This is what I am.\u201d She yanked up her sleeve, exposing the tattoo of a blue dolphin.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Takyn,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>Colotl muttered something ugly.</p> <p>\u201cI am the same as him. As all of them.\u201d Agraciana flicked her fingers at the islanders. \u201cWe were made in pairs. But the boy made for me died, and I had no more value for them. I was discarded, and when I was brought here, I was alone. I had no one to be with me. To help me.\u201d To Colotl, she said, \u201cI tried to tell you, but you were a coward, and you blocked me out. So I did what I had to do, so that I could live.\u201d She lowered her arm. \u201cJust as you did.\u201d</p><p>Doubt flickered through Colotl\u2019s thoughts, and the rest of the islanders exchanged puzzled looks.</p><p>\u201cI can feel all of them now, buzzing back and forth with their thoughts and emotions,\u201d Charlotte murmured. \u201cThey can connect with one another as a group.\u201d</p><p>We never told her or Energ\u00fameno that we could do this, Charlotte, Colotl thought. It was the only way we could protect ourselves against him.</p><p>\u201cI always knew what you were thinking to one another,\u201d Agraciana said. \u201cEven when you blocked my thoughts, I could still hear yours. And I never told the master.\u201d She turned and walked out of the room.</p><p>\u201cNice going,\u201d Drew said to Colotl. \u201cJust for the record, Gracie was dumped here with me because she tried to help me kill Energ\u00fameno tonight. What we did probably cost her parents, the only people who have ever cared for her, their lives.\u201d He took off after her.</p> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cWe need to get them settled down before they start bleeding again.\u201d</p><p>Samuel helped Colotl back to the sofa, where the islander rested for a moment before he spoke to the others in a low voice. When he finished, he held out his hands to Samuel and Charlotte.</p><p>Unless she attacks one of us, we will not harm the outcast. Colotl\u2019s thoughts were sluggish with exhaustion. Perhaps you can persuade her not to leave the island. She knows much about the master and his men.</p><p>\u201cHow can she leave?\u201d Samuel asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s thinking of dolphins,\u201d Charlotte answered before Colotl could. \u201cShe can control them with her voice. Be nice if she could call enough to take all of us back to the mainland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t run away from this,\u201d Samuel told her. \u201cWe have to find a way to stop the master before he hurts anyone else.\u201d</p><p>You are the way. Colotl pointed to his chest, where the gashes the master had inflicted on him had vanished. He gave you his blood, hoping to change you. You did not turn, but it has made you as strong as he is. That is why he commanded you never to come near him again. He fears you, Samuel.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018he didn\u2019t turn\u2019?\u201d Charlotte demanded.</p> <p>Energ\u00fameno wishes to make more of his kind to serve him and rule over his people, Colotl thought. So he makes the biggest and the strongest of us who are found drink from a goblet of his own blood. Until now no one has survived this except Samuel. We know he has not turned you because he did not become like the master. He did not grow fangs or try to drink your blood after you were beaten.</p><p>Samuel\u2019s stomach surged. \u201cI think that transfusion you gave me after they left us here saved more than my life, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte released their hands and stalked out.</p><p>Without her, Samuel couldn\u2019t read Colotl\u2019s thoughts, but the islander must have absorbed some of his language, for he said in thick English, \u201cCharlotte afraid. Go, talk.\u201d</p><p>Drew spotted Gracie sitting on the end of the pier, her hair dancing with the breeze, her legs dangling in the water. As he approached he noticed she had her hands braced on the edge, as if ready to push herself in.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to go skinny-dipping,\u201d he said, \u201cfirst you have to take off your clothes.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cYou should go back and be with your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re prettier than he is.\u201d He sat down beside her. Sleek, dark shapes moved beneath the surface of the water, disrupting the waves with almost imperceptible circular wakes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened in there. You didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are right to despise me for what I\u2019ve done. I never killed anyone, but I brought men to Energ\u00fameno whom I knew he would torture and murder. I even arranged everything so that Tacal could kidnap your friend. I did whatever he told me to, no matter what it was.\u201d Her shoulders hunched. \u201cFor that, I should die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked for Jonah Genaro for a couple of years,\u201d he told her, nodding as her eyes widened. \u201cI ran his tech department, and while I never killed anyone personally, some of the work my technicians did resulted in several kidnappings and murders of people like us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI can give you all their names, once I add your mother and father to the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not to blame for their deaths, if they are dead.\u201d Her voice grew dull. \u201cThe master doesn\u2019t kill right away. He will hurt them, and feed on them, for several days.\u201d Tears slid down her cheeks. \u201cHe likes to take his time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnerg\u00fameno can\u2019t do anything to them if he\u2019s deceased.\u201d Drew turned her to face him. \u201cThe others want to make that happen, and while they didn\u2019t win the battle tonight, the war is still on. If we stay and help them, I think we can figure out a way to put this bloodsucking bastard back in the ground for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t want my help, Andrew. They hate me, and if I stay, they will kill me.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cAnd I will let them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, at this moment, you are the most valuable asset they have.\u201d He pressed a finger to her lips. \u201cNot because of this, but this.\u201d He tapped her temple. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching the vampire for years. You know what he wants, how he does things, his strengths, his weaknesses. . . . . You\u2019re practically an Energ\u00fameno encyclopedia.\u201d</p><p>A glimmer of hope flashed over her face. \u201cNone of the children have seen him more than a few times, and even then he always kept his distance.\u201d She gave him a startled look. \u201cI thought it was his disdain for mortals; he truly does believe he is a god. But now I think . . . he may be afraid of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t before tonight, he is now.\u201d He put his arms around her. \u201cSo, can you send the dolphins off into the wet blue yonder?\u201d</p><p>She uttered a piercing sound, and the dark shapes changed direction and headed out to sea. \u201cI should go and talk to Samuel.\u201d</p><p>Drew caught a glimpse of the big man following a tall, lean figure stalking down the beach. \u201cI think maybe that has to wait for now.\u201d</p><p>Charlie knew she should go upstairs, check on Ihiyo\u2019s condition, and tell Tlemi that Colotl was recovering. As the only medical care provider, she had a duty to put her patients first, and she had never let anything interfere with her responsibilities: not her personal life, not her emotions, and certainly not the current bizarre circumstances in which she was being held captive.</p><p>She left the villa and walked down to the beach, staring out at the horizon. Clouds had swallowed the moon, and now nothing separated the blackness of the sky from the dark depths of the sea.</p><p>What Brent Collins had done had given Charlie an abiding hatred of suicide; she considered it the most selfish act a human being could commit. Yet standing here, knowing now that she might have to live with Samuel for the rest of her life, she understood what drove people to the brink of it.</p><p>I was afraid I\u2019d die with him, she thought, wrapping her arms tightly around her waist. Now I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t.</p><p>She felt Samuel coming toward her, felt it on her skin and in her bones, and her despair deepened. She had loved her father with all the purity and trust of a child, and he had tried to drag her into death with him. Now Samuel had her heart in his hands: Samuel who was handsome and rich and kind, just like Brent. Once more she felt small and dark and ugly, a changeling cast as a princess, entirely dependent on him. If they managed to confront the vampire again, would they escape certain death? Or would he die as her father had, leaving her to crawl away, broken and alone?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take any more.\u201d Her voice sounded harsh against the soft rush and ebb of the waves.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all had a rough night. Tomorrow things won\u2019t seem quite so hopeless.\u201d He came to stand beside her, but when he tried to put his arm around her she moved out of reach. \u201cCharlotte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as Ihiyo is stable, I\u2019m moving out. Let Segundo come and find me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou can\u2019t. There is nowhere else for you to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big island.\u201d She gestured vaguely inland. \u201cI\u2019ll live in one of the other houses, or with Pici at the cave.\u201d</p><p>Samuel came around her, peering down at her face. \u201cIs this because the vampire supposedly gave me his blood? Obviously I\u2019m not going to turn into one or infect you. The texts say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn about the texts.\u201d</p><p>He straightened. \u201cThen why are you leaving me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your wife.\u201d Shouting that made her feel like a bitch, but she couldn\u2019t take another second of his endless kindness and compassion. \u201cI\u2019m not your girlfriend, your lover, or even your occasional roll in the hay. We\u2019re strangers who had sex to save me from another beating. I\u2019m grateful, and the sex is good, but it\u2019s meaningless. In real life you and I would never have gotten together. So whatever you think we have here is a fantasy. It doesn\u2019t exist. I can\u2019t leave you, Sam, because I was never with you in the first place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gave her the once-over. \u201cAre you finished?\u201d</p><p>The politeness was icy now, but still firmly in place. She could yell at him until she gave herself laryngitis, Charlie thought, and it wouldn\u2019t make a difference.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d All the fight went out of her, and she trudged off, determined to get away from him before she made a bigger fool of herself.</p> <p>A massive arm scooped her off her feet and deposited her over a broad, stiff shoulder. Charlie was so surprised she hung there without struggling as he carried her off the beach.</p><p>\u201cHey. Hey.\u201d She twisted, but his hold simply tightened. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p><p>His voice sounded odd, and when she reached out with her mind she slammed into an impenetrable wall, so much like her own mental barriers that it dumbfounded her. \u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He edged his way between the rough, ringed bark of two coconut palms. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>Charlie turned her head, trying to see where he was heading. \u201cIs this supposed to impress me or intimidate me? Because it\u2019s not working. I know you won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Samuel remained silent as he waded through the brush and stepped out into a small open area, where he deposited her on her feet.</p><p>Charlie eyed the blanket on the ground, on which a covered basket sat. All around the edges of the grass a hedge of scarlet hibiscus bloomed. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sad attempt at a romantic midnight feast.\u201d He bent down and moved the basket to one side of the blanket. \u201cI intended to surprise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you\u2014\u201d All the air jolted out of her lungs as Samuel seized her, dropping to his knees and laying her out on the blanket. Before she could breathe again he had her pinned under him, his mouth an inch from hers. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s convenient.\u201d He reached down and tore her shirt from collar to hem, shoving the pieces aside before using his arm to lift her and rub her upper body against his chest. \u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSam. Please.\u201d Charlie felt her entire body flush with heat. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He covered one breast with his hand, kneading it urgently. \u201cIt means nothing, remember?\u201d</p><p>He bent his head, not to kiss her but to put his mouth to her throat, dragging his teeth across her skin before he laved her with his tongue. The erotic abrasion sent a shock wave of lust through her head, demolishing her resolve and knotting in between her thighs.</p><p>When Charlie tried to touch him, he dragged her arms over her head, holding them there with one big hand while he hooked the other in the waistband of her shorts. She heard the button pop and the zipper come apart, and then he was sliding down over her, pushing her legs apart to make room, his breath hot and fast against her sex.</p><p>His tongue pushed into her, wet and forceful, going deep, fucking in and out of her before he lashed it over her clit. The heat and ache exploded inside her as she came against his mouth, her hands twisting bunches of the blanket as he penetrated her with his fingers, working them into the liquid contractions of her sheath, pushing her through the delight and into another realm where the world dissolved along with her.</p><p>Catching her breath was impossible; he was on top of her a heartbeat later, his big body hard, his muscles bunching as he shifted her legs to his arms and his cock to her folds, pressing in so thick and hard she shuddered, almost sure this time he would split her in half. But her body had been made for a man like him, and it flowered around him, taking him in and clasping him in the most intimate embrace, stroking the impaling shaft, stretching and contracting to grip the broad base.</p><p>She felt the weight of his testicles, heavy and tight, caught between the press of their bodies, and a ferocious need came over her. She wanted to feel his semen pumping into her more than she wanted to breathe.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d When she did, he drew out with a slow, torturous movement, leaving just the head of his penis tucked between the slick ellipse of her labia. \u201cNow you tell me this isn\u2019t real.\u201d He released her wrists, cradling her face between his hands as he stroked into her and once more held himself there. \u201cWalk away from this.\u201d</p> <p>The merging of their sexes had her shaking with need; blindly she struck at him with one fist, wanting the blow to hurt her as much as him. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She opened her throbbing fingers to press them to his lips. \u201cI can\u2019t give you what you want. I can\u2019t love you if you\u2019re going to leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen be with me, Charlotte.\u201d He kissed her fingers, her palm, her wrist. \u201cBe with me and love me, because I will never leave you.\u201d</p><p>She felt his mind touch hers, his thoughts filling her with the strength and heat of his emotions. As their bodies moved together, his gliding and stroking in and out, hers holding and caressing, Charlie felt the last wall crumbling. He was all over her, inside and out, and there was no part of her he did not possess. She felt all that he was spreading through her, warm and delicious, twining around the surges of desire, enveloping her like water, illuminating the dark corners of her heart. She felt no fear as the pleasure broke over them, and wrapped her arms around him, taking the thick, heavy pulses of his semen into her core, immersing herself in the primal satisfaction of being a woman, his woman.</p><p>Sweat dripped from his face onto her shoulder as he sagged, his breath rushing against her ear, his fingers tangling with hers. When he tried to roll away from her Charlie held him, unwilling to release him from the clasp of her flesh.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat I love you?\u201d He lifted his head. \u201cGood God, woman. I\u2019ve all but tattooed the words on my forehead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I meant us. This. That we could be like this together. It was good before, but this.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t even describe it. You were everywhere inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dark kyn seem to practice a form of emotional bonding. The texts describe it as evil and perverse, a deliberate corruption of matrimony, but I think it\u2019s their form of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do the vampires have to do with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have abilities similar to theirs, and we already know that we\u2019re drawn to each other.\u201d He brushed some hair back from her cheek. \u201cPerhaps we can create the same kind of bond.\u201d He started to say something more, and then fell silent as he rolled away from her and sat up.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us have birth records other than what was issued to our adoptive parents, which were forged. We know we were genetically altered and tattooed as infants before we were adopted out. We have powerful and diverse psychic gifts, we heal rapidly, and we\u2019ve all survived injuries and illnesses that should have killed us. Agreed?\u201d When she nodded, he glanced back at her and asked, \u201cSo why did they do it? What was the purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably just to see if they could.\u201d She propped herself up on her elbow, tugging him down beside her. \u201cThey must have thought they failed, or they wouldn\u2019t have placed us for adoption.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBefore we were brought here, I believed the same thing.\u201d</p><p>She slid her hand across his chest, tracing her fingers in small circles over his heart. \u201cSo what\u2019s your new theory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, I think the scientists were trying to do the same thing as this Energ\u00fameno, but in their case they actually succeeded.\u201d When he saw her expression, he added, \u201cWe were created to be an army. One that kills vampires.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still conducting the street search, but all of the leads we\u2019ve received have turned out to be dead ends,\u201d Marlow said. \u201cNothing turned up on any of Energ\u00fameno\u2019s properties. The company that owns the cellular transmission tower outside the city sent a repair crew; they\u2019re in custody now, but when they don\u2019t report in, there will be inquiries. We don\u2019t have much time left, sir.\u201d</p><p>Jonah Genaro set aside the front page of the New York Times and drank the last of his coffee. \u201cDid you question Delgado?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe warden didn\u2019t offer anything of value, although if you need any leverage on local politicians\u2014\u201d</p><p>Genaro glanced up. \u201cWhat I need, Mr. Marlow, are Riordan, Taske, and Marena. Stop making excuses and find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Genaro.\u201d Marlow turned on his heel and left.</p><p>The presidential suite at the Barcel\u00f3 Karmina Palace was as secure as it was sumptuous, but Genaro felt caged. Back in Atlanta he could have retreated to the vault beneath his enormous home, where he kept his extensive collection of antiquities. The only time he ever relaxed was when he was surrounded by the forgotten glory of his Roman ancestor, Genarius, who had clawed his way up from nothing to become one of the most important and influential men of his time. While Genaro didn\u2019t believe in reincarnation, he had often felt as if his ancient ancestor watched over him, reaching an invisible hand across the millennia to guide him along the path to power.</p><p>Genarius wouldn\u2019t have sat in a hotel suite, waiting like some indolent fool.</p><p>When Genaro stepped outside into the hall, two armed men turned toward him, their expressions blank, their eyes watchful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out for a few hours,\u201d he told them as he went to the elevator.</p><p>In the lobby, he had the concierge send for his car, and directed his driver to take him to Energ\u00fameno\u2019s compound. Along the way he used the car phone to check in with Delaporte back in Atlanta.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve linked Les Fr\u00e8res de la Lumi\u00e8re to a European arson-for-hire ring,\u201d his chief of security said. \u201cThey\u2019re burning down properties and taking a cut of the insurance from the owners via charitable donations to the order. It\u2019s all strictly across the pond, sir; we\u2019ve confirmed that they\u2019re not operating anywhere in Mexico.\u201d</p><p>An inventive insurance scam, but not one that interested Genaro. \u201cWhat about Energ\u00fameno\u2019s assets? Have you found anything new?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s contributed to some campaign funds of local and state officials involved in environmental protection. Looks like a PR move to tie in with his waste-disposal holdings.\u201d</p><p>Genaro looked out at the marina the car was passing, and saw a deckhand casting off a bowline from a charter boat. Two tourists were seated behind the captain, already drinking beer. The casting perch above the helm was shrouded with a fitted canvas cover that looked mildewed around the seams, as if it hadn\u2019t been removed in some time. They\u2019d be drunk by the time they went around the restricted zone to waters where they could fish without getting arrested. . . .</p><p>\u201cDon, check into these the campaign donations,\u201d Genaro said. \u201cI want the officials\u2019 names, titles, job descriptions, and any legislation they\u2019ve been involved in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtected habitats, wildlife reserves, or any area with restricted access. Anyplace Energ\u00fameno could operate from with impunity.\u201d He leaned forward to tap on the glass divider, and when the driver lowered it, he said, \u201cTake me to the police station downtown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need some time to do the research, sir,\u201d Delaporte was saying.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out of time. Put everyone you have on this, and get it to me before the end of the day.\u201d He ended the call and sat back, mentally reviewing the maps he had seen of the city. As the driver stopped in front of the station, he glanced out to see a woman sitting alone in the shadowy courtyard of the caf\u00e9 across the street. Although he couldn\u2019t see her features, the scarlet poppy she wore tucked in the hair above her left ear drew his gaze.</p><p>You should have tried the wine.... Energ\u00fameno does not allow us to leave the compound. . . . As soon as you walk through the gates, you will forget me.</p> <p>\u201cWait here.\u201d He got out of the car and watched the girl as he crossed the street. She didn\u2019t try to run, only offering him a gap-toothed smile as he approached.</p><p>Genaro pulled out a chair and sat down. \u201cDid he send you, or leave you behind with the other useless women?\u201d</p><p>She sipped from a glass of red wine, licking a drop from her upper lip. \u201cYou have an interesting mind, se\u00f1or. No other man has ever remembered me after I compelled him to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompelled? You drugged me.\u201d</p><p>She set down the glass. \u201cYou must leave Mexico now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTossing me in a prison didn\u2019t work,\u201d he told her. \u201cNeither will threats from your employer.\u201d</p> <p>She studied him for a long moment. \u201cMy master could have killed you from the moment you arrived in Manzanillo. You do not interest him anymore. Go back to America, se\u00f1or.\u201d</p><p>When she rose, he stood and seized her wrist. \u201cI\u2019m not finished with you. Where is he? What has he done with the Kyndred?\u201d</p><p>Instead of looking frightened, she chuckled. \u201cIf only my master had given me permission to compel you to go.\u201d She lifted her hand.</p><p>Genaro grabbed her wrist, but instead of gouging her nails into his neck, she rested her hand against it. A terrible longing devoured his anger as he gazed into her beautiful eyes and remembered her lovely name.</p><p>\u201cForgive me for shouting, Quinequia,\u201d he said, bringing her wrist to his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s because I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell you a secret, amigo. When I touch them, all men want me.\u201d She leaned closer, resting her luscious curves against him. \u201cYou are cold and vicious, and care for nothing but power, but I could make you my lapdog. At least for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nodded, eager to please her. \u201cTake me with you. Let me care for you. I can\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath, sweet with wine, touched his lips just before she kissed him. Genaro enfolded her in his arms, avidly working his mouth over hers, delirious with desire.</p> <p>\u201cVery nice for such a nasty man.\u201d Quinequia pulled back and looked down. \u201cNow you will release me.\u201d</p><p>His arms fell to his sides, and panic made him blurt out, \u201cDon\u2019t send me away again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, unfortunately, I cannot do that.\u201d She gripped his throat with both hands. \u201cListen to me, Jonah Genaro, and obey me. You will not search the islands. The man you seek is not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot there,\u201d he agreed, his voice dull.</p><p>\u201cBueno.\u201d Quinequia\u2019s eyes burned into his. \u201cYou will forget our meeting, and when I leave here, you will never think of me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget.\u201d The word tore at him, but the pain ebbed almost immediately as her face blurred. \u201cNever again.\u201d</p><p>She led him back to the table, helping him to sit in the chair. \u201cGood-bye, se\u00f1or.\u201d She took her hands away, turned her back, and walked across the street to his car.</p><p>Genaro sat and looked at the empty wineglass across the table until a man touched his shoulder. He glared up at his driver. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been sitting here for a while, sir,\u201d the man said, his expression uneasy. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d see if you were all right.\u201d He tugged at his collar, as if it felt too tight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He stood, inhaling deeply to clear his head. \u201cWait for me in the car.\u201d</p><p>He watched the driver retreat, and then turned to pick up the wineglass. A faint red imprint on the rim indicated a woman had been drinking from it, but the courtyard was empty. The last thing he remembered was being in the back of the car as it pulled up to the police station, and checking his watch.</p><p>He turned his wrist to look at his Rolex. Twenty-three minutes had passed, and he couldn\u2019t remember a single moment of them.</p><p>Genaro took out a handkerchief, wrapping it around his hand before he picked up the wineglass and carried it across the street with him.</p><p>Inside the station he went to the command center and called one of the research techs over. \u201cI want this analyzed,\u201d Genaro said, handing him the glass. \u201cUse the saliva for DNA typing and run the prints. Cross-reference both against our acquisition database in Atlanta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any details to narrow the search field, sir?\u201d the tech asked.</p><p>\u201cJust one.\u201d Genaro\u2019s collar had grown damp with sweat, and he reached up to loosen his tie. \u201cShe\u2019s female.\u201d</p><p>By morning most of the islanders had recovered enough to return to their homes, where Charlotte suggested through Tlemi that they stay.</p><p>\u201cPici\u2019s contractions have stopped, and Ihiyo is stable,\u201d she assured them. \u201cIf anything changes, I\u2019ll send word.\u201d</p><p>Xochi glanced at the other women and then replied in her language.</p><p>\u201cShe say, you no need,\u201d Tlemi translated, and tapped the side of her head. \u201cWe know.\u201d</p><p>Colotl issued some instructions as well, but stayed behind with Tlemi as the other islanders left.</p><p>The women looked after their patients while Colotl took Samuel down to the beach to show him his hook-and-line method of fishing. Although they couldn\u2019t communicate without Charlotte or Tlemi, simple sign language sufficed, and they caught breakfast in a few minutes. Then Colotl gave him another, less enjoyable tutorial on how to gut and clean their catch.</p><p>\u201cHow delightful,\u201d he muttered, pausing for a moment to shake off the scales clinging to his hands and forearms. \u201cWith all the fish I eat, I must remember to give Morehouse a raise.\u201d As he applied the knife again, it slipped and sliced across the skin between his thumb and forefinger. \u201cDamn it.\u201d He pulled off the strip of rag he\u2019d used to hold back his hair and wound it around the gash.</p><p>Colotl frowned and reached into the pouch he carried, taking out the long pointed leaf of a succulent plant, and gesturing for Samuel to apply it to the wound.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Charlotte, or she\u2019ll break out the suture kit,\u201d he joked as he unwrapped his hand. The rag had no blood on it, he saw, because the cut had closed before it could begin bleeding. For a long moment he stared at it, and then, as a chill ran down the length of his spine, he brought his fingers up to his mouth, touching the edge of his teeth. None of them had turned into fangs.</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d Colotl gestured toward his mouth, tipping his head back and pushing a finger behind his front teeth, moving it from side to side.</p><p>He imitated the motion, but felt only the roof of his mouth. He removed his fingers and shook his head.</p><p>Colotl released a breath, looking as relieved as Samuel felt.</p><p>\u201cYou guys went fishing and didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><p>Samuel glanced over at Drew, who was crossing the sand. \u201cI thought I\u2019d let you and Agraciana sleep in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d Drew gave Colotl a wary look before crouching down to examine their catch. \u201cNice. I haven\u2019t had fresh fish in years. Samuel, we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this new or preexisting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew. Earlier I took a walk around the house and the grounds. There isn\u2019t any copper within five miles of this spot. Which is basically the entire island.\u201d</p><p>Without copper, Drew couldn\u2019t use his ability, which allowed him to manipulate the metal into any form he wished.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re running the houses off methane-fueled generators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I already checked them out. They\u2019re solid steel, and all the wiring is fiber-optic.\u201d Drew kicked over a shell in the sand. \u201cAccording to Gracie, copper is poisonous to the vampire. Figures he\u2019d make sure the natives couldn\u2019t get their hands on any.\u201d He frowned down at the sand.</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d Colotl picked up the cleaned fish that he had strung together, and pointed to the villa. \u201cNiccuiz. I take.\u201d He gestured toward the sun as if moving it to the center of the sky. \u201cTiyazque oztotl. Cave.\u201d He pointed to them and himself.</p><p>\u201cWe meet at the cave at noon.\u201d</p><p>Samuel exchanged a nod with him, and after the islander strode up the beach he turned to Drew, who was kneeling and sifting sand through his fingers over a small mound of the same. \u201cNow is not the time to build sand castles, Andrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d make millions if I did.\u201d Drew stood and surveyed the rest of the shore. \u201cIs it all like this? The whole island?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t walked the entire perimeter, but I assume so.\u201d Samuel eyed the sparkling sand. \u201cIs it artificial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Drew uttered a pained laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s also riddled with gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you mean pyrite, or mica.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSamuel, besides computers, the only thing I\u2019m an expert on is metal.\u201d He bent and scooped up a handful of the sand, stirring it with his fingertip. \u201cEverything that glitters here is the real deal. At least one-sixth of the beach is twenty-four karat.\u201d He poured it out of his hand. \u201cCagey bastard. He hid it in the one place Cort\u00e9s\u2019s descendants and the historians would never think to look.\u201d He glanced up. \u201cThe vampire is\u2014was\u2014Mote-cuhzoma. Last king of the Aztecs.\u201d</p><p>Samuel listened as Drew related what the master and Stanton had told him. When his friend finished the bizarre tale, he grew thoughtful. \u201cThat explains the artifacts in the villa. I thought they were reproductions, but they\u2019re simply newly made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think he\u2019s the big M?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cEarly explorers always brought disease to the Americas. It\u2019s not a broad leap to imagine one of them was dark kyn. He must have turned the Aztec, who viewed his transformation as the process of becoming a god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what let him survive what he\u2019s been through.\u201d</p> <p>Drew shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s gone loony tunes, but he\u2019s still smart. He\u2019s been taking over the drug cartels, and he can control anyone else he needs. If he does build this army and uses it to take over Mexico, Motecuhzoma\u2019s revenge is going to have a whole new meaning.\u201d</p><p>Of all the objects in the villa, the only ones Samuel had not been able to touch-read had been the strange clubs hung high on the first-floor entry wall. \u201cCome back up to the house. There\u2019s something I need to do.\u201d</p><p>Samuel intended to drape the security camera with a cloth to obscure the lens; instead he found the equipment smashed and dangling from a frayed wire. Drew reached up, pulling down the ruined unit and running his fingers along the wires.</p><p>\u201cMore fiber optics.\u201d He inspected the camera. \u201cLooks like it exploded.\u201d</p><p>Colotl joined them and grimaced at the twisted mass of metal. \u201cCharlotte.\u201d He mimed striking something with a club, and then swept his hand toward the rest of the villa.</p><p>Drew whistled. \u201cYour lady has a bad temper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want them to know Pici is close to delivering.\u201d Samuel led the men into the living room, where he began taking apart the modules making up the conversation pit. \u201cGrab one of these and bring them out into the hall.\u201d</p><p>By stacking the modules, Samuel was able to fashion a small tower beneath the display of the clubs. \u201cYou\u2019d better climb it,\u201d he told Drew. \u201cIt won\u2019t hold my weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust catch me if I fall,\u201d Drew joked as he started up.</p><p>With Colotl\u2019s help, Samuel was able to hold the modules steady, and Drew worked one of the clubs free of the hooks holding it to the wall. Colotl reached up to take it from him before he climbed back down.</p><p>\u201cXitlachia,\u201d Colotl said, his expression sobering as he passed it to Samuel. \u201cMicoani yaotlatquitl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like he\u2019s trying to say \u2018handle with care,\u2019 \u201d Drew said, only half joking.</p><p>Samuel hefted the surprisingly heavy weapon. Carved from a single piece of teak, the four-foot-long business end had been fashioned like a squared blade, with deep notches on both sides. Single rows of black, prismatic stone blades had been fitted inside the notches, their rectangular shape as puzzling as the razor sharpness of their exposed edges.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a club,\u201d Samuel murmured, turning it over. \u201cIt\u2019s a macuahuitl.\u201d At Drew\u2019s blank look, he added, \u201cAn Aztec sword.\u201d</p> <p>Drew\u2019s expression turned skeptical. \u201cSorry, but in every movie I\u2019ve seen, swords are made of forged steel or iron. That\u2019s just a big wooden stick with some black rocks stuck in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the historical accounts I\u2019ve read, these were very effective in battle. One Aztec warrior used his to decapitate a horse.\u201d Samuel closed his eyes briefly, drawing on his ability, which now provided only a glimpse of a powerful hand streaked with gold fashioning the weapon. \u201cThe vampire made these himself. I wonder why.\u201d</p><p>Drew made a rude sound. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s into arts and crafts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a decoration.\u201d Samuel took a test swing, pitting the stone-blade edge against one of the suspended animal masks. The blade cut through the jaguar\u2019s clay-and-hide visage as if it were made of paper, sending half of it to smash on the glass floor.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Drew blew out a breath. \u201cThat\u2019s a sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou break that floor, boys,\u201d a tired voice said, \u201cand you\u2019ll be mopping it up for weeks.\u201d</p><p>Samuel looked up as Charlotte came down the staircase. \u201cHow are the patients?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIhiyo is in and out, but no fever, no signs of sepsis. That\u2019s my good news.\u201d She rubbed a hand over the back of her neck. \u201cBad news is that Pici\u2019s contractions have started again. They\u2019re sporadic, and I\u2019ve given her a mild sedative, but if her water breaks, I have no choice but to deliver the baby. As small as she is, that\u2019s probably going to be by C-section.\u201d She eyed the macuahuitl. \u201cJust what are you planning to do with that thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse them to hurt the bad guys,\u201d Drew said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take down the others from the wall,\u201d Samuel decided. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough to go around, but with Colotl\u2019s help I believe I can make more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have a word with you in private?\u201d Charlotte asked, her voice tight.</p><p>Samuel led her into the kitchen. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like violence, but we need more weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? So I can turn this place into a hospital?\u201d She leaned back against the counter and folded her arms. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys build a boat instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t finish it before they come back for Pi-ci\u2019s baby,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThe vampire could come back with them, too.\u201d Her lips thinned. \u201cLast night he didn\u2019t even touch you, and he still cut you guys down like you were paper dolls. Even if you make a hundred of those sword things, none of you could get close enough to . . .\u201d She stopped and stared at him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ability to heal means I am the only one who has a real chance of withstanding the vampire\u2019s ability,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cIf we can lure him back to the island, and I alone attack him, I could survive his assault long enough to decapitate him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about cutting off the head of an immortal monster using a weapon that will probably bounce off him. At which point, he dismembers you with a single thought.\u201d She pushed herself away from the counter. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back upstairs.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand, tugging her back to him. \u201cHe\u2019s not invulnerable, and I know once we talk to Agraciana we\u2019ll figure out how to get to him. I\u2019m not going to die on you. I keep my promises, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d She curled her arms around his neck, resting her cheek against his chest. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m in. What do you need from me? I can spare you some scalpels if you want to use the blades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send Drew up to have a look at your equipment and see what he can use. He needs some copper to work with,\u201d he added as she gave him a quizzical look, \u201cbut Energ\u00fameno seems to have stripped all of it from the island.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back and frowned. \u201cHow much does Drew need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as you\u2019ve got.\u201d Drew came around the side of the doorway. \u201cSorry; I was eavesdropping. Leftover habit from my scary life as a GenHance mole.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte lifted her head. \u201cVulcan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Internet fame precedes me.\u201d He grinned before he glowered at Samuel. \u201cHey. You didn\u2019t say she was one of ours.\u201d He tilted his head as he studied Charlotte. \u201cYou\u2019re not Sapphira; she\u2019s Canadian. I\u2019ve met Aphrodite and Jezebel, and I know Delilah\u2019s safely hidden away in the Rockies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, am I the only one who doesn\u2019t get invited to these Takyn get-togethers?\u201d Charlotte demanded before she sighed and held out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Magdalene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie? No shit?\u201d Drew whooped and grabbed her in a bear hug before he held her at arm\u2019s length to inspect her again. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a medic. Damn, girl, the way you shoot I thought for sure you were a Green Beret or something.\u201d</p><p>Samuel raised his brows. \u201cShe shoots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and she scores. Majorly.\u201d Drew tucked his arm through hers. \u201cSo, okay, you played through to the end of three, right? Is he still alive? Is the war over or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey made a hundred and seventy million dollars in one day on three,\u201d Charlotte chided. \u201cTrust me; he\u2019s in cryo until they release four.\u201d She glanced at Samuel. \u201cWe\u2019ve played some online games together a few times.\u201d</p><p>Samuel followed them upstairs, only half listening to their conversation about gaming together. Drew\u2019s mention of Delilah had sent a fresh wave of guilt through him; he had yet to tell Charlotte how badly he had treated their Takyn friend. Fortunately it was daylight, or she might have plucked the shameful memories straight from his mind.</p><p>\u201cI feel a little tingle,\u201d he heard Drew say, and looked in as his friend walked around the treatment room. \u201cWherever it is, it\u2019s not much. May be some wire fragments inside one of these units.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take anything apart if I can help it,\u201d Charlotte told him. \u201cI might have to run some other tests on Ihiyo or Pici.\u201d</p><p>Drew nodded. \u201cI can search for it without destroying anything. Although we\u2019d have it made if one of us could mind-forge gold.\u201d He described his discovery on the beach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She seemed skeptical. \u201cThe entire island can\u2019t be made out of it. I read an article once that said if you put together all the gold ever mined in the world throughout time, it wouldn\u2019t fill two Olympic-size swimming pools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGold that we know of,\u201d Drew corrected. \u201cThe Aztecs hid what they had from the conquistadors. Mixing it with beach sand and building an island out of it is pure genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe island is not made of gold.\u201d Agraciana came in and went to Drew, who put his arm around her. \u201cThe master did recover his gold from where he hid it five hundred years ago, but it is only a small part of what he used to create the island. Most of it was built atop waste brought here on barges.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe made an island out of trash?\u201d Charlotte shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. This place is too big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is the truth.\u201d Agraciana smiled a little. \u201cI helped him finish it.\u201d</p><p>Samuel listened as she detailed how Energ\u00fameno had spent the last twenty years shipping tons of waste to a lifeless atoll, where the barges were then deliberately wrecked to form a six-mile-wide foundation.</p><p>\u201cIt took almost a decade for him to collect enough waste to completely cover the barges and begin terra-forming it,\u201d Agraciana said. \u201cNative coral formed to cement the ships together beneath the surface, while the elements of methane containment and topsoil layered atop the decaying waste shaped the landmass. Once the garbage had been sealed off, methane generators were installed, and the landscaping and building began.\u201d</p><p>Samuel saw that Drew and Charlotte didn\u2019t quite believe her claims. \u201cWhat she says is true. I dug a hole near the cave, and I\u2019ve seen the layers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019re basically trapped on a floating landfill.\u201d Charlotte sighed. \u201cMarvelous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe master intends to build more islands like this, once we solve one significant problem that prevents him from doing as he wishes,\u201d Agraciana told her.</p><p>Drew snorted. \u201cWhat more does he want?\u201d</p><p>She made a horizontal movement with her hand. \u201cIf weather conditions or other hazards make it necessary, he wishes to be able to move them.\u201d</p><p>A thought occurred to Samuel, one that was so dangerous it might kill them all. It also might be their only way to escape. \u201cAgent Flores, were you here on the island when the villas were built?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor most of the construction, yes.\u201d She looked puzzled. \u201cWhat do you need to know about them?\u201d</p> <p>He picked up Charlotte\u2019s notepad and a pen. \u201cEverything you can tell me about the piping.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>A god did not require sleep, only rest and seclusion from the burning rays of the sun. The immortal who had once been Sokojotsin accepted this, as he had so many distasteful aspects of his existence. He did not count the hours he spent in his dark chamber; compared to the centuries he had endured in the earth, they were nothing.</p><p>As soon as night darkened the air, Energ\u00fameno rose from the ornate dais that served as his bed. He would not waste another second of his reign on his back.</p><p>A woman stepped out of the shadows. \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><p>Energ\u00fameno held out his arm, and Quinequia came to him, her pretty hands soft against his ruined flesh, her lips smiling and softening her unfortunate countenance as she tipped her head to one side, offering him her throat.</p><p>The metal of his fangs emerged, and he lowered his head, piercing her thin skin. Her blood sweetened his mouth and drove away some of the pain that racked his limbs, but after a few moments he set her aside.</p><p>The euphoria she felt evaporated just as quickly. \u201cDo I displease you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he lied.</p><p>In the time of his first rule he would not have permitted such a creature within his sight; a king was entitled to be surrounded by beauty in all things. But while Quinequia\u2019s form would never deserve his attention, she was the only one of his children who did not cringe at his touch, and whom he could feed upon regularly without losing himself to blood madness. She also had other, equally valuable uses when it came to dealing with mortals.</p><p>He could smell one of them on her now. \u201cWhy have you been with Genaro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still searches for you. I thought I would persuade him to fail.\u201d She stroked her fingers over the gold protruding from his chest. \u201cHe remembered me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cannot.\u201d Energ\u00fameno frowned. \u201cHe is mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis greed for power consumes him. It controls him so much I do not think even I could bind him to me permanently.\u201d She moved her shoulders. \u201cHe is well guarded now, but I can lure him away from his men. Do you wish me to kill him, master?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have other work for you.\u201d He set her aside as other servants came in carrying linens and pots. \u201cThe first of my warriors will soon be born. Go to the House of Eagles and ensure all is in readiness for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be.\u201d Quinequia bowed to kiss the back of his hand before she withdrew.</p><p>Energ\u00fameno tolerated the tentative touch of his body servants, who scoured away as much blackened, rotted flesh as they could before rubbing his limbs and torso with the sweet-smelling floral unguents he had taught them to make. The fresh blood he was obliged to drink to sustain his beleaguered flesh had not yet fully restored his body, another annoyance, but his steward had sworn to him that in time it would. After all the centuries and so little change, however, he sometimes wondered if he would ever be healed. Dressed in newly made garments, he made his way from his private chamber to his reception room, where Stanton awaited him.</p><p>His steward\u2019s nervous pacing reminded Energ\u00fameno of the foolish rebellion staged by his children. Even now he regretted not unleashing the thousand blades on Samuel Taske; the American deserved a lengthy, leisurely death for instigating the others to violence.</p><p>Something admirable about the manner in which Taske had faced him, however, had stayed the immortal\u2019s hand. As calm and steady as an Eagle warrior, the American had not feared him. More than he wanted the man\u2019s heart in his hand, beating its last beneath the clench of his fingers, he wanted that courage.</p><p>Taske knew now there was no escaping his duty, and in time would pass along the gifts bestowed by Energ\u00fameno\u2019s blood to the many fierce, powerful sons he would sire to serve the new kingdom.</p><p>Segundo stood waiting by his throne, a goblet in his hands. In the old tongue he greeted him with, \u201cYou fill my eyes with beauty and terror, my king,\u201d and bowed low before presenting the drink.</p><p>The scent of the blood mixed into the wine brought forth Energ\u00fameno\u2019s fangs, but Segundo had not yet changed his garments, which still stank of seawater and smoke. Energ\u00fameno struck out with his hand, the gold striping it clanging against the silver goblet as he knocked it away.</p><p>\u201cDo you never bathe?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, master.\u201d Segundo dropped to his knees, his eyes on the floor. \u201cI was obliged to attend to less important tasks, and time escaped me. With your permission, I will go and tidy myself now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will remain.\u201d The immortal gestured for another waiting servant. \u201cBring more of my wine.\u201d To Stanton he said, \u201cWhat of my children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll but four have returned to their homes. Ghost required medical treatment, and remains with his woman and the Americans. Scorpion and his woman have also stayed behind.\u201d Segundo stared at the blooded wine splashed across the tiles, and swallowed before he added, \u201cWe observed the children through the cameras in the seventh house, until Turtle destroyed them.\u201d</p><p>Taske\u2019s woman would have to be punished, but as always Segundo would see to it. \u201cWhere is the daily report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe birds have returned, but they brought nothing with them.\u201d</p><p>It had been his servant\u2019s idea to use birds as messengers. Trained to fly out to the island by day and return at night, they carried reports on the children\u2019s activities in tiny capsules attached to their legs. \u201cSo our eye on the island has closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would seem so, master.\u201d Segundo stood slowly. \u201cThey have not yet touched the other cameras, if you wish to observe them.\u201d</p><p>Such tasks Energ\u00fameno left to Segundo and his other servants, as he considered it beneath him to personally spy on his children. Yet after the ugly events of the previous night he would be gratified to see them once more obedient.</p><p>He rose from his throne. \u201cShow them to me.\u201d</p><p>His servant led the way to the rooms he had filled with his strange machines and the rows of glass squares that showed black-and-white images from all of the houses on the island. Those that showed the interior of the seventh house had gone black, but the others displayed every room in the other six dwellings. However, none of his children appeared on any of the squares. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should be sleeping now.\u201d Frowning, Segundo went to one of the machines and began to press its buttons, which moved the images. \u201cThe American did this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy children obey me,\u201d he reminded his steward.</p><p>\u201cSo they do, master, but this man is an instigator. I believe now that he will never accept your authority over him.\u201d Segundo gestured toward the glass squares. \u201cAfter the events of last night, I know he is responsible for this. Even now he has probably lured the children from their homes to plot against you.\u201d</p><p>Energ\u00fameno\u2019s annoyance grew. \u201cAn army needs generals. Taske\u2019s sons will have the wisdom and the spine to lead my children to victory.\u201d</p><p>Segundo shook his head, his voice growing shrill. \u201cWe will have no army if he poisons the others, which he will if you do not kill him now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence.\u201d Energ\u00fameno gave him a clout that knocked him to the ground. \u201cI am their father. I decide who lives for my glory, and who dies under my heel. Not you.\u201d</p><p>Segundo licked the blood from the gash on his mouth. \u201cI tell you this out of my love for you, master. Without you I am nothing.\u201d</p><p>Weary of his steward\u2019s eternal mewling, he gazed at the images of the empty rooms. Little flickers of white light appeared along the bottom edge of one square, and then seemed to leap to another. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Segundo got to his feet and returned to the console, adjusting the knobs to make the images larger.</p><p>The lights crawled across the glass squares until they appeared in each one, and seemed to shoot up. It was only when gray clouds appeared with the lights that Energ\u00fameno realized what was happening. \u201cThey do this to destroy the other cameras?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only the cameras, master.\u201d Segundo straightened, his expression almost smug. \u201cThey have set fires in all the rooms. They are burning down the houses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey will come soon, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>Tlemi\u2019s voice halted Charlie\u2019s nervous pacing, but did nothing to dispel her anxiety. \u201cI should have gone with them.\u201d</p><p>Samuel and the other men had left almost an hour ago to finish setting fire to the other houses; they might not make it back before the boats arrived. At which point Charlie and the women would have to hold off Segundo, and quite possibly the vampire, by themselves.</p><p>Charlie surveyed the faces of the other women, most of whom had the good sense to look frightened. Samuel\u2019s plan to burn down all the houses was insanely risky, especially if Energ\u00fameno decided not to send anyone to rescue them. \u201cAll right, we need to get ready. Tlemi, what can the others do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cXochi move plants.\u201d She turned and spoke in Nahautl to the other woman, who nodded and touched one of the bamboo canes. The long, straight length began to coil like a spiral, at the same time sprouting new shoots that grew at an astonishing rate.</p> <p>\u201cGood. If any of the master\u2019s men come up from the beach, she needs to trap them in the bamboo.\u201d Charlie waited for Tlemi to translate that for Xochi before she noticed Pici struggling to get up from the makeshift stretcher they\u2019d used to bring her down to the beach. \u201cNo, sweetie, you don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p><p>Pici fell back, and then said something to Tlemi.</p><p>\u201cShe want to help,\u201d Tlemi explained.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant,\u201d Charlie told her, and rested her hand on the mound of her belly. \u201cYou just take care of this little guy for now.\u201d</p><p>Pici snapped something, and a seagull darted into their hiding place, landing on Charlotte\u2019s arm and giving the back of her hand an ungentle peck.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d She shook off the bird, and then went still as six others landed in front of her, glaring up at her with angry black eyes. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p> <p>Tlemi made a face. \u201cShe use birds.\u201d</p><p>Charlie pushed the memory of a Hitchcock movie out of her thoughts. \u201cOkay, Pici, you can help.\u201d When the pregnant woman reached for her hand, she assumed she wanted only some reassurance, but then Charlie felt her press something small and cylindrical against her palm. She looked into the other woman\u2019s eyes, and while she didn\u2019t understand her thoughts, she could feel the urgency of her emotions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to walk down and see how much room there is under the pier. Stay here,\u201d she told Tlemi.</p><p>As soon as Charlie ducked beneath the pier, she opened her hand and examined the object Pici had passed to her. The small plastic cylinder had a cap on one end, and contained a tiny roll of paper. She opened it and removed the note, unrolling it to reveal a handwritten message.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she give you?\u201d Tlemi asked from behind her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Charlie turned and held out the paper. \u201cBut you won\u2019t have to translate it. It\u2019s written in beautiful English.\u201d</p><p>The pale hand trembled as it took the paper. \u201cI can explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d Charlotte seized her by the throat. \u201cYou lying bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d Tears streaked Tlemi\u2019s face. \u201cI had to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to use your ability to spy on us, and tell them whenever we didn\u2019t follow the rules?\u201d Charlie tightened her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re right; I don\u2019t get it. How could you?\u201d She shook her. \u201cDid you enjoy watching through Sam\u2019s eyes while they beat me? Did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSegundo said if I didn\u2019t,\u201d Tlemi said, her voice strangled by the pressure of Charlie\u2019s hand, \u201che would kill Colotl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou idiot.\u201d Charlie shoved her away.</p><p>\u201cI stopped a long time ago. I\u2019ve been lying to them about everything, ever since they murdered Mocaya.\u201d The younger woman coughed and rubbed her neck. \u201cI only told them the truth about you because I thought the master had turned Samuel. I was afraid he would attack us for our blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if he was a vampire, Sam would never hurt anyone.\u201d Charlie felt the sincerity of Tlemi\u2019s emotions echoing in her words, and the shame that filled her thoughts. \u201cIf you try to help them tonight, I will kill you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Not ever again.\u201d The other woman glanced over her shoulder. \u201cAre you going to tell the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did, they\u2019d probably kill you.\u201d Grimly she looked around, measuring the available space. \u201cWe need to move the women away from here.\u201d She felt a wave of rage slam into her mind and staggered backward, shuddering as Tlemi caught her.</p><p>No language came through the thought stream, only gruesome images of Energ\u00fameno standing over Samuel\u2019s body, holding a still-beating heart in his hand. What he imagined doing next made her double over and vomit.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d Charlotte wiped her mouth and straightened. \u201cGet the other women and go. Stay out of sight.\u201d She managed to raise a mental barrier against the murderous thoughts barraging her mind before she hurried out.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Tlemi called after her.</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t look back. \u201cI have to warn Samuel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last one.\u201d Samuel stood back with Drew and watched as flames rose against the windows inside the house.</p><p>Colotl and the other islanders joined them, each carrying the torches they had used to set the fires.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful work,\u201d Drew said. \u201cIf you ever want to go into the arson business, take me as your partner.\u201d</p><p>Capping off all the gas pipes before they set fire to the villas ensured that the structures would burn instead of explode, which bought them more time. According to Tlemi, Segundo and his men lived on one of the protected islands in the vicinity; it would take at least an hour for them to arrive. Assuming they would come to rescue them.</p><p>\u201cThey will come,\u201d Agraciana said, accurately guessing his thoughts. \u201cThe master needs us too much to let all of us die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019d have no problem killing a couple of us to serve as examples,\u201d Drew guessed.</p><p>\u201cThat is Energ\u00fameno\u2019s way.\u201d She gave Samuel a troubled look. \u201cIf we cannot prevail, I will summon my dolphins, but . . . I cannot control more than four. That means only three can come with me.\u201d</p><p>Samuel glanced at Drew. \u201cThis time, we\u2019ll win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d Colotl pointed to a figure running toward them. \u201cCharlotte.\u201d</p><p>He ran to meet her, catching her in his arms as she stumbled and gasped for breath. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnerg\u00fameno.\u201d She clutched his shoulders. \u201cHe\u2019s coming. You have to go the cave and hide. Now.\u201d She tried to pull him in that direction. \u201cSam, please. I\u2019ve seen what he\u2019s planning to do to you, and you can\u2019t stop him. He\u2019s too strong, too angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew. Colotl.\u201d When the men joined them, Samuel quickly issued instructions for them to rejoin the women and take up defensive positions, and then added, \u201cI need the weapons.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte stiffened. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me? He\u2019s going to stick his hand in your chest and pull out your heart and eat it. You can\u2019t heal from that. This time, you will die.\u201d</p><p>Samuel looked at the other men. \u201cGive us a minute, please.\u201d When they moved away, he cradled her face between his hands. \u201cHoney, we don\u2019t have a lot of time left, so I need you to listen to me now. We\u2019ve talked to Agraciana about Energ\u00fameno\u2019s powers. He can hurt me from a distance, but to kill me he has to make physical contact. I\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop him.\u201d She gave Agraciana a desperate look. \u201cShe can control dolphins, right? Have her call one to take you off the island before he gets here. When you get to the mainland, you can get help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you, Charlotte.\u201d He brought her hand up and pressed it to his heart. \u201cAs for this, he can\u2019t have it. It belongs to you.\u201d</p><p>With her fists she gripped the front of his shirt, and pressed her brow against his chest. When she lifted her head again, her expression was one of complete calm. \u201cYou aren\u2019t leaving me, Sam. If he kills you, he kills me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be here to stop me.\u201d She took a scalpel from her pocket and held it up between them. \u201cYou know how I feel about suicide, but I\u2019d rather end my life than live without you. So if you die, I die.\u201d</p><p>He could take the scalpel from her, and warn the men about her intentions. But with her medical knowledge and training, how long would they be able to prevent her from following him into death? Suddenly he realized the other reason she had made her ghastly threat. \u201cWhen you read his mind and thought of me dying, this is how it felt for you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThat, and I threw up. You don\u2019t have to do that, though.\u201d</p><p>Samuel laughed as he wrapped his arms around her, lifting her off her feet until their eyes were level. \u201cI love you, Charlotte Marena, and I\u2019m not going to die tonight. I\u2019m going to live for you. I\u2019m going to live with you. And when we\u2019re very old, and ready for the next place, then we\u2019ll go together.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cPlease, God, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel,\u201d Drew called. \u201cTime to move.\u201d</p><p>As they joined the others, Agraciana moved to flank Charlotte. \u201cYou read the master\u2019s mind tonight, yes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI picked his thoughts.\u201d Her hand tightened on Samuel\u2019s. \u201cThey were as ugly as he is.\u201d</p><p>Agraciana\u2019s voice became tentative. \u201cCan you tell me, was he thinking of anything else besides coming here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know,\u201d Charlotte muttered before she saw the other woman\u2019s expression. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t deciding how he wanted to kill you, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut did he think about my parents?\u201d Before Charlotte could answer, she said quickly, \u201cI don\u2019t know what my mother looks like now, but my father is an old man, with white hair and a scar on his neck here.\u201d She touched a place on her throat.</p><p>Charlotte shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I didn\u2019t see anyone like that in his thoughts.\u201d</p><p>Instead of showing disappointment, Agraciana smiled a little. \u201cThen there is still some hope. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>By the time they reached the seventh house, the fire inside had caused the windows to burst and belch columns of black smoke into the sky. While Colotl directed the other men to take up defensive positions along the tree line, Tlemi came to speak in a low voice to Charlotte, who returned a few minutes later.</p><p>\u201cWe have another problem,\u201d she told him. \u201cPici\u2019s contractions have started again. The stress of this is just too much for her and the baby.\u201d</p> <p>Samuel had taken the precaution of removing everything Charlotte might need for the delivery from the treatment room before setting fire to the house. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to move her away from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTlemi and I are going to carry her down the beach until we\u2019re out of sight.\u201d She eyed the tree line. \u201cIhiyo should go with us. He\u2019ll help keep her calm.\u201d She turned to him. \u201cAnd no, don\u2019t suggest I stay with her. She\u2019s not ready to deliver yet, and you need me here.\u201d She stalked off toward the pier.</p><p>\u201cYou had to get mixed up with a telepath.\u201d Drew slapped the back of Samuel\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou know, you\u2019ll never be able to throw that woman a surprise birthday party. Or make her think you were working late at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He eyed his friend. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not mixed-up. I\u2019m in love with her. Come on.\u201d</p><p>They went to retrieve the weapons they had stashed beneath the sea grape bushes.</p><p>\u201cYours.\u201d Drew handed him two macuahuitl before hefting the bundle with the others they had made. \u201cIf you want to change your mind, we can all rush him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf this doesn\u2019t work, I need you in reserve.\u201d He glanced over at the women. \u201cWhatever happens, I\u2019m depending on you to get the islanders back to the States. Matthias will help you resettle them.\u201d</p><p>Drew uttered a sour chuckle. \u201cI think he\u2019ll need to buy a maternity hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t make it, he\u2019ll be able to purchase several.\u201d Samuel smiled. \u201cAs my long-lost brother, he inherits the bulk of my estate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t leave me anything in the will?\u201d Drew mocked.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOther than my shares in Intel and Microsoft, which I believe are presently worth a few million, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stop worrying about the vampire and start worrying about me.\u201d Drew turned his head, his eyes shifting past Samuel. His smile faded. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Energ\u00fameno had never loved her. Quinequia had accepted that as soon as she had been taken from the streets in Mexico City and brought to Manzanillo to be presented to him. That day, she had discovered that her ability couldn\u2019t overpower his ancient mind or the rage that had sustained it for so long. Contrary creature that she was, she adored him for it, and served him with loyalty so fierce she even defied him now and then in order to protect him.</p> <p>Her love had brought her to this cantina, where she sat and drank cheap wine while she waited. She didn\u2019t know for whom or what, only that she had to be here.</p><p>A man sat down in the chair across from her, his smile lighting up an unremarkable face. \u201cHello, little sister.\u201d</p><p>Quinequia eyed him. \u201cYou are mistaken, se\u00f1or. I have no brothers.\u201d The whore who had given birth to her had bled to death after a botched abortion when Quinequia was five; she had huddled against her mother\u2019s rotting body for two days before the stench and hunger had driven her out on the streets.</p><p>The man reached across the table and covered her hand with his. \u201c\u00c8 una cosa importante da ricordare.\u201d</p><p>Quinequia had never spoken Italian, but she knew instantly what he was saying. It is an important thing to remember. And she remembered him, her mentor, the man who had saved her.</p><p>No one knew about him. They had met when Quinequia had lived on the streets of Mexico City; he\u2019d found her one day holding court among the other ragged, filthy orphans. He had laughed at her confusion when her ability had failed to enslave him.</p><p>\u201cYour charms are not irresistible, my dear,\u201d he\u2019d chided in flawless Spanish. \u201cI can teach you what to do when they fail you, and much more.\u201d</p><p>Quinequia had never gone to school; that was for children with homes and families. But street life had taught her that no one did anything for free. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>He had pulled up the sleeve of his shirt to show her a strange picture just above his elbow. It had been made part of his skin, just like the gray bird on the back of her hand. \u201cBecause we are family.\u201d</p><p>He had taken her with him that day, first to the beautiful rooms in one of the big hotels, where maids had washed her and dressed her in clothes so clean and soft the touch of them felt like angel\u2019s wings. A butler had brought a cart with so much lovely food she had not dared do anything but stare at it, at least until her mentor told her it was all for her. Then she had thrown herself at him instead of the food, clutching him as she sobbed like a baby.</p><p>He had stroked her hair and let her cry until she hiccuped. \u201cI am going to take care of you now, little sister.\u201d</p><p>So he had, from that night on. During the next three years he had taken her all over the world with him, teaching her everything he knew, training her how to better control and use her gift, and then finally explaining her purpose. By the time they returned to Mexico, Quinequia was nine years old, and more than ready to begin the work.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a proper street urchin now,\u201d her mentor had said as he surveyed the ragged, filthy garments she wore.</p><p>Quinequia eyed another brother who came into the room; a silent and watchful teacher whom she had met in England. \u201cI will never tell anyone about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be made to tell, little sister. So you must be made to forget.\u201d Her mentor rubbed a little more dirt on her cheek, and then pushed the hair he had deliberately snarled back from her eyes. \u201cIf you need us, we will know. If there is time, we will come for you. If there is not, you must protect us.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and when the other brother had come to lay his hands on her neck, she had not resisted.</p><p>Memories flooded her as she looked across the table at her mentor. The words he had spoken to her had lifted the mask over her memory placed in her mind the night he had brought her back to Mexico and returned her to her life on the streets.</p><p>\u201cYou have come back for me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYour work here is finished.\u201d</p><p>Now that she recalled everything, she felt confused. The only reason he would come personally was to take her away with him. \u201cAm I being replaced? Is that why you are here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear.\u201d He stood and offered her his hand as she rose from her chair. \u201cYou are being recalled.\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip trembled as she fought back her tears. \u201cThen I have failed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are wrong.\u201d He put his arm around her. \u201cNow, come. We have one more task to perform.\u201d</p><p>Charlie stopped beneath a coconut palm and surveyed the area before she looked at Tlemi. \u201cTell him to put her down here.\u201d</p><p>Ihiyo, who had insisted on carrying the other end of the stretcher, nodded as Tlemi translated. In sync with Charlie\u2019s movements, he carefully lowered Pici to the ground, then came around to kneel beside the stretcher. The pregnant girl sighed as her lover took her hands in his and spoke to her in a soft, low voice.</p><p>Tlemi gestured for Charlotte, and she followed her out of the secluded spot down to the beach. \u201cI must tell you something.\u201d</p><p>Charlie held up one hand. \u201cIf you\u2019ve done anything else for the master, I don\u2019t want to know about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is about Pici.\u201d She glanced over at the grove. \u201cWhen she was a little girl, the master had her taken from her family in America. Her parents\u2019 names are Jill and Robert Colfax, and they lived in Houston, Texas. Jill was a teacher, and Robert sold insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is our hope that if the master defeats us, you may still escape him someday. If you do, she wishes you to find her family and tell them that she is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead.\u201d Charlie suddenly understood. \u201cIf he wins, she\u2019s not leaving the island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She gave her a sad smile. \u201cThis time, Ihiyo will go into the water with her. So will the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Charlie saw the grim logic of it; if they couldn\u2019t win against the vampire in life, they would do it in death. \u201cIf he kills Samuel, I\u2019ll be joining the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might.\u201d Tlemi held up a well-wrapped plastic container. \u201cSince we came to the island, I have been writing about Energ\u00fameno and what he has done with us and our country. When you and Samuel came, I wrote about you. If we must go into the water, I will give this to the waves. It will be our voice to the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming it washes up on the right beach.\u201d A flash of bright light distracted Charlie, and she turned her head to see what appeared to be three full moons in the distance, each bouncing like balls on the surface of the water. \u201cAre those searchlights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Tlemi inhaled sharply. \u201cThe master has brought all three boats, and all of Segundo\u2019s men.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlotte squinted, trying to scan for thoughts. The blankness she felt meant Colotl had already created a shield between them and the sea. \u201cHow many men does he have?\u201d</p><p>Tlemi gave her a helpless look. \u201cSixty. Maybe more.\u201d</p><p>Samuel had been counting on one boat with Segundo and his guards, not an army that outnumbered them three to one. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go and warn him.\u201d</p> <p>Tlemi nodded. \u201cI will stay with Pici and Ihiyo.\u201d</p><p>Charlie took off down the beach, running along the fringe of the waves where the water had packed down the sand. When she got within earshot she began shouting for Samuel, whom she finally spotted standing on the island side of the pier. He was watching the approaching boats, two rock-studded clubs in his hands, until he heard her voice and turned.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for him to come to her, but sprinted to the pier. \u201cThere are at least sixty men on those boats,\u201d she said when she reached him, dragging in air and swallowing before she added, \u201cIf we run now, we can wait until they land and then swim out to the boats. We can strand them here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the plan, honey.\u201d He put an arm around her and kissed her brow. \u201cGo and take cover.\u201d</p> <p>She wanted to take one of the clubs and beat him over the head with it, until her thought stream twined with his, and she saw what he had planned. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy. He won\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe believes he\u2019s our father and our king.\u201d His mouth hitched. \u201cHe\u2019ll do it.\u201d He gave her a gentle push toward the trees. \u201cWait for me up there, Charlie.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time he had called her by her nickname, and it made her eyes sting. \u201cMy name is Charlotte,\u201d she told him before she turned and hurried away.</p><p>Drew came out of the trees, holding out an arm and then pulling her along with him into the bamboo thicket. \u201cYou were supposed to stay with the pregnant chick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew about this challenge thing?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I even helped him modify the macuahuitl blades.\u201d He shoved her behind him.</p> <p>\u201cModify them with what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe human body stores a few milligrams of copper, mostly in the liver,\u201d Drew said in a conversational tone. \u201cIt\u2019s used by the body to produce energy, protect against free-radical cell damage, and keep the neurotransmitters firing, and even helps us metabolize iron.\u201d</p><p>She tried to see past him. \u201cI don\u2019t need a hematology refresher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know you can find traces of it elsewhere, like bound to proteins floating around in your veins.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cBy the way, you weren\u2019t planning on using any of that bagged blood you had chilling in the upstairs fridge, right?\u201d</p><p>Before Charlie could answer, the first of the boats reached the end of the pier, and she saw several armed men jump off to form two lines. The weight of the towering figure who followed them caused the entire pier to shake.</p><p>Charlie froze, her eyes widening as she saw the enormous golden daggers in the vampire\u2019s hands. \u201cDrew. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to use his power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnerg\u00fameno,\u201d Samuel called out before he crossed the macuahuitl over his head. \u201cYou have claimed to be Motecuhzoma, last king of the Aztecs. You have called us your children, and yourself our father. Is this what you believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is what is,\u201d the vampire said. \u201cI gave you this life, and now I will have it back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps you will,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cI challenge your rule.\u201d</p><p>Energ\u00fameno abruptly stopped and stared at him. \u201cYou cannot take my throne from me. You are mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, before you brought me here.\u201d Samuel lowered his arms. \u201cNow your blood runs through my veins. You remember. I\u2019m told you fed it to me yourself.\u201d</p><p>Segundo came up beside the vampire. \u201cIt is a trick, master. He has not turned. Kill him now.\u201d</p><p>Energ\u00fameno swept one of his daggers to one side, slitting the steward\u2019s throat with one motion before he kicked his body from the pier. Segundo fell into the water with a splash, his body quickly sinking out of sight.</p><p>The vampire advanced several paces, halting just out of Samuel\u2019s reach. \u201cCort\u00e9s poured boiling gold down my throat, and that did not kill me. Nor could five hundred years entombed in the earth. Put down your weapons now, warrior, and I will see to it that you die quickly and cleanly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA warrior doesn\u2019t kneel before death.\u201d Samuel tossed one of the macuahuitl at the vampire\u2019s feet. \u201cHe fights to it.\u201d</p><p>Energ\u00fameno tossed away one of his daggers before he bent and seized the hilt of the Aztec sword. \u201cSo you will.\u201d He flipped the heavy blade around his hand so fast it whistled through the air.</p><p>Charlotte surged forward, stopped only by Drew\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t.\u201d He pointed to the men wading through the shallows up to the beach. \u201cHow are they going to attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She wanted only to get to Samuel.</p><p>Colotl came up on her other side and caught her hand, holding his other out to Drew. As soon as he took it the islander\u2019s thoughts streamed into her mind. Charlotte, we must know what they mean to do. Help us.</p><p>\u201cGod damn it, Maggie.\u201d Drew dragged her around. \u201cTell me what they\u2019re thinking before they get to us.\u201d</p><p>She threw down her barriers, gathering up all the thought streams careening around her. \u201cThey know where we\u2019re hiding. They\u2019re going to drop. Throw grenades. Gas us. Knock us out. Carry us back to the boats.\u201d</p><p>Colotl closed his eyes briefly. I have told the others. We must scatter before they use the gas. We will circle around behind them.</p><p>The islanders began moving out through the brush as Charlotte looked down at the pier. Samuel and the vampire were circling each other and trading blows, throwing titanic shadows onto the sand. Wood splintered and flew as their swords met, while the planks of the pier groaned and cracked. Blackened flesh hung like rags from the vampire\u2019s body, while blood ran freely from terrible gashes on her lover\u2019s arms and abdomen.</p><p>She grabbed Drew\u2019s sleeve, tearing the shoulder seam. \u201cHe can\u2019t keep this up. He\u2019ll bleed out before he can heal.\u201d Her eyes shifted as the women came out from under the pier. \u201cJesus Christ, what are they still doing down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re part of the plan.\u201d As the women tossed burning torches onto the pier behind the vampire, Drew grabbed her. \u201cThat\u2019s my cue. Stay put.\u201d</p><p>Charlie ran after him toward the pier, her eyes fixed on Samuel, who was staggering backward, his free hand covering his left eye. Energ\u00fameno advanced slowly, the fire from the burning pier illuminating the golden filigree around the gaping black wounds in his decayed flesh.</p><p>Dolphins shot out of the water, distracting Charlotte as they slammed their bodies into some of the men wading toward the shore. Gulls screeched as they hurtled down from the sky, tearing at the men\u2019s faces. As the islanders emerged from the brush they formed a line and marched toward the beach, each using his or her abilities to attack in unison. One seemed to pull a stream of fire from the burning villa and directed it like a blowtorch at a pair of men stumbling onto the sand, while another flicked his hand at a dune, causing it to rise up like a wave and then collapse on the burning bodies, burying them.</p><p>Bamboo shot across the beach, undulating and curling as it encircled ankles and wrists before tightening into green manacles. As the vampire\u2019s men struggled to free themselves, some began shooting at the islanders. The fire thrower set some of the bamboo alight to form a high barrier of flames between the men and the islanders, while the sand mover created an enormous crater behind the twisting bodies. An invisible force pushed the trapped men close together while the bamboo formed a cagelike sphere. Charlotte glanced over to see Colotl\u2019s tattoo glowing as he focused on the writhing limbs of the vampire\u2019s helpless men. A moment later the bamboo sphere dropped into the massive hole in the beach, and another dune stretched out, filling in the hole until the men vanished from sight.</p><p>Charlie looked back at Samuel, who had dropped to his knees, and shrieked his name, only to find herself on her hands and knees in the sand. After shoving her down, Drew sprinted past her toward the water.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She pushed herself up, struggling to her feet. \u201cSam, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow your heart is mine.\u201d Energ\u00fameno held his sword to one side, raising the golden claw of his hand above Samuel\u2019s chest.</p><p>Charlotte screamed.</p><p>A misty figure appeared out of thin air between the vampire and Samuel, solidifying into Ihiyo\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cFor Mocaya,\u201d Charlotte heard him say just before he jumped at Energ\u00fameno.</p><p>White ice instantly encased the vampire\u2019s body, freezing him in place. A moment later something came whirling through the air from the water like a giant boomerang. Just before it struck the vampire\u2019s back, she saw it was another macuahuitl, this one covered with blades on all sides.</p><p>Samuel shot to his feet, his massive arm sweeping his sword up in a slashing blow.</p><p>Stone screeched against frozen metal, sending an explosion of ice crystals into the night air. Energ\u00fameno stared at Samuel in disbelief, ice cracking and shedding in chunks from his arm as he brought his golden hand up to his face. Ice-coated gold began to fall away from the vampire\u2019s body, thudding onto the damp sand. Energ\u00fameno looked down as his right arm dropped, and then his legs collapsed outward. He opened his mouth as if to speak, the horizontal gash extending across his face and disappearing into his frozen hair. His golden eye remained open as most of his head slid onto his shoulder and rolled away.</p><p>Charlotte felt one last wave of thoughts from the immortal, and caught her breath.</p><p>Samuel stood over him to make one final blow, the stone blades of his macuahuitl cutting cleanly through the vampire\u2019s neck. When the decapitated torso toppled over, he dropped the sword, turning away and starting toward Charlie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She could hear the shouts of Energ\u00fameno\u2019s men as the islanders surrounded them and attacked. Their frantic thoughts and emotions hammered against her mind, but suddenly Samuel was there, too, pushing them away and protecting her.</p><p>He stopped a short distance from her, his bloodied hands at his sides as he looked over at the islanders, who were finishing off the last of Energ\u00fameno\u2019s men. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us were.\u201d She closed the gap between them and touched his battered face, then surveyed the rest of him. Despite the blood loss most of his wounds had already begun to close, but she could feel the rawness of his emotions. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am now.\u201d He bent his head, resting his brow against hers.</p> <p>\u201cHe was like you were before we came here,\u201d she said softly. \u201cPain filled every moment of his life, and he suffered it for so long he forgot what it is to be whole and well and sane. His last thought was how wonderful it felt to finally be free of it.\u201d</p><p>Drew came to them, his trousers soaked to the thighs. \u201cYou two okay?\u201d As Samuel nodded, he glanced at the vampire\u2019s remains. \u201cCan we get off this fucking island now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Samuel looked out at the bodies on the sand, and the tired faces of the islanders walking toward them. \u201cLet\u2019s do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t find a match for the woman\u2019s fingerprints, but the DNA from her saliva tested positive for three alteration markers.\u201d Marlow handed Genaro the lab reports.</p><p>Genaro flipped through the pages. \u201cThere should be six markers.\u201d He glanced at the screen of his laptop, which displayed a video call screen. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to retest the sample, Eliot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary, sir,\u201d his geneticist said. \u201cShe would show three only if one of her parents were human. My guess is she\u2019s second-generation Kyndred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTest the sample and make sure.\u201d Genaro rubbed his tired eyes as he ended the video call and handed the reports back to Marlow. \u201cHas Delaporte faxed the results of the property searches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, but our background check on Foster Stanton turned up something interesting. He\u2019s been receiving a large annual grant from the U.K. to study bird migration patterns.\u201d Marlow went to the wall map. \u201cThe site where he\u2019s supposedly conducting these studies is an island here, about two hundred miles out.\u201d He tapped the spot, and then moved his fingertip a short distance to a tiny cluster of islands nearby. \u201cPROFEPA backed legislation to establish a protected area. No boat is allowed within six nautical miles of these islands.\u201d</p><p>It appeared to be the perfect place to conceal the Kyndred, but he wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cGet me satellite images.\u201d</p><p>Marlow left, and returned a short time later with a sheaf of printouts. \u201cThese were the last images recorded by our satellite before it moved out of range about twelve hours ago. There\u2019s a large structure that looks like some sort of religious temple on Stanton\u2019s island.\u201d He put one image on the desk, and then placed another atop it. \u201cThe satellite also picked up a fifth island that doesn\u2019t appear on any of the maps, but appears to be inhabited.\u201d He pointed to the seven large structures forming a ring around the island.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Genaro closed the laptop and got to his feet. \u201cCall our pilots at the airport and have them prepare the helicopters. We\u2019ll be leaving as soon as they\u2019re ready to take off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow many choppers will we need, sir?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t letting the drug lord escape him again. \u201cAll of them.\u201d</p><p>On the way to the airport, Genaro placed a video call to Delaporte to tell him they were relocating. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many we\u2019ll be able to recover from these islands, but have the lab in Los Angeles make arrangements for a dozen new acquisitions. Also, have them prepare interrogation rooms for Taske, Riordan, Flores, and Marena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I checked satellite images of those islands last night,\u201d his security chief said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing on them but some palm trees and birds. You\u2019re wasting your time going out there.\u201d</p><p>Delaporte didn\u2019t know that Marlow had pulled the satellite images, or that he had just betrayed himself.</p><p>Fury erupted inside Genaro, but he kept his expression bland. \u201cWell, then you\u2019ve saved me a long and uncomfortable flight. Good work, Don.\u201d</p><p>His security chief looked satisfied. \u201cI\u2019ll continue with the property searches, and get back to you as soon as we find anything of interest, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d Genaro ended the call and immediately dialed Eliot Kirchner\u2019s private line. \u201cDon Delaporte just tried to divert me away from the Kyndred. You were right. He\u2019s a traitor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that, Jonah.\u201d The geneticist sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of him personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep him sedated in isolation until I return,\u201d Genaro told him. \u201cNo one is to have access to him but you and me.\u201d</p><p>At the airport Marlow directed all of his men into the waiting transport carriers before joining Genaro. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to move quickly. I just got word that the Mexican army is on its way down here to take back the city.\u201d</p><p>More of Delaporte\u2019s handiwork, Genaro guessed. \u201cOnce we have the acquisitions secured, we\u2019ll fly directly back to the States.\u201d</p><p>In the air, ten minutes away from the islands, Genaro saw black smears, too dark to be clouds, marring the bright blue sky. He put on the headset that allowed him to talk to the helicopter pilot. \u201cIs smoke coming from a ship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d The pilot pointed toward the horizon. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from that landmass over there.\u201d</p><p>Beside him, Marlow checked the map, and then swore. \u201cIt\u2019s the unmapped island,\u201d he shouted over the noise of the rotors.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to land,\u201d Genaro instructed the pilot. \u201cMake a low pass so I can see what\u2019s down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>The helicopter descended to fly through the drifting smoke, dissipating enough of it to provide a partial view. The remains of the structures still smoldered, but from the amount of scorched rubble it was clear they had been burned to the ground. Unmoving bodies littered the beach in front of one of the houses, and smaller fires had broken out over the remainder of the island.</p><p>As the pilot completed his final pass, something exploded behind them, sending a shock wave through the helicopter. Genaro looked back to watch a small mushroom cloud of fire and smoke billow into the air.</p><p>\u201cThe survivors may have retreated to Stanton\u2019s island,\u201d Marlow shouted.</p><p>Genaro nodded, and told the pilot to change course, but from what he had seen he knew they were too late. Whatever battle had been fought was finished, and the victors were long gone.</p><p>Several hours later Marlow emerged from the Aztec temple on Stanton\u2019s island and confirmed Genaro\u2019s suspicions. \u201cThey left everything behind: money, drugs, artifacts, and enough weapons to outfit an army division. The Mexican government is sending a couple of navy ships out to investigate the source of the fires.\u201d</p><p>The sounds of three more distant explosions made Genaro glance out at the sea. \u201cRecall your men. We\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>Marlow nodded and gave the order over his handheld.</p><p>On the flight back to California, Genaro brooded over the events of the day. The complete failure of the mission had created a substantial setback, but had also resulted in exposing the most dangerous spy in his organization.</p><p>Delaporte\u2019s military training wouldn\u2019t protect him from the barrage of drugs and torture Genaro planned to use on him. Given his level of access to GenHance\u2019s operations, the lengthy time he had spent working for the company, and the number of crimes he had personally committed, his security chief was not working for the government or the authorities. Instead Genaro felt sure that Delaporte reported directly to a competitor interested in stealing the transerum; as soon as Kirchner came up with a successful formula, Delaporte probably would have taken it and the geneticist. But if that were the case, why was he trying to prevent the Kyndred from being captured?</p><p>After landing at one of the secluded airstrips GenHance maintained, Marlow escorted Genaro from the helicopter to the limousine waiting at the edge of the runway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to debrief the men, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll fly back to Atlanta tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReport to my office first thing in the morning,\u201d Genaro told him before he climbed into the back of the limo. He would need someone to replace Delaporte, and Marlow had proven to be reliable, if somewhat unimaginative.</p><p>Marlow gave him a casual salute and trotted off toward the hangars.</p><p>Genaro waited for the car to move, and when it didn\u2019t, he pressed the intercom button. \u201cTake me to LAX.\u201d When no reply came over the speaker, he reached for the button to lower the divider. \u201cI said\u2014\u201d He fell silent as he saw the empty driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>Delaporte\u2019s familiar voice came over the walkie-talkie strapped to the small bundle of gray bricks and wires sitting on the center console. \u201cGood-bye, Jonah.\u201d</p><p>Genaro turned and grabbed the door handle.</p><p>As the limo exploded, flying shrapnel forced Marlow to drop to the ground and cover his head. He waited until the rain of twisted metal and glass ended before he raised his head to look back and get to his feet. Men started running out of the hangars, shouting as they hurried toward the burning vehicle.</p><p>He took out the satellite phone he had used only once in Mexico, and pressed redial.</p><p>The voice that answered was not the one he expected, and its dark beauty sent a trickle of cold sweat down Marlow\u2019s spine. \u201cIs it done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d He looked once more at the burning wreckage that had become Jonah Genaro\u2019s funeral pyre before he gave Richard Tremayne a final assurance. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Agraciana had suggested going to her village after discovering the boat engines contained only enough fuel to take them back to the mainland. \u201cWe can take shelter in my father\u2019s house while I arrange transportation for you back to America.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They had arrived just before dawn, and at first the dock appeared empty. It was only when Agraciana stepped off that an elderly man emerged from the shadows and called her name.</p><p>\u201cPapi?\u201d She ran to him, halting only when she saw the silver-haired woman standing beside him. All the color drained out of her face. \u201cMama?\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded, her eyes bright with tears as she held out her arms.</p> <p>Charlie tensed as more people walked down the dock, until she saw the flashlights and blankets they were carrying.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re among friends,\u201d Sam told her.</p><p>The islanders remained on the boats, almost huddling together as they watched the villagers. Their odd behavior reminded Charlie of the near-complete isolation they had lived in for most of their lives.</p><p>\u201cTlemi.\u201d She smiled at the redhead. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Come with me and Sam and meet Agraciana\u2019s friends.\u201d</p><p>Colotl took her hand, helping her off the boat and walking beside her down the dock. He appeared braced for another battle, but did nothing as the excited villagers surrounded them. Everyone talked all at once as kind hands draped blankets over the islanders\u2019 shoulders. Another woman brought a tray of brightly colored ceramic mugs filled with a steaming brew that smelled spicy-sweet, and began handing them out as the other islanders cautiously approached.</p> <p>Colotl took a sip from his cup, met Charlie\u2019s gaze, and grinned like a boy.</p><p>Drew left Agraciana with her parents and came over to Charlie and Samuel. \u201cGracie says they\u2019ve got food and cots for everyone over at the church. The men of the village will keep watch so we can get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Charlie frowned. \u201cHow did they know we\u2019d come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man and a woman stopped by here an hour ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThey knew everything that happened to us. They also brought Gracie\u2019s mother home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were they?\u201d Samuel asked.</p><p>Drew shrugged. \u201cNo one recognized them, but Gracie\u2019s father said the woman wore a red flower in her hair. She also had a tattoo on the back of her hand.\u201d His mouth hitched. \u201cA dove.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSam.\u201d Charlie watched the sun glisten along the gleaming white hull of the vessel sailing into the bay. It had been three days since they\u2019d escaped the island, and while the villagers had taken good care of them, she was more than ready to go home. \u201cIs that our ride back to the States out there?\u201d</p><p>Samuel shaded his eyes for a moment to have a look before he continued reeling in his line. \u201cI believe it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d He peered again. \u201cHow odd. It bears a striking resemblance to one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a yacht.\u201d She turned to him and planted her hands on her hips. \u201cYou chartered a yacht.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re smuggling thirteen people into the United States,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThirteen American citizens who were experimented on by mad scientists before they were sold to a vampire,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWhatever you want to call them, honey, they\u2019re still not going to fit on a rubber raft.\u201d</p> <p>Agraciana appeared at the other end of the dock and waved. \u201cCome to the church,\u201d she called to them. \u201cDinner\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Samuel secured the hook to the fishing pole before shouldering it and pulling out of the water the string of fish he\u2019d already caught. He surveyed them with satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss this.\u201d</p><p>Charlie picked up his bait bucket, wrinkling her nose at the contents. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>They walked down the dock and through the dunes to the shell-lined path leading to the church that had served not only as their hotel but as the village\u2019s command center. Over the last seventy-two hours Agraciana\u2019s family and neighbors had gone into action, bringing a seamstress with piles of garments she altered to replace the islanders\u2019 worn clothing, a cobbler to fit them with shoes, and a hairdresser to trim their shaggy manes. A lovely old red velvet lounger had been brought over specifically for Pici\u2019s use, as well as a stereo, a television set, and a DVD player.</p><p>Charlie had chuckled at the islanders\u2019 reaction the first time the television had been switched on. At first it frightened them, until Samuel changed the station to one that showed cartoons, which soon fascinated them. While they couldn\u2019t understand the Spanish dubbing, none of them seemed to tire of watching the antics of Tom and Jerry.</p><p>The aroma of delicious food met them at the doors to the church, and Charlie and Samuel paused there to admire the sight of the picnic tables they had been using for meals, now laden with so many platters, bowls, and baskets the tops were completely concealed.</p><p>The generosity made Charlie\u2019s heart ache. \u201cEvery cupboard in this town must be bare by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cTomorrow Drew and Agraciana will make sure everyone is amply repaid for their efforts.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cThey\u2019re staying behind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a few weeks, so Agraciana can have some time with her mother.\u201d He put his arm around her shoulders. \u201cCharlotte, as soon as we return, Matthias will take charge of relocating the islanders. You and I have other business to attend to.\u201d</p><p>Charlie knew Matthias had a network of safe houses and properties, but the islanders didn\u2019t know him. \u201cWe can go with them, make sure they\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you want to change your identity, we have to make a public appearance. Give the media a happy ending.\u201d Before she could say anything he added, \u201cAll it will take is one press conference. I\u2019ve already arranged it and the cover story about our rescue.\u201d</p><p>So it had begun; she had expected it, but not so soon. Everything would be so easy for him; he\u2019d make a call, transfer some money, talk into some microphones, and his world would be just as it was before they were taken. Because Charlie had been on the job when she\u2019d been kidnapped, she knew she was facing a six-week administrative leave and a mandatory psych evaluation. She had four hundred dollars and change in her checking account; not enough to cover even her rent for a month. Although under the circumstances, she wouldn\u2019t be surprised to discover that her landlord had sublet her apartment and put her belongings up for auction on eBay.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a blind smile. \u201cSure, I can do a press conference. We both want our lives back; we should do whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>Samuel closed the door to the church. \u201cForgive me, but I don\u2019t want to be a lonely cripple again, or talk to you on a computer, or lie awake at night wondering where you are and what you\u2019re doing. I want you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you do.\u201d She tried to choose her next words carefully. \u201cSam, when we were on the island, you thought you were going to die. So did I. We said a lot of crazy things. We needed something good, and it was. It was wonderful. But it\u2019s over now.\u201d</p><p>His hands dropped away. \u201cI meant every word I said to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you did, m\u00edo.\u201d She turned away. \u201cBut we\u2019re safe now, so I\u2019m letting you off the hook. You can go back to Boston or wherever and sell your antiques and manage your millions. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a brave woman.\u201d He put his hands on her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re also a terrible liar. I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>The only thing she could use as her last defense was the truth. \u201cYou don\u2019t need me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Samuel turned her around. \u201cI love you, Charlotte Marena. Without you I have no life, so please.\u201d He touched his lips to hers. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t read his thoughts until the sun set, but she didn\u2019t have to. Everything he felt for her was in his voice, in his eyes, and in the heart beating against hers. \u201cI won\u2019t. At least, not until we\u2019re very old, and gray haired, and ready to go to the next place.\u201d</p><p>Samuel kissed her until the church door opened and Drew stepped out.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt, but Gracie needs to talk to you.\u201d He gestured inside.</p><p>Charlie and Samuel followed him into the church, past the tables where everyone was still enjoying the food, and into the hall where the cots had been set up.</p><p>Agraciana stood in front of the television, which was showing a funeral of someone important, judging by the hundreds of mourners in attendance. When she saw them she reached over and shut it off.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Charlie asked.</p><p>\u201cI am not certain.\u201d She reached into her pocket and took out a business card. \u201cThe man and woman who brought my mother home left this with her. In all the excitement she forgot about it.\u201d She offered it to Samuel. \u201cThey asked her to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the card and showed it to Charlie, who read the two lines printed on it.</p><p>\u201cMichael Cyprien. I don\u2019t know that name, but he has an international phone number.\u201d She looked up at him, but he only shook his head.</p><p>\u201cShould we call it?\u201d Drew asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Samuel pocketed the card. \u201cWe should go have dinner with our friends.\u201d</p><p>The media wanted much more than one press conference, but Samuel\u2019s small army of attorneys and security guards as well as sympathetic city officials kept them at bay as they left the mayor\u2019s conference room. After a brief trip to Charlie\u2019s apartment to collect what she needed, their police escort drove them directly to the airport, where Samuel\u2019s private plane waited.</p><p>Charlie, who had never flown anything but economy class, tried not to gawk at everything while Samuel spoke to the pilot. After turning down the drink offered by the pretty flight attendant, Charlie sank back in the sumptuous cushions of her seat and closed her eyes.</p><p>A big hand reached across her to buckle her seat belt and adjust the back of her seat to a reclining position.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping through my first flight on the Concord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the Concord, honey.\u201d Samuel tucked a weightless, prewarmed blanket around her. \u201cIt\u2019s only a Learjet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d She pursed her lips and pretended to look around. \u201cWell, this isn\u2019t bad, for a compact.\u201d She yawned. \u201cProbably gets better gas mileage, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to consult my mechanic.\u201d He lifted the arm between her seat and the other two beside it, and adjusted those so they reclined at the same angle. By the time he took off his jacket and sat down beside her, Charlotte was asleep.</p><p>The flight attendant silently offered him another blanket, but Samuel shook his head. She nodded and retreated to the front of the cabin.</p> <p>Samuel could sleep whenever he wanted, but as he had discovered on the island, he no longer needed to. It seemed to be the final gift of his transformation, one that worried him until he\u2019d discussed it privately with Matthias when he had met them on the yacht.</p><p>\u201cIt is the same for me, Samuel.\u201d The former Roman soldier, who had survived two thousand years buried in an icy grave, looked out over the water. \u201cAfter I came down from the mountain, I did not sleep for months. Lifting weights before you retire helps quiet the mind.\u201d His expression softened. \u201cSo does lovemaking.\u201d</p><p>Samuel took out the card Agraciana had given him and handed it to him. \u201cThis was left for us in Mexico. The number is unregistered. Michael Cyprien is the name of a reclusive, mysterious billionaire who apparently owns enough of the U.S. to secede from the union and form his own country, and yet has never once been interviewed or even photographed.\u201d</p><p>Matthias read the print. \u201cI think this is an invitation to talk.\u201d He returned it. \u201cAre you going to accept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He tucked the card away and glanced at the islanders, who had gathered in one of their circles on deck to silently commune with one another.</p> <p>\u201cThe time ahead will not be easy for them,\u201d Matthias said. \u201cTo avoid unwanted attention, we must separate and settle them in different locations. From what Charlotte has told me, they have never before lived apart from one another.\u201d</p><p>His comment made Samuel consider an alternative. \u201cPerhaps they don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Still yawning from the ridiculously long nap she\u2019d taken on the jet, Charlie stepped out of the terminal and surveyed the waiting limo and the uniformed chauffeur. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re right back where we started, Sam.\u201d As they walked over, she peered at the smiling face of the driver. \u201cHey, I know you. James, right? How\u2019s the lung?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking perfectly, thanks to your care, ma\u2019am.\u201d He touched the rim of his cap before his expression sobered and he regarded Taske. \u201cSir, I can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am for what happened on the bridge that morning. If you want my resignation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime, Findley, or any other.\u201d Taske pulled the driver into a careful bear hug before resting a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou still look pale. Are you certain that you\u2019re well enough to drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be running any marathons for a while, sir,\u201d Findley admitted ruefully, \u201cbut I can manage the drive home.\u201d</p> <p>Once they were on the road, Charlie felt a fresh surge of apprehension. \u201cYou never told me exactly where home is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI own several properties here and abroad, but I spend most of my time at Tannerbridge.\u201d He picked up her hand and frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re cold.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m a little clammy, too. Nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve survived a sniper attack, an abduction, the island, and the American media,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cAll with the courage and fortitude of a tigress. I\u2019m sure you can manage a visit to my humble abode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the abode were humble, which it\u2019s not,\u201d she guessed. \u201cNo one names a duplex or a town house or a double-wide trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents were sentimental.\u201d He rubbed her hand between his. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. If you hate it, we\u2019ll leave and find a nice, quiet hotel.\u201d</p><p>She hmphed. \u201cNow you\u2019re trying to distract me with sex.\u201d</p><p>A groove appeared in his cheek. \u201cIs it working?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould be.\u201d The foot of space between them became unbearable, and Charlie unbuckled her seat belt to shift herself over onto his lap. Once she had her arms looped around his neck and her face tucked under his chin, she sighed. \u201cTell me about your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a custom-built double king.\u201d He bent his head to whisper, \u201cWith silk sheets and a down feather duvet. They smell like sunshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cForget the hotel.\u201d</p><p>Findley drove for more than an hour, leaving behind the city for the back roads through the country, where the forests seemed to march on forever. Now and then she would see a private road leading off through a gate, most crowned with a curving sign proclaiming the property\u2019s name in elegant letters: Emerald Acres, Hudson\u2019s Folly, Feathersound.</p><p>\u201cFeathers don\u2019t make any sound,\u201d she grumbled to Samuel as Findley turned and brought the limo to a halt before a towering pair of gates fashioned out of wrought iron to resemble a bridge.</p><p>For a moment she felt a spike of terror, until she saw the forms of the diminutive couple walking hand in hand over it.</p><p>\u201cMy parents met on Tanner Bridge,\u201d Samuel said, tightening his arms around her. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have it taken down today, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. Not everything that happens on a bridge is bad.\u201d As the gates opened and Findley drove through, she glanced back before meeting Samuel\u2019s worried gaze. \u201cWe found each other on one, remember?\u201d</p><p>The drive stretched another two miles before they reached the main house on the estate. Charlie eyed the stately brick structure, which was too large to be called anything but a mansion. A slim man stood waiting by a gigantic, merrily splashing bronze fountain, its pool-size basin edged with dozens of petite red rosebushes. As soon as the car stopped he came to open the door.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, sir.\u201d He turned to Charlie. \u201cI\u2019m Morehouse, Miss Marena. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d</p><p>His British accent made her scowl. \u201cI bet you\u2019re the guy who came up with those evil chocolate-cherry scones that Sam e-mailed the recipe for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I am.\u201d Morehouse looked a little flustered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you didn\u2019t enjoy them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see this?\u201d Charlie patted her hip. \u201cAt least ten pounds of this is your fault.\u201d She grinned. \u201cSo, you got any more stashed away in there?\u201d</p><p>Morehouse suppressed a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll serve them with your tea this afternoon, madam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you want to give me a tour and all,\u201d Charlie murmured as they followed the house manager inside, \u201cbut I need a shower, and you to scrub my back. And my front. And anything else you feel like scrubbing.\u201d</p><p>Samuel\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cI would be delighted, but I do have something to show you first.\u201d</p><p>She sidled up against him. \u201cIs this a fast something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we stay inside,\u201d he said.</p><p>While Morehouse took their cases up to the master suite, Samuel led Charlie through a bewildering labyrinth of magnificent rooms to a long, wide atrium. Glass skylights provided sunny light and glimpses of the sky, while a wall of French doors offered a panoramic view of the gardens beyond the main house. \u201cWow.\u201d Charlie stopped and smiled as she looked out at the maze of flowers, arbors, and trees, and the ring of picturesque cottages in the distance. \u201cThis is gorgeous.\u201d Her eyes shifted as a man and woman came walking out of a bower of sweet peas, their arms around each other. \u201cUh, your gardeners are really friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d He sounded amused.</p><p>As the couple walked into the sunlight, the woman\u2019s neatly trimmed red hair blazed, and the man\u2019s dark skin glowed like melting chocolate.</p><p>\u201cTlemi and Colotl.\u201d Charlie turned to stare at him. \u201cWhat are they doing here? I thought Matthias was going to take them to his farm in Tennessee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI persuaded him to bring them here.\u201d He gestured toward the cottages. \u201cAs you can see, I have more than enough space, and they\u2019ll have the time they need to adjust to our culture, learn English, and decide what they want to do with their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really great.\u201d Charlie saw Pici and Ihiyo joining the other couple. \u201cWait. How many of them did he bring?\u201d</p><p>Samuel smiled. \u201cAll of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve basically adopted twelve grown-up kids.\u201d She tucked her arm through his. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of work, and probably cost you a large fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuckily I\u2019ve made several.\u201d His smile slipped. \u201cIf my wealth is still an issue, I\u2019ll give it all away tomorrow. I have everything I need now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a crazy man.\u201d She squeezed his hand. \u201cBut there might be others like them out there. We can\u2019t help them if we\u2019re living in a one-room apartment on my salary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, do I want to live in the mansion or the one-room apartment?\u201d She pretended to think. \u201cYou know, I really need to see this bed.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head and kissed her before guiding her around. \u201cRight this way, madam.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Anyone hoping to get a table at the most popular French restaurant in Manhattan usually had to make reservations six months in advance. The food at D\u2019Anges, however, was rumored to be well worth the wait. So it was odd that on the night of September 29, passersby noticed that the front of the restaurant remained dark, and every table stood empty. The only explanation had been taped to the front door: a small white sign that simply read, CLOSED 9/29 FOR PRIVATE FUNCTION.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re late.\u201d In the restaurant\u2019s kitchen, Rowan Dansant-Meriden glanced at her watch. \u201cThe snapper bisque won\u2019t be fit to eat soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we will serve it chilled.\u201d Jean-Marc, the owner and head chef of D\u2019Anges, as well as one of her lovers, took off his apron before he ran a soothing hand along her tense back. \u201cYou do not have to do this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat, leave Samuel alone in their clutches while I hide in the kitchen like a girl?\u201d She made a rude sound. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She glanced over at Charlotte Marena, who was having a laughing discussion in Spanish with their pastry chef. \u201cHey, Maggie, stop distracting the kid from his work. He\u2019s got to finish those champagne \u00e9clairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLo siento,\u201d Charlotte said, bumping shoulders with Enrique before joining Rowan and Jean-Marc and glancing at the clock over the sous-chef\u2019s station. \u201cThey\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Rowan linked arms with her. \u201cWe\u2019ll go keep the boys company.\u201d She looked back over her shoulder. \u201cIf you feel the urge to change, I left some clothes for you upstairs.\u201d</p> <p>Jean-Marc chuckled and blew her a kiss.</p><p>The women left the kitchen and went around the corner to the private room reserved for the chef\u2019s table, a weekly event that Manhattan\u2019s most devoted foodies would do anything to attend. Tonight only two men sat at the long glass table, and both were completely engrossed in a laptop showing a football game.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s winning?\u201d Rowan asked.</p><p>\u201cGreen Bay,\u201d Drew said absently. \u201cRodgers is merciless tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now. The Patriots will have no difficulty coming from behind,\u201d Samuel assured him before he smiled up at Charlotte. \u201cThey\u2019re late.\u201d</p> <p>She sat down beside him and helped herself to one of Rowan\u2019s delicious amuse bouches. \u201cSecond thoughts, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayback,\u201d Drew said. \u201cWe made them wait first. For months.\u201d The sound of the front doorbell made him straighten. \u201cAt least they don\u2019t hold a grudge.\u201d He switched off the laptop and stowed it under his chair before he shrugged into his jacket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show them in.\u201d Rowan sauntered out.</p><p>Samuel took Charlotte\u2019s hand in his. \u201cGenaro is dead, Kirchner is in prison, and Delaporte has destroyed everything that might expose us.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little. \u201cYou mean, stop worrying about something as simple and easy as meeting the vampires whose DNA was used to change us into superhumans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were created to hunt them down and kill them,\u201d Samuel said softly. \u201cI think we can hold our own.\u201d</p> <p>They both looked up as Rowan returned with three strangers. One, a broad, scarred-faced man with light eyes and an impassive expression, surveyed the room before stepping to one side. Behind him a petite, chestnut-haired woman stood beside a man who could have been Jean-Marc Dansant\u2019s twin brother.</p><p>Samuel rose to his feet. \u201cWelcome, Mr. Cyprien, Dr. Keller, Mr. Navarre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonsieur.\u201d Cyprien inclined his head, and then studied Charlotte and Drew for a moment. \u201cWe are happy that you finally agreed to this meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Alexandra,\u201d the woman said to Samuel. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not that happy. You wouldn\u2019t even tell us your names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you already knew some of them.\u201d Samuel gestured toward the empty chairs at the other end of the table. \u201cPlease join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe assume you can\u2019t eat food,\u201d Rowan said as she brought a bottle of wine to the table. \u201cCan you handle a little overpriced merlot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, no.\u201d Cyprien took the seat directly opposite Samuel\u2019s, but lifted his hands from the table an instant after touching it. \u201cThis is made of copper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d Drew took a penny from his pocket and flipped it into the air, where it hung suspended as it stretched out and became a miniature dagger. \u201cSo are most of the fixtures in this room. Which, by the way, I will not hesitate to use to skewer your immortal asses\u201d\u2014the little dagger flew across the room and buried itself in the wall behind Cyprien\u2019s head\u2014\u201cshould you try to help yourselves to some takeout.\u201d</p> <p>Alexandra burst out laughing. \u201cGod, you guys are smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not interested in feeding on any of you, monsieur.\u201d Cyprien held up his palms in a gesture of surrender. \u201cWe wished only to meet our progeny.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte scowled. \u201cWe are not your children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, no, you\u2019re not,\u201d Alexandra agreed. \u201cWe can\u2019t have kids.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked over as Jean-Marc entered the room. \u201cAh, you have arrived. I must go soon, but I thought . . . I would . . .\u201d He trailed off as he stared at Cyprien\u2019s face. \u201cMon Dieu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess whose DNA you got,\u201d Rowan drawled.</p><p>Cyprien rose and slowly extended his hand. After a moment, Jean-Marc took it in his own and began speaking to him in their native language.</p><p>\u201cDoes he fuss at you for leaving your clothes on the floor?\u201d Alexandra asked Rowan, who nodded. \u201cSome things are genetic.\u201d To Cyprien she said, \u201cQuit talking in French. It\u2019s rude to the English speakers, which is everyone else but Phillipe.\u201d</p><p>Both men glanced at her and apologized at the same time before uttering identical chuckles.</p><p>\u201cThis is incredible.\u201d Cyprien regarded his twin. \u201cAre there others among you who are . . . like the two of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cBut it\u2019s safe to assume there will be some Kyndred who were altered to be body doubles.\u201d As Cyprien met his gaze, he added, \u201cSo they could assume your identities after you were killed.\u201d</p><p>Cyprien sat back down. \u201cWe have no quarrel with you, monsieur. I wish you to understand that. We chose to intervene on your behalf in Mexico to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth,\u201d Charlotte murmured to Samuel.</p><p>\u201cSo you must be a mind reader. I have a similar problem, just with killers.\u201d Alexandra\u2019s expression turned wry. \u201cAnd yes, we do have excellent hearing. If you don\u2019t want us to hear what you whisper, you need to be about a block away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we want, Doctor, are some answers,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cWhy are you protecting us? Why offer to meet us? What do you really want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, primarily we\u2019d like to establish diplomatic relations so you don\u2019t end up being used by our enemies as weapons against us.\u201d Alexandra ignored the sharp sound Cyprien made. \u201cTrust me; I have the inside track on this. I was one of you before I grew fangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were Kyndred.\u201d Rowan looked skeptical.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019ll give you before and after blood samples.\u201d Alexandra tapped the inside of her forearm. \u201cFor the \u2018after,\u2019 you\u2019ll need the master of small change here to coat a syringe with copper. Nothing else penetrates our immortal asses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think any exchanges of blood should be avoided for right now,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cWe accept that you have wanted only to protect us, but you murdered Jonah Genaro. We can\u2019t condone or support that kind of violence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so we should have just let him go on kidnapping you, and dissecting you, and using your DNA to make monsters?\u201d Alexandra asked sweetly. She blinked as Drew slid a thick file across the table at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? A petition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidence,\u201d Drew said flatly. \u201cSome of us have spent years compiling it. We had put together almost enough to shut down GenHance and put Genaro in prison for the rest of his life.\u201d</p><p>Cyprien picked up the file and skimmed through it. \u201cSo you believe you do not need our protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am saying that we never asked for it,\u201d Samuel said softly.</p><p>Cyprien closed the folder. \u201cGenaro\u2019s death does not guarantee a safe future for the Kyndred or the Darkyn. For that, monsieur, we must work together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a team?\u201d Drew asked.</p><p>Phillipe muttered something, and Alexandra grinned. \u201cNo, pal. Like a family.\u201d Her eyes strayed to Jean-Marc, who was shaking and groping for a chair. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>Rowan swore under her breath as she went to him and helped him to sit. \u201cHe will be in a second.\u201d She knelt beside him, holding his hands as he hunched over.</p><p>Alexandra\u2019s eyes widened as Jean-Marc\u2019s body began to grow larger and his long black hair receded into his skull, and she knocked over her chair getting to her feet. She reached the chef at the same moment Charlotte did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Charlotte told her. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t take long to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo change into what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy other boyfriend,\u201d Rowan said, sighing as the transformation ended, and a big blond man lifted his head. \u201cSay hi, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, honey.\u201d The big man pulled her close and gave her a lingering kiss before he looked around the room. \u201cThey the vampires?\u201d he asked, his deep voice just as startling as his appearance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us.\u201d Alexandra sat back on her heels. \u201cSo he can cook and shape-shift. I\u2019ll be damned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a great deal to learn from one another,\u201d Cyprien said. \u201cPerhaps that is the best place for us to begin.\u201d He rose and walked over to Samuel, and held out his hand. \u201cIn hope that our people may someday become friends, monsieur.\u201d</p><p>Samuel looked at Charlotte, who nodded, as did Rowan and Drew, before he took Cyprien\u2019s hand. \u201cYou can call me Paracelsus.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
