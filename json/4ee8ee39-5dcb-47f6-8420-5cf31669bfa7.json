Although she was currently missing, dammit to hell.</p> <p>Sophia took equal pride in her reputation as being the \u201cbitch of all bitches.\u201d</p><p>It was a reputation she\u2019d worked hard to earn and the primary reason why she\u2019d hesitated before she\u2019d returned to Chicago to purchase the sprawling brick house in the chi-chi neighborhood near the shores of Lake Michigan.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want anyone thinking she\u2019d become all mushily maternal in her old age. Okay, she might be secretly delighted that her daughter Harley was expecting her first litter of children. And there might be the teeny-tiniest desire to settle into a lair near her family.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like she was going to sit around knitting booties.</p><p>Hell, she\u2019d just opened a high-end strip club with the finest male Were dancers to be found in the Northern Hemisphere. Sophia\u2019s Menagerie would soon be known as the one and only destination for women of discerning taste.</p><p>Human or demon.</p> <p>And of course, she\u2019d already managed to cause a stir among her snotty neighbors.</p><p>Without undue vanity she knew she was drop-dead gorgeous.</p><p>Her hair was a curtain of pale gold satin that tumbled to the center of her back. Her face was heart-shaped with fragile features that were dominated by a pair of pure green eyes. And her slender body, which was currently attired in skintight leather pants and barely there halter top, could (and often did) stop traffic.</p><p>But it was the smoldering sexuality that heated the air around her, along with the predatory hunger in her smile that made the men trip over their tongues when she was near.</p><p>And made women detest her on sight.</p><p>The flutter over her arrival had definitely added a spice to her move to the stuck-up, overly pretentious gated community.</p><p>And earned her an enemy.</p><p>Sophia shook off the unwelcome thought as she stomped across the tiled floor of her foyer to yank open one of the double oak doors that was framed by high arched windows.</p> <p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she growled.</p><p>Ignoring her warning, the tall, raven-haired Were attired in a black Gucci suit with a white shirt and blue silk tie brushed past her.</p><p>Salvatore, King of all Weres, looked like royalty with his arrogantly handsome features and golden eyes that glowed with the power of his wolf. His hair was slicked into a short tail at his nape, and his lips curved into a sardonic smile.</p><p>\u201cIs that any way to greet your favorite son-in-law?\u201d he demanded, folding his arms over his chest.</p><p>Sophia planted her hands on her hips, not about to be intimidated. Salvatore might be her king, but she\u2019d already gone above and beyond when it came to duty to her people.</p><p>She was done taking orders.</p><p>\u201cHave you found Cassandra?\u201d she demanded, referring to her missing daughter.</p><p>Salvatore grimaced. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re not my favorite son-in-law and we have nothing to discuss.\u201d She motioned her hand toward the still open door. \u201cTa-ta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCristo, Sophia.\u201d Salvatore frowned, his Italian accent more pronounced than usual. \u201cWhy will you not be reasonable?\u201d</p><p>It was a tediously familiar argument.</p><p>\u201cBy reasonable I assume you mean, \u2018Why won\u2019t I be a good girl and allow myself to be incarcerated in Styx\u2019s dungeon?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The king snorted. \u201cHardly a dungeon. I might not like the leeches, but not even you can deny Styx\u2019s lair is the finest piece of real estate in Chicago. It makes most museums look shabby.\u201d</p><p>It was true.</p><p>Styx and Darcy\u2019s lair, which was only a few miles to the north, was a sprawling mausoleum filled with acres of marble and gilt and priceless works of art.</p><p>Her own home was half the size, but as far as she was concerned it was far superior.</p><p>The long sunken living room was decorated in shades of pale gray and silver with a glass wall overlooking the pool and distant tennis courts. The kitchen was large and airy with a breakfast nook and an attached dining room. A curved double staircase led from the foyer to the master suite upstairs, which had a bed large enough to accommodate a football team and a built-in whirlpool that would make any Were purr in pleasure.</p><p>And her bathroom ... it was every woman\u2019s fantasy, with a shower that ran the entire length of one wall, while the tub was deep enough to drown in.</p><p>No way in hell was she giving up her comforts to hide in the basement of a leech.</p><p>Or at least, that was the story she\u2019d given her daughters when they pleaded for her to join them.</p><p>And she was sticking to it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d she informed her unwelcome guest. \u201cAnd it\u2019s crawling with bloodsuckers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daughters are all settled in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. They need your protection.\u201d She was genuinely relieved to know that Darcy and Harley and Regan were safely hidden. If only Cassandra was with them she could at last breathe easy. \u201cI, however, do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are dangerous times, Sophia. Even for a pure-blooded Were.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>Yeah, King of the Obvious.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a demon alive who wasn\u2019t aware that the Dark Lord was threatening to return from his banishment and unleash all hell. Or that there were all sorts of nasties crawling out of the shadows.</p><p>Which was precisely why her daughters were currently being hidden in Styx\u2019s lair.</p><p>And why she wasn\u2019t about to put them in any further danger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been taking care of myself for centuries.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore studied her stubborn expression.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to anymore,\u201d he said at last, his voice soft. \u201cYou have a family.\u201d</p><p>Once those words would have given her a rash. Now it made her heart warm with a strange emotion.</p><p>Hell, maybe she was getting old.</p><p>\u201cA family is like medicine.\u201d She twisted her lips into a sardonic smile. \u201cBest in small doses.\u201d</p><p>The golden eyes flared as his wolf prowled close to the surface.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also your king. I could make joining us an order.\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened, edged with a warning that made the large predator pale.</p><p>\u201cAnd I could tell Harley about those nymph triplets that you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he abruptly interrupted, headed toward the door. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat danger could I be in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, evil can lurk anywhere.\u201d Salvatore paused on the wide veranda to glance toward the distant homes surrounded by their perfectly manicured grounds. \u201cEven suburbia.\u201d</p><p>Sophia managed to hide her tiny shiver.</p><p>\u201cConcentrate on finding Cassandra,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I need you, I\u2019ll call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself... .\u201d Salvatore tossed her a mocking grin. \u201cGranny.\u201d</p><p>Sophia narrowed her gaze.</p><p>Okay, she might be tickled pink that Harley was pregnant, but there was no way in hell she was putting up with \u201cgranny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me that again and the litter Harley is carrying will be the last babies you\u2019re capable of producing.\u201d</p><p>With a chuckle, Salvatore headed toward his BMW, which was parked next to her low-slung Lamborghini.</p><p>Sophia watched his departure with a faint frown.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected Salvatore to concede defeat so easily.</p><p>Which could only mean one thing.</p><p>This particular battle wasn\u2019t over.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s Menagerie was a two-story brick building that discreetly blended in with the more conservative businesses that lined the quiet Chicago street.</p><p>Once inside, however, there was nothing discreet about the crimson carpet and shimmering gold wallpaper. Or the Venetian chandeliers that spilled light over the padded booths that were arranged to face the low stage.</p><p>There was an atmosphere of indulgent luxury that lifted her club above all others.</p><p>Well, that and the insanely gorgeous male strippers who could send an entire audience of women into a frenzy of screaming excitement.</p><p>Entering through the back door, Sophia made her way past the dressing rooms to the main floor, a satisfied smile curling her lips as her employees scurried about, preparing for the upcoming flood of customers.</p><p>This place might be just another strip club to some people, but for her it was her tangible display of independence.</p><p>She halted a moment to appreciate the sight of Dmitri and Dominic practicing their dance routine. The twin Weres had recently immigrated from Russian and were so exquisitely handsome it was a wonder they hadn\u2019t melted Siberia. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tall and slender with short, spiky blond hair and ice-blue eyes, they moved with the liquid grace of all pure-bloods. Combine that with the tiny fur G-strings that were the only thing covering their pale, perfect bodies ... yummy.</p><p>Then her smile twisted as she caught sight of the man standing near the edge of the stage, his hand reaching toward Dmitri. Or was it Dominic?</p><p>Troy, prince of imps, was a large, muscular man with the build of a professional wrestler and the fashion taste of a drag queen. At the moment he was attired in silver spandex pants and a see-through jade shirt that gave a nice glimpse of his broad chest.</p> <p>His long, brilliant red hair flowed down his back like a river of fire and his emerald eyes danced with a wicked sense of humor that was contagious.</p><p>He was like an exotic butterfly that oozed a blatant sensuality.</p><p>\u201cMmm ...\u201d he drawled as Sophia halted next to him, his gaze never wavering from the nearby dancers. \u201cDelectable as always, my love.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out she slapped his hand. \u201cNo touching the merchandise, Troy.\u201d</p><p>The imp pouted, but, dropping his arm, he turned to face her. \u201cBut you know how I love them tall, blond, and furry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou love them any way you can get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Troy ran his hands down his shirt, licking his lips. \u201cA wise imp swims with the tide.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. Troy did a lot of swimming with the tide. Which, of course, meant that he had connections throughout the demon world.</p><p>And that was precisely why Sophia had contacted him a few days before.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring what I asked?\u201d</p><p>With a chuckle that should have given her ample warning, he gave a lift of his hand, motioning toward a nearby doorway.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t I always deliver?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, but her words were forgotten as a man stepped from the shadows.</p><p>No, not a man ... a pure-blooded Were, she quickly corrected, catching the feral scent of his wolf. And so sinfully gorgeous that he made her heart slam against her ribs.</p><p>She covertly clenched her hands as he strolled forward. What the hell was wrong with her?</p><p>Her entire life had been filled with handsome, powerful men. All of them anxious for the opportunity to impress her. Whether it was to earn the right to breed with her. Or just to enjoy a few wicked nights of pleasure.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t recall ever feeling as if she\u2019d just stepped off the edge of a cliff and was plummeting through thin air.</p><p>Was that why she couldn\u2019t breathe?</p><p>More than a little disturbed by her unwelcome reaction, she warily studied the stranger.</p> <p>He was handsome, but it wasn\u2019t the polished elegance of her dancers.</p><p>The blue-black hair was cut short, as if he couldn\u2019t be bothered to mess with it, but the severe style only emphasized the stark male beauty of his face. His skin was the rich bronze that came from Latin heat and his eyes more black than brown.</p><p>He was taller than her, perhaps six foot, but he was thick with muscles that rippled beneath the skintight black T-shirt that was matched with a pair of black combat pants.</p><p>Ruthless.</p><p>The word whispered through her mind at the same moment his potent heat wrapped around her, inflaming her blood with a pulsing awareness she hadn\u2019t felt in decades.</p><p>\u201cGood ... God,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Troy cleared his throat, doing a piss-poor job of hiding his amusement.</p><p>Jackass.</p><p>\u201cSophia, this is Luc. Luc, Sophia.\u201d The imp waved a languid hand toward the massive Were. \u201cIsn\u2019t he just to die for?\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s gaze clashed with the burning black gaze, her skin suddenly feeling too tight for her body.</p><p>Shit. Shit. Shit.</p><p>This Were was trouble with a capital T and the very last thing she needed.</p><p>Tilting her chin, she allowed her gaze to slowly skim over the body that begged to be licked from head to toe, deliberately allowing her lips to curl into a sneer.</p><p>Neanderthals like this were always hyperarrogant. An insult to his pride and he\u2019d be out the door right quick and in a hurry.</p><p>\u201cI asked for a bodyguard, not a stripper wannabe,\u201d she mocked.</p><p>The dark eyes narrowed, but instead of the chest-thumping and the fast exit she\u2019d been hoping for, he stepped even closer, the rich scent of male musk teasing at her senses.</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m not into public displays.\u201d His voice slid over her like hot chocolate, smoothly decadent. \u201cOf course, if you want a private performance you could ask me nicely.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she wasn\u2019t going there.</p><p>Not even in her mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is protection, not another pretty boy,\u201d she said between clenched teeth, shoving her hands against his chest as she prepared to leave.</p><p>Let Troy deal with the muscle-bound fool. She was through.</p><p>Only she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Even as her palms slammed against his chest, his fingers captured her wrists in an unbreakable grip. At the same time he was spinning her around, jerking her until her back was pressed hard against his chest and pinning her arms across her chest.</p><p>\u201cI know what you want,\u201d he growled, his face buried against her neck left bare by her red halter top.</p><p>She shivered, telling herself it was outrage at being manhandled and not white-hot excitement at the brush of his warm breath over skin or the feel of his body pressed so intimately against her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you two play.\u201d Troy chuckled, wiggling his fingers as he moved past them. \u201cCiao.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy,\u201d she snapped in disbelief. Surely the imp didn\u2019t intend to leave her alone with this ... psychopath?</p><p>Evidently he did.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll send you my bill,\u201d he assured her, sashaying out the door.</p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d she muttered, her wolf prowling restlessly just below the surface. It wasn\u2019t angry, it was ... on edge. As if it sensed something momentous was about to happen. Which was as disturbing as the ease with which he\u2019d captured her.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk now?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNot until you let go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist,\u201d he taunted, his lips brushing against the pounding pulse at the base of her throat before he slowly released his grip.</p><p>Holding her head high, Sophia refused to glance in his direction, instead heading across the crimson carpet.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll finish this in the privacy of my office.\u201d</p><p>She sensed him fall into step behind her. \u201cYou\u2019re the boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that has yet to be decided.\u201d</p><p>Despite his bulging muscles and impressive fighting skills, Luc wasn\u2019t stupid. Hell, until this moment he\u2019d always prided himself on being the most intelligent Were in the room.</p><p>Now he had to wonder if he\u2019d left his brain back in Miami.</p><p>Not that it was entirely his fault, he swiftly assured himself, his gaze trained on the finest ass he\u2019d ever set eyes on as it swayed across the room. A man would have to be a saint to think clearly when face-to-face with Sophia.</p><p>Even warned of her lethal beauty, he\u2019d been stunned by his first glance at the delicate features that looked as if she was barely out of her adolescent years and her slender body that was shown to advantage in her leather pants and tiny halter top.</p><p>He\u2019d expected a hard, jaded female who would turn him off with her bloated conceit. Not an exquisite woman who attempted to hide her vulnerability behind a brittle shell. Or one whose emerald eyes held a haunted fear.</p><p>The man in him wanted to haul her into the nearest bed and teach her the true meaning of howling at the moon. The wolf in him wanted to toss her over his shoulder and take her to the safety of his lair.</p><p>It was his wolf\u2019s reaction that was most troubling.</p><p>Lust he could handle.</p><p>But possession?</p><p>It was addling his wits and jeopardizing his mission.</p><p>Grimly he shoved aside the disquieting thought.</p><p>He was here with a purpose. It was time to get on with it.</p><p>Following her into the private office, he reached to pull out the folded sheets of paper he\u2019d tucked into his back pocket. His first order of business was making sure he was hired as Sophia\u2019s bodyguard.</p><p>Of course, he wouldn\u2019t say no to an invitation for a more ... intimate arrangement, a voice whispered in the back of his mind.</p><p>It would certainly make it easier to keep an eye on her.</p><p>His eye and so much more ...</p><p>His cock hardened and with a muttered curse he turned his attention to his surroundings. Anything to keep himself from pouncing on Sophia and spreading her across the wide walnut desk.</p><p>The room was spacious with wooden shelves along one wall that held a stunning collection of priceless Faberg\u00e9 eggs. Across the room a marble fireplace was framed by two cream leather wing chairs that matched the low sofa beneath the window. The floor was covered by a Persian carpet. And the drapes were a soft peach velvet.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t surprised by the muted elegance of the room.</p><p>Although Sophia was currently dressed like a biker chick, she possessed an air of sophistication that was as much a part of her as the smoldering sexuality.</p><p>A lethal combination.</p><p>Directly on her tail, Luc smiled wryly as she hastily moved to put the desk between them, turning to send him a glare of frustration.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one battling an unwelcome attraction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Idiotically pleased by her reaction, he tossed the papers on the desk.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>With a frown she leaned forward, studying the papers without actually touching them. Did she fear they might bite?</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy references.\u201d</p><p>She skimmed the top page, her head abruptly lifting. \u201cMiami?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun in the sun,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou should give it a try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to Miami.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot recently,\u201d he said with absolute confidence, his gaze gliding over her milky white skin. Would it taste like cream? \u201cI would have known if you were in my city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>She studied him with a blatant suspicion. \u201cIf you\u2019re such a big shot in Miami, why would you want to travel to Chicago to become a hired thug?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt suits me to be out of Florida for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>The emerald eyes hardened. \u201cFemale trouble?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d he demanded. \u201cThe imp put out the word that he was willing to pay top dollar for a seasoned bodyguard. I\u2019m the best there is. End of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not the end.\u201d She tossed his glowing references in the trash. No doubt where they belonged. He\u2019d forged them on his way to Chicago. \u201cI\u2019m a long way from hiring you.\u201d</p><p>He moved to perch on the corner of the desk, folding his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t what I need.\u201d</p><p>A small smile curved his lips. She sounded ... petulant. \u201cDo you even know what you need, Sophia?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tightened. \u201cI know what I don\u2019t need. A conceited ass who pisses me off.\u201d</p><p>He battled back his wolf. Now wasn\u2019t the time to prove he was a dominant male who was worthy of her respect.</p> <p>He needed Sophia to believe that she was in charge.</p><p>\u201cThe imp wouldn\u2019t have chosen me if I wasn\u2019t the best at what I do, would he?\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned. \u201cThere\u2019s more to being a bodyguard than just muscle and fighting skills. I need someone who can blend into the background.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can blend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a joke?\u201d She threw her hands in the air. \u201cYou look like you should be invading a small country.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at his black T-shirt and pants. He\u2019d deliberately left his Glock and two Uzis in the car. Of course, he had his handy-dandy S &amp; W tucked in a holster at the small of his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that you\u2019re not right for the job.\u201d With a lift of her chin, she rounded the desk and headed for the door. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>With a speed that was shocking even for a pure-blooded Were, Luc reached out to snag her arm, twirling her around so she was standing between his spread legs.</p><p>They were nose to nose, electricity crackling in the air between them.</p><p>A heady combination of aggression and pure sex.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d His voice was husky.</p><p>She could have broken his grip. He might be physically stronger, but she wasn\u2019t helpless. Everyone knew there was nothing more dangerous than a pissed-off female Were.</p><p>Instead she met him glare for glare.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, her eyes glowing with emerald fire.</p><p>\u201cLet. Go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared because you want me.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to deny the truth of his words. He could read it on her exquisite face. But she wasn\u2019t stupid. Even if he couldn\u2019t feel her telltale shivers at his touch, or see the way her eyes dilated when they slid down his body, he could scent her arousal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted\u2014and had\u2014countless men over the years,\u201d she informed him. \u201cBig deal.\u201d</p><p>He growled, his wolf not pleased at the thought of her with another lover.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had a man like me\u2014\u201d he started to assure her, abruptly freezing as he caught the flicker of light out of the corner of his eye. A scope reflecting in the sunlight. \u201cMierda.\u201d</p><p>Acting on pure reflex, Luc shoved Sophia to the ground and landed on top of her, covering her with his larger body.</p><p>She cursed, but before she could try to throw him off, the sound of a gunshot echoed through the room, followed by an explosion of splintering glass.</p><p>Luc remained motionless, waiting for another shot. When nothing happened, he at last pulled back to run a searching gaze over Sophia\u2019s pale face.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he growled.</p><p>She gave a shake of her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d With one fluid motion he was on his feet and sprinting to leap through the broken window. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Stay here.</p><p>The damned Were was delusional if he thought he could order her around like a pet dog, Sophia told herself, swiftly rising to her feet and following him through the shattered window.</p><p>Okay, he\u2019d saved her life. And while it annoyed the hell out of her that she\u2019d needed his protection, she was willing to offer her gratitude.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean he was going to go around snapping out commands and expecting her to obey.</p><p>Some bastard had just tried to kill her and she was going to find who the hell it was.</p><p>Then she was going to rip out their heart and feed it to the vultures.</p><p>Or at least that was the plan.</p><p>Managing to get through the window without slicing open a major artery, Sophia paused as she realized that Luc had already crossed the street and entered the three-storied brick office building.</p><p>Holy shit, he was fast.</p><p>And wicked strong.</p><p>And so gloriously, spectacularly male that he made her ache in all the right places.</p><p>Which, of course, was why she was so twitchy when he was near. And why she was so reluctant to hire him as her bodyguard.</p><p>Even if she would rather bite off her tongue than admit it.</p><p>Realizing that the gunshot had already attracted unwelcome attention, Sophia forced herself to walk at a steady pace across the street and into the building where the shooter must have taken aim at her. Humans were always so easily spooked. A few gunshots, even when they weren\u2019t the target, and they were ready to panic.</p><p>It made her long to shift and really give them something to fear.</p><p>Muttering beneath her breath at the realization that her attacker could be halfway to St. Louis by now, she pulled open the glass door and entered the empty lobby.</p><p>Cautiously she sniffed the air, catching Luc\u2019s enticing scent that blended with the humans that filled the building. But there was no hint of another demon in the area.</p><p>Could it have been a mortal who had taken a shot at her?</p><p>Puzzled, Sophia ignored the bank of elevators and pulled open the door to the stairwell. She hesitated only long enough to make certain nothing was lurking in the shadows before moving up the metal steps tucked against the wall.</p><p>She had only a second of warning before Luc was vaulting from the top floor to land directly before her.</p><p>Show-off, she silently muttered, even as her blood stirred at the grace of his movements and the power of his male body.</p><p>Then, reluctantly lifting her gaze from the impressive width of his shoulders, she met his burning black glare.</p><p>\u201cWhat part of \u2018stay here\u2019 don\u2019t you understand?\u201d he snapped, his voice pitched to ensure it wouldn\u2019t echo.</p><p>She slapped her hands onto her hips. \u201cI\u2019m the boss here and I don\u2019t take orders from you.\u201d Her expression hardened. \u201cOr anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job to protect you,\u201d he growled, stepping so close that his heat seared over her skin. \u201cAnd if that means giving you orders then you\u2019ll obey them. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you ...\u201d</p><p>Brushing past him, she headed up the stairs. She bypassed the second floor, knowing from the angle of the bullet currently lodged in her desk that it must have been fired from the third floor. Personally she preferred her kills to be up close and personal, but she was a trained marksman.</p><p>Continuing upward, she sensed Luc directly behind her.</p><p>Hell, she more than sensed him. The pinpricks of his anger were biting into her skin, warning that his wolf was prowling close to the surface.</p><p>A powerful wolf, she inanely acknowledged.</p><p>One that was more than a match for her own.</p><p>Trying to shake off her distraction at his proximity, Sophia halted on the top floor landing. Before she could reach for the doorknob, however, there was a faint squeak on a stair below them.</p><p>The sound had barely reached her ears when Luc had her shoved up against the wall, caging her with his larger body. At the same time there was the deafening crack of a gunshot followed by a nerve-shredding screech as a bullet pierced the thin sheet of metal exactly where they\u2019d been standing less than a second before.</p><p>\u201cPor Dios.\u201d Pushing back, Luc ran a searching gaze over her tense form. Once assured she was injury-free, he moved to glance over the railing. \u201cStay here.\u201d He turned his head back to glare at her with eyes that were more wolf than human. \u201cThis time you\u2019ll do as I say or I\u2019ll handcuff you to the door. Got it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Without bothering to wait for her response, the idiot was leaping down the stairs, pursuing their trigger-happy attacker with a reckless disregard for sanity, self-preservation, and the basic laws of gravity.</p><p>Not that she should bother being worried.</p><p>Luc was obviously a trained thug who probably spent a large portion of his day chasing after crazies. If he wanted to take a bullet or two to prove he was a big, strong Were, then let him.</p> <p>Except he had saved her life, a tiny voice whispered in the back of her mind.</p><p>Twice.</p><p>She at least owed him a thank-you before he got himself offed, didn\u2019t she?</p><p>That was the only reason she was pacing the cramped landing instead of returning to her club and getting on with her day.</p><p>\u201cPain in the ass,\u201d she muttered beneath her breath, her head snapping around as Luc jogged easily up the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cWere you saying something?\u201d he asked, a faint smile toying at the edges of his mouth.</p><p>She ran a swift gaze over his magnificent body, refusing to allow herself to linger on the rippling muscles and the broad shoulders that were displayed to perfection by the tight T-shirt.</p><p>He was unharmed.</p><p>That was all that mattered.</p><p>\u201cDid you find the shooter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d His jaw clenched with frustration. \u201cWhoever it was managed to enter and leave the building without leaving a trace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible to say without further information.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll do a more thorough search when the building closes for the night.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI haven\u2019t thanked you.\u201d</p><p>Expecting him to gloat, Sophia was caught off guard when he abruptly stepped forward, grasping her upper arms as he regarded her with a fierce glare.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to thank me, Sophia. I want you to let me do my job.\u201d</p><p>She shivered as the heat of his hands seared against her bare skin, her wolf growling in low approval.</p><p>Traitor.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t given you the job.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019ve heard any number of rumors about you, but none of them mentioned that you were stupid.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. Until this moment she\u2019d never given a damn what people said about her.</p><p>Who cared if she was known as an immoral, heartless slut?</p><p>Now she scowled at the thought he might be judging her without ever knowing the truth.</p><p>\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d she growled.</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re the Queen of Bitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d No point in trying to deny that. Not that she wanted to. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>The dark gaze skimmed over her face. \u201cThat you\u2019re exquisite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you were blessed with four pure-blooded daughters. An amazing gift to our people.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze. Although the word of Cassie\u2019s talent of prophecy, as well as her recent disappearance, weren\u2019t state secrets, they hadn\u2019t yet become common knowledge.</p><p>The fewer people who knew, the better.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that you\u2019re a survivor,\u201d he continued, ignoring her sudden wariness. \u201cWhich was why you were smart enough to seek help when you needed it.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head with a wry smile. \u201cSlick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkilled,\u201d he corrected, frustration still simmering in his magnificent eyes. \u201cAnd unfortunately late to the party. Take me back to the beginning.\u201d His brows drew together as she hesitated. \u201cSophia?\u201d</p><p>She ground her teeth. Dammit. He was a wolf on the hunt.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to let this go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cSomething spooked you or you wouldn\u2019t have felt the need for a bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all been so ... childish.\u201d</p><p>His hands loosened their grip so he could run his fingers lightly up and down her arm, sending a series of pleasurable quakes through her body.</p><p>\u201cChildish?\u201d</p><p>She struggled to keep her mind on track. Not easy when her thoughts were being consumed with how quickly she could have him stripped of his clothes and pressed against the wall.</p><p>The things she could do to that fantastic body.</p><p>Mmmm.</p><p>His eyes dilated as the spice of her arousal filled the air, his body tensing with an answering hunger. With a low curse, she wrenched her mind back to the conversation.</p><p>Where were they?</p><p>Oh yeah, her murderous stalker.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt started with spiteful notes left on my door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual. \u2018I hate you.\u2019 \u2018Go away, bitch.\u2019 \u2018Whore.\u2019 \u201d Her lips curled in disgust. \u201cSomething a juvenile human would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy tires slashed. A dead rat left in my swimming pool.\u201d Her gaze shifted past him to the bullet hole in the floor. A few more inches and she would have been skewered. \u201cAt least until today.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened, his expression distracted. \u201cStrange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange that someone tried to shoot me, or strange that they hadn\u2019t tried before?\u201d she asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cIt usually doesn\u2019t escalate so swiftly.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to hold his questioning gaze at his unnerving perception.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t bad enough his mere touch could make her wolf pant with need, he also had to be intelligent?</p><p>\u201cYou mean the attacks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d His hands shifted so his thumbs were brushing the sensitive line of her throat, pausing over the unsteady beat of her pulse. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a leap from scribbling a nasty note to pulling a trigger. Most people never progress to that point. And those that do take longer than a few days to go from catty to psychotic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d Her expression was noncommittal. \u201cI see your point.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhen did you receive your first threat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days after I moved into my new house. Two weeks ago,\u201d she promptly answered. \u201cI assumed it was a jealous neighbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing before then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots.\u201d Her lips twisted wryly. \u201cI am the Queen of Bitches, remember? But most of my enemies have the balls to face me, not creep around like an angst-ridden adolescent.\u201d</p><p>He gave a slow nod. \u201cTell me about your neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only met a handful.\u201d She hadn\u2019t been particularly concerned by the lack of a welcoming committee. \u201cMost of them are mortal. Big yawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s a vamp who has a lair directly behind my tennis courts.\u201d</p><p>His thumbs skimmed up and down her throat with an intimacy that should have made her wolf snarl in warning. A Were\u2019s neck was considered off-limits to all but their most trusted pack mates.</p><p>Instead she battled the urge to tilt back her head and offer her tender flesh to his teeth.</p><p>Christ, what was wrong with her?</p><p>\u201cA vamp wouldn\u2019t waste their time with notes and tire slashing,\u201d he said, his gaze following the path of his fingers, a glow deep in his eyes. \u201cYou piss one off and they go directly for the throat. Literally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKirsten\u2019s barely out of her foundling years,\u201d she informed him. \u201cShe\u2019s still at the mercy of her human emotions.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to dismiss the vamp, although Sophia didn\u2019t doubt he\u2019d tucked the info in the back of his mind.</p><p>Nothing was allowed to escape this Were\u2019s notice.</p><p>Not the most comforting thought.</p><p>\u201cAnyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a nymph down the block.\u201d Sophia grimaced. \u201cShe\u2019s always polite in public, but I sense that she has no intention of becoming my BFF.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might be responsible for the drive-by harassments, but nymphs aren\u2019t usually bloodthirsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen how possessive she is of her current lover.\u201d Sophia shuddered. There had been a fanatical glint in the nymph\u2019s eyes when she\u2019d introduced her boyfriend to Sophia, her hands clinging to him with an embarrassing desperation. \u201cIt\u2019s creepy.\u201d</p><p>Luc lifted a dark brow. \u201cLover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cur.\u201d Curs were humans who\u2019d been bitten instead of being born a pure-blooded Were. They were capable of shifting, but they couldn\u2019t control the shifts as a Were could, and they weren\u2019t immortal, although their lifespan was greatly increased. \u201cWell, more or less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been turned, I can smell it, but he\u2019s a pathetic excuse for a cur.\u201d The image of his short, pudgy body and pasty face turned Sophia\u2019s stomach. \u201cHe\u2019s an embarrassment to curs everywhere. I\u2019ve never encountered such a timid creature.\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward, pressing her body against the wall. \u201cNot your type at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing of my type.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his head, he allowed his lips to brush over the racing pulse at the base of her throat.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m it.\u201d</p><p>Hell, they both knew he was it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was going up in flames from a mere touch.</p><p>What would happen if he actually kissed her?</p><p>Not about to stay around and find out, she shoved her hands against his chest.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d she muttered, marching around him and down the stairs.</p> <p>It was bad enough that she\u2019d spent the day dodging bullets. She wasn\u2019t going to make it worse by becoming another victim to Luc\u2019s fatal charm.</p><p>She had no doubt there were enough of them littering the streets of Miami.</p><p>Luc finished his sweep of the office building and was pulling his black Mercedes SL550 Roadster past the uniformed guard who was opening the gates of Sophia\u2019s neighborhood when his cell phone beeped.</p><p>A glance at the flashing ID and he grimaced, knowing he couldn\u2019t ignore the call.</p><p>Turning up the car stereo, he put the phone to his ear. There were too many demons with superior hearing to take chances.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he demanded, sighing at his caller\u2019s response. \u201cS\u00ed. I\u2019m headed back to her house now.\u201d His jaw tightened. \u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t suspect anything. Not yet. But she\u2019s too smart for me to fool for long.\u201d There was another burst of sharp words. \u201cYeah, I got it. I\u2019ll keep in touch.\u201d</p><p>Tossing his phone into the passenger seat, Luc parked his car at the end of the tree-lined street. Then, briefly considering the benefits of shifting, he gave a shake of his head and jogged toward Sophia\u2019s house.</p><p>He\u2019d already called his wolf to search the office building. His human form couldn\u2019t begin to match his wolf senses, but while he was stronger than most Weres, he didn\u2019t want to waste unnecessary energy.</p><p>Not when he couldn\u2019t be certain he wouldn\u2019t need to protect Sophia.</p><p>Reaching the nearly half acre of parkland surrounding Sophia\u2019s house, he did a swift search of the grounds, including the pool house, before entering her home through the patio doors.</p><p>He\u2019d checked through her living room, a guest bedroom, and the fully equipped gym before heading to the kitchen.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, he found Sophia leaning against the marble counter, her arms folded across her chest. She would have sensed him the moment he entered her yard.</p><p>Halting in the center of the ceramic-tiled floor, Luc allowed his gaze to run over her slender body barely covered by a lacy red camisole and matching silk shorts.</p><p>He bit back a growl, his gaze lifting to the beautiful face framed by the pale golden hair.</p><p>The lust he didn\u2019t mind. What male wouldn\u2019t be hot and bothered by the sight of a gorgeous, half-naked female?</p><p>But the sense of recognition from his wolf, as if she ... belonged to him, was unnerving.</p><p>Especially when the emerald eyes were glowing with a warning that was far from welcoming.</p><p>\u201cDo your duties include breaking and entering?\u201d</p><p>He deliberately glanced toward the door leading from the breakfast nook onto the patio. A dew fairy could break the flimsy-ass lock.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but they include an inspection of your alarm system.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI\u2019m a pure-blooded Were. That\u2019s all the alarm system I need.\u201d</p><p>Scowling at her nonchalant tone, he turned back with a glare of frustration.</p><p>Dios.</p><p>Did she know how her seeming lack of concern was challenging his wolf to do whatever necessary to protect her?</p><p>\u201cObviously not if some lunatic has managed to wander around your place without getting caught,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cThe lunatic always trespassed when I was at the club.\u201d She allowed her gaze to drift down to his heavy boots and back to his narrowed eyes. \u201cAt least until tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need an alarm system.\u201d</p><p>She heaved a purely feminine sigh of exasperation at his stubborn expression.</p><p>\u201cDid you find anything at the office building?\u201d</p><p>He moved past her to open the fridge and pulled out a bottle of perfectly chilled beer. Twisting off the cap, he downed half of it in one swallow.</p><p>\u201cI found that the secretary from the insurance claims company is staying late to burn the midnight oil with the janitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidnight oil?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAnd that the loan officer is sleeping on the couch in his office. No doubt his wife kicked him out.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze lingered a tantalizing moment on his lips before she was visibly squaring her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cFascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was just the first floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find any clues that might lead us to my stalker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He polished off the beer and tossed the bottle into the recycle bin. \u201cWhich means they\u2019re very, very good. Or very, very lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you basically have jack squat?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her taunt, moving until he could grasp the counter on either side of her hips, effectively trapping her.</p><p>He was going to get answers.</p><p>One way or another.</p><p>\u201cActually, I have a question.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, her power swirling through the air. Oddly, however, she made no move to shove him away.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d she mocked instead. \u201cYou break into my house at an ungodly hour. You help yourself to my private stash of imported beer. Now, having absolutely zero information for me, you expect me to play Twenty Questions.\u201d She tilted her chin. \u201cAnd, for the true cherry topper, I\u2019m supposed to pay you a weekly wage for the privilege?\u201d</p><p>His gaze swept down to the delectable glimpse of her breasts beneath the red lace.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ll throw in the night of mind-blowing sex for free.\u201d</p><p>He heard her heart miss a beat, the scent of her ready response more enticing than any perfume.</p><p>Still she held herself rigid, clearly as wary as he was by the potent force of their attraction.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your question?\u201d she asked huskily.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re hiding from me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened before she was hastily smoothing her expression.</p><p>\u201cHiding?\u201d She lifted her brow, trying to brazen her way past his question. \u201cWhat the hell makes you think that I\u2019m hiding something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pure-blooded Were doesn\u2019t hire a bodyguard just because she\u2019s being harassed.\u201d</p><p>The realization had struck him as he watched her flounce away from him in the stairwell. He\u2019d started to halt her retreat then and there to demand an answer, but the rigid line of her spine had warned she wasn\u2019t in the mood to cooperate.</p><p>And in truth, he\u2019d still been so cranked at being led around like a dunce by the mystery gunman that he knew he was bound to make matters worse if he tried to pry the truth from her.</p><p>Now he wasn\u2019t going to leave until he knew exactly what the hell was going on.</p><p>\u201cMy son-in-law made me promise I wouldn\u2019t kill any of my neighbors the day I moved in.\u201d She tried to hold her ground. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t hire someone else to kill for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Sophia, I can\u2019t help you if you\u2019re not honest with me,\u201d he snapped. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>They glared at one another, the air filled with a sizzling heat as they both fought a silent battle for dominance.</p><p>At last Sophia muttered a curse, sensing his grim determination.</p><p>\u201cThe harassment has been annoying, but I would have ignored it if I hadn\u2019t started feeling like I was being hunted,\u201d she grudgingly confessed.</p><p>\u201cHunted.\u201d He latched on to the revealing word. \u201cNot followed?\u201d</p><p>A shadow darkened her beautiful eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s been more than some pervert lurking in the bushes and peering in my window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Her sharp tone didn\u2019t entirely disguise her unease. \u201cI just know that there\u2019s been someone shadowing my movements for the past week.

The next day I was jogging through the park and I was attacked by a rabid pit bull. Then, two days ago, I was nearly brained by a stone urn that fell from the top of a building I was walking past.\u201d</p><p>Luc\u2019s fingers tightened on the granite counter, his wolf enraged by the mere thought of someone terrorizing this female.</p><p>His female.</p><p>When he finally got his hands on the stalker, he was going to make the coward very, very sorry.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this from the beginning?\u201d he demanded, his voice thick.</p><p>She turned back to stab him with a glare. \u201cIn case you missed the memo, I\u2019ve been trying to get rid of you, not give you a reason to stay.\u201d</p><p>No, he\u2019d gotten the memo.</p><p>His brooding gaze slid down to the sensuous curve of her mouth before returning to the emerald fire burning in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought if I discovered someone\u2019s been trying to kill you instead of just harassing you that I would be more likely to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, regarding him as if he were being particularly dense. \u201cYou\u2019re an alpha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means you turn into a caveman when you think there\u2019s a damsel in distress that might need your protection.\u201d Her gaze warned him not to even try to deny the truth of her words. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you.

Christ.</p><p>She could already feel the benefits. They were melting through her body, making her knees weak and her hips press with restless need against the hard thrust of his growing erection.</p><p>In a minute she was going to rip off his clothes and push him onto the ceramic tiles.</p><p>Or maybe onto the breakfast table.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t particular so long as it was hot and sweaty and lasted until she was too sated to move.</p><p>Vivid images of straddling that bronzed, perfect body had her abruptly shoving him away so she could head for the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late, go away,\u201d she muttered, ignoring her wolf, which snarled in frustration.</p><p>She didn\u2019t truly expect him to obey her order. Luc was a Were who would do what he wanted, when he wanted. But she hadn\u2019t expected him to actually sweep her off her feet, cradling her against his magnificent chest as he headed toward the nearby stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.

He never paused as he crossed the silver carpet that accented the black and white d\u00e9cor. At last reaching the ebony slipper bed, he laid her on the white and black striped comforter and straightened to study her with a hooded gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty to tuck you in.\u201d</p><p>She pushed herself into a seated position, leaning against the pile of silver pillows.</p><p>\u201cYour duty?\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes ran a hungry survey down the length of her body, his own body tense as he struggled to leash the desire pulsing in the air.</p><p>\u201cThere might be a bit of pleasure mixed in.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. Not only from the rough edge in his voice that warned he was holding on by a thread, but by the possessive glow in those dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting rid of you, am I?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like Neanderthals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be as sensitive as the next guy.\u201d His gaze shifted to the expanse of pale skin exposed by her tiny camisole. \u201cWith the proper motivation.\u201d</p><p>She could physically feel the heat of his gaze, caressing over her with a searing pleasure.</p><p>Dammit, why couldn\u2019t he be just another stunningly hot guy whom she could use and abuse and toss aside when she was done?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to try to boss me around,\u201d she accused in frustration, \u201ctelling me what I can and can\u2019t do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep you alive,\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be caged.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNot again.\u201d</p><p>She regretted the words as soon as they slipped from her lips, abruptly turning to study the original Rembrandt etchings that hung on her wall.</p><p>\u201cSophia.\u201d She felt the mattress dip beneath Luc\u2019s considerable weight as he perched on the edge of the bed. When she refused to acknowledge his presence, he reached to cup her cheek in his hand and tugged her to meet his searching gaze. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done your duty, now leave me alone,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>His thumb brushed her lower lip. \u201cSophia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to tell me why you think I would try to cage you.\u201d</p><p>She gave a restless lift of her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s just an expression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d he stubbornly insisted. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She stilled in surprise. She\u2019d bet her favorite Herm\u00e8s handbag that this man had never said the P word more than once or twice in his very long existence.</p><p>The fact he\u2019d lowered his pride to use it now undermined any hope of resisting his soft plea.</p><p>\u201cYou know the history of our people,\u201d she hedged, feeling dangerously vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cThat covers a lot of ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor far too long we have hovered on the edge of extinction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that is all about to change now that Salvatore has destroyed the demon lord,\u201d he pointed out, referring to the King of Weres\u2019 recent battle with the demon who\u2019d been draining them of their powers for centuries. \u201cAlready our strength is returning. Even those ancient powers that have been nearly forgotten.\u201d His lips twisted into a rueful grin. \u201cDangerous powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re referring to Salvatore discovering that Harley is his true mate?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAs I said ... dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Sophia had to agree with him.</p><p>True matings between Weres had become nothing more than a distant legend until Salvatore\u2019s shocking bond with Harley. Now there were rumors of more and more purebloods becoming mated.</p><p>What would it feel like to know she was irrevocably tied to a mate?</p><p>That never again would she desire another in her bed?</p><p>She told herself that it was a horrifying thought.</p><p>And she almost believed it.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore seems disgustingly pleased with himself, and I have to admit Harley is content.\u201d</p><p>His fingers traced the line of her jaw. \u201cBut you\u2019re still haunted by our past?\u201d</p><p>Haunted?</p><p>It sounded dramatic, but Sophia couldn\u2019t deny it captured the memories that refused to leave her in peace.</p><p>\u201cI was one of less than a dozen females capable of becoming pregnant,\u201d she abruptly admitted.</p><p>He stilled. \u201cA breeder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d she muttered, oddly offended by the term used for those rare fertile females.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cI never considered the burden you must have carried.\u201d</p><p>It had been more than a burden. Without their usual powers, the Were females had not only become increasingly infertile, but they\u2019d lost the ability to control their shifts during their pregnancies.</p><p>It had nearly been the end of purebloods.</p><p>\u201cWhen a race is trying to survive, we must all do our part,\u201d she said, doing her best to keep the lingering pain hidden.</p><p>Typically, Luc wasn\u2019t fooled.</p><p>\u201cAnd we all must bear the scars,\u201d he said softly, something in his voice suggesting that he had a few unwelcome memories of his own.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He studied her in silence, his fingers continuing to wreak havoc with her senses as they stroked along her cheek and then tenderly tucked her hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cHow many children did you lose?\u201d</p><p>She flinched at the low question. \u201cHundreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... cara.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lowered, unable to bear the sympathy gleaming in the dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cI swore I was done when Salvatore convinced me to try one more time.\u201d Her gut knotted. She wanted to forget those days of being nothing more than a breeding machine, expected to try and carry a litter year after endless year. \u201cHe wanted to alter the DNA of my babies so they couldn\u2019t shift and would be more likely to carry a child to full-term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd spare them the pain you endured.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted. \u201cThat was the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it worked.\u201d There was an unmistakable pride in his voice. \u201cThe entire Were nation celebrated your four miraculous daughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were promptly stolen from the nursery,\u201d she reminded him, unwilling to reveal her confusion of emotions when she\u2019d manage to produce her daughters, only to have them disappear. The anger, the dread, the overriding fear that made her emotionally distance herself from the children whom she\u2019d never been allowed to hold in her arms. \u201cI spent the past thirty years searching for my daughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s \u2018me time.\u2019 \u201d She met his steady gaze with a stubborn tilt of her chin. \u201cNo responsibilities, no one depending on me, no one trying to control me. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Luc got it.</p><p>He really did.</p><p>This female had spent her entire life with the fate of her people resting on her shoulders.</p><p>Was it any wonder she was so skeevy to maintain her independence?</p><p>Unfortunately she was in danger.</p><p>And even if he wasn\u2019t plagued by an ever-increasing need to protect her, he would be bound by his duty to keep her safe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Regardless if it meant forcing her to accept his help.</p><p>And making an enemy of her in the bargain.</p><p>He hissed at the strangely painful thought, his hand shifting to trace the line of her slender throat.</p> <p>\u201cI got it, cara,\u201d he gently assured her, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t change the fact that someone\u2019s trying to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of annoyance. \u201cWhich is why I hired a bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his wolf smug as she allowed his fingers to savor the satin skin of her neck.</p><p>It was an intimate touch that spoke of trust.

It was time for reasoning with the female, not ... what had she said?

I\u2019m not going to run and hide like a gutless mist sprite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would only be for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that.\u201d She held his gaze, silently warning him she wouldn\u2019t be screwed with. \u201cIt could take you weeks or even months.\u201d</p><p>His teeth clenched. \u201cThen stay with one of your daughters until I\u2019ve cleared up this mess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd put them in even more danger?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>His fingers encircled her neck, not in a threat, just an expression of frustration.</p><p>\u201cYou are ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boss.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes clashed and Luc swiftly shifted through his limited options.</p><p>He could physically force her to go to Miami. He had the brute strength and the training necessary to manhandle all but the king.</p><p>But even as the thought raced through his mind, he was dismissing it.</p><p>He knew without a doubt that turning her into his virtual prisoner, even if it was for her own good, would break something fragile inside her.</p><p>\u201cObstinada,\u201d he breathed, leaning down to yank off his boots.</p><p>Then, ignoring her sudden scowl, he rose from the bed to strip off his T-shirt. He had tugged off his belt and was unzipping his pants when she found her voice.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re auditioning for a position at my club, I have to warn you we only take experienced dancers,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>He shrugged, pulling down his pants and kicking them aside to stand in nothing but his black satin boxers.</p><p>\u201cIf the mountain won\u2019t come to Mohammed ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he gets kicked in his nuts?\u201d</p><p>He stretched out on the mattress beside her, hiding a smile as he caught her covert gaze ogling his thickly muscled legs before lifting to linger on the broad expanse of his chest.</p><p>She might want him gone, but that didn\u2019t keep her from lusting after his body.</p><p>And frankly he was good with that.</p><p>For now.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t protect you if I\u2019m not close to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t include sharing my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact it does.\u201d Lying on his back, he tucked his hands behind his head. \u201cAt least until I get a security system set up.\u201d</p><p>She bent over him, her expression hard even if she couldn\u2019t disguise the scent of her smoldering arousal.</p><p>\u201cIf you have to stay, then you can sleep in another room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen use the chair.\u201d She pointed toward the charcoal-gray chair set next to the window. \u201cThere\u2019s an extra blanket in the closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Sophia?\u201d he teased. \u201cAfraid you can\u2019t keep yourself from jumping me in my sleep?\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly the emerald eyes darkened, as if he\u2019d injured her.</p><p>\u201cDespite the rumors you claim to have heard about me, I don\u2019t spread my legs for every man who crosses my path,\u201d she said stiffly.</p><p>Dios.</p><p>Regretting his thoughtless words, he lifted himself onto his elbows, regarding her with a somber gaze.</p><p>\u201cThat was never a rumor I heard, and I wouldn\u2019t believe it if I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia, I\u2019m here to protect you.\u201d Her lips parted and he hastily pressed a finger to halt her angry words. \u201cHold on. I\u2019m not going to insult your intelligence by denying that I want you.\u201d He allowed his hunger to simmer in the air, the heat stirring the satin strands of her hair. \u201cDesperately. Or that I\u2019m going to say \u2018no\u2019 when you finally accept that I\u2019m irresistible.\u201d With an effort he leashed his aching desire, needing her to realize that she would always be safe in his care. Physically and emotionally. \u201cBut until that moment, I don\u2019t expect anything from you but your cooperation in keeping you alive.\u201d</p><p>Her expression remained suspicious. \u201cYou intend to spend the night with me and not have sex?\u201d</p><p>Both wolf and man groaned at the mere thought of the long hours ahead, but his smile never wavered.</p><p>\u201cI can keep our relationship platonic if you can.\u201d</p><p>It was a direct challenge.</p><p>One no wolf could back down from.</p><p>Her jaw clenched. \u201cThe boxers stay on.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cYou\u2019re the boss.\u201d</p><p>Turning her back to him, she reached to switch off the Tiffany lamp.</p><p>\u201cChrist, I must be out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>It was late afternoon when Sophia woke.</p><p>Considering that dawn had already crested when she\u2019d at last fallen asleep, it was no surprise she\u2019d slept late.</p><p>It was, however, a surprise to realize that she was not only wrapped in Luc\u2019s strong arms, but that she\u2019d molded herself so tightly to his body that she might as well have been a damned barnacle on the bottom of a ship.</p><p>Her head was tucked beneath his chin, her ear pressed over the steady beat of his heart, and she had one leg thrown over his hip.</p><p>Pathetic.</p><p>Sensing he was awake and well aware of her embarrassment, she tilted back her head, intending to slay him with a heated glare.</p><p>Instead she forgot how to breathe.</p><p>Holy ... shit, but he was beautiful.</p><p>Achingly, shatteringly beautiful.</p><p>Helplessly her gaze wandered over the chiseled male features that were only emphasized by his heavy morning beard and his tousled hair. The high cheekbones, the wide brow, the near-black eyes that could make a woman melt at a hundred paces.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until his lips parted to reveal the teeth that were shockingly white against his bronzed skin that she was reminded that she wanted to punch him in his perfect nose, not ...</p><p>Other things.</p><p>Wicked, delicious other things.</p><p>\u201cIf you intended to use this side of the bed you should have said so last night,\u201d she informed him, shifting her hands from his back to press them against his chest.</p><p>He smiled at her with a lazy satisfaction. \u201cYou were the one who wanted me to be more sensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I didn\u2019t want you acting like a caveman,\u201d she corrected. \u201cBesides there\u2019s nothing sensitive in groping me while I\u2019m asleep.\u201d</p><p>His hands drifted over her hips, touching her with a familiarity that should have been offensive, not exciting.</p><p>\u201cYou were whimpering and tossing around until I at last took you in my arms,\u201d he claimed. \u201cOnce I had you tucked against me you slept like a baby.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted to deny his ridiculous claim, only to snap shut as a vague memory flashed through her mind\u2014a nightmare in which she was being chased through a dark forest by an unseen enemy.</p><p>Muttering her opinion of arrogant Weres who should be neutered, she shoved her way out of his arms and headed toward her bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI need a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like Julia Child?\u201d she demanded, pausing to send him a warning scowl. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about opening this door.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, looking edible as he tucked his hands behind his head, the satin sheet falling down to reveal his wide chest and washboard abs.</p><p>\u201cI could scrub your back.\u201d</p><p>Fiercely refusing to allow the tempting image to form in her mind, Sophia slammed the door shut and turned the lock.</p><p>Not that she thought Luc would intrude into her privacy. He might be overbearing when it came to protecting her, but he would never force himself on an unwilling woman.</p><p>Why would he?</p><p>He no doubt had an entire harem waiting for him back in Miami.</p><p>Refusing to consider why that thought made her wolf snarl, Sophia yanked off her camisole and shorts before entering her shower and turning the cold water on full blast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A half an hour later she was dressed in a tiny yellow bikini with a matching sarong that fell to her knees tied around her slender waist.

Sophia breathed deeply, catching the spicy aroma of chilies and cumin and chopped oregano.</p><p>\u201cYou should be thanking me,\u201d he murmured, taking a seat across the small table, his grin distinctly wicked. \u201cI\u2019ve had women begging on their knees for a taste of my huevos rancheros.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the only thing they begged for, she silently acknowledged, piling her plate high with scrambled eggs before taking a sip of her freshly squeezed orange juice.</p><p>Heaven.</p><p>She glanced up to catch him watching her with an unreadable expression.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be rigging up my alarm system or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk first.\u201d He nodded toward her plate. \u201cEat.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled her eyes at his commanding tone. \u201cAre you going to give me a treat if I roll over and play dead?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me, don\u2019t order me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I get credit for not throwing you over my shoulder and hauling you back to bed?\u201d Heat blazed in his eyes as they skimmed down her nearly naked body. \u201cThat\u2019s what my inner caveman is urging me to do. And my wolf agrees.\u201d</p><p>So did her wolf.</p><p>It didn\u2019t mind a bit of caveman.</p><p>Not when the end result was some raw, spectacular sex.</p><p>She shoveled the eggs into her mouth, barely taking time to savor the bold flavor as she cleaned her plate. Anything to distract her from the aching void between her legs that was becoming nearly unbearable.</p><p>Once finished, she pushed away her plate. It really had been delicious and she crankily wondered if there was anything that wasn\u2019t perfect about this Were.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to discuss?\u201d</p><p>Having polished off his own plate, Luc settled back in his chair, his arms folded across his chest.</p><p>\u201cA party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to host a party.\u201d</p><p>She slowly narrowed her gaze. \u201cWhat kind of party?\u201d</p><p>He gave a sudden laugh. \u201cNot the kind you\u2019re thinking of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you can read my mind?\u201d she muttered, pretending the maddening image of Luc floating in her hot tub with a covey of water sprites pleasuring his naked body hadn\u2019t just flared through her mind.</p><p>He leaned forward, his hand reaching to cover hers. \u201cI told you I\u2019m not into public displays. Especially not when it comes to sex,\u201d he assured her in a voice filled with husky promise. \u201cI like it mano y mano with lots of privacy and lots of time.\u201d The dark eyes flashed with sinful amusement. \u201cAnd occasionally handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandcuffs?\u201d She pretended his light touch wasn\u2019t sending molten need through her veins. \u201cDo you need restraints to acquire your dates? Or to keep them from escaping?\u201d</p><p>He lifted her fingers to his lips. \u201cSomeday very soon I\u2019ll show you exactly what I do with them.\u201d</p><p>With a low groan she snatched her hand away. In a minute she was going to be knocking aside the table and crawling over him like a sex-starved harpy.</p><p>\u201cSo why do you want me to host a party?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, the amusement lingering in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s the most convenient way to gather all your neighbors at one time so I can question them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019ll confess to being a homicidal maniac over apple martinis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to read people when they\u2019re in a group,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I do door-to-door interviews they\u2019ll be on guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d she muttered, her gaze skimming over the heavy muscles of his chest.</p><p>Even dressed he would be the sort of unannounced visitor who would make her neighbors hide under their bed and call the cops.</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cThis way they\u2019ll feel more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd more likely to give something away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the hope.\u201d</p><p>She had to admit it made sense, she acknowledged, rising to her feet.</p><p>As he said, her neighbors were more likely to let down their guard during the course of a party. Especially if she could score a bottle of nectar from Troy. A few drops in her guests\u2019 drinks and their inhibitions would be lowered. Perhaps not to the point of revealing their most intimate secrets, but they would be more inclined to \u201cshare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She cleared her throat as he straightened, his muscles rippling in the afternoon sunlight that slanted through the glass wall. \u201cI\u2019ll send out the invitations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t really going to serve apple martinis, are you?\u201d he demanded, moving to stand way too close.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to explain your presence?\u201d she abruptly demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your latest lover, of course.\u201d</p><p>She snorted at his ready suggestion. \u201cYou could be my brother. Or the pool boy.\u201d</p><p>His hand lifted to skim along her hairline, following the curve of her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nearly pretty enough to be the pool boy, and we don\u2019t want to shock the natives if I happen to do this in front of them.\u201d</p><p>A part of her knew a kiss was coming. She also knew she could halt it by taking a simple step backward. Instead she tilted back her head to meet his descending mouth, her lips parting in invitation to the deep, hungry kiss.</p><p>He groaned, his hands gripping her hips as their tongues tangled in a silent dance of mutual need.</p><p>An enthralling pleasure blasted through her, making her arch against his hardening cock as her hands ran a restless path over his powerful back.</p><p>He was so deliciously warm.</p><p>And male.</p><p>Starkly, unapologetically male.</p><p>The kiss deepened as she rubbed her aching breasts against his bare chest, her blood on fire with the need to feel him plunging deep inside her body.</p><p>As if sensing her desperate desire, his hands skimmed up the curve of her waist, cupping her breasts to tease her sensitive nipples with his thumbs.</p><p>She growled her approval, arching toward his insistent caresses as her hands slid beneath the satin boxers to cup the hard muscles of his perfect ass.</p><p>Laughing softly he nipped at her lower lip before whispering against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t at all brotherly.\u201d</p><p>Busy thanking the gods that she wasn\u2019t related to this intensely sexy Were, Sophia was taken off guard as a brick was tossed through the window over the sink.</p><p>They both stiffened in shock, but Luc swiftly recovered and was immediately out of her arms and sprinting toward the French doors leading onto the back patio.</p><p>Sophia felt a brief flare of fear at the realization he was unarmed as he charged after the trespasser only to grimace as the backlash of his power sizzled through the air. Even without shifting there were few demons who could match his strength.</p><p>And if he went wolf ...</p><p>Well, she pitied anyone stupid enough to stand in his path.</p><p>Of course, a silver bullet could bring down the mightiest Were, an anxious voice whispered in the back of her mind.</p><p>A voice she hastily squashed.</p><p>Luc could take care of himself. She refused to even consider the thought of him being hurt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clenching her hands, she turned her attention toward the shards of glass littered across her floor.</p><p>Dammit to hell.</p><p>What was it with people busting her windows lately?</p><p>They were not only a pain in the ass to replace, but they left a mess that she was in no mood to clean.</p> <p>Picking her way over the glittering shards, Sophia reached to pluck the brick from the sink, not at all surprised to find a note scribbled on the back.</p><p>\u201cLeave or die.\u201d</p><p>Predictable. Tacky. And downright clich\u00e9.</p><p>Tossing the brick onto the countertop, she moved to retrieve a broom, sweeping up the broken glass and dumping it in the trash.</p><p>She\u2019d just finished when Luc returned, his eyes glowing with the fury of his wolf.</p> <p>\u201cAnything?\u201d she demanded, although she already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growled, his frustration thickening the air until it was difficult to breathe. \u201cWhoever threw the brick had already taken off, and there are too many scents to pick out a specific person.\u201d His jaw knotted as he struggled to leash his emotions. \u201cI do know it wasn\u2019t a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He moved to pick up the brick, testing its weight as his gaze skimmed the words of warning.</p><p>\u201cUnlike a demon, they would have to be standing in your yard to pitch this through the window. There\u2019s no way they could have escaped before I could catch them.\u201d</p><p>She nodded in agreement. \u201cThen that narrows down the options.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot far enough.\u201d</p><p>Sensing his self-disgust, Sophia frowned. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something off,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cOff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf someone genuinely wants you dead they don\u2019t warn you,\u201d he muttered, throwing the brick into the trash.</p><p>He was right. She was trained well enough to know that the best assassin was the one who moved through the shadows and struck before their prey ever sensed the danger.</p><p>\u201cThe gunshot was genuine enough,\u201d she pointed out, sharing his confusion.</p><p>\u201cSo was the bullet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, the bastard ruined my desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went back to dig it out.\u201d His expression was grim. \u201cIt was silver.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. \u201cI suppose crazy doesn\u2019t always make sense.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he wanted to bite something.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for the day?\u201d he abruptly demanded.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cA few hours by the pool and then off to the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling a security firm to install your alarm system.\u201d He prowled toward the door. \u201cDon\u2019t leave without me.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the crowd of drunken females who screeched in wild abandon at the male Were gyrating on the stage, Luc leaned against the carved oak bar and sipped his Cognac.</p><p>No one would blame him for being in a foul mood.</p><p>Not only was he no closer to discovering who was trying to harm Sophia, but he was so tormented by his raging lust he could barely think.</p><p>Mierda.</p><p>This was supposed to be a simple job.</p><p>Get in, fix the problem, and get out.</p><p>That\u2019s what he did.</p><p>He fixed problems.</p><p>But from the instant he\u2019d caught sight of Sophia, the job had gone from simple to simply insane.</p><p>Proving his point, his gaze skimmed over the mingling crowd, landing with unerring accuracy on the golden-haired female who was responsible for his current discomfort.</p><p>She looked exquisitely elegant in a silky ivory pantsuit.</p><p>The jacket was perfectly tailored to her slender frame, the plunging vee neckline revealing the lush curve of her breasts. The pants clung to her long legs before flaring above a pair of three-inch heels.</p><p>Her pale hair was pulled into a smooth knot at the back of her head, the style perfectly designed to rouse his wolf into a near frenzy as he pictured his lips and teeth nuzzling down the length of her neck.</p><p>Wondering what she would do if he tossed her over his shoulder and headed for her office, Luc\u2019s pleasant imaginings were interrupted as he watched a red-haired imp move to stand beside Sophia.</p><p>The tall fey looked a bit like Troy, but his hair was cut short and his far more bulky frame was covered by a black Armani suit instead of spandex. A smile touched his handsome face as he bent down to whisper something in Sophia\u2019s ear.</p><p>A growl trickled from Luc\u2019s throat as his fingers clutched the glass he was holding until it shattered.</p><p>Ignoring the Cognac that spilled over his hand, Luc prowled forward, his gaze locked on the fey who appeared unaware he was toying with death.</p><p>The crowd parted before him, the females giving tiny gasps of nervous excitement as they avidly watched him cross the room. He was indifferent to the stir of interest caused by his tight T-shirt and black slacks and the fluid grace of his movements.</p><p>He had only one thought in his mind.</p><p>Halting directly behind Sophia, he reached around her just as the fey was intending to take her hand. He grabbed the fool\u2019s wrist, barely repressing his urge to crush the bones beneath his fingers.</p><p>\u201cTouch her and I\u2019ll make certain you never use that hand again,\u201d he warned, his voice thick with his wolf.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Pale green eyes widened as the imp regarded him with a startled alarm. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou work here?\u201d</p><p>Releasing his grip on the imp, Luc wrapped his arm possessively around Sophia\u2019s waist, his chin resting on the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cMy only job is pleasing Sophia.\u201d</p><p>Holding herself rigid, Sophia covered his hand with hers, covertly allowing her claws to dig into his flesh.</p><p>A tiny warning that she wasn\u2019t pleased by his public claim.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll finish our discussion tomorrow, Andrew,\u201d she smoothly promised the wary imp. \u201cMy office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour o\u2019clock,\u201d the fey murmured, cautiously waiting for Luc\u2019s tiny nod of agreement before backing away and disappearing into the crowd.</p><p>Smart imp.</p><p>He obviously had enough sense not to piss off a Were. Especially not one in heat.</p><p>Of course, a female Were was equally perilous.</p><p>Tugging out of his grasp, Sophia turned to stab him with a furious glare.</p><p>\u201cAre you demented?\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cOdd.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cThat question has been running through my mind with growing frequency.\u201d He nodded toward the fleeing imp. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy liquor distributor, who was giving me a very sweet deal until you came stomping over here like Conan the Barbarian,\u201d she rasped. \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d</p><p>Ah, now that was a loaded question.</p><p>For the past centuries Weres hadn\u2019t been jealous creatures. The overriding need to produce children had destroyed the instinct to find that one special companion.</p><p>Was it any wonder he was as baffled as Sophia by his urgent desire to make certain that every male in Chicago understood this woman was his property?</p><p>\u201cHave you considered the fact that you opened this club at the same time you moved into your new house?\u201d he hastily improvised.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand toward the stage where yet another overly pretty Were was stripping off his clothes.</p><p>\u201cSo your mysterious stalker might be someone you met here.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened, but it was obvious that she was considering his words.</p><p>\u201cAnd how does pounding your chest and publicly branding me as your latest bimbo help?\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted. \u201cBimbo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNow everyone knows they have to go through me to get to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d She didn\u2019t appear particularly pleased by his logic. \u201cWhat if they decide to lie low until you leave? Then I\u2019m back to where I started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d he assured her, moving forward to trace the line of her stubborn jaw. \u201cNot until I\u2019m absolutely certain you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps sensing that nothing short of death was going to pry him from her side, she heaved a sigh, her gaze shifting to the horde of females who were studying him with a rapt attention that was intended to be reserved for the entertainment.</p><p>\u201cSo much for blending in,\u201d she gave in with a sour frown.</p><p>He smiled, his finger lowering to follow the plunging neckline of her silk jacket.</p><p>\u201cYou were right to begin with,\u201d he murmured, his voice thickening as she gave a small shiver of pleasure. \u201cI don\u2019t blend.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>The human caterers had arrived precisely at eight to transform the back patio into the predictable clich\u00e9 of an oriental paradise.</p><p>Paper lanterns were glowing near the pool. Black and red tablecloths covered the long buffet tables that were lined with platters of sushi. And cheesy silk fans had been placed on every chair to be given as party favors.</p><p>Not Sophia\u2019s usual style.</p><p>She preferred champagne and caviar.</p><p>But considering one of her guests was quite likely trying to kill her, this was as good as it was going to get.</p><p>She did, however, manage to get her hands on the nectar she needed, and liberally dousing the drinks of the nymph and her cur lover, as well the vampire, she\u2019d done her best to ensure that the party wasn\u2019t a complete flop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not that it was necessary, she sourly acknowledged, watching the flock of women fluttering around Luc like bees to honey.</p><p>But then, why wouldn\u2019t they flutter?</p><p>He looked like a bronzed god stretched on a lounge chair beside the pool wearing nothing more than a black Speedo that left nothing to the imagination.</p> <p>The half dozen female mortals were so enthralled by the sight they were actually kneeling next to the chaise, as if they were worshipping him, while the dark-haired vampire with brown eyes and pale, pale skin had planted her ass on the edge of the chair, leaning forward as if afraid that Luc had missed the pair of boobs she had barely covered in a scarlet bikini.</p><p>Whose stupid idea was it to make this a pool party? she wondered in disgust.</p><p>Oh yeah, hers.</p><p>And why?</p><p>Because of the damned Were who had spent the past four days practically ignoring her.</p> <p>Standing near the French doors that led to her kitchen, Sophia heaved out a frustrated sigh.</p><p>She supposed she should be pleased.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she made it clear she had no intention in sharing her bed? Or her body?</p><p>But after the alarm system had been professionally installed, and Luc had moved into the guest room down the hall, she hadn\u2019t been nearly so relieved as she should have been. And she\u2019d been even less relieved when he began disappearing for hours on end, popping in and out without warning.</p><p>Was he hunting for her mysterious stalker? Or had the fact that there hadn\u2019t been any more attacks given him the excuse to find another woman to ease his lust?</p><p>She told herself she didn\u2019t give a damn even as she\u2019d abruptly decided to hold the party by the pool. Why not show off her new hot pink Dolce and Gabbana bikini? But even as she sent out the invitations she\u2019d suspected that her reasons were a lot less about vanity and a lot more about Luc.</p> <p>Stupid werewolf.</p><p>Sipping her apple martini while she imagined the pleasure of shifting so she could more easily rip out the throats of the twits paying homage to the man driving her nuts, Sophia abruptly caught a whiff of an approaching nymph.</p><p>Turning her head, she watched the auburn-haired woman with smoke-gray eyes halt at her side.</p><p>Victoria was lushly curved like most nymphs and at the moment was displaying those curves to full advantage in a black strapless one-piece swimsuit that was cut down to her navel.</p><p>The female smiled as her gaze shifted toward Luc. \u201cYou never mentioned that you had a lover.\u201d</p><p>Sophia barely swallowed her snarl.</p><p>Get it together, Sophia, she silently chided herself.</p><p>The opportunity to question this female was precisely why she\u2019d agreed to hold this stupid party.</p> <p>\u201cMy private relations are just that... .\u201d She pinned a cold smile to her lips. \u201cPrivate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted privacy then you should never have moved into this neighborhood,\u201d the nymph drawled. \u201cWe are incurably curious and far more interested in one another\u2019s lives than our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a little pathetic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d A sly expression crossed the nymph\u2019s pretty face. \u201cOf course, I do understand your reluctance to share. He\u2019s yummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously you\u2019re not the only one who thinks so,\u201d Sophia snapped as Kirsten ran a provocative finger down Luc\u2019s bare chest.</p><p>Victoria wrinkled her nose. \u201cThat vampire should be staked and left for the sun.\u201d</p><p>Sophia was thinking more along the lines of ripping off her head.</p><p>Quick and easy.</p><p>\u201cNot a big Kirsten fan?\u201d she instead forced herself to ask.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a whore.\u201d</p><p>Sophia lifted a brow at the sharp edge in Victoria\u2019s voice. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back. Tell me how you really feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe pretends she has no interest in my Morton, but I\u2019ve seen how she sniffs at him when he\u2019s near.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still a foundling, no doubt she sniffs everything with warm blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The nymph sent Sophia a mocking smile. \u201cThen you don\u2019t mind that she\u2019s currently latched on to Luc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d It was a miracle that the words didn\u2019t choke her. \u201cI trust Luc.\u201d</p><p>Victoria snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t lie. You want to toss the bitch into the barbeque pit and watch her go up in flames.\u201d</p><p>Sophia hastily squelched the delicious image.</p><p>Focus, Sophia. Focus.</p><p>\u201cIf I do decide I need to defend my territory, I\u2019ll confront her directly.\u201d She narrowed her gaze. \u201cI have no tolerance for creatures who attack anonymously.\u201d</p><p>The nymph paled, hastily backing away. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Sophia rolled her eyes. The stupid female might as well have tattooed \u201cguilty\u201d across her forehead.</p><p>Grasping her upper arm, Sophia yanked her to a halt. \u201cDon\u2019t run away, Victoria. We have so much to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d the nymph pleaded. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all depends on you,\u201d she growled. \u201cConfess and I won\u2019t kill you here and now.\u201d</p><p>The silver eyes shimmered with terrified tears. \u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a pure-blooded Were.\u201d</p><p>Victoria frowned at Sophia\u2019s deliberately vague response. \u201cThe witch promised me that the amulet would disguise my scent completely.\u201d</p><p>A disguise amulet.</p><p>That\u2019s how the woman had waltzed into her yard without leaving a trail.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Sophia demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>It was Sophia\u2019s turn to frown, her gaze moving toward the short, stocky male cur built like a fireplug. He had brown hair and pale eyes with unremarkable features.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly imagine I would be interested in Morton?\u201d</p><p>Victoria sucked in an offended breath. \u201cHe\u2019s perfect. Why wouldn\u2019t you want him?\u201d</p><p>Where to start?</p><p>Sophia picked the first one that came to mind. \u201cHe\u2019s a cur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Weres and curs don\u2019t mix,\u201d Sophia snapped. \u201cNow tell me why you\u2019ve been harassing me.\u201d</p><p>The nymph licked her lips. \u201cI ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like how Morton watched you when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking.\u201d</p><p>Sophia swore. \u201cSo you thought you could badger me into leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worth a shot.\u201d The nymph shrugged. \u201cI couldn\u2019t physically force you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when that didn\u2019t work?\u201d Sophia pressed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you decide on a more permanent solution?\u201d</p><p>There was a stunned silence before Victoria at last gave a slow shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cPermanent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning me over in your car?\u201d Sophia suggested sweetly. \u201cReleasing a rabid pit bull to attack me?\u201d</p><p>Victoria lost another layer of color. \u201cI\u2019m in love, not insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much difference,\u201d Sophia muttered.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, but I know that none of those things would actually kill you,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cOnly piss you off.\u201d</p><p>Her words teased at the edge of Sophia\u2019s mind, but for the moment she was too preoccupied to sort through the sensation that she should be disturbed by the comment.</p><p>\u201cA silver bullet through the heart would be lethal,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>The nymph held up pleading hands. \u201cLook, I left a few notes, a dead rat, and slashed your tires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brick through my window?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the brick,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll pay for the damages if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>Sophia gave the spiteful female a small shake before shoving her away in disgust.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is for you to leave me the hell alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d Victoria visibly struggled to regain her composure, smoothing her shaking hands over her hair as her gaze shifted to Luc. \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious to everyone in the neighborhood that you\u2019re taken.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stiffened. \u201cI\u2019m not \u2018taken.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I doubt the Were would agree. The way he looks at you ...\u201d She gave a tiny giggle. \u201cIt gives me the shivers.\u201d</p><p>Sophia followed the nymph\u2019s gaze, finding Luc staring at her with a heat that made the very air sizzle.</p><p>Shivers? Her entire body trembled.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an alpha,\u201d she lamely retorted.</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with him being an alpha and everything to do with him being a man.\u201d Victoria heaved a feminine sigh of pleasure. \u201cAnd what a man he is.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s power made the nymph\u2019s hair stir in warning. \u201cI thought you were desperately in love with your cur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, but I\u2019m not blind.\u201d Not entirely suicidal, the female returned her attention to Sophia. \u201cTake my advice and lock him away before some tart tries to steal him.\u201d</p><p>Sophia clenched her hands, her gaze still locked with Luc as she absently considered the logistics of holding such a powerful beast captive.</p><p>Preferably in her bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luc was a typical male Were.</p><p>Warm-blooded, fully functioning, and possessing a fine appreciation for the opposite sex.</p><p>Tonight, however, he had to clench his teeth against the soft female hands that took every opportunity to touch his exposed skin and the plethora of boobs waggled beneath his nose.</p> <p>There was only one woman he wanted touching his body or offering him the temptation of her firm, delectable breasts.</p><p>The knowledge should have sent him howling into the night in terror.</p><p>But if the past few days had taught him nothing else, it was that it was far too late to avoid his obsessive need for Sophia.</p><p>Even when he was miles away from Chicago she consumed his thoughts, the overriding need to return to her side a nagging ache that couldn\u2019t be denied. And when she was near ...</p><p>Dios.</p> <p>Pretending indifference to disguise his acute awareness of the female Were, not to mention his savage need to haul her nearly naked body away from the gawking male guests, Luc covertly monitored her every movement.</p><p>Which was why he knew the second the nymph approached her.</p><p>Tensing, he battled back his instinct to rush to Sophia\u2019s side. He didn\u2019t have to overhear their words to know that Sophia was in charge of the heated exchange, or to suspect that she was managing to bully information from the nymph.</p><p>A fact confirmed when Victoria crossed the terrace to grasp her lover\u2019s arm and with nervous glances toward Sophia urged him across the lawn toward the side gate.</p><p>Clearly, Sophia was more than capable of holding her own. At least when the enemy was face-to-face.</p><p>But when she turned to enter the house through the French doors, without so much as a glance in his direction, he could no longer deny his primitive male urges.</p> <p>Nothing like the sight of his prey attempting to escape to send a predator into a frenzy.</p><p>Nearly bowling down the gaggle of females leaning against his lounge chair, Luc was on his feet and following in Sophia\u2019s wake. He didn\u2019t give a damn about the cries of protest. The only thing that mattered was getting to the female who had him so twisted in knots he couldn\u2019t think straight.</p><p>He caught up with her as she crossed the shadowed kitchen, moving with a burst of speed to block her path.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you discover?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She came to a grudging halt, her hands on her hips. \u201cHow do you know I discovered anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were looking very chummy with the nymph. I doubt you were exchanging recipes.\u201d</p><p>Emerald fire sparked in her eyes. \u201cIs that an insult of my cooking abilities?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched as he recalled coming home last evening to find Sophia waiting for him at the table, her expectant expression revealing her pride in the hideous creation steaming on his plate.</p> <p>It was a testament to his devotion to her that he\u2019d managed to choke down more than two spoonfuls.</p><p>\u201cCara, I\u2019ve eaten raw slug demons that tasted better than your meat loaf.\u201d</p><p>Her power slammed into him, nearly sending him reeling backwards.</p><p>\u201cIt was salmon loaf, and since I never wanted to cook for you in the first place I hope it gives you food poisoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it very nearly did.\u201d He did a hasty sidestep as she attempted to circle past him. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tightened. \u201cTo bed.\u201d</p><p>He hissed, his body reacting with violent excitement to her simple statement.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t helping matters that he\u2019d spent the past four hours imagining how easy it would be to slice through the strings holding together her tiny excuse for a swimsuit.</p><p>Suddenly his Speedo was painfully tight.</p><p>\u201cAt this hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>Tired? Mierda. He had never felt more juiced in his life. As if his entire body was buzzing with electric anticipation.</p><p>He stepped closer, his wolf relishing the warm scent of woman and power.</p><p>Until Sophia he\u2019d never noticed whether a female could match his strength. So long as she was attractive and intelligent enough to hold his interest outside of bed he considered it a good relationship.</p><p>Now, he found his wolf preening at the knowledge this female was capable of holding her own.</p><p>Even against him.</p><p>His fingers lifted to grasp a strand of pale gold hair, savoring the feel of the silky softness.</p><p>\u201cYou still have guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t waiting around for my company,\u201d she said, the bite in her voice unmistakable. \u201cJust try to keep the noise down. We don\u2019t want to be busted by the neighborhood watch.\u201d</p><p>A slow, wicked smile curved his lips. \u201cWhy, Sophia. Are you jealous?\u201d</p><p>Holding herself rigid, she met his teasing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m a Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t get jealous.\u201d</p><p>His humorless laugh echoed through the kitchen. \u201cIf that were true then I wouldn\u2019t have waited outside your club for that damned imp to show up just so I could make it clear he wasn\u2019t to so much as smile at you during your meeting.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise at his blunt confession. As she should. He\u2019d felt like a dork waiting for the imp to make his scheduled appointment with Sophia and then accosting him as if he were some lethal assassin instead of a harmless liquor distributor.</p><p>Of course that didn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>He\u2019d been compelled to make sure the fey understood that Sophia belonged to him.</p><p>\u201cI wondered why Andrew looked like he\u2019d just swallowed his tongue,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cHe was lucky he still had a tongue after I watched him whispering sweet nothings in your ear,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>She sniffed, folding her arms over her chest. \u201cAt least he wasn\u2019t groping me like an octopus.\u201d</p><p>Ah. She was jealous.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>\u201cAre you referring to Kirsten?\u201d he asked in an overly innocent tone.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019ve never cared for cold-blooded leeches, but to each his own I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201d</p><p>Not giving her time to react, Luc scooped Sophia off her feet and headed out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, but astonishingly she made no effort to struggle out of his grasp. Or even to rip out his throat.</p><p>Progress.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen talk,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He crossed the foyer and easily jogged up the curved staircase, using the excuse to press her tight against his chest.</p><p>\u201cIn private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your groupies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll eventually find easier game.\u201d He held her petulant gaze, not bothering to hide his smoldering desire. \u201cThis one\u2019s already been bagged and tagged.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips as he stepped into her bedroom and kicked shut the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cLuc.\u201d</p><p>Still holding her gaze, which was now wary, he gently set her on her feet in the middle of the room, his hands resting on her nicely rounded hips.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be interrupted here.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the only reason you chose my bedroom?\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened on her hips, his already hardened cock throbbing with an eager plea for attention, but with an effort he forced himself to concentrate on business before pleasure.</p><p>Later ...</p><p>Oh, the things he intended to do.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you learned from the nymph.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned at his commanding tone, but she wasn\u2019t a fool. She had to sense he was hanging on by a thread.</p><p>As if his raging erection didn\u2019t give it away.</p><p>\u201cShe was the one harassing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not the brightest bulb,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cWith a little prompting she confessed to writing the notes and leaving dead animals and slashing my tires. Oh, and throwing the brick through my window.\u201d She made a sound of disgust. \u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He\u2019d pegged the nymph for the childish pranks, but it was nice to have it confirmed.</p><p>\u201cAnd the attempts on your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was clueless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded without hesitation. \u201cShe might be a flake, but she\u2019s not bloodthirsty enough to try to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there are two separate enemies.\u201d Luc felt a piece of the aggravating puzzle slide into place. It wasn\u2019t that the harassment was escalating. It was that they were traveling separate paths. \u201cOne mystery solved.\u201d</p><p>She tilted back her head to regard him with a lift of her brows.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who insisted that I host this ridiculous shindig,\u201d she tartly reminded him. \u201cDid you learn anything besides Cindy\u2019s bust size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mortal who was worshipping at your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He allowed his fingers to trail over her lower back, male enough to enjoy her pique. \u201cWas she the brunette or the redhead? They all start to look alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ...\u201d</p><p>He pressed a finger to her lips, halting her furious words. \u201cI\u2019ve started the process.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook off his hand, her eyes narrowing. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He reached into the side of his Speedo to pull out a small key.</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d</p> <p>She snorted, unimpressed. \u201cA key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lifted it from Kirsten when she was trying to stick her tongue down my throat,\u201d he explained.</p><p>If looks could kill, he\u2019d be dead on the spot.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would you need her key?\u201d she managed to ask between gritted teeth.</p><p>She was beautiful when she was jealous, he decided.</p> <p>Eyes glowing with emerald fire. Her hands clenched.

She parted her lips to protest the destruction of her expensive clothing, only to have a groan escape as he spread his palm over her bare ass, his fingers squeezing her flesh in promise of pleasure to come. \u201cHour after hour I lay in my bed, hearing you pace the floor while the scent of your desire filled the air.\u201d He peered deep into her eyes. \u201cDo you know what it cost me not to come to you? Not to ease your need?\u201d</p><p>She knew the torment of having him so near and yet too frightened to admit her growing desperation for him.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His hand stroked up her back, cupping the nape in a gesture of comfort.</p><p>\u201cMy first priority is keeping you safe,\u201d he reminded her, a thin layer of sweat forming on his brow as she gave his cock a slow pump. \u201cI can\u2019t do that if you don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you haven\u2019t tried to seduce me?\u201d</p><p>He gave a strangled chuckle. \u201cThat and I feared you might slice my balls off.\u201d</p><p>Smart, smart Were.</p><p>He knew precisely what to say.</p><p>And how to touch, she acknowledged as his fingers moved from her nape to trace the line of her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhy tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to tell myself it\u2019s because you have come to accept I only want what\u2019s best for you, but the truth is that I\u2019m not a saint,\u201d he confessed, the rasp of his breath filling the air. \u201cI need you so badly I\u2019m not sure I can survive another night without you.\u201d</p><p>Without warning his hands shifted to grasp her hips, rolling her until she was lodged on top of him. Pleasure jolted through her as her already damp flesh was pressed to his thick cock.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cTell me you want this, Sophia.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at his impossibly handsome face that was hard with barely leashed passion.</p><p>She\u2019d fought this moment for so long. Ever since he\u2019d walked into Sophia\u2019s Menagerie.</p><p>Only now, however, did she realize that it wasn\u2019t her fear of being used to simply pass the time that had made her wary of allowing him into her bed.</p><p>But something much darker and far more dangerous.</p><p>Something that she couldn\u2019t fight any longer.</p><p>\u201cI want this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His hands skimmed to cup her breasts, studying her with the measuring gaze of a wolf.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what he was searching for, but she sensed that it was important.</p><p>\u201cTell me that you want me,\u201d he prodded, rolling her tender nipple between his thumb and finger.</p><p>Oh ... God.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cLuc.\u201d His voice was thick with need. \u201cSay my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow let me taste you.\u201d</p><p>She planted her hands on either side of his head, lowering her body until he could plant an openmouthed kiss at the base of her shoulder. She shuddered, rubbing against his hard erection as his tongue ran a wet path along the line of her collarbone.</p><p>He clamped his hands on her hips, holding her tight against him while refusing her the relief of moving.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to regret this in the morning, are you?\u201d</p><p>She gave a husky chuckle as she turned her head to stroke her lips along his jaw, delighting in the rough scrape of his whiskers. She didn\u2019t doubt he had to shave more than once a day to look civilized.</p><p>The thought was oddly erotic.</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d</p><p>He hissed in pleasure. \u201cNo, but I don\u2019t want to be kicked to the curb because you blame me for taking advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one takes advantage of me.\u201d She nipped his bottom lip. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a silly juvenile who doesn\u2019t know what she wants from one minute to the next. I\u2019m a full-grown Were and I want you.\u201d</p><p>A moan was wrenched from his throat as his lips traveled over the curve of her breast, at last latching on to her aching nipple.</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut as a raw, savage pleasure raced through her.</p><p>\u201cOh ... God, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d</p><p>Like it?</p><p>Hell, she accused him of being a caveman, but her urges in this moment couldn\u2019t be more primitive.</p><p>Give her a club and she\u2019d make sure this man never left her bed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t say that if you\u2019d seen me during a full moon,\u201d she teased with a small sigh. \u201cI earn my title of Queen of Bitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that you\u2019re a bitch.\u201d His mouth tormented her nipple, lapping and nipping until her fingers dug into his shoulders. \u201cAnd that you\u2019re not afraid to speak your mind. And that you\u2019ll kick ass when necessary.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered, his soft words as much an aphrodisiac as his skillful touch.</p><p>Gods, she was on fire.</p><p>After waiting for so long to ease this burning ache, she had planned to enjoy a slow, mind-numbing seduction, but the pagan need to have him buried deep inside her was rapidly reaching a critical level.</p><p>As if sensing she was tumbling out of control, Luc pulled back to study her with a gaze that sent tiny tremors down her spine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a gaze that spoke of need and yearning and ... possession.</p><p>Lifting his hands, he framed her face in his hands, pulling her down to kiss her with an aching sweetness. Sophia sighed. She didn\u2019t know what she had done for fate to have dropped this delectable man into her arms, but she intended to savor every moment he remained with her.</p><p>Her hands smoothed over the corded muscles of his chest. His skin was a warm, silken temptation, and with a moan of need, she moved to trail her lips over his face and down the strong column of his throat. Her stomach clenched in fierce need, her wolf delighting in the clean scent of male skin.</p> <p>\u201cYou taste of heat and sunshine,\u201d she whispered as she continued her provoking caresses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be tasting you,\u201d he growled, his hands clutching her hips as he sought to regain command.</p><p>Such an alpha.</p><p>\u201cDo you object?\u201d she whispered, moving steadily lower.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia,\u201d he rasped as she reached the rippling muscles of his lower stomach.</p><p>\u201cMmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Were who has wanted you for a very long time,\u201d he ground out. \u201cI need to be inside you when I come.\u201d</p><p>She gave a throaty chuckle, oddly pleased by his words. Not that she was done with her playing. Deliberately rubbing her body back up the length of his body, she savored the electric sparks set off by the friction of their naked skin.</p><p>It\u2019d been so long since she\u2019d felt such overwhelming desire. Hell, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever needed a man like she needed Luc. Her every nerve felt alive, sensitized to the point she thought she might combust.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have wanted me that long,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other a week.\u201d</p><p>Without warning he lifted her hips, stealing her breath as the fierce jut of his erection settled in the damp heat between her legs.</p><p>She arched, the persistent throb in her sex rejoicing as the wide tip of him slipped just inside her body. But instead of shoving himself home, he clutched her hips and regarded her with smoldering eyes.</p><p>\u201cI met you a week ago,\u201d he said in thick tones. \u201cI\u2019ve waited for you all my life,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Oh shit, she was in trouble.</p><p>\u201cLuc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow ... my turn for some torture,\u201d he informed her, drawing her toward his waiting lips. \u201cI want you begging before I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>With a wicked smile, Luc branded her lips with a kiss of pure hunger. The taste of his wolf on her tongue sizzled through her, setting off small fireworks of pleasure.</p> <p>Then moving his mouth over her face, he stroked down the length of her arched neck. Sophia\u2019s fingers dug into his shoulders as he tugged her upward, catching the pouting nipple between his teeth. She gave a soft growl as he licked and suckled her, her head tilted back at the insistent bliss pulsing through her. He turned his attention to the other breast, deliberately urging her desire to a fever pitch.</p><p>She needed to get him inside her.</p><p>She needed to be so deeply connected to him that they reached paradise together.</p><p>But even as she struggled to slide onto his waiting cock, he was ruthlessly hauling her up to her knees. With a strangled moan she glanced down to watch his mouth explore the clenched muscles of her stomach, his tongue darting out to send shivers of delight through her.</p><p>She moaned, her heavy lashes lowering as he stroked over the curve of her hip and down the inside of her thigh.</p><p>Okay, she could take a small detour before riding him like a cowboy.</p><p>Then his seeking lips found her moist cleft and any logical thought was destroyed. Oh, this was good. This was fan-freaking-tastic.</p><p>Struggling not to topple backward as his tongue stroked the highly sensitive flesh, she speared her fingers in the thick satin of his hair.</p><p>There was something a bit naughty about straddling him as he expertly tongued her, although she intended to become a whole lot naughtier before the night was over.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t forgotten those handcuffs he\u2019d mentioned....</p><p>Still holding her hips, Luc found the core of her pleasure, gently sucking as the magical pressure began to build.</p><p>\u201cLuc, I\u2019m close,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he muttered, guiding her back so he could position her over his straining erection.</p><p>Then, slowly he penetrated her damp channel.</p><p>Sophia hissed as she pressed herself ever deeper. She had logically known he was large. All over. But as he stretched her to the limit, she had to admit she hadn\u2019t actually considered the sensation of being impaled by such a generously proportioned shaft.</p><p>Holy crap.</p><p>Bigger really was better.</p><p>And when a man knew what to do with such a fine, fine instrument, then it was nothing less than a gift to women.</p><p>Briefly savoring his deep, steady pace, Sophia at last placed her hands on his chest, rolling her hips to meet his upward thrust. She smiled with wicked satisfaction as his fingers convulsively clutched her hips.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one with talent.</p><p>\u201cDios, you feel so good,\u201d he panted. \u201cSo good.\u201d</p><p>Sophia lifted until the tip of his cock was nearly at her entrance before plunging downward. His hips jerked off the mattress, his eyes glowing as his wolf strained to be released.</p><p>Sophia chuckled, loving the sensation of being the one in power even as she knew that it was an illusion that he was offering her.</p><p>Just as he was offering her the illusion that he was hers.</p><p>The one wolf meant to be hers for all eternity.</p><p>Abruptly crushing the disturbing thought, she concentrated on the sensation of Luc\u2019s deepening thrusts, her soft pants filling the air as her muscles tightened in preparation for the looming orgasm.</p><p>Luc tightened his grip, his face burying in the curve of her neck. Then, still pumping into her at a furious pace, he sank his teeth into her flesh, sending her into a shattering climax.</p><p>Sophia shuddered in bliss, convulsing around him as he gave one more thrust and cried out with the violent pleasure of his own release.</p><p>Luc rolled to the side, wrapping his arms tightly around Sophia\u2019s trembling body as he struggled to catch his breath. His mind reeled from the astounding pleasure that continued to shudder through him.</p><p>Not just the orgasm that had ripped through him with the force of a tsunami, but the feel of her flesh beneath his fangs as he had marked her with his bite.</p><p>A damned shame that the mark wouldn\u2019t last. He wouldn\u2019t be at all displeased to have her walking around with a blatant display of his ownership.</p><p>Unfortunately even now her skin was healing, returning to the perfect, unmarred silk that tempted him to lean down and sink his teeth in for another bite.</p><p>He groaned, his body hardening.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, he was tempted to start the whole thing over. This time he wouldn\u2019t let the bewitching Were provoke him into such a swift conclusion.</p><p>He intended to take hours pleasuring her.</p><p>To have her pleading for release.</p><p>And most importantly, to make certain that he had entrenched himself so deeply she would never, ever want another lover.</p><p>Snuggling against his chest, Sophia heaved a sigh of contentment.</p><p>\u201cThat was ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSensational?\u201d he offered, his lips teasing over her brow and down the slender length of her nose. \u201cLife altering? The best you\u2019ve ever had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdequate.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. The earth had just moved.</p><p>For both of them.</p><p>\u201cAdequate?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head to deliberately tease the tender spot just below her ear, chuckling as she quivered in ready response.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe it was above average,\u201d she whispered huskily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire, cara.\u201d Nipping the lobe of her ear, he planted hungry kisses down the length of her throat, pausing to nuzzle the tender flesh he intended to hold in his teeth as he brought them both to an explosive climax. \u201cShall I remind you of just how good it is between us?\u201d</p><p>She groaned, her hands branding a path of heat over his chest and down his stomach.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s coming back,\u201d she assured him. \u201cSlowly.\u201d</p><p>For all his brawn, Luc had always been surprisingly intuitive. In truth, it was his ability to read others that made him such a lethal killer.</p><p>Any Were could use his teeth and claws to battle his enemies. But a soldier who could predict what his opponent was going to do before he did it, priceless.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t intuition, however, that made him pull back to study his companion with a searching gaze. No, this was much deeper. Much more ... intimate.</p><p>\u201cSophia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d she murmured, her hands continuing the path of destruction toward his fully erect cock.</p><p>Mierda, he wanted to forget the concern that niggled at the edge of his mind. Surely whatever was bothering Sophia could wait?</p><p>At least for a few hours.</p><p>Then, as he caught the scent of wariness threaded through the rich spice of her desire, he heaved a small sigh, catching her hand a mere heartbeat before she captured his shaft and put an end to any coherent thought.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something on your mind.\u201d</p><p>She flashed a deliberately wicked smile. The kind of smile intended to divert any red-blooded male. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA sexy six-foot Were who thinks he\u2019s all that?\u201d</p><p>Bringing her hand to his lips, he pressed a kiss to her knuckles, his gaze never wavering from her pale face.</p><p>\u201cNice try, but I know when a female is distracted.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cNot a problem I usually have when I\u2019m in bed with her.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou really need to work on your self-confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia, tell me what\u2019s troubling you.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence as she inwardly debated the odds of keeping her secrets.

Maybe he was being childish. After all, he couldn\u2019t deny that he\u2019d had a few one-night stands in his past. And while he had never intentionally used a woman, there might have been a few who had wanted more than he was willing to offer.</p><p>But the thought that Sophia could ever have dismissed their powerful connection as a meaningless bout of lust pissed him off.</p><p>Royally.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cI was lying to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>There was the slightest hesitation before she heaved a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cAbout you and why I was terrified to let you into my bed.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his arm, grudgingly meeting her troubled gaze. \u201cThen what was the reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid I would never let you out of it.\u201d</p><p>The blunt words hung in the air as Luc allowed them to slowly ease the sick ball of dread that had lodged in his gut.</p><p>At last he lifted a hand to lightly touch her pale cheek. \u201cSophia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wolf recognized you from the beginning,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt understood... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop now, cara,\u201d he coaxed, desperately needing to hear the words.</p><p>\u201cIt understood that you belong to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>The emerald eyes flared at his noncommittal response. \u201cI warned you that you wouldn\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>His laughter was filled with pure joy as he rolled her beneath him, pinning her to the mattress with his much larger body.</p><p>\u201cHow could you possibly think I wouldn\u2019t want to know how you feel?\u201d he growled, not certain if he wanted to shake her or kiss her senseless.</p><p>The damned female could make him feel as uncertain and awkward as a pup.</p><p>Her eyes widened as she felt the blunt tip of his erection settle at the moist entrance between her legs.</p><p>\u201cYou came here for a job, not to become mated.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek, his thumb brushing the sensuous curve of her lips.</p><p>Just a few days ago the word mate would have made him break out in hives.</p><p>Now he couldn\u2019t imagine his life without this woman.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter why I came, only that I never intend to leave.\u201d</p><p>Her arms wrapped around his neck, her emerald eyes glowing with an emotion that was echoed in his racing heart.</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI belong to you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine?\u201d</p><p>A smile curved her lips, then before he could guess her intentions, she\u2019d captured his thumb between her teeth, gently sucking on it.</p><p>He growled in pleasure, the sensation of her tongue rubbing his thumb making his cock ache for the same delicious attention.</p><p>\u201cJust as you are mine,\u201d he swore, lowering his head to press restless kisses over her face.</p><p>White-hot need blazed through him, but somewhere in the back of his mind he felt a brief moment of disquiet.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just his fear for her safety, although that was a constant, biting concern. Until he\u2019d captured and killed the bastard trying to harm Sophia he would always be on edge.</p><p>No, this was more personal.</p><p>But equally worrisome, he realized with a pang of surprise.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he regretted his actions. He\u2019d done what he was commanded. And more importantly, his actions had always been in an effort to protect this woman.</p><p>But something warned him that Sophia might not be pleased when she discovered that he hadn\u2019t yet been totally honest with her.</p><p>Briefly he considered the notion of confessing all. It was, no doubt, the right thing to do. But even as the thought drifted through his mind, Luc was abruptly distracted when her legs wrapped around his hips, her nails biting into his ass in a silent plea for release.</p><p>There would be time later, he assured himself, squashing the tiny voice of warning.</p><p>Much, much later.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>It was late morning when Sophia and Luc crept into Kirsten\u2019s home, both shifting into wolf form to make a swift sweep of her lavish lair.</p><p>Once it was obvious there was nothing suspicious beyond an obscenely massive collection of Manolo Blahnik shoes that Sophia fully intended to get her greedy hands on, Luc gave her rump a playful nip and they headed back to her house.</p><p>Following him up the stairs to her ... their ... bedroom, she had an opportunity to admire her wolf.</p><p>And he was well worth admiring.</p><p>A large beast with massive fangs and dark fur, he was the size of a pony with a broad chest and thickly muscled legs. His eyes glowed with the midnight fire of his wolf, but there was an unmistakable intelligence that was as dangerous as all the strength of his heavy body.</p><p>Oh yes, he was fine, fine, fine.</p><p>An opinion that was only emphasized as a shimmering light haloed his body as he shifted back to his human form.</p><p>He shuddered as his body hovered between wolf and man, the ancient magic pulsing through the air. Then the transformation was over and with a remarkable ability to recover, Luc was rising to his feet, his naked body all chiseled perfection wrapped in smooth bronze silk.</p><p>Yummmmmm.</p><p>Sophia concentrated on her own shift, relishing the painful stretch of muscle and popping of bone. There was a primitive satisfaction in calling on her powers.</p><p>Not quite as swift as Luc in regaining her balance, Sophia slowly rose to her feet and pulled on the short, silk robe tossed on the bed. Across the room, Luc was already dressed in a pair of khaki shorts and polo shirt that might have made him look civilized if not for the shadow of whiskers already darkening his jaw and the feral glint in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d he asked, referring to their recent jaunt through the vampire\u2019s lair.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He moved to the full-length mirror attached to the back of the door, smoothing back his hair.</p><p>\u201cWhich would seem to leave the cur as the last of our suspects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorton?\u201d She snorted. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine him as a homicidal maniac.\u201d</p><p>He turned to discover her eyeing his ass. A smug smile curved his lips.</p><p>\u201cLooks are far too often deceiving.\u201d</p><p>Sophia grimaced, picturing the dull fire hydrant of a cur. \u201cThey would have to be excessively deceiving.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll soon find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming he is guilty, I don\u2019t know how walking around a golf course whacking at a white ball is going to convince the cur to confess.\u201d</p><p>Luc crossed to stand directly in front of her. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to confess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>He reached to grasp a lock of her hair, smoothing it between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cGiven enough time alone with him, I\u2019ll know if he\u2019s guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d She studied the supreme confidence etched on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re not a mind reader, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have any number of talents, cara.\u201d His voice lowered to the husky drawl that made her shiver. \u201cNot all of them involve a bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrogant dog.\u201d</p><p>He paused, absently twirling her hair around one finger. \u201cWhat are your plans for the rest of the day?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gave a vague wave of her hand, hoping he truly wasn\u2019t a mind reader.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis and that.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYour \u2018this and that\u2019 wouldn\u2019t include a visit to Victoria, would it?\u201d</p><p>Dammit.

The beast didn\u2019t like the thought of her being close to another male.</p><p>Understandable. She\u2019d slice off his nuts if she thought he was sniffing after another female.</p><p>\u201cA new dancer?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her slow smile assured him that he was the only man she wanted. \u201cHe\u2019s a Were from China who supposedly does things with his nun-chucks that make women melt.\u201d</p><p>Without warning she was wrapped in possessive arms and hauled against Luc\u2019s broad chest.</p><p>\u201cWhen I get back tonight I\u2019ll show you my nun-chucks,\u201d he promised, planting an openmouthed kiss at the base of her neck. \u201cI bet they\u2019re bigger.\u201d</p><p>A sure bet, she silently acknowledged, wrapping her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cJust make sure you make it back,\u201d she commanded, studying him with open concern.</p><p>He might be the biggest, baddest Were on the block, but there was a psychopath out there who had a gun with silver bullets and wasn\u2019t afraid to use them.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d His lips nibbled a path up the curve of her neck, halting just below her ear. \u201cAnd, Sophia.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, her body instinctively arching against him. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Pulling back she regarded him with a wary frown.</p><p>The words were as good as a cold shower.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I like the sound of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need you to know... .\u201d He bit off his words, his expression impossible to read.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, as if he was considering his words. Then he gave a short shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Her vague unease became downright worry.</p><p>\u201cLuc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He leaned down to steal a searing kiss that sent bolts of excitement through her before turning to head for the door. \u201cCan\u2019t be late for our tee time.\u201d</p><p>She watched his departure with a jaundiced frown, knowing it would be a waste of time to try and force him to reveal what was troubling him.</p><p>He would confess when he was good and ready.</p><p>Throwing her hands in the air she headed to her shower.</p><p>\u201cMen.\u201d</p><p>The exclusive country club south of town was precisely what Luc had been expecting. A large clubhouse designed in a tudor-style with attached pool, tennis courts, and stables all impeccably maintained.</p><p>The surrounding golf course was equally well-manicured. The fairways were narrow with deep sand bunkers and a line of overhanging trees that might have posed a challenge for a human. Luc, however, possessed the strength to simply hit his ball over any obstacles to the distant green, more often than not ending up mere inches from the flag that fluttered in the summer breeze.</p><p>By the time they\u2019d reached the back nine, his physical superiority had accomplished precisely what he desired.</p><p>Morton had gone from a casual companion to a furious cur who was fuming with a frustration that reddened his round cheeks and made his eyes flash with sparks of crimson as he tried to hold back his wolf.</p><p>Unlike pure-blooded Weres, the curs were at the mercy of their beast, and while Luc didn\u2019t want the man to shift, he did want him so preoccupied with controlling his temper that his defenses were lowered.</p><p>Who knew what he might reveal?</p><p>Putting away his club after holing out on a par five, Luc joined his companion in the golf cart, nearly being tumbled out as the cur stomped on the gas pedal.</p><p>\u201cNice shot,\u201d Morton gritted.</p><p>Luc sprawled back in the seat, smiling with a lazy arrogance custom-designed to infuriate his companion.</p><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad?\u201d Morton scowled. \u201cIt was a hole in one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little competitive there, champ?\u201d</p><p>Looking remarkably like a marshmallow with his square, squishy body covered in a white shirt and matching pants, Morton gripped the wheel of the golf cart and struggled not to do something stupid.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Morton, not champ,\u201d he snapped, \u201cand when I do something, I like to do it well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d</p><p>The pale eyes glowed with a crimson fire. \u201cSome more than others.\u201d</p><p>Luc chuckled, reaching over to slap the man on the back, hard enough to rattle his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Morty-boy, if I didn\u2019t know better I might think you didn\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>The cur clenched his teeth, no doubt counting to ten.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you planning to stay in Chicago?\u201d he at last demanded.</p><p>\u201cHoping to get rid of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think the suburbs would be a bore.\u201d</p><p>Luc offered a taunting grin, covertly studying the tension emanating from the cur.</p><p>So far all he\u2019d managed to pick up was Morton\u2019s natural aversion to an obnoxious companion. Time to up the ante.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but there are benefits,\u201d he drawled. \u201cSophia is smoking hot between the sheets.\u201d</p><p>The male hissed. \u201cTypical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p><p>Without warning the cur veered the cart off the path and headed into a thick patch of trees. Turning in his seat, he studied Luc with a revulsion he no longer tried to hide.</p><p>Luc hid a smile. Action at last.</p><p>\u201cSophia is revered among our people, but of course a man like you would only consider your own pleasures.\u201d</p><p>Luc paused at the fierce words.</p><p>There was an edge of crazy that he\u2019d been looking for, but he didn\u2019t sound like a man intent on killing a female.</p><p>Of course, there were always those bastards who were willing to murder the object of their fantasy if they couldn\u2019t have them.</p><p>He slouched against the leather seat, pretending he didn\u2019t notice the cur was a breath away from shifting.</p><p>\u201cShe may be revered, but she needs a good banging like every other woman.\u201d</p><p>More crimson fire in the eyes. \u201cAnimal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou seem abnormally interested in my relationship with Sophia,\u201d Luc mocked. \u201cDon\u2019t you have your own female to worry about?\u201d</p><p>Morton belatedly attempted to hide his obsession with his beautiful neighbor.</p><p>\u201cI merely believe Sophia deserves a more worthy male.\u201d</p> <p>Luc lifted a brow. \u201cA male like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would certainly appreciate her fine qualities.\u201d The crimson gaze flicked over Luc with a dismissive annoyance. \u201cUnlike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think she\u2019s so fine, then why haven\u2019t you made your move on her?\u201d Luc deliberately widened his eyes, as if struck by a sudden thought. \u201cOr have you already tried and been shot down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt for the best.\u201d Luc gave the cur another slap on the back, barely resisting the urge to unleash his claws and rip out his throat. The mere thought that the creep had been secretly lusting after Sophia made his wolf ache for blood. \u201cJust between us, I don\u2019t think she would ever be interested. I believe her exact words were that you were \u2018a sorry excuse for a cur.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>Morton flinched at the insult, but there was a grim set to his jaw. As if he\u2019d made his decision and nothing was going to sway him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only because she doesn\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ll grow on her?\u201d Luc chuckled. \u201cLike fungus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s an intelligent female who can appreciate the needs of duty.\u201d</p><p>Luc stilled, thrown off guard by the unexpected words. \u201cDuty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p> <p>All right, enough was enough.</p><p>He had no doubt that Morton was the stalker and he intended to get to the truth, one way or another.</p><p>He actually preferred the \u201canother\u201d option, since it included a lot of pain and carnage.</p><p>\u201cIs it your duty to try and kill her?\u201d</p><p>Morton looked like a deer in the headlights for a split second, then meeting Luc\u2019s ruthless gaze he seemed to accept that he was busted. With a shrug he allowed his act to drop, a cunning expression settling on his pudgy face.</p><p>\u201cAh, I feared you had guessed the truth.\u201d</p><p>Luc subtly scooted forward, not wanting to be in the position where he could be pinned against the roll-bar of the cart.</p><p>Not that he believed for a moment the cur could physically overpower him. Still, better safe than sorry.</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve guessed is that you\u2019re responsible for stalking Sophia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot stalking ...\u201d Morton corrected, \u201ctesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough I\u2019ve held the greatest respect for Sophia since the birth of her daughters, I needed to be certain that she retained her strength and agility over the years.\u201d</p><p>A chill inched down Luc\u2019s spine. There was something far more disturbing about this calm, almost condescending Morton.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo bear my children, of course.\u201d</p><p>Fury pulsed through Luc, his wolf savagely trying to break free of his restraint. It would kill before it allowed another man to steal his mate.</p><p>And the man in him was in full agreement.</p><p>Ironic he was the one in a rage considering he\u2019d been trying to provoke the cur.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d</p><p>With a smooth motion, Morton reached into the cooler set on the seat between them and pulled out a small gun loaded with a cartridge.</p><p>Luc frowned. A tranq gun? The cur truly was insane if he thought a pure-blooded Were could be put down by a mere tranquilizer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever question my sanity,\u201d Morton warned, obviously a little sensitive on the subject of his mental state.</p><p>Luc carefully judged the distance between them as he sought to keep the cur distracted.</p><p>\u201cIf you want her as a breeder then why did you try to kill her?\u201d</p><p>Morton regarded him as if he were particularly dense. \u201cI didn\u2019t try to kill her. I\u2019ll admit that I devised a few obstacles to monitor her physical condition, but I would never permanently harm her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Luc snarled, furious at the thought of Sophia being systematically terrorized by this psycho. \u201cI know you were the one who shot at her. A silver bullet through the heart would have been very permanent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t shooting at her, you fool.\u201d Morton smirked, clearly thinking that his peashooter gave him the upper hand. A mistake that Luc was eager to demonstrate. \u201cI was aiming at you.\u201d</p><p>Luc frowned, startled by the confession. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had borrowed Victoria\u2019s disguise amulet to follow Sophia to her club when you arrived in Chicago.\u201d His expression hardened with disgust. \u201cI knew from the way you were watching her that you were going to interfere with my plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo capture Sophia and impregnate her with my litter.\u201d</p><p>Any coherent thought was lost as a red mist descended over him, his beast beyond the point of no return.</p><p>\u201cNo way in hell,\u201d he growled, his words nearly unintelligible.</p><p>Looking almost bored as Luc began to shift, Morton pointed the gun at the center of his chest.</p><p>\u201cI just knew you were going to be trouble.\u201d</p><p>Distantly Luc heard the pop of the gun and felt the dart plunge into his flesh, but, lost in his transformation, it was too late when he realized his muscles were slowly being paralyzed as the unknown substance began to flow through his blood.</p><p>Regarding the smug cur in horror, he realized he should have paid far more attention to his own warnings.</p><p>Looks truly were deceiving....</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Sophia was running late.</p><p>After reviewing the payroll and dealing with the linen service that had forgotten to bring their laundered tablecloths and napkins, she had been forced to soothe one of the waiters who had been insulted by the bartender and locate the key to the back freezer that had been lost.</p><p>At last she was able to settle in a chair to audition the Were who had traveled thousands of miles just to perform at her club.</p><p>Unfortunately, she struggled to concentrate.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Jian wasn\u2019t spectacular. He nearly set the stage on fire with his lean, muscular body that moved with a fluid grace that was amazing even by Were standards.</p><p>But tapping a finger on the arm of her chair, she realized she felt ... weird, unsettled.</p><p>She told herself that she was merely impatient to return home to Luc. He was bound to be finished with his golf match by now and waiting for her return.</p><p>Hopefully naked in her bed.</p><p>What woman wouldn\u2019t be anxious to be done with work?</p><p>Counting down the minutes until she could politely bring the audition to a close, Sophia was startled when she caught a familiar scent.</p><p>Turning her head, she watched the crimson-haired imp dressed in a silver mesh shirt and black spandex cross the room to take the chair beside her, setting a leather briefcase at his feet.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he moaned, his gaze drinking in the sight of the near-naked Were dancing on the stage. \u201cTasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy.\u201d Sophia gave a lift of her brows. \u201cDon\u2019t you have your own business to run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the view isn\u2019t nearly so nice.\u201d</p><p>She reached to grab his chin, turning his fascinated attention in her direction.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to ogle the talent, you\u2019re supposed to pay a cover charge.\u201d</p><p>He pouted. \u201cIs that any way to treat your bestest friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I came to your coffee shop you charged me an arm and a leg for a cappuccino the size of a thimble,\u201d she reminded him in dry tones.</p><p>\u201cBut I sprinkled it with my special fairy dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial fairy dust, my ass,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cIt was cinnamon.\u201d</p><p>A smile twitched at the edges of his mouth. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you have a reason for being here beyond trying to sneak a peek?\u201d</p><p>The smile faded, leaving the handsome face unexpectedly somber.</p><p>\u201cI think we should talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d Sophia frowned. \u201cI seem to be getting that a lot lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Trying to shrug off her persistent unease and the sudden certainty she wasn\u2019t going to like what Troy had to say, Sophia rose to her feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go to my office.\u201d</p><p>With a thumbs-up toward Jian, she led the towering imp into her office, closing the door behind them.</p><p>Troy strolled to inspect her enviable collection of Faberg\u00e9 eggs.</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>Sophia moved to the wet bar behind her desk. \u201cSomething to drink? Water? Brandy?\u201d She pointed toward the sleek silver cappuccino machine. \u201cA ten-dollar cappuccino with fairy dust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Troy took the seat opposite her desk, opening his leather briefcase to pull out a small flask. \u201cI always carry my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came prepared,\u201d she murmured, noting the stack of manila folders in the case. \u201cShould I be worried?\u201d</p><p>He took a swig from the flask. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>She sat in the chair behind her desk, her heart lodged in her throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTroy?\u201d</p><p>He replaced the flask, regarding her with a guarded gaze. \u201cWhen you asked me to find you a bodyguard I went through my usual contacts to locate one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot usually.\u201d</p><p>She tucked her hands beneath the desk, unwilling to let the imp see her clenching them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s different this time?\u201d</p><p>The imp paused, as if considering the wisdom of confessing whatever it was that had brought him to the club.

Why did she suddenly feel so cold? \u201cWhat\u2019s that saying, \u2018There\u2019s no fool like an old fool\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She heard the imp cross to stand directly behind her, his hands landing lightly on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a fool, Sophia,\u201d he assured her. \u201cLuc managed to deceive us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re not sleeping with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because he didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>Sophia started to smile when she was abruptly struck by a thought that made her heart clench in agony.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>Giving her shoulders a tug, Troy turned her to meet his searching gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could be working with the maniac who has been stalking me,\u201d she breathed. \u201cHell, he could be the stalker.\u201d</p><p>Troy gave a firm shake of his head. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not the stalker. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m absolutely certain of.\u201d</p><p>So was she.</p><p>Her lips thinned as the thought whispered through the back of her mind.</p><p>She had proof that he had lied to her from the beginning of their relationship. Why did she find it impossible to accept he would ever do anything to hurt her?</p><p>\u201cHow can you know?\u201d</p><p>With a grimace he moved back to the briefcase he\u2019d left on her desk, pulling out yet another folder.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s one of Salvatore\u2019s most trusted lieutenants,\u201d he said, pressing the file into her hands. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the window, her head dizzy as she tried to process yet another shock.</p><p>Damn the King of Weres.</p><p>She had known when Salvatore capitulated so easily to her refusal to join them in Styx\u2019s lair that he was up to something. Something devious.</p><p>He was a Were who always believed he knew best.</p><p>So the fact that he had somehow managed to discover she was seeking a bodyguard and had planted his own trusted soldier into her house to keep an eye on her wasn\u2019t at all a surprise.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t make Luc\u2019s deception any easier to bear.</p><p>He might not be her stalker, but he\u2019d used her desire and all too vulnerable emotions to make sure he could remain close to her and fulfill his duty to his king.</p><p>The ... jackass.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the folder she was clutching in her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe information my private investigator managed to dig up. At considerable expense, I might add.\u201d Troy shook his head. \u201cThe man buried his identity deeper than Jimmy Hoffa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a private investigator?\u201d she absently demanded, flicking through the various pages.</p><p>She paused to take in the photos of the large stucco mansion surrounded by palm trees that was Luc\u2019s true home and an unmistakable picture of Luc and Salvatore meeting in a park several miles west of Chicago.</p><p>Another shaft of pain sliced through her heart.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous world these days,\u201d Troy explained. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d She threw the folder across the room, watching the papers fan across her carpet.</p><p>Troy nervously cleared his throat. \u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>Was she?</p><p>At the moment she wasn\u2019t entirely certain.</p><p>The pain and disappointment clawing through her felt lethal.</p><p>Then realizing that the imp was watching her with a sympathy she couldn\u2019t stomach, she gave a toss of her hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sophia,\u201d she announced, her head held high. \u201cNo man\u2019s going to get me down. Even if he is a lying, mangy piece of shit.\u201d</p><p>Troy gave a snap of his fingers, a smile curving his lips. \u201cYou go, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d</p><p>Sophia headed for the door, her need to find Luc an overwhelming compulsion.</p><p>\u201cUh, Sophia,\u201d Troy called out.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you decide to kill Luc you need to make sure you hide the body,\u201d he warned. \u201cI doubt that your son-in-law would be happy to learn you offed his most trusted soldier.\u201d</p><p>A humorless smile curved her lips. \u201cActually I was thinking I could use a new fur rug in front of my fireplace.\u201d</p><p>Troy\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYikes.\u201d</p><p>Leaving the office, Sophia headed out of the club, her fierce glare keeping the milling employees at bay.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with clogged drains and missing G-strings.</p><p>In fact, the only thing she was in the mood for was blood and mayhem.</p><p>Storming out a side door, she was halfway across the parking lot when she heard a faint click. She slowed her furious pace at the same minute she felt a prick in her upper chest. Looking down she realized there was a small dart sticking from her skin.</p><p>What the ... ?</p><p>That was as far as her confused mind managed to get before her muscles became paralyzed and she was tumbling toward the paved ground. Then her head was smacking face-first into the pavement and the entire world exploded into black.</p><p>Waking, Sophia cautiously held herself still as she took stock.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t gone to the great kennels in the sky, thank the gods.</p><p>She had a throbbing head, and she could feel an odd metal collar strapped around her neck, but the rest of her seemed to be back in working order.</p><p>Cautiously she allowed her senses to spread further.</p><p>She was in a basement, she realized with a stab of surprise. Or at least underground.</p><p>And night had fallen while she had been conked out.</p><p>Oh, and the stench of cur was thick in the air.</p><p>The same scent she\u2019d caught mere seconds before she\u2019d been shot by the dart.</p><p>A growl trickled from her throat as she wrenched open her eyes to discover Morton leaning over her, his face the nasty color of paste in the fluorescent light.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d She surged to a sitting position, barely noticing the narrow cot beneath her as Morton hastily backed away. \u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>With a visible effort the cur halted his retreat, gathering his shaken courage as he sent her a chiding glare.</p><p>\u201cNow, Sophia, I must insist that the mother of my children not use such foul language,\u201d he informed her. \u201cIt\u2019s indecent.\u201d</p><p>Still weak from whatever poison he\u2019d pumped into her system, Sophia swayed on the edge of the cot, wondering which of them had lost their minds.</p><p>She was betting on the cur.</p><p>\u201cMother?\u201d She shook her head, trying to clear the cobwebs. \u201cAre you mental?\u201d</p><p>Pinpricks of crimson flashed through the pale eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t push me.\u201d</p><p>Oh, pushing him was going to be the last of the little prick\u2019s concern once she got her strength back, she assured herself, glancing around the six-by-six-foot cell that was paneled with sheets of silver.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy private lair beneath Victoria\u2019s house.\u201d He regained command of his composure, one hand smoothing down his white polo shirt. His other hand held a small device that Sophia suspected was some sort of weapon. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she knows better than to come down here. We won\u2019t be interrupted.\u201d</p><p>Her lip curled in scorn. \u201cDoes she suspect that you\u2019re a psychopath?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had barely finished her taunt when Morton pressed a button on the device and the collar around her neck began to sizzle. The next thing she knew a massive jolt of electricity speared through her body, nearly toppling her off the cot onto the cement floor.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cI did warn you.\u201d</p> <p>She clenched her teeth, imagining the pleasure of gutting the pasty-faced cur over and over and over... .</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d he scolded. \u201cI\u2019ve chosen you to be the mother of my children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt in your demented mind you think I should be honored by the offer, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to take a pass.\u201d Her stomach heaved at the mere thought. \u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d</p><p>Even prepared for the bolt of electricity, Sophia couldn\u2019t halt her yip of pain, her legs trembling and sweat coating her skin.</p> <p>\u201cYou will learn,\u201d Morton growled.</p><p>Her hand weakly lifted toward the metal wrapped around her neck.</p><p>\u201cChrist, where the hell did you get this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invented it myself,\u201d the cur preened, as if expecting Sophia to admire his handiwork. \u201cJust as I invented the serum that knocked you out. I\u2019m a scientist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was Dr. Frankenstein,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYou know how that turned out.\u201d</p><p>Zap.</p> <p>She leaned down until her forehead touched her knees, fighting against the urge to vomit.</p><p>\u201cYou will learn to respect me,\u201d Morton abruptly shouted, clearly unhinged by her refusal to play the game by his rules.</p><p>Not surprising.</p><p>Morton-the-cur was a born victim who had no doubt been bullied and mocked by others his entire life.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she demanded. \u201cBecause you can create torture devices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s merely my hobby.\u201d His smile was edged with a smug pride. \u201cMy true genius is chemistry. Which is why Caine hired me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>Caine was currently missing along with her daughter Cassandra.</p> <p>At one time he\u2019d been under the sway of a demon lord who\u2019d convinced him that he was destined to change curs into pure-blooded Weres.</p><p>A part of the prophecy had come true when the same demon lord had taken a path directly through Caine on his way back to hell, transforming him from a cur into a Were.</p><p>\u201cYou worked with Caine?\u201d</p><p>The cur shrugged. \u201cYes, although we disagreed on how to accomplish our goal to turn curs into pure-blooded Weres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you hope to accomplish such a miracle?\u201d</p><p>She expected him to refuse to answer. Weren\u2019t mad scientists usually secretive about their strange experiments?</p><p>Instead he answered without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cIn the same way your king did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to alter the DNA of our children while they are still in your womb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ...\u201d</p><p>Words failed her, her mind refusing to return to those long days in Salvatore\u2019s clinic. She\u2019d been a willing participant and it had still been near unbearable. With an effort she squashed the rising panic. She would die before she allowed this freak to impregnate her. First, however, she would try to reason with him.</p><p>\u201cEven supposing that you do manage to change our children into Weres, how does that help the other curs?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His eyes lit with the gleam of a true fanatic. \u201cI can use their blood to help create a vaccine that will transform all of us.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, not about to try and point out to Dr. Evil that the magic that created a pure-blooded Were couldn\u2019t be found in a test tube. It was always futile to argue with a true believer.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d she instead asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already proven yourself to be a fertile breeder.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He seemed caught off guard by her response. \u201cI mean that with the greatest respect.\u201d</p><p>Said the psycho to his electrified prisoner.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she prompted, knowing there had to be more.</p><p>\u201cAnd when you moved into the neighborhood I realized that fate had at last smiled upon me,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWhy else would you be here if not to fulfill my destiny?\u201d</p><p>Great. Of all the neighborhoods she could have chosen, she had to pick the one with Morton-the-crazy-ass-cur.</p><p>\u201cHave you considered the fact that I might not be willing to become your lab rat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit that it\u2019s been a concern,\u201d he said. \u201cI hated the thought of holding you prisoner down here for months, perhaps even years. I\u2019m not a monster, after all.\u201d</p><p>She choked back a laugh at his seeming sincerity. \u201cYou could have fooled me.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her response, moving toward the small stool in the corner of the barren cell to pick up a heavy leather glove.</p><p>\u201cThen a solution literally dropped in my lap.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s wolf was on full alert although the serum still pumping through her bloodstream refused to allow her to shift.</p><p>\u201cWhat solution?\u201d</p><p>Using his gloved hand, the cur reached for the small handle on the wall, pulling back the silver panel to reveal that the cell was divided in two.</p><p>Sophia hissed in sudden horror as she caught sight of the dark Were lying unconscious on the floor, a silver collar around his neck that was attached to the heavy chain bolted to the wall.</p><p>Luc.</p><p>Stupidly she\u2019d assumed that he was waiting for her at her home. Perhaps even now wondering why she was so late.</p><p>For a moment panic threatened to consume her.</p><p>He might be a deceitful bastard who had broken her heart, but the thought that he might be dead was enough to send a crippling agony through her.</p><p>Then through her pain, she detected the unmistakable beat of his heart.</p><p>Oh ... thank the gods.</p><p>He was alive.</p><p>She turned her head to stab the cur with a fierce glare. \u201cWhat have you done to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave him the same drug I used on you, although in a considerably larger dose.\u201d He gave a dismissive wave of his hand. \u201cHe\u2019ll eventually wake up.\u201d</p><p>Sophia sensed the sudden increase in Luc\u2019s heartbeat.</p><p>He was awake, she abruptly realized, but feigning unconsciousness. A task made possible by Morton\u2019s inferior senses.</p><p>She smoothed her expression, inwardly gathering her strength. Although she was still weak, she knew she would have to strike swiftly. The amount of silver in the room would drain what little power she had remaining in a matter of hours.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of holding him prisoner?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain he can\u2019t carry your litter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy first thought was to kill him,\u201d he admitted, his voice revealing his deep regret in being denied the pleasure. \u201cNot only because I knew that he\u2019d be a threat to my plans, but because he\u2019s a genuine pain in the ass.\u201d He heaved a sigh. \u201cThen I realized he could be my assurance for your good behavior.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>With an effort, she forced herself to pretend confusion as she shakily rose to her feet. She needed to distract him just long enough to get that damned device out of his hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not blind.\u201d His lips thinned in revulsion. \u201cI saw how you watched him during your party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHow could I not watch him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou care for him,\u201d he insisted, the crimson flickering in his eyes. \u201cWhich means you\u2019ll do whatever I ask to make sure he eventually gets out of this basement alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d She gave a wave of her hand to distract from her covert step forward.</p><p>He sniffed. \u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right that I did care for him.\u201d Another wave, another step. \u201cPast tense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen call Troy.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThe imp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She turned to glare at the unmoving Were, not having to feign her simmering anger. \u201cRight before you went all Man vs. Wild on me in the parking lot, he revealed that Luc had lied to me.\u201d</p><p>Watching him with an eagle eye, she easily caught the faint twitch of his ears.</p><p>Guilty conscience?</p><p>Or annoyance at having been busted?</p><p>\u201cWhat was the lie?\u201d Morton wanted to know.</p><p>She pointed a finger toward Luc, again taking a step forward. Just a few more feet and she would be close enough to knock his ass to the ground.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a plan after that, but she was willing to play it by ear.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a bodyguard like he told me,\u201d she revealed. \u201cHe\u2019s a right-hand man to Salvatore and he was sent to Chicago to spy on me.\u201d</p><p>Morton scowled, obviously reluctant to believe her. Her outrage at Luc\u2019s betrayal did, after all, ruin his diabolical plans. But even a stupid cur could sense the sincerity of her angry words.</p><p>\u201cWhy would the king wish to spy on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe obviously believes I\u2019m too stupid to make my own decisions,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAn opinion shared by that Were lying on the floor.\u201d She moved toward the cur, keeping her steps slow and unsteady, as if she was having trouble with her balance. \u201cSo if you hope to use him as a bargaining chip then you\u2019re shit out of luck, because as far as I\u2019m concerned you can dig his grave and toss him in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Morton pressed his gloved hand to his forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to confuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s confusing?\u201d With another step she was able to reach out and grab his white polo shirt, giving him a small shake. \u201cWhere\u2019s your gun? I\u2019ll shoot him myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop... .\u201d He regarded her in puzzlement, unaware of his danger. \u201cDon\u2019t do this... .\u201d</p> <p>Knowing she\u2019d only have one shot at escape, Sophia pulled back her arm and smashed her fist into his face with enough force to make him fly across the cell and smack into the far wall.</p><p>If she\u2019d been at full strength, the bastard would have been dead.</p><p>As it was, he was only knocked loopy.</p><p>With her heart lodged in her throat, Sophia darted toward Luc, who was on his feet, regarding her with a burning black gaze.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to be able to read his mind to know he was furious she was trying to rescue him rather than escaping.</p> <p>Ignoring the massive fangs he bared as she knelt beside him, she clamped her hands around the silver collar. The silver seared into her skin, burning away the flesh, but there was no time to search for a key.</p><p>Already she could feel Morton stirring.</p><p>Luc growled, using his large head to try and push her away, but she held on. She could feel the silver stretching and weakening beneath her powerful tugs. Just a few more seconds and she\u2019d be able to snap it in half.</p><p>The prickle on her neck was the only warning before a bolt of electricity shot through her body. She screamed, her back bowing beneath the impact, but grimly ignoring the brutal pain she continued to pull at the collar.</p><p>Distantly she was aware of Luc\u2019s furious growls and yet more lightning dancing down her spine. Christ. She was about to black out.</p><p>Again.</p> <p>Out of time, Sophia gave one more massive tug, not certain if she actually felt the collar snap beneath her grip, but there was no mistaking the sensation of Luc\u2019s massive body brushing past her as he launched himself forward or the shrill screams of Morton.</p><p>Death screams.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Once again Sophia was struggling out of a blanket of darkness.</p><p>This time it took only moments to realize she was lying on her own bed wearing a clean camisole and silk shorts. And that she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Luc filled the room with his presence.</p><p>The rich, male scent. The restless power of his wolf.</p><p>And above all, the prickling awareness that set her blood on fire.</p> <p>For a crazed moment she felt an overwhelming surge of relief at the knowledge that they had both survived the basement from hell and that they were seemingly safe from Morton the crazy-ass cur.</p><p>Then she abruptly remembered that Luc was a total creep who\u2019d played her for a fool.</p><p>And that she wanted to kick him in the nuts, not shiver in pleasure as he settled on the mattress beside her reclined body and gently tucked a curl behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cSophia?\u201d he murmured softly. \u201cI know you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>She kept her eyes squeezed shut. Maturity was highly overrated.</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She heaved an aggravated sigh. \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>He trailed his fingers down the stubborn line of her jaw. \u201cSophia, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go away if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I get a gun and shoot you?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, his fingers shifting to outline the curve of her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t shoot me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes snapped open. How else could she glare into his handsome face?</p><p>Unfortunately, she also managed to catch a glimpse of his broad shoulders and the chiseled muscles of his chest that were perfectly outlined by his tight black T-shirt.</p><p>Dear gods, but he was gorgeous.</p><p>Edible.</p><p>Treacherous, unwelcome heat curled through the pit of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t I?\u201d she asked between clenched teeth.</p><p>A smile teased at his lips, but the dark eyes remained watchful. Wary.</p><p>\u201cBecause you love me.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened at the accusation. \u201cArrogant ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I\u2019m your arrogant ass.\u201d</p><p>With a curse, Sophia scooted until she was leaning against the pile of pillows at the head of the bed, pleased to discover that her wounds were completely healed.</p><p>She could feel Luc\u2019s gaze skim down her half-naked body with a tangible hunger, but she resisted the urge to crawl beneath the covers.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to give him the satisfaction of knowing he could still disturb her.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think that I\u2019m going to forgive and forget that you came to me under false pretenses?\u201d she rasped. \u201cThat you climbed into my bed with lies? And that even after we ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe what?\u201d he prompted as her words broke off.</p><p>\u201cSupposedly mated.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched, his power thickening the air. \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018supposed\u2019 about it, Sophia. We are most definitely mated.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his interruption, despite the voice in the back of her mind that warned he was right.</p><p>Mating wasn\u2019t marriage. It couldn\u2019t be ended by a couple of lawyers and a restraining order.</p><p>At the moment she wasn\u2019t in any mood to admit they were still bonded.</p><p>\u201cEven then you continued to deceive me.\u201d</p><p>Something flared through the dark eyes. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s all you have to say for yourself?\u201d She lowered her voice, mimicking his less-than-impressive explanation. \u201c\u2018I know.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was scared,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>Her brows snapped together. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to be funny ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Neanderthal was scared?\u201d She allowed her gaze to trail down the hard, toned perfection of his body. \u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know at the time.\u201d He studied her with blatant regret. \u201cI only knew that whenever I told myself I had to confess the truth, I found some reason to put off the inevitable.\u201d</p><p>Her heart gave a renegade flutter. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I know that I was terrified that when you learned the truth you would never be able to forgive me. If I lost you ...\u201d He abruptly reached to grasp her hand in a near painful grip, a haunting fear briefly flaring through his eyes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to survive.\u201d</p><p>A portion of her fury faded. There was no doubting the sincerity of his words.</p><p>She could feel the fierce emotions that pulsed through his body. They echoed in her own heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly is the truth?\u201d she asked, her voice thick.</p><p>\u201cI think you know most of it.\u201d His thumb caressed her inner wrist, the light caress sending jolts of pleasure shooting through her. \u201cI was contacted by Salvatore two weeks ago. He said that his mother-in-law was in danger, but that she was too stubborn to accept his help.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cTo be honest, I wasn\u2019t happy about his request. I\u2019m a soldier, not a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not an aging, feebleminded female who needs her hand held by a big, bad male,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cAging?\u201d He seemed baffled by her outrage. \u201cYou\u2019re an exquisite female who is just reaching her prime.\u201d</p><p>A secret part of her preened at his words\u2014she was, after all, about to become a grandmother, she had every right to be sensitive. But she was still angered by the thought she\u2019d been treated as if she was incapable of making her own decisions.</p><p>\u201cAnd feebleminded?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>Frustration tightened his expression. \u201cOf course you aren\u2019t feebleminded. Hell, you\u2019re clever enough to ensure my life is going to be a constant battle to keep up with you. But I won\u2019t apologize for trying to keep you safe, cara,\u201d he rasped. \u201cIt\u2019s what I was born to do.\u201d</p><p>Okay.</p><p>That was exactly the right thing to say, she wryly acknowledged.</p><p>Not that she was ready to concede defeat. There were still a few bones to pick.</p><p>\u201cIf Salvatore realized I was searching for a bodyguard, why did he send you?\u201d One day she would discover exactly how her son-in-law had known she was in danger and that she was looking for a hired thug. \u201cIt was obvious I was taking steps to protect myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the best.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cEven if you do say so yourself?\u201d</p><p>His dark gaze never wavered. \u201cIt\u2019s not a boast, Sophia, it\u2019s the simple truth.\u201d</p><p>She believed him.</p><p>There was a vast difference between arrogance and confidence.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t accept that it was just his talent in providing security that had prompted Salvatore to choose him.</p><p>\u201cAnd because you would report to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he admitted without hesitation. \u201cYour daughters were anxious to know you were safe.\u201d Abruptly his grip on her hand tightened, his wolf glowing in his eyes. \u201cOf course, in the end I failed you.\u201d</p><p>Sophia sucked in a sharp breath as she felt the guilt that was festering deep inside Luc.</p><p>Christ, she\u2019d never thought he would be blaming himself for her being kidnapped by Morton. The cur was raving mad.

Mierda.\u201d He shuddered, his hands lifting to lightly grasp her wrists. As if he needed to reassure himself that she was alive and unharmed. \u201cI was so worried you would be lured into a trap and I walked straight into one. And then, when Morton was torturing you with that damned collar ...\u201d</p> <p>Without thought she leaned forward to halt his pained words with a fierce kiss. She couldn\u2019t bear for him to be burdened with regret when he\u2019d done everything possible to keep her safe. But as soon as their mouths connected, the gesture of comfort combusted into something far more intense.</p><p>Dangerous.</p><p>Hurriedly she jerked back, licking her tingling lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>His brooding gaze remained locked on her mouth. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>There was a short silence as they both savored the thought of Morton dead.</p><p>Sophia hoped the bastard was rotting in hell.</p><p>At last, Luc slowly smiled. \u201cOf course, there was one good thing about being locked in that basement.\u201d</p><p>A good thing?</p><p>She scowled. \u201cDid you take a blow to the head? That place was a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou risked your life to rescue me,\u201d he pointed out softly. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have done that if you didn\u2019t still love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was too weakened to shift,\u201d she lamely tried to argue. \u201cI knew I would need you to kill Morton and get us out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuc ...\u201d</p><p>Tugging on her wrists, which he still held in a loose grip, he kissed her with an aching tenderness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, cara,\u201d he whispered against her mouth. \u201cI regret ever deceiving you, and if I could go back in time I would change everything. But all we can do is go forward.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back to study his somber expression. Deep inside she knew that he hadn\u2019t meant to hurt her. At least not intentionally.</p><p>He\u2019d come to Chicago as a soldier obeying orders. And like her he\u2019d been knocked off guard by the power of their mating.</p> <p>Could she truly blame him for being reluctant to confess the truth?</p><p>Not that she didn\u2019t intend to keep his blunder as ammunition to pull out whenever she screwed up. It was almost like having a Get Out of Jail Free card, she decided.</p><p>\u201cYou swear never to lie to me again?\u201d</p><p>She could feel the tension drain from him at her question, a small smile curving his lips.</p><p>\u201cI swear I will never ever give you a reason to regret trusting in me,\u201d he hedged, knowing better than to make a promise he could never keep.</p><p>A Were who could be trained.</p><p>A good sign.</p><p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t interfere when I kick Salvatore\u2019s furry ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is my king, but you ...\u201d The dark gaze seared over her face, his steadfast love burning like a beacon. \u201cYou are my mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart Were,\u201d she whispered, a delicious warmth spilling through her as she wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cMaybe you should remind me why that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d He pressed her back against the pillows, his lips tracing a path of erotic fire down the curve of her neck. \u201cFor both of us.\u201d\u2018</p><p>MURDER ON MYSTERIA LANE</p><p>ANGIE FOX</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Last time I got stuck in a graveyard after dark, I missed the final episode of Lost. This time, an immense werewolf leveled a shotgun at my nose.</p><p>I could smell the sharp tang of gun oil in the dry desert air.</p><p>\u201cHeather McPhee\u201d\u2014he cocked his weapon\u2014\u201cI order you to halt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and what army?\u201d I came up short, less than an inch from the double barrel. You really could poke an eye out with that thing. My gray cargo pants clanked with handcuffs, a stun gun, mace, two fixed-blade daggers, and of course my lucky boot knife.</p><p>A desert wind blew in from the west, pelting the aged tombstones with rocks and debris. Two more werewolves emerged from the darkness. They took positions on either side of the scraggily, bad-breathed Goliath.</p><p>Great, just great.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the password?\u201d he growled.</p><p>Like I knew. \u201cOut of my way you, hairy oaf.\u201d I started to move around him until his hand closed around my arm in a vise grip. \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play with me, girl. I\u2019m not afraid of your kind.\u201d</p><p>Too bad everybody else was.</p><p>\u201cListen, brainiac,\u201d I said, fighting the urge to stomp his foot,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here on the Alpha\u2019s orders, so unless you want to take it up with Finnegan\u2014\u201d</p><p>The guard growled low in his throat, his face a mix of shadows. \u201cFinnegan should have told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t.\u201d Not that he wouldn\u2019t be on my shit list for that. But to be fair, the guy had a pack to run. And an emergency it seemed.</p><p>I craned my neck around the wall of weres to see if I could catch anybody peeking out from the crypt.</p><p>There was no little stone house-like structure or stone angels to guard it. The Topanga Pack buried their alphas bunker-style. The shadow of the hole gaped low and menacing in the canyon bedrock. Thirty stone steps surrounded by sandstone walls ended in a solid oak door.</p><p>Lovely. No help in sight. Whoever was there to meet me was already inside\u2014waiting.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not answering his phone,\u201d barked the bodyguard to my right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking he might be busy,\u201d I snapped. I would be, too, if I could get past these clowns.</p><p>The top dog didn\u2019t just open up the Crypt of the Alphas for his health, or an all-night kegger. It was unsealed maybe once or twice a year for matters of pack justice. I was his only interrogator, a position I rather liked. So when Finnegan ordered me to get my ass down there, I\u2019d bailed on my dinner date with a bucket of KFC\u2019s original recipe and made a beeline for my boss.</p><p>Until I\u2019d run smack-dab into a boulder.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not a threat,\u201d I said. For heaven\u2019s sake, it\u2019s not like the overgrown Chewbacca and I weren\u2019t on a first-name basis. We\u2019d played together as kids\u2014Mary Poppins to be exact. And I wasn\u2019t the one dressing up as the flying babysitter.</p><p>Just because he\u2019d avoided me for the past twenty years didn\u2019t mean I\u2019d forgotten. The bodyguard had other secrets, too. Everyone did. That\u2019s why my bugged-out powers came in so handy.</p><p>I\u2019d been born with the Truth gene, an obnoxiously rare and recessive trait that showed up about once every seven hundred years. Lucky me. I could ask a question and literally make a person tell the truth.</p><p>Within limits. But I wasn\u2019t about to start broadcasting that little tidbit.</p><p>\u201cWant me to start asking you questions?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cCan it, McPhee,\u201d he said with a snarl, casting a glance at the wolves on either side of him. His eyes had widened a touch. I recognized the fear.</p><p>Good.</p><p>I reached into my back pocket for a rubber band and proceeded to pull my long red hair into a ponytail. Lucky for him I wouldn\u2019t be unleashing my powers in the middle of the Wolf\u2019s Lair flats. First off, it would be downright mean, even if my old buddy was being an ass. Second, using my powers gave me a massive hangover.</p><p>This joker wasn\u2019t worth it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be, meathead?\u201d</p><p>He scowled.</p><p>\u201cI can stand here until Finnegan comes out looking for me. No sweat off my back. Though it may mean the skin off yours.\u201d</p><p>He growled low in his throat as I started whistling the Jeopardy theme song.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this bullshit,\u201d he grumbled, standing aside.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I nudged him with my elbow as I brushed past.</p><p>He growled low in his throat. \u201cFreak.\u201d</p><p>Oh goody. Things were back to normal.</p><p>I descended the thick stone stairs into the darkness of the tomb. I might not win Miss Popular 2011, but my pack was stronger because of me.</p><p>Frankly, I\u2019d rather be needed than accepted.</p><p>The coarse walls were broken every so often by burial carvings and caked with canyon dust.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Finnegan\u2019s voice boomed before I\u2019d even reached the bottom of the stairs. \u201cNever mind,\u201d he added. \u201cJust get your ass down here.\u201d</p><p>It was cooler underground, the air stale. I could smell the pack leader\u2019s agitation even before I came upon him pacing in the center of a small, circular room.</p><p>A turquoise and orange pack crest spread across the ceiling. In the flickering light, I could read the inscription: Riamh daing-nithe i gc\u00fainne.</p><p>Never backed into a corner.</p><p>Damned straight.</p><p>It didn\u2019t look like our pack leader was doing so hot tonight. Finnegan jammed his hands into his copious red hair. His bulbous nose had gone red and his beard twisted sideways where he\u2019d been yanking on it.</p><p>Behind him, a shirtless human sat lashed to a wooden chair etched with runes and death spells.</p><p>\u201cWe need you to question this ... gardener,\u201d the Alpha said, as if he wasn\u2019t quite sure what a gardener even did. \u201cHe\u2019s from Eternal Life Estates.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wrinkled my nose. \u201cIn Vampire County?\u201d</p><p>The humans called it Malibu.</p><p>It was where trophy wives went to die.</p> <p>Or not die ... as the case may be.</p><p>Finnegan gave a tight smile. \u201cI\u2019ll remind you of my littermate who moved to Eternal Life Estates.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Sunshine McCarty, the bleached blonde, boob-enhanced darling of the pack. Growing up, she liked to tease me by pretending I was a boy.</p><p>As far as insults went, it was pathetic.</p><p>Let her yank out her eyebrows and wobble around on stiletto heels that, let\u2019s face it, would make it impossible to knee anyone in the balls. I liked to keep my options open.</p> <p>I studied the olive-skinned gardener. I didn\u2019t get why any were\u2014or this human for that matter\u2014would move in with the vampires. Sure, it beat Botox. Once you married a vampire, you stopped aging. Trophy wives for centuries.</p><p>Ridiculous.</p><p>I blew a few strands of hair out of my mouth. No matter what I did, my hair always ended up in my face. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Finnegan folded his arms over his chest. \u201cSunshine was killed three nights ago.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, not sure what to say. Comforting words weren\u2019t exactly in my nature. Not that the Alpha would want to hear them anyway.</p><p>He gave me a long look, the candles flickering shadows over his burly features. \u201cShe was murdered.\u201d</p> <p>Now that surprised me. If Sunshine had been willing to chip a nail, she could have gone up against any were. Unless she\u2019d come face-to-fang with her vampire husband.</p><p>\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cCrushed to death.\u201d</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>Finnegan tugged on his beard. \u201cWe\u2019ve kept it out of the papers. The pack won\u2019t know until we get justice.\u201d He stood behind the visibly shaking man. \u201cIt happened yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>That ruled out a vampire, at least directly.</p><p>\u201cThis is our witness,\u201d Finnegan continued. \u201cHis name is Marcos.\u201d</p><p>I studied the man, glad to be back in familiar territory. \u201cLet me guess. He\u2019s not talking.\u201d We\u2019d change that.</p> <p>Poor sap.</p><p>I tilted my head, my boots grinding grave dirt into the stones as I approached. \u201cWhat did you see, friend?\u201d</p><p>The man shook his head, a thin sheen of sweat slicking his forehead. \u201cN-nothing. I was trimming the hedges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer hedges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hedges! I heard a loud noise. I ran. Upstairs.\u201d His eyes darted away. \u201cThat\u2019s where I found her.\u201d His lower lip trembled. \u201cUnder her bathroom chandelier.\u201d</p><p>I resisted the urge to ponder the idea of a chandelier in the bathroom. I swallowed hard, locking eyes with the man in the chair as I unleashed a magnetic power from low in my chest. \u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d I felt the buzzing in my head, the dry tightness in the back of my throat. Marcos and I were connected, as if by a thin wire.</p><p>\u201cA woman\u2019s voice,\u201d he said, clearly surprised to hear the words come out of his mouth. \u201cI could barely understand her. She said that Sunny deserved what she got. And then she got even angrier. She said, \u2018and I hate your lawn.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Finnegan rushed to the bound man\u2019s side. \u201cWho was it? Did you see her?\u201d</p><p>My mind reeled as if he\u2019d smacked me upside the head.</p><p>\u201cFinnegan.\u201d I cringed. He knew better.</p><p>He halted, but he didn\u2019t apologize. Being an Alpha meant never saying you were sorry.</p><p>Head clanging, I asked the question. \u201cDid you see who was in the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He winced. \u201cI was tied to the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you were,\u201d I said, throwing up a warning finger at my leader. If he jarred my mind again, I was going to lose our witness. And because Finnegan knew the stakes, I got away with it.</p><p>I turned back to the gardener. \u201cHow often did you have sex with the victim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Whenever I worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Finnegan swore behind me.</p><p>\u201cDid her husband find out about your sex-capades?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Vampires tended to be intensely sexual, and not particularly good at sharing. Then again, if the husband knew, he probably would have just eaten poor Marcos.</p><p>The gardener trembled, his eyes wild. \u201cHer husband was too busy with his own mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was?\u201d I prodded deeper.</p><p>He was sweating heavily. \u201cSunny wasn\u2019t sure,\u201d he said on an exhale. \u201cShe only knew it was one of the other Predators.\u201d</p><p>My head was pounding now, but I had to hold on. \u201cWho are the Predators?</p><p>\u201cFive shifters.\u201d He caught himself. \u201cWell, now there are four: Francine, Nina, Bliss and their whipping girl, Tia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d I glanced up at Finnegan. \u201cWe\u2019ll start there.\u201d</p><p>My vision swam and I felt my hold loosening. I broke our contact. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>My record was five minutes. This? Well, this was the best I could do tonight. My head throbbed. It would only get worse. Tapping minds gave me a hangover like I\u2019d downed a fifth of SoCo. Not that I\u2019d ever voluntarily do that to myself.</p><p>\u201cNice work.\u201d</p><p>Shaking, I folded my hands behind my back and lowered my chin to the Alpha.</p><p>\u201cVery nice indeed,\u201d said a man\u2019s voice, smooth as glass.</p><p>I whipped a dagger out of the back of my pants as a vampire emerged from the shadows behind me.</p><p>Panic shot through me. Why hadn\u2019t I smelled him? Why hadn\u2019t I seen him? My blood ran hot.</p><p>Finnegan must have blocked him from me. I didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>He was taller than I would have liked. Leaner. His shoulders were wide, his stance confident. This one was going to be a bitch to take down.</p><p>Finnegan raised his hand. \u201cHold back, McPhee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a vampire.\u201d I might be able to get hold of him by the hair. It was clipped short and blond.</p><p>\u201cMcPhee\u2014\u201d Finnegan\u2019s tone was a direct order. \u201cThis is Lucien Mead. My guest.\u201d He put an emphasis on that last word.</p><p>The vampire bowed at my pack leader\u2019s introduction. A hint of a grin gave him an almost boyish charm. A swirl of desire wound through me. Leftover adrenaline, no doubt.</p><p>Get it together. Hot or not, he was still a vampire. A fucking bloodsucker! I wasn\u2019t going to be seduced and bitten.</p><p>Even mosquitoes had more integrity than that.</p><p>The Alpha was not amused. \u201cLose the knife and say hello.\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth. If Finnegan was okay with the vampire, he must be working with the pack.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lucien.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t quite bring myself to put away the knife. Not yet. He was easy on the eyes. In fact, he reminded me of Iceman from Top Gun. He had that look, and that cool confidence.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d he asked, his eyes raking over me.</p><p>\u201cMcPhee\u2019s power is a pack secret,\u201d Finnegan said, as if he knew how I did what I did. Hell, I didn\u2019t even know. Finnegan stood his ground in front of the vampire, who was a full foot taller than the Alpha. \u201cDo you want us or not?\u201d</p><p>Lucien gave a long, slow grin. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll take her.\u201d</p><p>My head hurt for a whole new reason. \u201cTake me?\u201d He couldn\u2019t take me. I had a pack. I had a home.</p><p>Sensing my urge to bolt, Finnegan laid a hand on my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s only temporary. We need someone to go undercover.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never been undercover.</p><p>Lucien drew too close for comfort. \u201cI need a were to pose as my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>Finnegan continued as if I hadn\u2019t said a word. \u201cYou two will be the newest couple to move into Eternal Life Estates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather eat glass.\u201d</p><p>Finnegan\u2019s hand tightened on my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ll be going to Malibu, McPhee. Haven\u2019t you always wanted to see Malibu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I had everything I needed right here in the canyon.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, your skills are required,\u201d Lucien said. \u201cWe have a window of opportunity. A new couple was set to move into Eternal Life Estates. We\u2019ve commandeered the house for the investigation. However, it will be tight. Mr. and Mrs. Duke are scheduled to arrive tomorrow evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Detective Mead will pose as the Dukes,\u201d Finnegan said.</p><p>\u201cDetective?\u201d I stared at the vampire. \u201cWhat are you, some sort of undead Columbo?\u201d</p><p>Lucien grinned. \u201cYou could say that. I report to the Vampire Council.\u201d</p><p>Lovely. Even if the man was some kind of an eternal cop, he couldn\u2019t just drag me into this. \u201cAren\u2019t there protocols? Rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Finnegan growled. \u201cObey your pack master.\u201d</p><p>Had he lost his mind? \u201cIn case you two haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m not the trophy wife type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLower the dagger,\u201d Finnegan snapped.</p><p>Oh yeah. I hadn\u2019t noticed I\u2019d been waving my knife. I pulled it back and used it to clean a wedge of dirt out from under my ring fingernail.</p><p>This was ridiculous. How was I supposed to be a Sunny clone? He\u2019d better not make me wear a girdle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to help Detective Mead sniff out Sunny\u2019s murderer,\u201d Finnegan said, by way of a rah-rah speech.</p><p>Fuck a duck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get the truth out of the were wives of Vampire County.\u201d</p> <p>As if I wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll blend,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>I snarfed out loud.

We\u2019d declare war on a county full of vampires. And if the rest of them were like this solid blond wall, we didn\u2019t have a chance. It\u2019d be suicide for pack pride. And I really didn\u2019t want to die. Not for Sunny anyway.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I threw up my hands, remembered I was holding the knife, and sheathed it before Finnegan yelled at me again.</p><p>As if I was the one causing the problem.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll be the good wife.\u201d Ick. It even hurt to say the word. \u201cWe\u2019ll start with Sunny\u2019s old crowd. The Predators. We\u2019ll learn the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Finnegan said, a victorious glint in his beady little eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not wearing heels,\u201d I added.</p><p>Lucien leaned in from behind, his breath tickling my ear. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do a lot more than that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>I stared out the tinted glass of the Lincoln Town Car at the even darker night outside and wondered how on earth I was going to pull this off.</p><p>No. Don\u2019t think that way.</p><p>My newly manicured fingers fiddled with the obnoxiously large diamond on my left ring finger. God. I didn\u2019t even recognize my own hands. \u201cI can do this,\u201d I murmured to myself.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>A green road sign announced we were Entering Malibu. I smoothed the yellow baby doll dress over my knees. I had everything I needed to play the part.</p><p>Six coats of mascara? Check.</p><p>Bright red lipstick and matching strappy sandals? Check.</p><p>Model-worthy hair? I swear I used an entire bottle of Aqua Net.</p><p>We\u2019d had only last night and today to prepare, but I\u2019d been on tougher missions than this. I\u2019d wrangled the truth from a bullheaded minotaur, I\u2019d warned the pack about the Berserker Charge of 2010, and I\u2019d scared the feathers off a flock of angry harpies.</p><p>Surely I could face a pack of trophy wives with names like Francine and Tia.</p><p>Lucien lounged comfortably opposite me, one arm stretched out over the seat back between us. He wore an Armani suit and seemed like a natural for this job and this neighborhood.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if that made me feel better or worse.</p><p>We had less than seventy-two hours to pull this off.</p><p>Just breathe.</p><p>Yeah, well maybe I could breathe if I didn\u2019t have a girdle mashing my rib cage into my liver. I scrunched my shoulders and leaned forward, hoping for a measure of relief, but that only made me notice the reinforced toe of my panty hose peeking out from my red shoe. I\u2019d tried to stuff the dark brown part under my toes, but it kept inching back.</p><p>Oh well, what kind of woman notices another woman\u2019s shoes?</p><p>Lucien regarded me with a mixture of interest and distrust. From his piercing blue eyes to the blunt tips of his fingers, a cool power seemed to radiate from him. More than that, he was unapologetically male. A lick of desire slipped down my spine.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go over the plan again?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d We\u2019d been over it a half dozen times. I knew my role. And I was willing to do anything, even wear panty hose, to do the job right. It was a matter of pride\u2014for me and for the pack.</p><p>His smile was pure sin. \u201cThen stop fidgeting.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a dirty look. Oh please. \u201cLet\u2019s wrap you in a sausage casing and see how you fidget.\u201d</p><p>The car bounced over a series of speed bumps at the entrance to Eternal Life Estates. We wound through streets lined with palm trees, past the kind of houses you saw on the cover of magazines at the grocery checkout. The landscaping was impeccable, the fa\u00e7ades ornate, and the front lawns trimmed down to the last blade of grass.</p><p>At least the place looked deserted, except for, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d I thrust my head between the two front seats. A mass of shape shifters and vampires gathered in the road. As we neared, I could see that they had completely taken over a circle drive lit by torches in the ground.</p><p>Like an old-fashioned werewolf hunt.</p><p>I double-checked the twin knife holders I\u2019d strapped to my thighs.</p><p>Lucien hissed. \u201cI told them we did not want a welcome party on the first night.\u201d</p><p>No kidding. \u201cThey might have figured out the truth about us.\u201d I twisted around to face him. \u201cSomeone probably knows the Dukes.\u201d</p><p>Lucien was oddly focused on my thighs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep our cover.\u201d His steely gaze met mine. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t blow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot. Nothing like a supportive partner to get the job done right.\u201d This was why I liked working alone. \u201cAnd stop staring at me like you want to bite me.\u201d</p><p>Sure he looked like sex on wheels, but that didn\u2019t mean I was going to serve myself up with a sprig of parsley between my teeth.</p><p>His lips parted. \u201cI do want to bite you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it and I stake you.\u201d</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t I brought a stake?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, little werewolf,\u201d he said, sending a shiver down my spine. \u201cI\u2019m always in control.\u201d He held my gaze a second longer than he needed. \u201cAs for tonight, follow my lead. Remember, the less contact you have, the better.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I could find a nice tree branch.</p><p>I nudged the hem of my dress to make sure I wasn\u2019t giving any more free shows. \u201cAnything else, your brood-i-ness?\u201d</p><p>He cocked a grin. \u201cYou said you knew the plan.\u201d</p><p>Oh sure. The plan: Keep quiet. Look pretty. I need you until I don\u2019t need you.</p><p>I leveled a perfectly glossed fingernail at him. \u201cKeep in mind that you picked me. I\u2019m the best interrogator you have.\u201d</p><p>He seemed amused at that. \u201cInterrogator? Yes. Investigator? No.\u201d His voice lowered a notch. \u201cYou do not handle the case. I do. You get them alone later and you question them. But for now, you don\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ass.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t react. Stone-cold Luke this one was.</p><p>At least he knew what he was doing. According to what Finnegan had told me this afternoon, Lucien Mead was one of the Vampire Council\u2019s top guys. They brought him in to handle tough cases like this\u2014at least ones that could result in war. I had no problem following his lead\u2014as long as he didn\u2019t force it.</p><p>I wrangled halfway through the space between the two front seats to get a better look at the doom that lay straight ahead. Oh my God, they had mint tins.</p><p>\u201cYou are here to be pretty. You are here to be vapid.\u201d</p><p>I slammed back into the seat next to him. \u201cOh yes. Like the time I was too busy painting my nails to wrestle down a banshee and force him to give up the rest of the murdering horde.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeather\u2014\u201d Lucien leveled an icy gaze at me.</p><p>\u201cLay off the tall, blond, and frigid act. I\u2019ve got enough problems.\u201d I rubbed at my eyes, leaving a sparkly blue eye shadow streak on the back of my hand. Great, just great. I wiped it on the back of my dress where no one would see.</p><p>\u201cThink before you act.\u201d He planted a hand on the seat back behind me. \u201cYou are the only one who can learn the truth and prevent this war.\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah. No pressure there.</p><p>He had this whole calm and collected investigator persona down pat. But I was an interrogator. And I was good at my job precisely because I was willing to do whatever it took.</p><p>Like pretend to sleep with a vampire.</p><p>\u201cDrive casually,\u201d Lucien said to the driver as we drew near the crowd.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, boss.\u201d The ponytailed driver eased us between two party rental trucks.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s staying in the car, right?\u201d The guy looked like he should be working as a bouncer at a nightclub instead of driving a pair of pretend socialites. He also needed a shave.</p><p>The driver cocked his head toward me, silver rings piercing his right eyebrow and a black spike earring dangling from his left lobe. \u201cHis name is Vinny,\u201d he drawled with an unmistakable New Jersey twang, \u201cand you bet your ass I\u2019m getting out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVinny is my daytime eyes and ears,\u201d Lucien explained.</p><p>\u201cVinny would never even make it through a metal detector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? Fine.\u201d Vinny turned around and I about fell over as his hair shimmered from jet-black to white. Not only that, it shortened into a close-clipped haircut.</p><p>The scent of wood and grass filled the car. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d I watched Vinny\u2019s hands on the wheel age right in front of my eyes. His black T-shirt morphed into a silver suit jacket. His scraggly near-beard faded. By the time we parked, he looked like Jeeves the butler. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSatisfied?\u201d Vinny asked, with the same rough Jersey accent. Hardly. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>The old butler grinned back at me. \u201cI\u2019m special.\u201d</p><p>No kidding.</p> <p>\u201cStop showing off,\u201d Lucien said, as Vinny got out of the car to come open our door.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to think\u2014about Vinny or Lucien or this entire situation.</p><p>\u201cOne question,\u201d I said, as we watched Vinny circle around the front.</p><p>I knew all about my role in this\u2014and I had the lipstick on my teeth to prove it. But I sure as hell didn\u2019t know what Lucien the super cop was up to\u2014or what he wanted. What did the council care if the vampires slaughtered a pack of wolves?</p><p>Lucien closed his hand over mine as Vinny made a great show of standing by the door, preparing to open it. \u201cWhy are you two doing this?\u201d</p> <p>Lucien gave me a quick squeeze. \u201cBecause you\u2019ll never set foot outside if you see the karaoke machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall the guard, the vampire made a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeather\u201d\u2014he looked at me, really looked at me, for the first time\u2014\u201cI\u2019m here because I want to know the truth,\u201d he said, a determined slant to his jaw, \u201cjust like you.\u201d</p><p>Vinny opened the door. Jazz piano music flooded in. From the middle of the street at ten o\u2019clock at night. This was weirder than that coven of narcoleptic werebats we busted a while back.</p><p>Lucien stood outside the car, his hand extended to help me. His grip was firm and left no room to wrangle.</p><p>Deep breath. This was a special assignment, an important one that only I could do. I didn\u2019t want to let my Alpha down.</p> <p>Lucien took my hand once more, his grip cool and strong. \u201cRelax. You\u2019ll do great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. I\u2019d never been so plucked, sprayed, and manicured in my life. I\u2019d fit in. We\u2019d find the Predators. We\u2019d get to the bottom of this.</p><p>A brunette with a heart-shaped face and a sleek red sundress sauntered toward us on ice pick heels. \u201cMitzy, Luke!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cLook everybody, the Dukes have arrived!\u201d</p><p>I turned to him. \u201cLuke Duke? You\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>The waif-like woman stopped in front of us and smirked. \u201cNice earrings.\u201d</p><p>My stomach lurched. There was nothing wrong with my red hoop earrings. I\u2019d matched them to my shoes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Francine Sharp,\u201d she continued, as if she hadn\u2019t just insulted me, \u201chead of the welcoming committee.\u201d</p> <p>And a Predator. This was shaping up nicely.</p><p>Francine was also a werevulture from the smell of it. She fingered the gold locket at her neck, openly eyeing my fake husband.</p><p>\u201cA pleasure,\u201d Lucien said, kissing her delicate hand.</p><p>I waited for her reaction. Was she sleeping with dear departed Sunny\u2019s husband? Or would she be open to Lucien\u2019s attentions? I couldn\u2019t wait to get her alone to ask.</p><p>Only she\u2019d stopped eyeing him and had turned her sharp gaze on me.</p><p>A warm flush began in my stomach and heated me all the way up to my cheeks. Yes, I was being scrutinized. I\u2019d prepared for that. But I didn\u2019t like standing here being submissive.</p><p>I wanted to jump, holler, scream. Anything.</p><p>Instead I said, \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bvlgari.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She pursed her lips together. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>I had the distinct impression I\u2019d done something wrong, but I had no clue what. I mean, who names a necklace?</p><p>Lucien leaned close enough to whisper loving encouragement into my ear. \u201cKeep your mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Too late.</p><p>I fought the urge to snarl.</p><p>The werevulture tilted her head. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d</p><p>I tried to think of somewhere both exotic and cosmopolitan. \u201cEast of here,\u201d I said, mimicking Francine\u2019s head tilt. \u201cLas Vegas,\u201d my mouth supplied before my brain could say what?</p><p>I wanted to wince, sink into the ground, walk away, and make these people forget they\u2019d ever met me. The entire crowd had stopped talking. For the first time, I noticed everyone surrounding us, staring at me.</p><p>I struggled to think of something both vapid and agreeable that would satisfy these trophy wives and their husbands. \u201cI moved to Las Vegas to better myself. You know, to meet guys.\u201d</p><p>Lucien groaned under his breath.</p><p>Oh, the poor vampire was suffering? Well, he could help me out here.</p><p>I\u2019d been judged quite enough for one evening.</p><p>The air felt heavy as the wall of shifters closed us in. I wanted to bolt. I didn\u2019t like crowds, or attention, not to mention being hemmed in on all sides. But I stood my ground. I was a wolf on a mission, even if that meant I was alone in a crowd, teetering on shoes no woman should be forced to wear, holding a purse that could fit a gumdrop.</p><p>He\u2019d asked for inane. What else did he expect from a werewolf who\u2019d just had half of her eyebrows yanked out of her head?</p><p>He gripped me. Tight. \u201cNow Mitzy, that\u2019s not exactly how we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I asked, heart speeding up. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell the story?\u201d Or why didn\u2019t he just let me out of here?</p><p>This was going bad in a hurry. Every second I spent around these people was making it worse.</p><p>It didn\u2019t even make sense to talk to the Predators tonight. I needed to question these werewives individually, not in the middle of a game of This Is Your (Undead) Life.</p><p>I was about two seconds away from telling this vulture where she could go.</p><p>Deep breaths.</p><p>She twirled her necklace on one finger, daring me.</p><p>That was it. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take your Blvgari\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucien hoisted me by one arm. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd shove it up your ass.\u201d The vampire oofed as my stiletto met his knee. \u201cAnd you\u2014\u201d I spun toward Lucien the grabby. \u201cDo you want me to tackle you?\u201d</p><p>Boy, he looked pissed. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I can take her.\u201d The vulture would never screw with me again.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d He grabbed me around the waist.</p><p>\u201cLet me down, you cretin!\u201d I seethed, as he carried me like a sack of rice away from the welcoming committee.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Lucien opened the four paneled door with a snarl. \u201cAfter you, dear,\u201d he said, dumping me into our new home.</p><p>\u201cBite me, bloodsucker.\u201d</p><p>A wave of cold air slapped me upside the head. The foyer was the size of my entire apartment back home. And I could barely believe it, but there was actual furniture inside the door\u2014a couch and a chair, a statue of a woman with half her clothes falling off, and a large potted palm.</p><p>He slammed the door behind us. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>As if he didn\u2019t know. I scrambled to my feet. \u201cI thought I was being vapid,\u201d I said sweetly.</p><p>\u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty?\u201d</p><p>His eyes raked over me from head to bare toes. \u201cYou are something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vulture provoked me.\u201d He\u2019d seen it.</p><p>Lucien towered over me, glowering. His dress shirt was disheveled, a vein pulsed at his neck, and a lock of blond hair had fallen straight over his left eye. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. She doesn\u2019t matter. You can\u2019t let her get you riled up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, believe me, you haven\u2019t even seen riled.\u201d I stood up to him. Eye to chest. \u201cWhen I can approach her on my terms,\u201d on an even playing field, \u201cher ass is mine. I\u2019ll learn the truth.\u201d He\u2019d seen me in an interrogation room. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see that you have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cStop it. I don\u2019t speak French.\u201d</p><p>I kicked off my shoes. This was going to be a long three days. Still, I had to keep my wits about me. I didn\u2019t want to let my pack down.</p><p>Next came the knives. I stacked them on the hall table. I didn\u2019t choose to be different. I stripped off my panty hose and tossed them over the potted palm.</p><p>The whole situation felt so suffocatingly wrong.</p><p>I shucked off my yellow baby doll dress and hooked my thumbs under the top of my bra and girdle combination. The cool air hit my overheated skin as I peeled the garment away. I whimpered in relief as it dropped to my feet. Heaven.</p><p>I used my toe to flick it away.</p><p>In a few seconds I\u2019d be blissfully free. I stopped when I caught sight of my partner.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I demanded. He had a funny look on his face. Like he\u2019d swallowed a bug. \u201cLay it on me. What else did I do wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he choked.</p><p>So much for honesty. How long had that lasted\u2014five minutes?</p><p>He cleared his throat, his gaze positively feral.</p><p>Holy heck. Was he going to sink his fangs into me?</p><p>My pulse quickened and I took a careful step toward the door. \u201cThere\u2019d better be some law against biting your partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not bite you,\u201d he said, his voice rough.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you looking at me like I\u2019m the main course?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA thousand pardons,\u201d he said, breathy. He\u2019d even taken on a slight Spanish accent. \u201cYour decision to disrobe was most unexpected.\u201d</p><p>What did the guy want? I\u2019d kept my red thong. God, I couldn\u2019t wait to get back to the pack where I could run around naked in peace.</p><p>I planted my hands on my hips. \u201cDo you really want me to put that crap back on again?\u201d</p> <p>The front door burst open and I lunged for my knives. I had them at the intruder\u2019s neck before he\u2019d taken two steps inside.</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Whoa!\u201d He gurgled. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Vinny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>This guy looked like a waiter or something. Then I smelled him. \u201cHey, it is Vinny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you\u2019re still holding a knife to his throat,\u201d Lucien pointed out.</p> <p>Vinny\u2019s eyes flicked down to my breasts, which were smashed up against his chest. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t mind so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPervert.\u201d I let him go. What was it with non-weres and nudity?</p><p>Lucien flung off his tie and unbuttoned his crisp white dress shirt, his fingers impatient. Just when I thought he\u2019d seen the light, he shoved his shirt at me. \u201cPut this on.\u201d</p><p>As far as chests went, he had a nice one. Smooth and firm. Ripped without looking like he tried.</p><p>I took the shirt. \u201cSo you can relax, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not relaxed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh fine.\u201d I slipped the cotton monstrosity over my shoulders.</p><p>Vinny shook his head. \u201cI gotta tell you, \u2018Mitzy\u2019 sure stirred things up out there.\u201d</p><p>The back of my neck prickled. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiters hear all. They\u2019re wondering if Mr. Duke here has a Las Vegas hooker fetish.\u201d</p><p>Lucien groaned.</p><p>\u201cCome on, gorgeous. Blue eye shadow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like blue,\u201d I protested.</p><p>Lucien sighed. \u201cVinny, maybe you can give her some pointers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you kidding? I\u2019d make it worse. I even liked her shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was wrong with my shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d Lucien pulled out his phone. \u201cWe need some more backup.\u201d</p><p>Another creature in the mix? \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d I said to Vinny.</p><p>He threw the bolt on the door. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like what happened out there, either.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest as Lucien left a message for someone named Tia.</p><p>Wait. \u201cNot the Tia?\u201d Otherwise known as a Predator?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trustworthy,\u201d he said, slipping his phone back into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d I bristled. \u201cWhen were you even going to tell me you knew her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>Well, la-dee-dah. \u201cAnything else you\u2019d like to share?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cThis is how I work,\u201d he said, closing the distance between us. \u201cI\u2019m an investigator. I have a network. I have contacts. I focus on the facts, the details, the minutiae others miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re the Sherlock Holmes of the undead. I want you to level with me. How do you know Tia?\u201d</p><p>He backed off. \u201cI\u2019ve known her husband for nearly a century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Were you drinking buddies?\u201d</p><p>He ignored me. \u201cHis pharmacy was on my beat. Many years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh goody.\u201d I broke away to inspect the first floor, giving in to the urge to roam.</p><p>Naturally Lucien followed. The man needed a lesson on werewolves.</p><p>Of course, I could also use a guide to all things posh and annoying. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me about Tia the Predator?\u201d I didn\u2019t need my powers to know he was holding back. He\u2019d held himself wrong. Everyone did it when they lied. One shoulder down, spine bent slightly crooked. I\u2019d learned to recognize the signs.</p><p>\u201cShe lives on this block. On Mysteria Lane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTia is\u201d\u2014he paused, searching for the words\u2014\u201cshe\u2019s a survivor. And she\u2019s trustworthy,\u201d he insisted. I could tell he believed it.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d My day couldn\u2019t get any worse. Might as well partner with a predatory werewife. I\u2019d mojo her with my truth powers and see for myself whether I should trust her\u2014or truss her up in the basement.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d What you see is what you get.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why he was so surprised.</p><p>Lucien trailed behind me as I began to inspect our headquarters. It was a security nightmare\u2014windows everywhere. There was a door leading out to a sunroom, a door to the garage, a door out the back of the kitchen. We\u2019d have to invest in some good locks. I didn\u2019t look forward to sleeping here without them.</p><p>\u201cSo have you spent a lot of time on Mysteria Lane?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d he said behind me. \u201cI try to avoid eternal life-digging weres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would cramp the bloodsucking playboy routine a bit, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked, moving on to the sunken living room.</p><p>He shrugged, not bothering to deny it.</p><p>Why would a vampire even get married?</p><p>Mmm ... I wriggled my toes. The thick plush carpeting felt amazing.</p><p>He stopped at the edge of the sunken living room. Everything was done up in shades of white\u2014the couch, the woven rugs, even the mantel decorations.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we tell the vulture the next time?\u201d I asked, inspecting a white pointy piece of marble. \u201cWhy did you marry me?\u201d It was an element of our story we hadn\u2019t worked out.</p><p>\u201cIt was love at first sight,\u201d he said tartly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p><p>I laughed out loud. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to buy that.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure which was funnier\u2014this broody vamp falling in love or me being the object of anybody\u2019s affections.</p><p>I tried a light switch and the fireplace roared to life. Sweet.</p><p>\u201cNo offense,\u201d I said, \u201cbut you don\u2019t impress me as the lovey-dovey type.\u201d In fact, he had the brooding down pat.</p><p>\u201cI can be affectionate,\u201d he said, in that pounce-y way of his.</p><p>Oh no. \u201cWhen was the last time you ate?\u201d I fought the urge to run, feeling his shirt swirl along my thighs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little personal,\u201d he said, his eyes roaming my body.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t. But what he wanted to do to me sure was. \u201cI don\u2019t care how sexy you are. I\u2019m not dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou implied.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a heated look. \u201cI can\u2019t help what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? A ravenous vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Male.\u201d</p><p>I felt my cheeks flush. \u201cLet\u2019s get one thing straight, buddy. We are a pretend married couple. Fake!\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cYes, but we might as well enjoy our roles.\u201d</p><p>He had to be kidding. \u201cWhat is that? Part of your method of deduction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, quit it. I\u2019m off-limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity,\u201d he said, as if he meant it.</p><p>For a moment, I felt like more than a meal. It was as if he noticed me. He wanted me.</p><p>But it was impossible. I\u2019d always be on the outside. I\u2019d learned that back with my pack.</p><p>\u201cYou said all weres were eternal life-diggers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of warmth caught my stomach. \u201cThen what exactly are you asking?\u201d</p><p>A long beat passed between us.</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d I rushed to say something\u2014anything\u2014before he did. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want me anyway. He couldn\u2019t.</p><p>I retreated through the kitchen, my bare feet slapping against the chilly ceramic floor. \u201cWhere\u2019s the luggage? I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>I could hear his easy strides behind me. \u201cClothing and personal items were delivered to our bedroom this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Our bedroom? I halted at the foot of the stairs. \u201cListen, fang breath, I sleep alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShocking.\u201d He trailed me up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it, though?\u201d</p><p>We arrived at a master bedroom suite, large enough to house a family of eight. It was done up in gold and burgundy, with antique furniture and ornate lamps scattering warm yellow light.</p><p>\u201cThat is the biggest bed I\u2019ve seen in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t even notice I\u2019m there,\u201d he said behind me.</p><p>\u201cOf course not because you\u2019re sleeping in there.\u201d I turned and pointed to a well-appointed room across the hall.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even bother to look. \u201cVinny is sleeping across the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take one of the other five bedrooms.\u201d I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>It was a shame, though. I was used to being both respected and shunned by the pack. Nobody had ever wanted me. Now the one man who might, also happened to want to eat me.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t win.</p><p>Lucien braced his hands on the door frame, filling it completely, and I had the horrible sensation of wanting to close the distance between us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gave a sexy smile, as if he knew. \u201cWe need to feel comfortable around each other if we\u2019re going to maintain our charade.\u201d</p><p>Luckily I was not vapid or stupid, even if Lucien would prefer it. \u201cKissing you was not in the contract.\u201d</p><p>He moved his mouth dangerously close to mine. I felt strangely vulnerable as he brushed his fingers along the edge of my jaw. His thumb found the curve of my chin. \u201cYou could use a good kiss.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t doubt that. But I didn\u2019t need it from him.</p><p>He broke the contact and I nearly slithered to the ground with relief. If he\u2019d tried to kiss me at that very moment, I wasn\u2019t sure what I would have done.</p><p>He brushed past me, toward the bed, which gave me time to press my legs together tightly and try to forget I\u2019d ever met a vampire named Lucien.</p><p>He stretched out over the bloodred bedcovers, his back against the antique headboard. God, he was a solid piece of man. And I\u2019d seen a lot of well-built weres.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t let Lucien get to me. \u201cWhat do you really want?\u201d I demanded. But I was already in trouble. I\u2019d never been so aware of my body\u2014or tempted to learn the god-awful truth.</p> <p>Darned if the vampire didn\u2019t know what I was thinking. \u201cYou\u2019re not about to use your power on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you tilting your chin down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy chin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in the crypt, you lowered your chin a fraction right before you began the interrogation.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. I\u2019d never been aware I did that. I tried to imagine interrogating someone and realized he was right.</p> <p>Lucien went cold. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever interrogate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d I said. \u201cIs there?\u201d I ignored his scowl. \u201cIt might not even work on your kind.\u201d Although I believed it would.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll question the vamps. You question the wives.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>I had a feeling I was going to be doing the heavy lifting.</p><p>His phone beeped. Lucien eased it out from his back pocket and checked the screen. \u201cAfter you speak with Tia, I think you should question the vulture. She seems a likely suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. Where will you be tomorrow?\u201d He certainly couldn\u2019t sleep in the bedroom. It had three bay windows.</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t give anything away. \u201cThe Vampire Council has made certain provisions for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t tell me what or where?\u201d</p><p>His pointed look said it all.</p><p>\u201cWay to go, partner.\u201d I should have known. \u201cYou\u2019ll hop into bed with me just so long as I don\u2019t know where you sleep.\u201d</p><p>He patted the mattress next to him. \u201cMust you make things difficult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, refusing to sleep with you will make things a lot simpler. And while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s lay down some ground rules. Number one: no bed sharing.\u201d</p><p>Lucien scowled.</p><p>\u201cNumber two: no kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s beside the point,\u201d I snapped, reddening when I realized what I\u2019d said. \u201cNumber three,\u201d I said a little louder, ignoring his smug expression. \u201cNo bloodsucking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are not very good rules.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask for his approval, just as he hadn\u2019t asked for mine. \u201cThey\u2019re my rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have one more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLay it on me.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a long look. \u201cNever use your truth powers on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d I asked just to tick him off.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to take the bait. \u201cAgreed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d I said, slipping out of the room.</p><p>This was going to be a long three days.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>I smelled Vinny before I heard him. \u201cWake up, cupcake.\u201d He still had that odd mix of old wood and grass going for him. Only now, he had the body of a French maid from the Playboy Mansion.</p><p>\u201cYou like?\u201d he asked, as I stared at the boobs practically popping out from under the lacy front of the dress. His voice was as gravelly as ever, only now he had cover model features, big doe eyes, and legs that wouldn\u2019t quit. \u201cI\u2019m your housekeeper, Helga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe garters are a bit much,\u201d I remarked, climbing out of bed.</p><p>\u201cRight-o. This coming from the fashion queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you start.\u201d</p><p>He leaned up against the edge of the dresser. \u201cLucien has it so you\u2019re gonna go over to that gal Tia\u2019s house. Nine o\u2019clock sharp.\u201d</p><p>I checked the bedside clock. \u201cOkay. I have a half hour.\u201d Plenty of time.</p><p>\u201cI paid her a visit last night.\u201d</p><p>No wonder Lucien never went anywhere without Vinny. He was handy to have around. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d I said, \u201cpizza delivery guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He scratched at his ear. \u201cThese women don\u2019t eat. Besides, I had to get on the inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStranded motorist?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cShe has a thing for hurt bunnies.\u201d</p><p>Somehow I couldn\u2019t picture Vinny as a fuzzy bunny.</p><p>\u201cAnyhow, I checked her out good. She don\u2019t seem to be working for anybody else. You might want to do your woo-woo thing\u201d\u2014he twirled a finger on the side of his head\u2014\u201cjust in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. I fully intended to use everything I could on her\u2014and the rest of the werewives.</p><p>A half hour later, I rang the doorbell at 12 Mysteria Lane. Tia Lovelace lived in a pink two-story flanked by climbing white roses and a generous front porch.</p><p>I was wearing a lovely orange pantsuit, perfect for concealing weapons. The pockets were big enough for my stun gun, I had my fixed-blade daggers tucked in the back and two pairs of handcuffs\u2014one in each bra cup.</p><p>A dazzling auburn-haired were opened the door. She had the same pouty lips and impeccable skin as the rest, yet she seemed a little fresher than the others, more real.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Heather,\u201d she said, treating me to an uneven smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Mitzy to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to say hi last night,\u201d she said shyly.</p><p>No kidding. \u201cLucien said you could help.\u201d I didn\u2019t need to elaborate. We both knew.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she said, standing behind the door while she opened it, as if she could disappear.</p><p>\u201cNice spread,\u201d I said, if you liked peach and white. She led me into the most un-vampirish living room in the universe. It was sleek and clean. In fact, it would be very hard to hide a weapon in this place.</p><p>Still, as soon as my butt hit the couch, I leaned forward and drew my power up into my chest. \u201cTia,\u201d I said as I felt it move through me, \u201cwhy are you helping me?\u201d</p><p>My head throbbed and my ears began to buzz. Her glossed lips parted and I could feel the taut pull of my powers, binding her to me.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen yourself in the mirror?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat vulture is going to tear you apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I had a few problems last night,\u201d I admitted. We\u2019d work on that later. I needed to know her connection to Lucien.</p><p>Tia furrowed her brow. \u201cA few problems? Red stilettos with a yellow peasant dress?\u201d</p><p>Oh come on. \u201cRed shoes are sassy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked like an eighth-grade hooker.\u201d</p><p>My temples ached. \u201cTell me what you really think,\u201d I said, resenting my power for the first time.</p><p>But Tia was on a roll. \u201cFrancine is openly asking why a status-seeking vampire would marry you. It\u2019s only a matter of time before you\u2019re discovered.\u201d</p><p>I focused on her, ignoring the pounding behind my eyes. \u201cWhy are you helping us?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cI started this. I led the council to Marcos the gardener.\u201d</p><p>I sat back. Well, that was news.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked slowly.</p><p>\u201cSunny was my friend. She had her faults, but she was a good person.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI knew I could go to Detective Mead.\u201d She crossed her long legs. \u201cMy husband trusts him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he going to be able to work with Lucien as well?\u201d It would be nice for Lucien to have an ally among the vampires.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tia chewed at her lip. \u201cMy husband is asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s daytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d\u2014she wrung her hands\u2014\u201cThomas has been asleep for the last six years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the ground?\u201d I\u2019d heard of vampires who did that.</p><p>\u201cHere at home,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s very tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>Tia gave a small smile. \u201cThomas would approve of my going to Lucien. He\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I was the one asking the questions, and fighting a massive headache. It still didn\u2019t explain why she\u2019d called someone like Lucien in. \u201cDo you know anyone who wanted to hurt Sunny?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she have any enemies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Damn. I couldn\u2019t hold on much longer.</p><p>\u201cHow well did you know her again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe saw them often. Sunny\u2019s husband, Gaston, is business partners with my Thomas.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at a series of framed photographs crowding the top of a white baby grand piano. \u201cSunny was part of Francine\u2019s circle. There were four of them. Now there are three.\u201d</p><p>I tried to examine the photographs, but couldn\u2019t without breaking contact with Tia. So instead, I asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you part of the group?\u201d</p> <p>She folded her hands in her lap. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you not know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the omega.\u201d</p><p>I sat back and tried not to imagine what kind of hell it was to be Tia. Omegas were the lowest of the low. They were the ones who ate last, groveled most, and acted as the general whipping boys, and girls. And that was in what shifter society considered a normal functioning pack. I couldn\u2019t imagine what it would be like to be an omega under a vulture like Francine.</p><p>Even though my head was pounding, I held the connection. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be the omega.\u201d Or anywhere near Francine. \u201cYou can break out of this.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHave you ever tried to break rank in a pack?\u201d</p> <p>I rubbed at my temples, willing the pain away. I had and I\u2019d failed. I broke contact. She was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Tia,\u201d I said, meaning every word. \u201cI know you can help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She brought a trembling hand to her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I feel a little dizzy.\u201d</p><p>Join the club. I rooted around in my teeny yellow purse for Advil. My fingers clutched the small bottle and I stopped. \u201cYou know, Tia. I\u2019d like to help you, too.\u201d</p><p>She flashed an indulgent smile. \u201cFirst things first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d I popped two Advil.</p><p>She went to the kitchen and returned with a glass of mineral water. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, handing it to me.</p><p>Well, that was nice.</p> <p>\u201cHeather,\u201d she began, \u201cI think perhaps you may want to look at new eye makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just bought some.\u201d Too bad I didn\u2019t have it with me. I tossed my purse onto the ground. It would never fit. \u201cI have a whole kit full of sparkly blue and red and yellow... .\u201d Her eyes widened as I ticked them off, one by one. \u201cWhat? No good?\u201d</p><p>She faltered for a moment, deciding what to say. I already missed the truthful Tia, but frankly, my head couldn\u2019t take any more. \u201cYou may want to consider a more subtle color palette.\u201d</p><p>I looked around her living room. \u201cWhat? Like white?\u201d</p><p>She almost cringed. I could tell she wanted to. Good. Maybe I could bring this girl out of her shell. \u201cLook, why don\u2019t you show me? We\u2019ll take a field trip.\u201d</p><p>Tia broke out into a shy smile. \u201cYes.\u201d She lowered her eyes. \u201cIf you really want to go with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a car?\u201d I asked, because I didn\u2019t. Well, unless I wanted to share this part of the journey with Vinny the chauffeur/ bunny /cross-dressing housekeeper.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Tia said, reaching for an immense pink bag that could have easily fit a bowling ball or three.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s in style?\u201d I asked, imagining all the weapons I could stuff into that puppy.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is the new Christian Louboutin Sylvia Large Softy Calf Hobo bag.\u201d A flicker of doubt crossed her delicate features before she pressed ahead. \u201cSee how it matches my yellow and black round-toe T-strap shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I honestly didn\u2019t.</p><p>Confidence crept into her tone. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen lead the way, Kemo Sabe,\u201d I said, whisking her to the door, Finnegan\u2019s American Express card burning a hole in my pocket, \u201cI can be the Eliza Doolittle to your Henry Higgins.\u201d</p><p>She opened the passenger door of her white Mercedes convertible before she rushed around to open her own. \u201cIf you want, I could even coordinate some outfits for you.\u201d</p><p>I popped two more Advil as I slid into the car. \u201cYou could match them for me and tell me what to wear: outfits A, B, C... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need that much help,\u201d Tia protested, settling in next to me.</p><p>\u201cStop lying,\u201d I told her, slamming my own door shut. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that with me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>I stood alone in my room late that afternoon and made two twirls in front of the mirror. And then\u2014just because I had the momentum going\u2014I made a third spin.</p><p>Unbelievable. Tia\u2019s stylist had tamed my out-of-control hair into sleek copper layers. I ran it through my fingers. The kicker was I could still tie it away from my face. Only now I didn\u2019t need to.</p><p>Tia showed me how to wear makeup without looking like I was wearing makeup. You\u2019d think that would defeat the point, but I stopped debating her on it after she almost jammed a mascara wand up my nose.</p><p>Tia was easily flustered.</p><p>I rubbed my lips together, tasting a hint of cherry gloss. I looked like me, only better.</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d forced me into white pants, which are a really bad idea if you want to wrestle a murderer to the ground. And don\u2019t even get me started on the flimsy emerald top. Tia said it matched my eyes. I wasn\u2019t sure why that was important, but I figured she knew style just like I knew how to slap a pair of handcuffs on a drunken werepoodle.</p><p>Speaking of cuffs, I had both pairs in my what-cha-ma-call-it Softy Calf Hobo bag. The silly purse cost more than a case of those fancy cigars Finnegan liked to smoke, but I figured he owed it to me for making me wear mascara.</p><p>Tonight would be my big chance. The vulture herself was throwing a luau, complete with a roasted hog, in honor of me and Lucien. Of course, if Francine had her way, I\u2019d be the one tied to the spit.</p><p>Let her try. The deep pockets allowed enough room for my mace. I\u2019d sliced a stun gun holder into the lining of my fancy new purse. The cut of the pants was generous enough for my two fixed-blade daggers, and I had my lucky boot knife in my bra.</p><p>Gorgeous.</p><p>The silk against my skin made me feel almost naked. Sleek. I placed my hands on my hips and studied the image in the mirror. I looked like I could pull this off.</p><p>Tia had even suggested a bottle of the vulture\u2019s favorite French perfume as a hostess gift. The contents of the tiny gold bottle smelled like half-dead rabbit. I had to admit it wasn\u2019t bad.</p><p>My heels caught every crack in the sidewalk as I hobbled over to Francine\u2019s hacienda-style home. The scent of roast pig lingered in the air, and I could hear voices and laughter coming from the back of the house. A plant-filled courtyard dominated her front lawn, featuring terra-cotta birdbaths, lush floral arrangements, and tasteful sitting areas. I took the stone path through the garden and straight to the looming stucco house, painted in burnt orange. Before I could even knock on the heavy wood door, it opened.</p><p>\u201cHola, missus,\u201d a uniformed housekeeper in her midfifties answered. She led me though the foyer and into a boldly decorated room that led to I didn\u2019t even want to know how many more. This place could have fit half our pack.</p><p>A bank of glass at the back of the house opened out to a patio.</p><p>\u201cMitzy!\u201d a voice called from the kitchen as we passed.</p><p>I stopped short as an impossibly skinny woman with a broad-brimmed hat poured herself a glass of white wine laced with fruit. She had a helmet of straight black hair that ended stylishly at her prominent collarbone.</p><p>\u201cCare for some dinner?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I asked, not sure what to make of her.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She jiggled the pitcher.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll wait,\u201d I said. I wasn\u2019t really into drinking, especially now, when I needed to keep my wits.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d she said, leaving the pitcher behind for the maid. \u201cI\u2019m Nina, by the way.\u201d</p><p>One of the Predators.</p><p>And a wereleopard from the way she smelled. She was impossibly bony, yet sleek, and she moved with a fluid grace.</p><p>\u201cTia told me about your little shopping trip,\u201d she said, a conspiratorial smile tipping her lips.</p><p>It was then I noticed she was wearing a silver bikini under an elaborate white silk wrap.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not real silver,\u201d she said, as if that\u2019s why I was staring.</p><p>A ribbon of dread wound its way through me. \u201cThis is a pool party,\u201d I said, stating the obvious.</p><p>And I was in pants.</p><p>I could have sworn I knew how these things worked. I\u2019d watched Dynasty. Alexis Carrington and her pack wore skimpy gowns and jewels to outdoor parties. They even had shoulder pads. I was not overdressed for a society party. I couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Nina said, as if she could read my mind. \u201cNobody swims anyway.\u201d</p><p>I was just about to think of a way to escape when one of the glass doors at the back of the house slid open. \u201cNina!\u201d Francine breezed in wearing a getup that reminded me more of a 1940s pinup outfit than swimwear. \u201cStop drinking your dinner and get your ass out here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need to fortify myself before Samuel arrives,\u201d she said, fishing out a cherry and biting it.</p><p>\u201cYou knew he was a Puritan when you married him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I thought in four hundred years, he would have grown out of it.\u201d Nina glanced at me. \u201cHe\u2019s going through a relapse. You know how it is.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, not even wanting to think about how these women could marry vampires.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d Francine asked, walking a slow circle around me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t swim,\u201d I said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>My fingers squeezed the crinkly wrapping of my hostess gift as I endured her scrutiny. At that moment, I wished I\u2019d been holding my lucky boot knife, and it took everything I had not to reach down in my bra and pull it out.</p> <p>At least then I\u2019d feel capable of defending myself.</p><p>Nina breezed past. \u201cLet\u2019s get out to the party.\u201d</p><p>The entire patio was filled with women in swimsuits and wraps that were never designed to touch water. In fact, I\u2019d be willing to bet that everything out here was dry-clean only. They clustered around mosaic tables and on padded chaise lounges. A band had set up in the back, playing island-themed music.</p><p>My skin crawled with the need to escape. It wasn\u2019t only the fact that a twelve-foot wall surrounded the entire pool area, it was the keen knowledge that I did not belong here\u2014even if I was a guest of honor.</p><p>Ha.</p><p>More like the main course.</p> <p>Okay, well, the sooner I questioned Francine, the faster I could make my escape. I knew she was involved in Sunny\u2019s murder the same way I knew she\u2019d taped her boobs into that gravity-defying pinup swimsuit.</p><p>\u201cFrancine,\u201d I said, as she attempted to glide toward a cluster of polished women. \u201cI have a gift for you.\u201d I dangled Tia\u2019s perfectly wrapped bottle of eau de dead chipmunk.</p><p>The vulture assessed me. \u201cNot now, werewolf.\u201d</p><p>I gripped her on the arm, knowing her kind didn\u2019t like touch. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were dark with fury as she attempted to shake me off.</p><p>I held on tighter. \u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t make a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsk! You think I care if you make a scene? Hell. It would be the highlight. They\u2019d be talking about my party for the next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know why Lucien married me?\u201d I asked, tempting her with information.</p> <p>\u201cSure thing, hon. I\u2019m dying to know what you had on him,\u201d she said, shrugging out of my grip, while at the same time smiling to a group of guests. \u201cOver here.\u201d</p><p>She led me to the edge of the pool area, where plants spilled from terra-cotta pots and part of the stone wall gave way to a rocky waterfall.</p><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s get one thing straight,\u201d she began, as I locked eyes with her and released a surge of power from low in my chest.</p><p>She made me jumpy, nervous. I channeled that anxiety and more as I flung my power out at her.</p><p>Shadows fell over her face as she backed farther into the palms, wet with water.</p><p>That\u2019s it. Back away. Run. There\u2019s nowhere to hide.</p><p>My head buzzed with energy and a dry tightness seized the back of my throat. My mind locked with hers. As soon as I felt the connection, I asked, \u201cDid you kill Sunny McCarty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d she said a second before my power whipped back and smacked me between the eyes.</p><p>\u201cSon of a\u2014\u201d I stamped one well-heeled foot on the pavement so hard I was sure I heard a crack.</p><p>I knew better than to jump too far, too fast. I\u2019d let her get to me. I so wanted this to be over.</p><p>Francine cringed like I\u2019d raked my nails over a chalkboard.</p><p>Join the club. My head was ringing, too. The goal was to slip into someone\u2019s mind, not zap her with a thousand volts.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start over,\u201d I croaked, trying to act as if my skull wasn\u2019t ringing.</p><p>This time, I eased into her mind. I let the power connect naturally. We\u2019d start with simpler questions.</p><p>Francine\u2019s fingers shook as she checked her diamond earrings and smoothed her hair behind her ears.</p><p>I could feel the magnetic pull of the connection as I drew closer to her.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you such a bitch?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cBecause I can be.\u201d</p><p>Of course. I\u2019d forgotten how straightforward it was for bullies like her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t belong here.\u201d She fixed on me then, as if she could see straight into me. \u201cI don\u2019t think you belong anywhere.\u201d</p><p>The truth stung.</p><p>\u201cTell me a secret about Sunny.\u201d</p><p>She considered the question. \u201cNina hated her.\u201d</p><p>That surprised me. \u201cNina?\u201d Sure, I\u2019d only known her for about two minutes, but she didn\u2019t seem like the hateful type. Or maybe she was just drunk.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I prodded.</p><p>\u201cSunny was blackmailing her.\u201d</p><p>Some friend.</p><p>Francine stared out past me, toward her party. \u201cYou\u2019d think Bliss would have been the blackmailer. She\u2019s had money problems ever since her dead husband left his money to the dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I hadn\u2019t met Bliss yet.</p><p>Francine glanced at me. \u201cAnd by dog I don\u2019t mean someone like you. He left their fortune to Chi-Chi the Chihuahua.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Bliss.\u201d I didn\u2019t even know her and I felt sorry for her.</p><p>Francine shrugged. \u201cShe gets by.\u201d</p><p>And, if I was reading between the lines right, it also meant Bliss would never eclipse Francine, which seemed to be a requirement for being a Predator.</p><p>\u201cIntroduce me to Bliss,\u201d I said, scanning the designer crowd, as if I could somehow pick her out.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ve been dying to show her what a train wreck you are,\u201d Francine said, making me instantly regret my truth powers.</p><p>My head throbbed, the pain moving down my neck and into my shoulders and back as I pushed deeper into Francine\u2019s mind.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need the vulture\u2019s approval. At least she didn\u2019t know I was investigating.</p><p>She smirked down at me and I braced myself. Hopefully my initial questions had gotten me into her head enough, because I needed to know. \u201cDid you kill Sunny McCarty?\u201d</p><p>Francine tossed a lock of gleaming hair over her shoulder. \u201cA massive Gothic chandelier killed Sunny.\u201d</p><p>She was resisting. It seemed she\u2019d dish out anyone else\u2019s dirt, but there were barriers up when I aimed directly at her.</p><p>I regrouped and hit her again. \u201cWere you behind the falling chandelier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be impossible.\u201d She pursed her lips. \u201cThe chandelier fell from the ceiling.\u201d</p><p>Just shoot me now. I was running out of juice and she was playing semantics.</p><p>My head pounded. Dang. Most of my subjects would at least elaborate a little. Francine was going to torture me for every sliver she gave me. \u201cDid you rip down the chandelier?\u201d I pressed.</p><p>\u201cAccording to the rumor mill, the chandelier was cut,\u201d she said, her voice breathy with meaning, or perhaps the strain of avoiding my questions. \u201cI\u2019d say it was a planned job. You cut all but one wire and then ... Snip, snap.\u201d</p><p>Oh geez. My temples rang and the patio began to spin.</p><p>\u201cDid you have anything to do with Sunny\u2019s death?\u201d I shrieked.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Finally. I wanted to curl up and sleep on the patio. \u201cThen why?\u201d Why had she made this so difficult? \u201cAre you holding anything back?\u201d</p><p>She leveled a predatory smile. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I grimaced. I couldn\u2019t hold the link any longer. I let her go and with a crack, I felt our connection break.</p><p>My power shot back into me like a rubber band snapping. \u201cOw.\u201d I clutched my head and fought a wave of nausea.</p><p>I was going to have a massive hangover from this one.</p><p>Francine felt it, too. She stared at me, rubbing at the spot above her ear. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she asked, the words coming slowly.</p><p>She squared her shoulders, regaining her trademark control. \u201cNever mind.\u201d She brushed past me and back to her party.</p><p>I could barely walk straight as I made my way through the partygoers, who were at this point almost giddy with anticipation. The vampires would be arriving soon. I could tell we had some werewife hopefuls in the house tonight.</p><p>Run, I wanted to tell them. Run and never look back.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d I nearly ran into her.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, girl,\u201d she said, steadying me. \u201cI see you had some of the sangria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Bliss,\u201d I said.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how I was going to question her. The pain in my head was growing worse and worse. I\u2019d pushed myself too hard back there with Francine. But I couldn\u2019t help it. The woman\u2019s mind was a brick wall.</p><p>\u201cBliss had to cancel,\u201d Nina said. \u201cOh yeah\u2014excuse you,\u201d she added sarcastically as a bimbo nearly trampled her on the way to go see a vampire.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Bliss cancel?\u201d I asked. \u201cI really wanted to meet her.\u201d And her little dog, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nina shrugged. \u201cWhy does Bliss do anything?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d like to find out.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I needed to talk to Nina, too. My brain felt like cotton.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you cringing?\u201d Nina asked, as I prepared to draw my powers out once again.</p><p>My head felt like it was going to split in half. I rubbed at my temples as I used all of my strength to draw a line between us.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she said, bringing the fruity wine to her lips. \u201cThat tickles.\u201d</p><p>At least her mind was open. It felt like walking through a soap bubble.</p><p>Even so, I knew I wouldn\u2019t last long. I hadn\u2019t even found a private place to question her. \u201cFrancine said Sunny was blackmailing you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. She was taking me for five thousand dollars a month.\u201d</p><p>No way would I get deep enough to ask if she was the killer. I was surprised I\u2019d gotten into her mind in the first place.</p><p>\u201cWhy was Sunny blackmailing you?\u201d</p><p>Nina took a sip of wine, holding her glass to the side with two fingers. \u201cShe caught me giving my personal chef a bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the dining room table.\u201d</p> <p>My brain was fuzzy, yet another side effect. \u201cWell, he is a chef.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t eating, babe.\u201d</p><p>Oy. I didn\u2019t need that mental picture.</p><p>She noticed my discomfort and answered it with a sultry smile. \u201cOh, don\u2019t be a prude. My husband doesn\u2019t eat. I don\u2019t eat. Our personal chef has to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shoot me now.\u201d These people were all nuts.</p><p>She tilted her head and studied me. \u201cNo. If I was going to kill you, I\u2019d maul you.\u201d She grinned. \u201cOr just smack you with a chandelier, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I demanded. But it was no use. The connection fizzled out. I had nothing left. Nina didn\u2019t even notice.</p><p>She bent closer. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d She shook her wine goblet, the half-melted ice at the bottom sloshing from side to side. \u201cYou\u2019d better lay off the hooch.\u201d</p> <p>I stumbled backward. I\u2019d never questioned two people in one night and now I knew why. There wouldn\u2019t be a third, that much was certain.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go,\u201d I said to no one in particular as I made my way back toward the house. The cool slap of air-conditioning hit me as I slid the glass door open. It felt good in a way, like laying my head on the cool porcelain of a toilet seat after I got sick questioning that Harley-riding witch back in Las Vegas.</p><p>She\u2019d been a stubborn cuss.</p><p>But at least the biker witch wasn\u2019t evil. I had a feeling there was more to Sunny\u2019s murder than one desperate werewife gone off the deep end.</p><p>Francine and her dodgy answers.</p><p>Nina and her talk about chandeliers.</p><p>A large hand closed around my shoulder and I shouted.</p><p>\u201cHeather,\u201d he hissed in my ear.</p><p>\u201cLucien.\u201d I about fell over with relief.</p><p>He wore no shirt, which was a total waste because at that moment I knew I wasn\u2019t fully appreciating his fine vampire self. I also liked the concern I saw in his eyes. Sue me. It felt kind of good that someone cared whether or not I passed out next to the fake tiki hut.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d I murmured as he wrapped his arms around me. \u201cI\u2019m wiped.\u201d</p><p>Wait. I thought about resisting as he pulled me close against his chest, but then again\u2014I wasn\u2019t crazy.</p><p>I supposed I should have been trying to keep my distance from him, but at that moment, I didn\u2019t give a rip.</p><p>My cheek rested against Lucien\u2019s chest and something warm pooled inside me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get you out of here,\u201d he said as he drew away and helped me down the hall.</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask me any questions. He didn\u2019t push me. He just walked with me. And as soon as we\u2019d cleared the threshold of Francine\u2019s house, he picked me up and carried me home.</p><p>\u201cI can stand,\u201d I insisted as Lucien kicked our front door closed.</p><p>\u201cLeave it to me,\u201d he said, as we headed for the stairs.</p><p>You\u2019re not listening, I protested, or maybe I just thought it as he carried me up the steps like a child, all the way to his room.</p><p>His bed was an ornate cherry wood antique with bloodred sheets. \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping in your bed,\u201d I groaned.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said, easing me into the soft mattress and stretching out next to me. \u201cAdvil?\u201d</p><p>My head hurt too much to argue. \u201cBetter make it a double.\u201d</p><p>He fetched me four pills and a chaser of water. I swallowed them down and wished he could just knock me out. \u201cI feel like I got hit by a garbage truck.\u201d</p><p>The bed dipped as he sat down next to me. \u201cIs it always this bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019d pushed myself hard tonight. \u201cGo away.\u201d That\u2019s what my pack did at this point. They cleared out and left me to my pain.</p><p>He stood. The lights dimmed and I thought that would be the end of him, but Lucien came back. \u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d he asked, the bed creaking under his weight.</p><p>\u201cMy head.\u201d</p><p>His cool hands slid across my cheeks as if he were preparing to play a delicate instrument. His fingertips found my aching temples and lingered, rubbing hypnotic circles until I felt the tension loosen.</p><p>He kept on. Every thought I had focused on the way his hands soothed me. I shouldn\u2019t have let him touch me like that. No one else did. Why should he be any different? He was vampire. Not pack.</p><p>He was dead. He was a Predator.</p><p>I swallowed and let him touch. To hell with it. I needed this.</p><p>His hands moved through my hair, over my aching head, sending tiny chills down my body.</p><p>\u201cNot my neck,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d I heard him grin as the palm of his hand slid down the back of my head to rest at the aching spot at the top of my spine.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to bite me. I knew that somehow. And as soon as I decided, I tried to shove it out of my mind. I didn\u2019t want to think of him any other way. I needed him to be a Predator. I was good at having enemies. The rest was too hard to figure out, especially right now.</p><p>His hands found my shoulders.</p><p>I rolled onto my stomach and let him dig his strong fingers into my aching muscles. Good lord, I hadn\u2019t been petted in a long time. Ever, really. Damn, it felt good.</p><p>His hands found the edges of my silk top and I let him strip it off. The air felt wonderfully cool against my skin, his fingers soothing.</p><p>I floated above the pain, focusing only on Lucien\u2019s touch. He worked the muscles along my spine, easing away the tension.</p><p>He found the back of my bra. \u201cTake it off,\u201d I ordered. My voice betrayed none of the shakiness I felt.</p><p>It was no big deal to be naked around pack. But it was different with Lucien. I knew that now.</p><p>Still, I needed his skin against mine. It was a werewolf thing. It had nothing to do with the way he was touching me.</p><p>The pain had eased somewhat, replaced by ... what\u2014comfort? No, it was more than that.</p><p>I had the sudden, maddening urge to touch him back.</p><p>Gah. I shoved both hands under my pillow. \u201cTake it off,\u201d I said, voice muffled by the pillow. I wanted to feel his hands and nothing else.</p><p>\u201cHeather,\u201d he said, his voice husky.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I said, before I could change my mind.</p><p>I closed my eyes as his hands slid up either side of my chest, skimming the outer edges of my breasts. Awareness pricked me as his fingertips lingered above my nipples. It was everything I could do not to press forward against his hands.</p><p>He wanted to touch me. I knew he did.</p><p>I wanted it, too. But it would change everything.</p><p>Lucien was too much of a gentleman to press me. Damn it. I let him slip my bra off.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even care about my lucky boot knife.</p><p>Right now that didn\u2019t matter. Nothing did.</p><p>I was facedown, half-naked under a vampire and I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Scratch that.</p><p>I wanted him.</p><p>It would be so easy to roll over and let him run his hands over my breasts, my stomach, and every other part of me that ached for him.</p><p>\u201cLucien.\u201d I felt the weight of him on the backs of my thighs as I turned over on the bed.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help smiling at his hunger.</p><p>\u201cWatch it, werewolf.\u201d He stroked a finger down my cheek, over the pulse of my neck and down to my breast. My breath caught as he found my nipple.</p><p>Our eyes met.</p><p>His faltered.</p><p>\u201cNot like this,\u201d he whispered, pulling the covers over my body.</p><p>The crisp white sheets felt smothering. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I started to sit up until the pounding in my head returned, or maybe it had never stopped and I just hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d he said, as if that would keep me from wanting to see him naked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be more hurt in a minute.\u201d My body was screaming with frustration.</p><p>He made it worse by pressing a kiss to my forehead, and then to the soft spot in front of my ear.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cYou like to torture me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d He settled in next to me. \u201cSleep.\u201d He pressed against my back until he was spooning me in the most delicious way. It was warm, protective. It felt like the pack I\u2019d never had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLucien, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to rest, Heather.\u201d He nuzzled his chin on my shoulder. \u201cYou did too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d He was so close.</p> <p>\u201cShhh ...\u201d His steadying weight blanketed me. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>I snuggled into the pillow, almost content. It did feel good. \u201cYou\u2019re bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He held me like that until we drifted off to sleep.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p> <p>A curtain creaked open and sunlight flooded my face. \u201cWake up. You going to sleep all day?\u201d</p><p>I cracked an eye open. Sweet heaven above. An Alexander Skarsgard look-alike stood next to my bed, shirtless, wearing battered Levi\u2019s and a smile.</p><p>He cocked a grin. \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Vinny.</p><p>Of course. I\u2019d recognize that New Jersey accent anywhere.</p><p>I squinched my eyes closed and burrowed into the pillow. My head pounded and my stomach churned. I\u2019d hoped the hangover would be gone by now.</p> <p>\u201cYo, sleeping beauty.\u201d Even his voice made my head hurt.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to investigate Bliss\u2019s house, you\u2019d better hurry.\u201d</p><p>Of course Lucien had updated Vinny. Worse, Vinny didn\u2019t seem to be surprised to find me in his master\u2019s bed. I was the worst werewolf ever. Sleeping with a bloodsucker.</p><p>Damned vampire.</p><p>I shoved a pillow over my face. Naturally, it smelled like him.</p><p>The pillow went sailing across the room.</p><p>Oh, who was I kidding? It wasn\u2019t Vinny\u2019s fault. Lucien had touched me and rubbed me and comforted me through my pain like no one else had, or probably ever would. I didn\u2019t even know I needed that until I had it.</p><p>I\u2019d better not get used to it.</p> <p>I groaned and rolled over, certain traitorous parts still wishing they\u2019d had their way with Lucien last night. Of course it would have been amazing. Damned vampire. I sure hoped he didn\u2019t tell Vinny everything.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Vinny shook the bed. \u201cLucien said you might want to do some investigating that didn\u2019t involve thwacking your brain against a mental wall, so to speak.\u201d He yanked back the covers. \u201cUp and at \u2019em.\u201d My shirt thwomped me on the head. \u201cThe lady just left for her weekly massage and seaweed wrap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBliss,\u201d he said, losing patience.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d I rolled over, tugging on my shirt. \u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI flirted,\u201d he said, as if it were obvious. \u201cShe\u2019s leaving the alarm off for me. It\u2019s a one-time opportunity, babe.\u201d</p><p>He tossed a key at my head.</p><p>\u201cCripes, Vinny,\u201d I mumbled as I caught the key, almost jealous of the fact that he\u2019d allowed himself to flirt without feeling guilty about it. \u201cWhat are you supposed to be anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your gardener,\u201d he said, relishing the role. \u201cI mow things. I chop down trees. I flirt with the neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re supposed to chop down trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, scram,\u201d I said, forcing myself out of bed. I needed to get started.</p><p>Knowing these women, a beauty treatment would give me several hours alone in the house. I\u2019d like to find a bankbook and check into her money situation, maybe uncover anything else that I could ask her about. I needed to keep my conversations with these women useful and targeted\u2014or else my head was going to explode.</p><p>Besides that, we were on a deadline here. I had less than two days to figure out who\u2019d killed Sunny or this would all be for nothing. My pack would be at war.</p><p>A shower and four Advil helped perk me up. Then I grabbed a cream and blue sundress with straw sandals that Tia had picked out. She\u2019d labeled them with matching florescent yellow dots, which she\u2019d found demeaning and I\u2019d found extremely helpful. I tossed the dots into the trash and committed the outfit to memory.</p><p>I waved to Vinny on my way out the door and couldn\u2019t help grinning when he accidentally sliced a chunk off the front rosebushes. I had to think that was for me. And I enjoyed it immensely. Maybe it wasn\u2019t so bad being a girly girl\u2014at least while I was undercover.</p><p>Of course, it would have been wiser to wear black while breaking into a house, but somehow, I fit in better in this neighborhood as I was. And it wasn\u2019t like there\u2019d be anyone home.</p><p>According to Vinny, Bliss lived in the chocolate brown house on the corner. It was accented by large dark timbers and leafy palm trees. I was pleased to see that plants, rather than a fence, formed the barrier to the backyard. I\u2019d rather not be seen entering through the front door.</p><p>I ducked between two bougainvillea bushes. Dark-green leaves slapped at my face and thorns clawed at my skin and my dress, but I didn\u2019t care. Once I made it past, I\u2019d have plenty of cover to enter through the back.</p><p>A finger nudged me on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d I stood straight up and banged my head on a heavy branch. \u201cOw!\u201d I turned, trying to think of just what excuse I could give for slogging through Bliss Leeson\u2019s bougainvilleas.</p><p>Tia stood directly behind me. \u201cHi,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I craned my neck to see who else might be watching. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d The wind crackled the trees around us.</p><p>She pulled a strand of auburn hair away from her face. \u201cI stopped by your house. Vinny said you were investigating.\u201d</p><p>Vinny needed to keep his mouth closed. \u201cWhat else did he say?\u201d He\u2019d better not have mentioned my powers.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, her expression earnest. \u201cI figured you could use some help.\u201d</p><p>That surprised me. \u201cWhat? You want to break into Bliss\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>Tia reared back like I\u2019d struck her. \u201cNo!\u201d She gathered herself. \u201cOf course not.\u201d She wet her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you might need a lookout.\u201d She pointed a pink nail toward her immaculate front lawn across the street. \u201cI can pretend to do yard work,\u201d she said, way too excited.</p><p>Aye yae yae. \u201cFine. Go.\u201d We couldn\u2019t be seen chatting in the bushes.</p><p>She gave a shy smile. \u201cYou look good, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou picked it out,\u201d I said, parting the branches again.</p><p>\u201cTake credit, okay?\u201d She turned and headed back.</p><p>Right. I had bigger things on my mind. Like breaking and entering.</p><p>I pushed my way through the foliage and into a heavily wooded backyard. Of course, what else could I expect from a weretiger? It was like a jungle back here. Tree branches wove overhead as clusters of jasmine and tall grass filled in underneath. Insects buzzed all around, and I could swear it was hard-packed mud and not sandy California soil under my feet. I picked my way through tangles of plants as they grabbed at my skin and clothes.</p><p>At last I made it to a heavy oak door at the back of the house. Long gashes marred the wood. Someone had been playing\u2014or using it as a scratching post. I hoped Bliss wasn\u2019t an angry tiger. I mentally crossed my fingers as I inserted the key into the lock.</p><p>Yip-yip-yip! A dog blustered on the other side. No doubt it was Chi-Chi, who was technically the owner of this place.</p><p>Yip-yip-yip!</p><p>Fierce.</p><p>Yip-yip-yip!</p><p>Luckily I had a way with dogs.</p><p>I pushed open the door and stepped into the cool, dark interior of the house. \u201cHow goes it, Chi-Chi?\u201d</p><p>The little tan dog couldn\u2019t have weighed more than two pounds wet. She had bulging eyes and a tail that wouldn\u2019t stop. Yip-yip-yip! Every time she barked, the backfire sent her an inch off the hardwood.</p><p>I bent down and let her sniff my hand before she nudged underneath and forced me to pet her between the ears. Well, at least I tried to give her a nice rub. Chi-Chi was having a hard time standing still.</p><p>\u201cYou gotta stop barking, okay? Auntie Heather has a hangover.\u201d</p><p>She licked my hand and I took that as agreement.</p><p>Chi-Chi followed me through the mudroom and into the kitchen, collar jingling and nails clacking on the floor.</p><p>It was lighter in here, although Bliss kept plants clustered around the narrow windows.</p><p>I opened the fridge and found a few bottles of white wine and a package of steaks.</p><p>Chi-Chi whined.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019d give you one, except nobody can know we\u2019re hanging out.\u201d</p><p>Chi-Chi had to sit and think about that one.</p><p>I moved on down a side hallway and found Bliss\u2019s office. Rich Indian fabric covered the walls. The desk itself was painted with images of four-armed women and colorful elephants. Mirrored tiles studded the corners.</p><p>I started on the drawers at the upper right and worked my way down. \u201cYou know where Mama keeps her financial files?\u201d</p><p>The dog growled.</p><p>\u201cFair enough. I won\u2019t call her that.\u201d</p><p>I rifled through years of household documents, plastic surgery records\u2014who injects themselves with neurotoxins in the name of beauty? Finally, I found her bank records shoved in a heap in the bottom drawer.</p><p>The gossip was wrong. Her finances looked great\u2014better than great. Bliss was getting large influxes of cash. She was spending it, too. I couldn\u2019t tell where the payments were coming from. They were merely noted as transfers. Still, they couldn\u2019t be blackmail, unless she was blackmailing Donald Trump. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After the office, I searched her bathroom. You could tell a lot about someone by her bathroom. What I learned about Bliss was that she was a slob, and if there was ever a shampoo shortage, I knew where to go. The woman had at least a dozen different bottles.</p><p>\u201cWe need, more, Chi-Chi,\u201d I said, moving to her bedroom.</p><p>The Chihuahua jumped up on the bed and gave a big yawn. Yeah, I knew it wasn\u2019t her problem.</p> <p>I checked my watch. I\u2019d been in here for an hour. We had to pick up the pace. \u201cOkay, Chi-Chi, where would I hide something I didn\u2019t want anyone to find?\u201d</p><p>My eyes settled on the walk-in bedroom closet, with its door hanging open and clothes littering the floor. I ignored them, and the endless shelves and teak wood racks. Instead, I walked to the very back of the closet. It was stacked with shoeboxes. They were perfectly dusted, but older. I could tell by their slightly caved-in lids. And so I went through boxes. I saw blue heels and gold heels and enough heels to make my own feet ache. Until I opened a box and found row upon row of pill bottles.</p><p>Excitement zinged through me. This was what I\u2019d been looking for. I knew it before I even knew what it was.</p><p>None of the bottles had prescription labels. Instead, they were marked with expiration dates written in black Sharpie and tiny brand labels\u2014Slimprol.</p><p>I popped open a bottle and discovered sparkly blue tablets about the size of aspirin.</p> <p>Slimprol. I\u2019d never heard of it. Of course that didn\u2019t mean anything. I kept myself fit without this junk. Still, if this was legal, it wouldn\u2019t be stuffed in the back of a closet.</p><p>It killed me not to take a sample, but I didn\u2019t want to rouse suspicions\u2014not until I knew what we were dealing with.</p><p>Instead, I found a pen and began a complete inventory of the box, including expiration dates and pill volume. Well, until Chi-Chi shot off the bed barking.</p><p>Yip-yip-yip!</p><p>Her barks grew fainter as I heard the front door open.</p><p>Bliss was home!</p> <p>Yip-yip-yip!</p><p>I was trapped!</p><p>Yip-yip-yip!</p><p>Hands shaking, I made sure there was no trace of my presence, then dashed for the window. I threw open the curtains and found an ornate wooden grate.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>I tried to shove it back, but it wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>Yip-yip-yip! Chi-Chi\u2019s barking grew closer. Bliss could probably smell me. She was tracking me!</p><p>Calm down. I had to think.</p> <p>At least she didn\u2019t know who I was\u2014yet.</p><p>I attacked the grate and felt it start to give. I\u2019d rip it off the hinges before I got trapped in here with a tiger.</p><p>\u201cBliss!\u201d Tia called from the front of the house. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back. I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I heard a low growl from the hallway.</p><p>\u201cBliss.\u201d Tia was inside the house. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, Tia,\u201d Bliss said, her voice throaty.</p><p>\u201cBut\u201d\u2014Tia\u2019s voice cracked\u2014\u201cyou put me in charge of planning the midnight golf scramble and I know we\u2019re having it at the country club, but we never did decide if the men were going to take golf carts. I know that vampire you\u2019re dating likes to levitate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare talk about who I\u2019m dating,\u201d Bliss roared.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Tia squeaked. \u201cI can\u2019t. You never told me. Anyhow, we really need to decide on the carts or else we might not get enough or even the ones we want and ...\u201d</p><p>I could feel Bliss losing patience as I renewed my struggle with the grate.</p><p>Forget it. It wasn\u2019t budging. I hoped Tia had drawn Bliss far enough away from the back hallway. I had one shot at escaping.</p><p>I darted out into the hall, ready to be bowled over. But it was empty. Hallelujah! I dashed out the way I\u2019d come in\u2014down the hall, through the kitchen. I thought I spotted a glimpse of yellow as I darted past an area exposed to the front door, but I didn\u2019t hesitate. In fact, I didn\u2019t stop until I was back home with the door locked behind me.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>I tossed a ThighMaster out of my closet, followed by a pair of wedge sandals and a paraffin wax hand-dipping kit.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Vinny protested behind me, rubbing his forehead.</p><p>Oh, come on. I couldn\u2019t have hit him that hard. Besides, we had bigger problems. \u201cWhere are my heels?\u201d I groused. \u201cThe ones with the green stickers?\u201d</p><p>Tia\u2019s dress-to-shoes color-coding system was no good if I couldn\u2019t keep my new wardrobe straight.</p><p>Vinny massaged his head in a clearly dramatic attempt to make me feel like a crazy woman. \u201cI don\u2019t care where your green stickers are. I came up here to tell you Lucien is making a call. After that, he needs you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me look.\u201d The closet was a mess. I\u2019d never had this much junk before. \u201cTurn yourself into Martha Stewart or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for all the tea in China, babe.\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah, now he gets picky.</p><p>We were due at Nina\u2019s dinner party and I\u2019d underestimated the time it took to get tweezed and sprayed and polished for the evening.</p><p>It had never taken me more than five minutes in the past.</p><p>Truth be told, I\u2019d had a hard time tearing myself from the computer. I\u2019d been online, investigating Slimprol. Not that it did any good. I couldn\u2019t find any mention of the drug, much less what it did\u2014or why Bliss would hide it.</p><p>Lucien said he\u2019d put the Vampire Council research department on the job. I\u2019d try to question Bliss at the party. Although I\u2019d rather use my resources to ask questions about Sunny\u2019s murder.</p><p>Finding the killer was my main priority. We had tonight. Tomorrow at dusk would be the full moon, which would be the end of our investigation, and the beginning of a war.</p><p>Vinny shoved the ThighMaster back into the closet and right in my way.</p><p>Say ... I turned to him. \u201cYou have an \u2018in\u2019 with Bliss.\u201d</p><p>I tossed the ThighMaster out of the closet before I tripped over the thing.</p><p>Vinny simply stared at me.</p><p>Honestly, the man was causing more problems than he solved.</p><p>Did I have to spell it out?</p><p>\u201cThink you can romance me the 411 on Slimprol?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who gets them to spill the truth, sweetheart,\u201d he said, shoving the ThighMaster onto an upper shelf. \u201cI\u2019m just your eyes and ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so now you stick to your job.\u201d Men. I\u2019d never understand them. I stared up at the hinged contraption that was now threatening to smack me on the head. \u201cWhat\u2019s that thing doing in here anyway? I didn\u2019t buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said, deliberately avoiding the subject.</p><p>Vinny began digging through my pile of shoes. \u201cWear these.\u201d He held out a pair of brown flats that most certainly did not go with my slinky black dress.</p><p>See? I was getting better.</p><p>Granted, Tia had forced me to buy a lot of beauty gadgets, but, \u201cif I didn\u2019t buy it and you didn\u2019t buy it and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep it in my closet, okay?\u201d he said, tossing the flats and shoving a pair of gold strappy sandals at me.</p><p>\u201cHey, green stickers. Thanks.\u201d Then it occurred to me. \u201cWhy do you have a ThighMaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he grumbled, retreating from the closet. \u201cJust leave it in here.\u201d</p><p>I perked up. \u201cYou don\u2019t want Lucien to know you have a ThighMaster.\u201d</p><p>Hidden in plain sight.</p><p>Vinny didn\u2019t share my amusement. He rubbed at the stubble on his chin. \u201cI told you to can it.\u201d</p><p>I gave him the once-over. Okay, so maybe Vinny in his natural state had a few jiggly spots, but it wasn\u2019t like he needed to \u201csqueeze his way to fitness.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared and I swear his eyebrow ring even jingled a bit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it to the grave,\u201d I said, carrying my heels to the bed so I could sit and fasten them. \u201cIt might happen soon, too, considering Bliss is about to tear me apart.\u201d</p><p>She had to have smelled me in her house. Once she locked on to my scent tonight, I\u2019d be toast.</p><p>A part of me was actually relieved. I liked confrontations. I\u2019d rather know where I stood than sneak around waiting for the other shoe to drop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got your back,\u201d he assured me.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you a waiter tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. That\u2019s another reason I came up to talk to you.\u201d He\u2019d propped an elaborate curved sword against my nightstand. \u201cLucien thought you\u2019d enjoy seeing this. It\u2019s from his private collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucien likes knives?\u201d I loved blades.</p><p>\u201cYou two have a lot more in common than you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt needed to be said,\u201d he stated. \u201cAnyhow, I\u2019m acting like scenery tonight. Sadly, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve had to be live sculpture art during a vampire party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so pretentious.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI meet a lot of people in my line of work. Some act like God\u2019s gift because they can put on a show.\u201d There was that meaningful look again. \u201cOthers are full of themselves because they don\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Vinny didn\u2019t dwell on it. \u201cNina has an Arabian Nights theme going.\u201d He grinned. \u201cMeet the burly harem guard.\u201d He took a swoop at thin air. \u201cYou have a problem, look for the sword.\u201d</p><p>Got it. \u201cMuch better than you with a chain saw.\u201d We\u2019d lost three trees during his stint as a gardener.</p><p>We headed downstairs to find Lucien waiting. He looked fantastic in an understated black suit and a blue tie that set off his eyes.</p> <p>I felt his gaze touch me and it was all I could do not to trip down the last three steps.</p><p>\u201cIs the research department working on Slimprol?\u201d I asked, just to have something to say.</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help remembering the way he\u2019d touched me the night before. Clearly, he was thinking of it, too.</p><p>He ate me up with his eyes. \u201cYou look amazing.\u201d</p> <p>I snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re only saying that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>I moved close enough for him to smell my honeysuckle perfume. \u201cYou just want to bite me,\u201d I said, my voice huskier than I would have liked.</p><p>He took my hand as I tried to breeze past.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said, drawing me back, his hand cupping my chin, his thumb grazing my lower lip. \u201cI also want this.\u201d</p><p>His mouth brushed mine once, twice. The thrill of it slapped through me. I grabbed his head and deepened the kiss.</p> <p>My body collided flush with his. And those parts that had ached in frustration roared back to life.</p><p>God, I\u2019d waited so long for something like this. I deserved it.</p><p>Lucien wanted me. It was a heady feeling.</p><p>If I should have been kissing him.</p><p>I broke away, trying to keep my breath even and failing miserably. \u201cWe said no kissing.\u201d</p><p>A brief flash of stark emotion crossed his features. Good. \u201cYou said no kissing,\u201d he said, with his infernal logic. He nipped short kisses along my jaw, as if he couldn\u2019t quite help himself. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>Too much. My breasts felt heavy as he nuzzled my earlobe. \u201cThat\u2019s beside the point.\u201d One of us had to be sensible.</p><p>It probably should be me. I ran my hands down his shoulders and arms, feeling the heavy weight of his suit jacket. Then again, maybe the whole sensible thing was overrated.</p> <p>He pressed tight against me.</p><p>Oy vey. What was I getting myself into?</p><p>Yes, I found I enjoyed touching and being touched. But we were pretending here, playing roles. I\u2019d forgotten that last night. When this was over, he\u2019d be sent on another job for the Vampire Council and I\u2019d be returning to my pack. Alone.</p><p>He lowered his mouth to mine again and I let him. I let him kiss me into a heart-pounding fury until I forgot all about what I\u2019d said I was going to do.</p><p>He slid his hands down to the small of my back, tempting me closer, but I didn\u2019t need any help. I rubbed against Lucien like a cat, savoring every rock-hard inch of him.</p><p>\u201cYou like it,\u201d he said, drawing back just long enough to grin at me with boyish pleasure before he devoured me again.</p><p>Damn the man. He was good at making me forget just why I said I\u2019d never kiss him in the first place.</p><p>\u201cI like it, too,\u201d he whispered against my lips.</p><p>\u201cI can tell,\u201d I said, wriggling against him, a victorious twinge lancing through me when I felt just how much I affected him.</p><p>Lucien wasn\u2019t the jaded creature I\u2019d first imagined. He was a man. Admittedly an immortal one, but a flesh-and-blood man all the same.</p><p>His expression softened as he saw the change come over me. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d He tucked a lock of hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cHmm ...\u201d I mused, enjoying the sexual power I held over him. \u201cI\u2019m thinking you need to kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>I beat him to it. I took the lead this time as I tasted him, savored him. Our kiss deepened as he pushed back. He wanted me. We drove into each other. He wanted me so bad.</p><p>I\u2019d never had this with a man. Sure, maybe I\u2019d had a few meaningless flings, but no one like Lucien.</p><p>To the males of my pack, I was a dare, an experiment. But this affair with Lucien went much deeper. It was both alarming and exhilarating.</p><p>\u201cOkay, come on. Break it up.\u201d The front door creaked open with Vinny behind it. \u201cI got the car started, for all you noticed.\u201d</p><p>Lucien drew back a fraction. His lower lip glistened. God I wanted to kiss him again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll walk,\u201d he said, turning his back on Vinny.</p><p>Vinny stood on the front stoop, arms crossed. \u201cWhat? You think I\u2019m nuts? You two will never make it.\u201d</p><p>Lucien raised his hand and the door slammed shut.</p><p>\u201cReal nice!\u201d Vinny hollered from the other side.</p><p>\u201cOhh ... telekinesis!\u201d I said, impressed.</p><p>\u201cI have all kinds of things I\u2019d like to show you,\u201d Lucien said, moving in to seal the deal.</p><p>I hated to think Vinny might be right, but, \u201cWe might actually have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>I nuzzled him. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Lucien\u2019s amusement faded, replaced by something primal. \u201cOne more kiss.\u201d He took me with such force it was a wonder I held on. I was aware of every touch, every caress of his mouth as my senses came vibrantly alive. The hot glide of his tongue sent heat washing through me. It was all I could do not to climb the man as he deepened the kiss even more.</p><p>He groaned as I cupped his butt and pressed him tighter against me.</p><p>Lucien wanted me. He wasn\u2019t afraid to admit it\u2014or slam the door on Vinny. That part had actually been kind of fun.</p><p>But could I really have an affair with him?</p><p>I hated weres who paired with vampires. Well, maybe not Tia. But I couldn\u2019t stand the type. I didn\u2019t want to be the kind of woman who needed a man, much less a vampire.</p><p>Heck, I didn\u2019t even need my pack. I was fine on my own.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t I?</p><p>I arrived at Nina\u2019s house with a satisfied Vinny and a frustrated Lucien. I knew how the vampire felt. My body was screaming for five minutes, okay four\u2014okay, one minute alone with him.</p><p>Maybe after the party, I reasoned, trying to get a choke hold on my raging libido. As it stood, Tia had worked hard in order to secure us an invite. She\u2019d probably agreed to paint Nina\u2019s toes for the next year. It burned me to see how the Predators treated her.</p><p>Vinny watched us walk in the door, promising to \u201carrive\u201d shortly after.</p><p>Nina lived in a modern-style home with lots of clean lines. The front room was done in black and white, with zebra and gazelle fur accents. Charming. Low pillows and flowing fabric accents gave a nod to the Arabian Nights theme.</p><p>A stoic vampire with bowl-cut hair and a long black salt-and-pepper beard greeted us.</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d Lucien nodded to him, holding my hand. His thumb caressed the soft skin below my wrist. \u201cThis is my wife, Mitzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe women are in the living room,\u201d he said to Lucien, as if I wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Fair enough. It was Lucien\u2019s job to question the vampires. At the moment, I didn\u2019t envy him. Samuel seemed like a cold fish.</p><p>Strange that Nina would ally herself with an unusually grim vampire. Then again, my job here wasn\u2019t to question lifestyle choices, just potential murderers.</p><p>My shoes were already digging into the sides of my feet. It would be nice to take a load off.</p><p>A mouthwatering scent filtered in from the kitchen.</p><p>I found the wives perched on Nina\u2019s impossibly white couches and chairs. Tia in white. Francine staring daggers at me in red. And an Indian woman in a gorgeous blue dress who literally growled. Bliss.</p><p>The coffee table in front of us was covered with plates of caviar and crackers, pine nut puffs, and all kinds of tiny appetizers that looked like they each took about an hour to make.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself.\u201d Nina, who wore a black dress at least two sizes smaller than mine, waved a hand toward the display, as if daring me.</p><p>None of the wives had so much as touched a plate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait until dinner,\u201d I said, my stomach protesting. Now that my body wasn\u2019t pulsing after Lucien, I remembered that I hadn\u2019t eaten lunch. \u201cYou have a fantastic home.\u201d I took a seat, ignoring the way my dress shifted sideways.</p><p>\u201cYou want a tour?\u201d Bliss asked, wasting no time.</p><p>Her smile didn\u2019t reach her eyes. She knew.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, \u201cwhy not?\u201d</p><p>Let\u2019s get it over with. She could try to tear me apart, but I was all wolf.</p><p>I stood. I gave myself decent odds, especially if Lucien jumped in.</p><p>Tia cast a worried glance my way. I could see the indecision eating at her.</p><p>\u201cMitzy\u2014\u201d The were rushed after me as I was about to leave the room with the tiger. Once she made it to me, she scrambled for what came next. \u201cYou have a smidge of something on your dress.\u201d She scrubbed with bare fingers at the area next to my back zipper. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she whispered in a rush.</p><p>Me too.</p><p>\u201cThanks for saving my hide this afternoon,\u201d I murmured under my breath.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she said, growing desperate.</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d I turned to her, keeping my voice low. \u201cYou\u2019re strong, Tia. You have to be. You\u2019re on my team.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She chewed at her lip.</p><p>\u201cYou need to stand up for yourself.\u201d</p><p>I did, too.</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>I left her with the Predators and followed Bliss.</p><p>Tia couldn\u2019t help me right now. I needed to do this on my own. If I was smart\u2014and lucky\u2014I might be able to pull this off.</p><p>I just needed to grab her mind, preferably before she took me by the throat.</p><p>The weretiger turned on me the minute we were out of the room. \u201cWhat were you doing in my house?\u201d she demanded, nostrils flaring. \u201cAnd don\u2019t bother to deny it.\u201d She leaned in close, her face inches from mine. \u201cI smelled you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFunny thing, Bliss,\u201d I said, trying to buy precious seconds, grasping with my mind.</p><p>Steady.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t afford a backlash. I channeled the power from deep inside of me. It flowed between us and I felt the invisible cord tighten. I tested the connection and sighed with relief when it held. \u201cOkay, tiger. I have a few questions I\u2019d like to ask you.\u201d</p><p>Her face went slack. \u201cI\u2019m in charge of this conversation,\u201d she said, but it was only a line. I had her now.</p><p>We\u2019d start with something easy.</p><p>\u201cAre you aware that Sunny was blackmailing Nina?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, eyes widening.</p><p>Fair enough. \u201cWere you sleeping with Sunny\u2019s husband?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s fantastic in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes,\u201d I said, my head beginning to pound. \u201cDo you know where Sunny\u2019s husband is now?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Bliss tilted her perfectly oval face. \u201cOverseas,\u201d she said, repeating what I already knew. \u201cOn business.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never got around to asking, \u201cWhat does he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPharmaceuticals.\u201d</p><p>No kidding. \u201cLike the Slimprol you have in your closet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, almost in a trance.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Slimprol do, Bliss?\u201d</p><p>She blinked once. Twice. \u201cIt makes you sleepy. You go to sleep and you lose weight.\u201d</p><p>Great. An unapproved drug for extreme weight loss. I could already tell Sunny\u2019s husband was a real piece of work.</p><p>Pain lanced through my head. I was losing the connection. I knew I\u2019d laid it on thick, but dang, when somebody wants to kill you, it\u2019s a good idea to crank up the happy current. \u201cWhat else can the drug do, Bliss?\u201d I pressed. \u201cCan it kill people?\u201d</p><p>She snarled at me. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>Our connection unraveled.</p><p>Bliss bared her teeth.</p><p>Oh come on. I was offended she\u2019d think I\u2019d break into her house. Even if I did break into her house.</p><p>I threw up a hand. \u201cI was in your house trying to find my gardener. I don\u2019t care who you are. What\u2019s mine is mine.\u201d</p><p>She should know wolves are territorial.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d she snarled, unsure for the first time. She narrowed her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t like wolves who sniff around my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBliss!\u201d Nina called. \u201cMitzy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d I gave a ready answer.</p><p>She found us with no trouble. \u201cDinner is served.\u201d</p><p>The tiger growled low in her throat. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over, werewolf,\u201d she said, stalking past me.</p><p>I never said it was.</p><p>Lucien and I were seated near the head of the table for dinner. Samuel sat at the head. Lucien at his right side. I sat next to Lucien, with Nina across from me. Luckily, Bliss was at the far end with poor Tia in a werewives version of the singles\u2019 section. That meant I got to chat with Francine and her husband, Olaf.</p><p>Worse, I couldn\u2019t help picturing what else Nina had served up on the sleek black dining room table.</p><p>Vinny the Arab warrior offered us each a small bowl of rose water with a fingertip towel.</p><p>Despite the fact that I\u2019d come one mind-reading trick from being consumed by a tiger, my stomach growled as I anticipated dinner. I needed to eat. Food helped me think. It helped me heal.</p><p>And just when I\u2019d worked myself up into a frenzy of anticipation, my plate arrived.</p><p>The waiter served up one tiny chicken wing with grated cucumber on top. A date cut into a flower served as garnish. I supposed it was gourmet, but it made me want to cry.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take it.</p><p>These people could threaten me. They could lie to me and demean me and make me wear god-awful heels with pointy tips. But they couldn\u2019t starve me. It wasn\u2019t right. My head hurt and my dress was still kind of sideways and I just needed one thing tonight to go the way it was supposed to go.</p><p>I needed crackers. I needed anything but a puny chicken wing with a garnish.</p><p>The vampires sat drinking their wine. The weres picked at their cucumber as if touching it would make them gain weight. What was wrong with these people?</p><p>I needed to eat.</p><p>And so I did.</p><p>I ate my chicken wing clean. I devoured the cucumber. And the cut-up date. Then I marched out to the living room and loaded up on appetizers\u2014caviar, lamb with goat cheese, fancy fruity tarts. I ate it all. And when I was done with that plate, I went and got another.</p><p>Bliss growled. Francine sneered. Tia stared, openmouthed.</p><p>Nina couldn\u2019t care less. \u201cMore wine?\u201d she asked the table.</p><p>She shrugged off her Puritan husband\u2019s glare. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m just being a good hostess.\u201d</p><p>Everyone agreed to refills, except for me. I hadn\u2019t touched my glass. I\u2019d never been one for alcohol. And now that I had my third plate of lamb thingies and a raging psychic hangover, forget it.</p><p>The waiter started pouring at the other end of the table and the bottle of white was long gone by the time it reached our end. Nina cracked open another and gave me a healthy pour.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve gotta save room for the ham puffs.\u201d</p><p>Bliss stared at me as I slid my glass over to Lucien.</p><p>He winked at me and drank.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>I cleared away the rest of the lamb, all of the puff pastries, and a good portion of the caviar. I\u2019d never been huge on fish, much less their eggs, but it was there. And the crackers weren\u2019t half-bad, either.</p><p>\u201cBet you never even heard of a saltine,\u201d I said to Nina.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d she said, either half-soused or highly amused, probably both.</p><p>\u201cHere, here,\u201d I said, toasting her with the last of the caviar.</p><p>I had plenty to celebrate. Topping the list was the fact that I had not been eaten by a tiger tonight.</p><p>The vampires had lost interest by this time and were busy trying to one-up each other on who had endured the most annoying minions. Points were given for base groveling, years served, and most obnoxious way they died. And it seemed they always died.</p><p>Big surprise there.</p><p>Yet another reason why no self-respecting weregirl should bind herself to a guy like that.</p><p>I licked a bit of caviar off my fingers.</p><p>Of course I did notice Lucien hadn\u2019t joined in on the minion talk. In fact, he looked a little green. Good for him. Using people was just plain wrong.</p><p>I nudged him. \u201cYou feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSlightly put off by the conversation.\u201d</p><p>Lucien used a napkin to wipe his forehead and a trickle of perspiration glinted near his ear.</p><p>I\u2019d never seen him sweat before. I\u2019d never even seen him warm.</p><p>His chin dipped and he braced his hands on the edge of the table. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say he was struggling to remain upright.</p><p>I covered his hand with mine. \u201cCripes.\u201d Something was definitely wrong. \u201cYou\u2019re burning up.\u201d</p><p>I flagged down the waiter. \u201cCan we get him some water?\u201d</p><p>He was abnormally pale.</p><p>Everyone at the table was watching now\u2014except Bliss. She\u2019d become quite interested in her gold bracelets.</p><p>Then it hit me with a sickening thud. \u201cYou drugged him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes locked with mine. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d answered too fast, and without a hint of surprise.</p><p>Bliss had been after me. I\u2019d given my wine to Lucien right before he got sick.</p><p>I ran a finger along the inside of his glass and found traces of glitter. Slimprol.</p><p>Of all the ... Fury welled up inside me as I stalked toward the tiger. \u201cNow would be a really good time to tell me what\u2019s in Slimprol.\u201d</p><p>She stood, her chair toppling over. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>I resisted the urge to grab her by the braid and shake her. Barely.</p><p>\u201cGet him into the car,\u201d I said, refusing to turn my back on the tiger.</p><p>Vinny hoisted Lucien out of his chair.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d Tia stammered, bobbing in her chair, clearly afraid to stand.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tia,\u201d I bristled. \u201cHe\u2019s not okay.\u201d</p><p>But he would be. I\u2019d see to it myself.</p><p>I snarled at Bliss and a blaze of triumph shot through me when she backed up a step.</p><p>She\u2019d messed with the wrong werewife.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not through with you,\u201d I said, as Francine led her away.</p><p>That\u2019s it. Run, tiger.</p><p>It took all I had not to chase her.</p><p>Soon. Right now, I had to take care of my own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucien was getting sleepier and sleepier. His head dipped and Vinny had to readjust his grip as he took on more of Lucien\u2019s weight. I helped make way for them as they rounded the table.</p><p>Lucien\u2019s breathing grew shallower with each breath. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he gasped as we led him out the door. \u201cAlcohol doesn\u2019t affect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been drugged,\u201d I said, helping him navigate the front step, hoping he was aware enough to understand. \u201cYou have to stay awake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrugs don\u2019t work on me,\u201d he said, voice slurred.</p><p>I glanced back at Nina\u2019s house. \u201cThis one does.\u201d</p><p>We sped off in Vinny\u2019s car, not even caring about breaking cover.

We had no idea how to reverse whatever Bliss had given him.</p><p>\u201cContact the Vampire Council,\u201d I told Vinny. \u201cSee if they\u2019ve learned anything about Slimprol.\u201d</p> <p>Lucien was dead weight as we pulled him out of the car. His skin was clammy, and his face had gone deathly pale.</p><p>\u201cDrag harder,\u201d Vinny said.

He was immortal, but he wasn\u2019t un-kill-able and I still didn\u2019t trust Bliss not to make a lethal move. She was desperate, vicious, and out for blood.</p><p>Vinny was thinking the same thing. \u201cLock the door,\u201d he said when we\u2019d made it inside.</p><p>I threw the dead bolt and the chain. Then I set the security alarm.</p><p>There was no way we could drag Lucien up the stairs. In fact, we made it as far as the couch in the living room.</p><p>\u201cEasy does it,\u201d Vinny said, out of breath as we laid Lucien on the white couch facing the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cHow could Bliss even think she\u2019d get away with this?\u201d</p><p>Vinny pulled out his cell phone. \u201cI doubt she was thinking that far.\u201d He hurried toward the kitchen. \u201cRodger? Get me Milosh.\u201d He took the rest of the conversation in the garage.</p> <p>Lucien struggled just to keep his eyes open. His pupils were fixed and dilated. His breathing had slowed as if he were asleep.</p><p>\u201cStay with me.\u201d I ran my fingers through his short blond hair and touched my lips to his forehead. \u201cCome on. You can do it.\u201d I kissed his eyelids and his cheeks.</p><p>God, he had impossibly long eyelashes.</p><p>I was anxious. Terrified, really. It was as if a big hole had opened up in my chest, waiting to be filled, or crushed.</p><p>His eyes fluttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to miss this.\u201d</p><p>I brushed a kiss over his lips, and then another. A tear splashed down on his cheek and I wiped it away, glad that no one saw.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I asked, wiping my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>What was wrong with me? Getting blubbery over a job.</p><p>I\u2019d seen death more than I cared to admit. It was part of being a pack enforcer.</p><p>But this was Lucien and he was different and he didn\u2019t deserve this.</p><p>The garage door burst open. \u201cNo information on Slimprol, but they\u2019re sending a medic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>Vinny shoved his phone in his pocket. \u201cA half hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Vinny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he has a half hour.\u201d My voice caught in my throat.</p><p>His breathing had all but stopped. He wasn\u2019t keeping his eyes open and he\u2019d gone deathly pale.</p><p>Vinny stood frozen. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet on the phone,\u201d I ordered. \u201cFigure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, fishing in his pocket.</p><p>Vinny retreated back to the kitchen or the garage or wherever the hell he went. Damn the Vampire Council for being so slow. Damn Vinny for not figuring this out. I wanted to scream. I wanted to beat something because Lucien was dying right in front of us and there was nothing I could do.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t cure a vampire.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t make this better.</p><p>I\u2014</p><p>\u201cWake up.\u201d I tapped at his cheek until I was full-fledged slapping him. \u201cWake up!\u201d</p><p>His eyes cracked open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to drink from me,\u201d I said, breathless. I couldn\u2019t believe I was saying it, much less thinking it, but there was no other way.</p><p>Lucien was a vampire. He needed blood to heal and I would give it to him.</p><p>\u201cLucien!\u201d</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lucien. Wake up. You have to drink from me.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed at my wrist, trying to figure out where there\u2019d be an artery. I\u2019d heard there was one in there somewhere.</p><p>To hell with it. No time.</p><p>I climbed on top of him and lowered my neck to his mouth. \u201cDrink!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cOh well, this is just great!\u201d I hollered. First he could barely keep his fangs to himself, and now when I had to save his miserable life, he wanted to go to sleep. Well, not on my watch.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to die,\u201d I growled. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m going to seduce the hell out of you.\u201d</p><p>I got an eyelid flutter for that.</p><p>Ha!</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I said, wrestling with the back zipper of my dress. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been dying for this.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my bra. Damned vampire.</p><p>My mouth skimmed his jaw and nibbled at the soft spot behind his ear. One by one, I freed the buttons on his white dress shirt until I could press my hands against his deathly cold flesh.</p><p>Don\u2019t think of that. I focused instead on the hardness of his muscles, the wisp of hair that trailed from his chest and disappeared into the front of his dress slacks. I flicked a nipple and he groaned. I took it between my teeth and he groaned harder.</p><p>That a boy.</p><p>I pressed my breasts flush against him and let his coolness seep over me. He\u2019d begun to breathe harder. So had I. I paused for a moment to breathe in his spicy, masculine scent.</p><p>I almost forgot this was a rescue mission instead of a mutual pleasuring. He felt so good. I brought my body flush with his, toying with his belt buckle, nibbling my way up his chest as I reached lower.</p><p>He inhaled sharply. \u201cHeather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm-hum,\u201d I said, nuzzling his ear. God, he was hard.</p><p>\u201cHelp me get undressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to drink,\u201d I said, lips crushed against his ear.</p><p>\u201cI want to be inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink.\u201d I tilted my neck toward him. His fangs pricked the tender skin of my neck, sending a jolt of panic through me.</p><p>\u201cHeather?\u201d he whispered against my neck.</p><p>I wet my lips. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>His fangs sank into my neck and my fear vanished. I squirmed, rubbing myself against him as I experienced the most explosive connection I\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>Lust swamped me. I shivered with the intensity as he pressed me against his hard body and drank. My body stretched like a bow with sheer pleasure, held in place by Lucien\u2019s steady hands.</p><p>He was with me, alive. And he felt amazing.</p><p>I was wet, shaking, and on the verge of climax when Lucien sank back from me, dazed. \u201cIs this a dream?\u201d he asked, rolling me under him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, blinking back to reality. He was alive, and strong. I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cNot a dream.\u201d</p><p>There was stark, sexual hunger in his eyes. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>I was naked before I knew what had happened.</p><p>\u201cLucien\u2014\u201d His fingers found the core of me and I stopped complaining.</p><p>He drew me into the most erotic kiss of my life, his fingers exploring me until I thought I was about to scream from the intensity of it. A second later, I came.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I threw my head back against the couch. \u201cGod, you\u2019re polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d he said, pressing the tip of himself against me. His radiant blue eyes fastened on me. \u201cTell me you want it.\u201d</p><p>My breathing hitched. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>He drove into me, setting off another wave of pleasure. Sweet heaven, how could anything feel so good? I thought I\u2019d had men before but I\u2019d never had anyone like Lucien.</p><p>He pushed me. He filled me. He drove me to heights I hadn\u2019t even let myself imagine before.</p><p>I nipped at his shoulder, his neck, anything I could reach.</p><p>Lucien let his head drop. His face pressed against my shoulder as his fangs slid along my neck.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d I gasped as he bit me again.</p><p>Yes! I slammed hard against him as he drove into me. We took from each other and gave to each other until it was impossible to separate our two selves.</p><p>This time, I screamed as I came. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucien gasped and cried out as he stiffened above me. It was the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Afterward, we lay in a boneless puddle, Lucien on his back with one arm behind his head and me using his chest for a pillow.</p><p>It was safe to say I\u2019d cured him.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help grinning. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy head hurts.\u201d</p><p>I felt myself giggle. \u201cJoin the club.\u201d</p><p>He was kissing my hair, my forehead, my nose, pretty much any place he could reach. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a headache since 1908.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re due.\u201d</p><p>He found my lips again. The man could not keep his mouth to himself.</p> <p>\u201c1908, huh?\u201d I said, when I managed to extricate myself from yet another deep, hungry kiss (admittedly, I hadn\u2019t been trying very hard).</p><p>He scooted back on the couch and cradled me in next to him. \u201cI could tell you stories,\u201d he said, toying absently with my hair, \u201cif you\u2019d let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be nice.\u201d I\u2019d have to think on it.</p><p>He propped himself over me. \u201cHeather, not that I\u2019m complaining\u201d\u2014he caressed the stretch of skin between my ear and my chin\u2014\u201cbut what happened tonight?\u201d</p><p>I was almost afraid to tell him. \u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d</p><p>He looked somewhat embarrassed. \u201cI was at Nina\u2019s party, and then nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were drugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He seemed surprised. \u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlimprol.\u201d</p><p>His expression darkened. \u201cBliss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to himself, calculating. \u201cWhere is she now?\u201d</p><p>Just like that, I knew our alone time was over.</p><p>Lucky for me, I liked a good fight.</p> <p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>I strapped on my fixed-blade daggers, holstered my Glock 22 with silver bullets, added handcuffs, a stun gun, mace, and of course, my lucky boot knife.</p><p>It felt good to look like me again, with certain improvements. I wore a pair of black leather pants Tia had picked out, with a matching tank top that let me move.</p><p>Lucien watched me with obvious hunger, which I enjoyed thoroughly.</p><p>Probably because I knew he was going to do something about it later.</p><p>When I\u2019d double-checked my gun and finished with my daggers, he tucked a stray lock of hair behind my ear. \u201cThanks for saving my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Parts of me went gooey just thinking about it.</p><p>Vinny clomped through the kitchen, carrying a shotgun in each hand. \u201cNever mind the fact that I was stuck in the garage for the last two hours.\u201d</p><p>I checked the clock on the mantel. Two hours? I ran a palm up Lucien\u2019s arm, admiring his tight black T-shirt. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d The man had stamina.</p><p>\u201cAnd I had to send away the medic,\u201d Vinny grumbled. \u201cGood thing you weren\u2019t exactly subtle. I don\u2019t like surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does he think this is about him?\u201d I asked Lucien.</p><p>He kissed me on the nose. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Vinny headed for the front door. \u201cCan you knock it off? We have a tiger to cage.\u201d</p><p>It was about the only thing he could have said to move me from that spot.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d Lucien whispered, his breath hot against my ear.</p><p>God, I hoped so.</p><p>I admired his ass on the way to the front door. He wore jeans and combat boots, which was a very nice look for him. I was about to tell him so when we opened the door and found a visitor on the front stoop.</p><p>\u201cTia,\u201d I said, surprised. I remembered her following us earlier tonight, but I had no idea she\u2019d still be here.</p><p>She stood as soon as she saw us. Tia wore her dress from the dinner party, although it was torn on one shoulder and bore grass stains up the side. She\u2019d also lost her shoes.</p><p>Guilt pricked at me. I\u2019d been inside, having my way with Lucien, while she\u2019d been, well, what had she been doing?</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Vinny asked.</p><p>She ignored the question, eyes trained on me. \u201cI told you I needed to talk to you,\u201d she said, voice shaky.</p><p>\u201cThat you did.\u201d But I really didn\u2019t think she\u2019d camp out.</p><p>Vinny took her by the arm. \u201cDid someone attack you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d She seemed surprised. \u201cUm. No. I, well, it\u2019s hard to run in a dress.\u201d</p><p>Funny. That had been my point all along.</p><p>Tia being here was all fine and good, but we had to get moving. I\u2019d say we had barely an hour of darkness left.</p><p>I led her down the front walk while Lucien started up the car and Vinny loaded the trunk with shotguns. \u201cOkay, well what did you need to talk about? We\u2019re on our way to kick some tiger ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat drug you found in your drink,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was sparkly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to rush her, but as soon as Vinny went back for a few extra cases of silver bullets, we were leaving.</p><p>Tia touched my arm. \u201cSunny had been giving me vitamin supplements, for my husband. They were supposed to help him get extra nutrients, because, well, I\u2019m anemic and\u201d\u2014a blush crept up her cheeks\u2014\u201che only wanted to drink from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d I said, stunned that I almost understood.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she said dreamily. \u201cAnyway, it seemed he needed more. Or at least we thought he needed something. Thomas was getting more and more tired, until one day he decided to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Then it hit me. \u201cSunny was mixed up in Slimprol.\u201d</p><p>It made sense, and it didn\u2019t. Sunny and Bliss were friends, but Bliss didn\u2019t seem all that eager to share her pills\u2014or her secrets.</p><p>\u201cHow can we be sure?\u201d Lucien asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d She gripped my arm. \u201cThe vitamin supplements are blue and sparkly, about the size of an aspirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly hell.\u201d</p><p>Vinny slammed the trunk. \u201cAll set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the car,\u201d I told her.</p><p>I took a seat next to Lucien and yanked the door closed. \u201cSunny was giving Slimprol to Tia\u2019s husband, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>His expression hardened. \u201cHow can you know?\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes. \u201cI put one on his tongue every morning.\u201d She ended in a wail. \u201cI thought I was helping him. I love him! Why would Sunny want him to go to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Lucien said, pulling out of the drive. \u201cBut her husband, Gaston, is Thomas\u2019s business partner, correct?\u201d</p><p>Tia gave a sniffling nod.</p><p>\u201cPharmaceuticals,\u201d Lucien added.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to bet they\u2019re the makers of Slimprol?\u201d Vinny asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout a hundred billion percent.\u201d I wondered just what Sunny had gotten herself mixed up in. Tia, too.</p><p>\u201cIs he\u2014\u201d Tia sobbed, \u201cis he going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>Vinny patted Tia on the leg, clearly uncomfortable with the grieving woman next to him. \u201cHow long has your husband been taking it?\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him through red-rimmed eyes. \u201cSix years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOy,\u201d Vinny said.</p><p>\u201cVinny!\u201d If I could have flicked him on the head, I would have. We all knew it was bad. She didn\u2019t need to hear it from him.</p><p>What I wanted to know was, \u201cWhat\u2019s Sunny\u2019s husband been doing for the last six years?\u201d</p><p>Tia shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I saw him tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Lucien asked. \u201cIn Eternal Life Estates?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWhile I was waiting on the porch. But he didn\u2019t go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d he go?\u201d I asked, as we pulled up to Bliss\u2019s house, ready to spring into action. By the expression on Tia\u2019s face, I already knew.</p><p>\u201cI love when a plan comes together,\u201d Vinny said, cocking his shotguns like a Wild West cowboy.</p><p>\u201cYou call this a plan?\u201d I asked, on Lucien\u2019s heels.</p><p>Oh sure, we had Bliss and Gaston in one spot. \u201cIt also means we\u2019re about to barge in on a pissed-off weretiger and a bloodsucking vampire\u2014no offense, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken,\u201d he said, as we stalked to the front door, using the dense foliage as coverage. \u201cI think our biggest consideration is that I\u2019m still weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t shift,\u201d I said, \u201cnot so soon after interrogating.\u201d</p><p>Lucien gave me a long, concerned look as we waited for Vinny and Tia.</p><p>I held up my hands. \u201cHey, I can\u2019t change my nature.\u201d</p><p>He should know that by now.</p><p>\u201cHere, babe,\u201d Vinny said, handing Tia a shotgun.</p><p>Oh yeah. That was a good idea.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Lucien murmured, right before he rushed the door and kicked it in.</p><p>I sprinted after him with Vinny on my heels.</p><p>By the time I got there, Lucien was locked in combat with a white-haired vampire. In the split second it took for me to assess the situation, Bliss tackled me from behind.</p><p>My head smacked the ceramic floor and my vision swam.</p><p>Yip-yip-yip!</p><p>I turned over to see Chi-Chi launch herself at Bliss\u2019s neck. The tiger slapped the dog away. She yelped as she slammed against the wall, but it was enough time for me to unsheathe my dagger. It sliced Bliss across the chest and she roared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bliss shifted, lowering her head as tiger fur raced down her back.</p><p>Vinny fired his shotgun, blowing Gaston off of Lucien. I stood, wiping blood out of my eyes.</p><p>Gaston hissed, fangs bared. Lucien was pale and bloody. He launched himself at the white-haired vampire, but Gaston dodged, tossing Vinny through the front window. His body smashed through the glass.</p> <p>\u201cHeather!\u201d Tia screamed as Bliss readied to pounce.</p><p>I fired my pistol once. Twice. My silver bullets didn\u2019t even slow her down. The wounded tiger kept coming. She was after blood now and there was nothing I could do.</p><p>Vinny was out. Lucien was locked in his own life-or-death battle. Tia crouched in the corner.</p><p>\u201cTia!\u201d I screamed as Bliss landed on me like a two-ton brick. I pulled out my lucky boot knife, sinking it into her chest as she hit me. She kept coming. I hit the floor, rolling with her to keep her from taking out my neck, but it was just a matter of time. Only seconds.</p><p>My fingers gripped her coarse fur. It felt like time slowed as her sinewy muscles moved under my hands. She was a killing machine.</p> <p>I waited for the end as blood spurted across my face. At first, I thought it was mine and I marveled at how I didn\u2019t even feel any pain.</p><p>The tiger roared and fell backward. A large brown wolf had it by the neck.</p><p>I shot Bliss with my stun gun and reached for the last thing I had\u2014mace\u2014for all the good it would do us.</p><p>But Tia had the tiger in a death bite. Blood poured from the animal\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cE-yah!\u201d I turned just in time to see a bloody Vinny move up behind Gaston and stake the vampire in the back with a broken windowpane.</p><p>I stood for a moment, in shock, as Vinny helped Lucien pick his way through the pulpy mess formerly known as Gaston. Meanwhile Tia was using the tiger for a chew toy. I wiped my dagger on the curtains and resheathed it.</p> <p>Yip-yip-yip!</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Sparky?\u201d I scooped up Chi-Chi and together we surveyed the damage. Someone was going to need the services of about a dozen Vinnys in French maid costumes to clean up this place.</p><p>Gaston was clearly no more, which was a shame. I would have liked some answers. Then I saw a hairy tiger paw twitch.</p><p>\u201cTia, hold back.\u201d</p><p>The werewolf growled.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, now you get pushy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lucien asked behind me.</p><p>\u201cI think Bliss is alive.\u201d</p> <p>Between Lucien, Vinny, and me, we managed to tempt Tia away from her prey. Actually, it was Chi-Chi\u2019s idea. We used the steaks from the refrigerator, on a white plate for presentation. Tia was a sucker for white.</p><p>Bliss shifted back to human faster than any of us expected, but she was still weak enough that we managed to handcuff her to a pole in her garage.</p><p>I leaned against a silver Bentley while we waited for the Vampire Council police to arrive.</p><p>Bliss was blubbering by this time, although more for her vampire lover, it seemed, than for herself.</p><p>\u201cHe was the only man who ever loved me,\u201d she sobbed, clutching the housedress we\u2019d thrown around her.</p><p>I almost felt sorry for her.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>Gaston was not only a drug dealer, he was also a cheat.</p><p>\u201cHe had a wife,\u201d I reminded her.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t love them!\u201d she wailed. \u201cHe was impulsive. He didn\u2019t mean to marry them!\u201d</p><p>Say what? \u201cExactly how many wives are we talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly eight\u201d\u2014she sniffled\u2014\u201cmostly in Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy guy,\u201d Vinny said, feeding Chi-Chi yet another slice of steak.</p><p>She stared off dreamily. \u201cHe was supposed to take me to Italy next month.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cWatch out for blue pills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not be too far off,\u201d Lucien mused. \u201cWhat if he put them to sleep while he was gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sick,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMakes cheating easier if wifey doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re gone. We\u2019ll have to investigate further, but I\u2019ll bet some of these women are literally sleeping their lives away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d know.\u201d I\u2019d know if I was married to a seven-time bigamist. I hoped. I felt my gaze harden as Tia strolled up to the weeping tiger.</p><p>Blood streaked her arms and she wore a pale pink dressing gown Vinny had found in one of the closets. \u201cMy Thomas found out about the drug, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was high and mighty about it. He wanted to spill the whole thing to shareholders. Gaston didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d she said, as if that made a difference.</p><p>\u201cNo, he just put him to sleep,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the side effects?\u201d Tia demanded. \u201cHow do I bring him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You could ask Gaston but you killed him!\u201d Bliss collapsed into another round of sobbing.</p><p>That\u2019s when I knew. \u201cSunny figured it out, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Bliss sniffled. \u201cThe bitch. She couldn\u2019t just be happy being one of his wives. She had to be his only wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she know you were sleeping with him?\u201d Wild guess, but I wasn\u2019t about to try to enter her mind right now.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gulped, \u201cbut Sunny was going to tell about his other wives. She was going to bring in her wolf pack. She told me and Francine all about it.\u201d Her eyes were wild. \u201cShe was going to take him from me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you killed her,\u201d Lucien said.</p><p>She nodded, gulping. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I need a man. I have nothing. The damned dog has more than I do!\u201d</p><p>Chi-Chi growled.</p><p>Damned straight.</p><p>\u201cThe only money I had came from Nina,\u201d she said.</p><p>Right. \u201cYou mean from blackmailing Nina.\u201d</p><p>Who wasn\u2019t blackmailing Nina?</p><p>Bliss shrugged. \u201cShe had the money. And she\u2019s a slut.\u201d</p><p>Err ... pot calling kettle?</p><p>\u201cSunny\u2019s husband, Gaston. He was giving you money, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d asked Lucien.</p><p>Bliss stiffened. \u201cHe could afford it.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. Still, \u201cYou didn\u2019t love him. You just needed a sugar daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved him!\u201d she wailed. \u201cAnd I hated Sunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you kill her?\u201d Lucien demanded.</p><p>She cowered, trapped.</p><p>\u201cYou already told us you did it, Bliss,\u201d I reminded her. I could see how getting clocked with an ornate medieval chandelier would kill Sunny. But how had Bliss nailed her with it?</p><p>I could see her making her decision. Finally she relented. \u201cI snuck in while she was out mooning over that damned gardener. It didn\u2019t take long to cut the links on the chandelier.\u201d She gave a sullen look. \u201cI only had to knock it enough to spin free of the broken link for it to fall. I hated that god-awful piece of junk. He gave it to her. She didn\u2019t deserve anything from him. She didn\u2019t even see it coming.\u201d Tears welled in her eyes. \u201cNow he\u2019s never coming back.\u201d</p><p>I just hoped Tia\u2019s husband could.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>The werewolves arrived that morning. The war was off, which was great because my pack seemed more interested in raiding our kitchen than fighting. The vampires would arrive tonight.</p><p>Bliss was taken into custody by her own people, which I thought was horse pucky until Finnegan told me what they\u2019d probably do to her. It wasn\u2019t pretty, but at least she\u2019d live. Unlike Sunny.</p><p>That left Chi-Chi the Chihuahua at loose ends. I offered to take her in if she was willing to give up life on Mysteria Lane. From her enthusiastic wriggling, I figured she was up for the challenge.</p><p>We retreated back to the Duke house to wait for representatives from the Vampire Council. Nina sent her chef over to help out, which was pretty nice of her, all things considered.</p><p>He\u2019d loaded the granite countertops with meat pies, steak tartar and roasted venison. I slipped a bite to Chi-Chi and wondered if I should break it to the cook that we did eat other things besides meat. You know what, though? The guy looked happy. He was actually getting to cook for once, so I left him to it.</p><p>Tia had skipped her husband\u2019s pill that morning and had reported no results yet. She planned to sit with him all day, to see if she could detect a change.</p><p>I\u2019d spent as much time as I could that morning interrogating Francine and Nina, just to make sure there wasn\u2019t anything we\u2019d missed. Nina had been telling the truth all along. Good for her. And it turned out Francine was bald as a bat under that expensive brunette wig.</p><p>I insisted she remove it for the remainder of our questioning.</p><p>None of the residents of Mysteria Lane would be any wiser. But I\u2019d sure enjoyed it.</p><p>I managed a quick \u201chello\u201d with Lucien when he woke up for the evening. I made sure to show him exactly why I was so glad we\u2019d survived the night before. He returned the favor.</p><p>Twice.</p><p>I love it when the Vampire Council runs late.</p><p>But they eventually arrived. More\u2019s the pity. And went into closed meetings with Finnegan and our pack elders.</p><p>The pack used it as an excuse to enjoy an eighteenth course, courtesy of Nina\u2019s chef. I swear if he ever wanted to leave her, he\u2019d have his choice of about thirty slavering Topanga Pack members, ready to bow at his command. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Good food could do that to a wolf.</p><p>Vinny plucked a beef skewer off a silver tray and leaned up against the counter next to me. \u201cTia\u2019s husband woke up.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cFantastic. When?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout ten minutes ago. She skipped his evening meds. I helped her prop him up enough for a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. They\u2019re even louder than you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran like a girl.\u201d</p> <p>I smacked him on the arm, not really meaning it. I wished Lucien would get back soon. No telling how much time we\u2019d have before he had to be on to his next assignment.</p><p>The mere thought of it made my stomach hollow.</p><p>Suck it up, McPhee.</p><p>I\u2019d known this moment would come. I couldn\u2019t have Lucien forever, even if I wanted it.</p><p>And boy, did I want it.</p><p>The Vampire Council and the wolf elders made it back to the house alive, which was a good sign.</p> <p>Finnegan slapped me on the back so hard he almost knocked the wind out of me. \u201cThe war is off,\u201d he announced to the crowd at large. \u201cThanks to your hard work,\u201d he added under his breath.</p><p>Sure. Nothing like accolades for a job well done.</p><p>Oh, who was I kidding? I didn\u2019t need praise. I had a happy ending.</p><p>At least until, \u201cHi, Lucien.\u201d The corners of my mouth turned up as he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me on the head.</p><p>We ignored the catcalls from my pack mates.</p><p>Yeah, yeah.</p><p>McPhee was smiling. McPhee was smitten.</p><p>McPhee was in love.</p> <p>Damn it all.</p><p>I vowed to keep my pride. I\u2019d let him go when the time came. I just hoped it wouldn\u2019t be tonight.</p><p>\u201cHeather,\u201d he said into my hair, \u201cwe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Damn.</p><p>I felt my smile falter. \u201cSure. Whatever you say.\u201d</p><p>He led me out of the packed kitchen and upstairs to his room.</p><p>Hoo-boy. To be dumped in the same spot where we\u2019d made love this evening. I could hardly wait. Then again, maybe this was for the best. I\u2019d know it was over. We\u2019d make a clean break. I could do this.</p><p>I let out a hard breath.</p><p>This was worse than preparing for a fight.</p><p>\u201cHeather.\u201d Lucien held my hand, his expression earnest. Curse him and his amazing body and his gorgeous lips and the way he made me feel hot even now when I knew he was about to hightail it out of town.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, unable to stand it. \u201cI know you have to leave. You said it before we ever got involved.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t his fault.</p><p>It was mine for being stupid enough to fall for him.</p><p>\u201cI do have to leave,\u201d he said, in that same infuriatingly calm tone.</p><p>I was so tempted to use my truth powers on him. My chin lowered and I stopped myself. What was the point? I already knew he was heading out for the next assignment.</p><p>Damn the man. Would it kill him to be a little upset about this? Meanwhile my insides felt like they\u2019d turned to glue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading down to New Orleans,\u201d he said, oblivious. \u201cWe\u2019re looking into a coven of voodoo mambos turned vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds lovely,\u201d I said, just trying to make it through the conversation with my pride intact. In a second, I was going to cry.</p><p>He caressed my cheek, which made it worse.</p><p>Could we just get to the dumping part?</p><p>\u201cIt will be amazing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cIf you join me,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He looked vulnerable all of a sudden. \u201cI could use a were who can make people tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>Was he actually saying what I thought he was saying? \u201cI\u2019m not even sure it works on vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me if I care.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t leave with him. I didn\u2019t quite know why, but I knew there was a reason it had never occurred to me. \u201cYou can do this on your own,\u201d I said, making complete sense.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be half as much fun,\u201d he said playfully.</p><p>Maybe so, but, \u201cMy pack needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can fly back home if they do.\u201d</p><p>I tangled my hands in my lap. \u201cFinnegan would never let me go.\u201d</p><p>He untangled them. \u201cI made it part of our negotiations this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve known all along.\u201d He brushed his lips over mine. \u201cGo with me, Heather. Let\u2019s see where this leads.\u201d</p><p>I pulled back, but not so far as to unwrap my hands from his. \u201cIt can\u2019t be this easy,\u201d I said, trying to reason with him.</p><p>Nothing in my life had ever been this easy.</p><p>It could be amazing.</p><p>\u201cHeather?\u201d he asked, waiting for my answer.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to beg. I liked that in a vampire. Oh my God, was I actually considering this?</p><p>\u201cVoodoo vampires, huh?\u201d I asked. It could be interesting. And I\u2019d never been to New Orleans.</p><p>\u201cIf I go\u201d\u2014I ran a finger down his chest\u2014\u201cwill I get to sleep next to you?\u201d</p><p>He pulled me closer. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A smile tickled the edges of my lips. \u201cKiss you?\u201d</p><p>His voice grew husky. \u201cI hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I have to let you bite me?\u201d I hoped.</p><p>He nibbled kisses along the soft spot in front of my ear. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>I tilted his chin my way for a long, lingering kiss.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, before I lost all control and jumped headlong into bed with him. \u201cI\u2019ll go to New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d He let out a very unvampirish whoop before tackling me back onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cBut I have a few rules,\u201d I said, wriggling against him. Anticipating what was to come.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he said, propped above me.</p><p>\u201cI will not wear high heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI absolutely refuse to do any more breaking and entering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrude.\u201d</p><p>He kissed his way down my neck until I almost forgot rule number three. \u201cAnd,\u201d I said, running my fingers through his thick, blond hair, \u201cI will not fall in love with you.\u201d</p><p>I could feel him smile against my neck. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>WEREWOLVES IN CHIC CLOTHING</p><p>TAMI DANE</p><p>Michelle Stewart waited her whole life for something exciting to happen.

In reality, Michelle wouldn\u2019t live to see any of her dreams come true....</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>I think I might have just moved into Stepford. If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you know what I\u2019m talking about. If you haven\u2019t ... what are you waiting for? The Stepford Wives (I\u2019m talking about the original film) is a classic.</p><p>Back to Stepford. Why do I think I\u2019ve moved there? Let me paint a visual picture for you. I was driving a rusty U-Haul, twenty-five years\u2019 worth of personal possessions, including my collection of vintage purses, packed into beat-up cardboard boxes. I was rolling past one perfectly kept home after another. The flower gardens were weed-free, grass freshly mowed. And everyone I saw was smiling.</p><p>It was damned creepy.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019d lived in the city too long. I wanted to hear someone yell, \u201cFuck you!\u201d I ached for the reassuring sound of a horn blaring in anger. Instead, I was getting happy birdsong and the distant rumble of a lawn mower.</p><p>Why did this bother me so much? Because if this suburban nirvana was anything like Stepford, there was absolutely no way I was going to fit in. I hate cooking. I kill plants. I\u2019ve never been crafty.</p><p>And ... what the hell was I doing?</p><p>You\u2019d better be worth it, Jonathan Stewart.</p><p>One look at Jonathan Stewart, and almost every niggling doubt in my mind immediately evaporated.</p><p>Hellooooo, handsome.</p><p>FYI, Jonathan Stewart, my soon-to-be fianc\u00e9, is traffic-stopping gorgeous. He\u2019s also powerful, successful, generous, kind\u2014downright perfect ... and he was standing in his driveway, wearing the world\u2019s biggest smile.</p><p>I am the luckiest woman alive.</p><p>Now, back to my story.</p><p>Jonathan was at my door, yanking it open before I\u2019d even gotten the truck shifted into PARK. \u201cHello, beautiful,\u201d he said, pulling me out of the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cHello back,\u201d I said, sliding my arms around his waist. We kissed, and I saw stars. I heard angels singing, too. Then again, that might\u2019ve been the robins. My knees were a little wobbly by the time the kiss ended.</p><p>Jon brushed my windblown hair out of my face. \u201cHow was your drive? I wish you would have let me handle the move for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy drive was fine, thank you. And there was no point in hiring movers to load a few cardboard boxes.\u201d I motioned toward the house, which was huge and immaculate. \u201cSo, this is where you live?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe. This is where we live.\u201d Jon stepped to the side, one arm still curled around my waist. He motioned to his picture-perfect brick house. \u201cChristine Price\u2014soon to be Christine Stewart\u2014welcome home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d I echoed, letting him guide me inside. \u201cOh ... wow.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe this ... showroom ... was going to be my home. First, it was huge, but I\u2019d already said that. And beautifully decorated, and ... there was absolutely no way the particleboard and laminate \u201cfurniture\u201d I\u2019d just hauled across three states was going to fit in here. We meandered through the foyer, past the sweeping staircase leading to the second floor, down a hallway that led to the rear of the house. On our way, we strolled past a formal living room that looked like it had never been used, past a formal dining room that also looked unused, and finally an office-slash-library. The hall ended at an open space housing the family room and eat-in kitchen.</p><p>In the family room my eyes jumped from one thing to another. The sectional sofa screamed, Sit on me! The ginormous flat panel TV on a wall gleamed in the sunlight. A pair of comfy-looking leather club chairs created a cozy nook that inspired me to grab a book and cuddle up to read. The floor-to-ceiling windows lining the back wall beckoned me, the lush green landscape beyond framed in drapes (were they ... happy sigh! ... silk?).</p> <p>The whole place whispered expensive. Tasteful. Classy.</p><p>Jon looked proud. \u201cI want this place to feel like home. If there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like to change\u2014and I\u2019m hoping there is\u2014I want you to do it. Just tell me what you want, what you need, and I\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d</p><p>I tested one of the chairs. Heaven. \u201cThanks,\u201d I said, beaming as I ran my hand over the arm. I pulled in a deep breath, drawing in the scrumptious scent of the leather and the equally intoxicating aroma of the man standing next to me. Whatever cologne he was wearing, it was pure aphrodisiac. \u201cBut everything looks so new. I don\u2019t see why we\u2019d need to change a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Do whatever you want.\u201d He grabbed my hands, eyes twinkling, and pulled me to my feet. \u201cDon\u2019t get too comfortable yet. I still need to show you the rest of the house.\u201d</p><p>He escorted me into the kitchen, which sported all the essentials of fine suburban living. Stainless steel appliances, natural stone countertops, beautiful wood cabinets and floor. There were two ovens. Two. I rarely put one to use. How would I ever find a reason to use two? Jon informed me the stove was a chef\u2019s stove, whatever that meant. It was big and looked dangerous. I decided I\u2019d stick with microwaving for now. The fridge, on the other hand, was also enormous but not at all scary. It was well stocked with all my favorite foods. There was even a month\u2019s worth of my fave ice cream in the freezer.</p> <p>This man deserved a kiss. I gave him one. And a second. And a third.</p><p>He growled like a man-bear\u2014how I adore the way he growls\u2014scooped me up into his arms, and turned a one-eighty, heading back toward the front of the house.</p><p>With one arm looped around his neck, I swallowed a girly giggle. Would this be my life from now on? Filled with toe-curling kisses, manly growls, and a never-ending supply of German chocolate ice cream? I didn\u2019t dare hope so. A past full of heartache, hardship, and frustration had shattered the lenses in my rose-colored glasses a long time ago.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t enjoy this moment.</p><p>\u201cNow, to show you our room.\u201d Upstairs, Jon turned into the first room on the right, and I literally gasped.</p><p>\u201cNo way. Is this really our bedroom?\u201d I asked, gaping like a kid who\u2019d just stepped into the world\u2019s largest toy store. I was beginning to see a trend here. The bed, just like the stove and refrigerator and television downstairs, was gigantic. Who would need so much space to sleep? Then again, I wondered if that space was intended for something else, something besides sleep. As a few possibilities played through my mind, I licked my lips.</p> <p>Jon said, \u201cI just had this room redesigned. But if you don\u2019t like it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jon dropped me on the bed. It was like landing on a cloud. He palmed my cheeks and stared into my eyes, his expression dark and manly and one hundred percent sexy. \u201cI want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling I\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bet I\u2019ll do everything in my power to make sure of that.\u201d He tipped his head, and I closed my eyes, bracing for another mind-blowing kiss. But a knock on the door had me snapping them open and Jon jerking back.</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d Joshua, Jon\u2019s twelve-year-old son, was standing just inside the door, his cell phone in his hand. He had the world\u2019s worst timing. But I\u2019d heard that was true for all kids. \u201cCan I go to Ethan\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>I scrambled to my feet and tried to pretend my face wasn\u2019t about to combust into flames. I was slightly aware of Jon pushing to his feet beside me.</p><p>I stuttered, \u201cJosh, it\u2019s good seeing you again.\u201d</p> <p>Josh gave me one of those looks, the kind that said, \u201cyeah, whatever.\u201d</p><p>Jon said, \u201cJosh, I told you, I need your help today. Christine\u2019s moving in.\u201d</p><p>Josh\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cBut Dad, it\u2019s Labor Day weekend. School starts Tuesday. It\u2019s my last weekend of summer vacation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d I whispered, turning to face my hot, sexy almost-fianc\u00e9. \u201cIf you\u2019re making Josh stay home for my sake, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019d rather he go play with his friends, have fun.\u201d</p><p>Josh adopted a convincing sad puppy expression.</p><p>Jon thought about it.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Josh said, his voice doing that preteen-boy cracking thing. Ugh. I was about to become a stepmom to a teenager. Good times were coming my way. I could see it already. \u201cI\u2019ll be back by seven. That\u2019ll still give you plenty of time to make me work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. By seven. Not a minute later.\u201d</p><p>Josh roared out of the house as fast as his twelve-year-old legs could take him. When the deep thump of the front door slamming echoed through the house, Jon strolled to the bedroom door and closed it. Turning, he gave me a look hot enough to melt lead. \u201cNow, where were we?\u201d</p><p>I fell onto the mattress, batting my eyelashes at him. \u201cI think you were about to make me very happy\u2014\u201d I gave a little shriek as he pounced on me like an overgrown jungle cat.</p><p>Angled over me, Jon gave me a Cheshire grin. \u201cAh, yes. And so I was.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so there was at least one thing about this Stepford setup I\u2019d like....</p><p>Jon nibbled on my earlobe.</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>\u201cUrk,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Jon said. He scowled. \u201cThe hell with it. They\u2019ll go away.\u201d He went back to nibbling, and I went back to melting.</p><p>The freaking doorbell rang a second time. Jon kept on nipping my neck, but I wasn\u2019t into it anymore. I was distracted. When the bell rang a third time, I shoved him. \u201cOkay, Dracula\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a silly pet name, but the man has a thing for necks\u2014\u201cwe\u2019re going to have to take a timeout. I can\u2019t get into the mood with all that ding-donging.\u201d</p><p>Jon sighed. It was his turn to give a sad puppy look. It was clear where Joshua had learned it.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t work.\u201d I pushed on his chest until he was upright.</p><p>\u201cBut it worked for Josh.\u201d Ding dong. \u201cIgnore it.\u201d He grabbed my hand, flipped it over, and scattered tickly little kisses over the inside of my wrist.</p><p>Ding dong.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ignore it.\u201d</p><p>Ding dong.</p><p>Sheesh, whoever that was, they were persistent.</p><p>Jon motioned to me. \u201cStay put. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>I decided I was okay with that plan ... until I heard a woman\u2019s voice downstairs. Laughing.</p><p>I\u2019d just left the best job of my life, said sayonara to every friend I had in the world, and hauled everything I owned three hundred miles. I didn\u2019t do that to sit upstairs and listen to my soon-to-be husband flirt with another woman.</p><p>After a quick mirror check\u2014a girl needs to make a good first impression\u2014I headed downstairs to see why my not-quite fianc\u00e9 hadn\u2019t returned to me yet.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t happy with what I saw when I reached the foyer. The world\u2019s most perfect woman\u2014Stepford, I\u2019m telling you\u2014was standing a little too close to Jon for my comfort. She was holding a covered Pyrex pan with something red in it. As I stepped onto the stone tile, the visitor\u2019s attention snapped to me. So did Jon\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said to them both.</p><p>Jon and the Stepford wife began chattering at the same time. Jon stopped.</p><p>Mrs. Perfect beamed at me. Perfect blond hair. Perfect makeup. Her dress was very well-maintained vintage. 1950s. Silk. I was guessing Harvey Berin. She was wearing a wedding ring. \u201cHello, Christine, I\u2019m Samantha Phillips. I live next door. So good to meet you at last.\u201d She shoved the hot dish into my hands, cherry pot holders keeping them from blistering. \u201cI made a pan of lasagna, thinking you\u2019d probably be too busy to cook tonight.\u201d</p><p>The scents of tomato sauce and garlic and cheese tickled my nose. \u201cHow thoughtful. Thank you.\u201d I took the pan to the kitchen and set it on the stove. I heard Jon and Samantha following me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jon echoed.</p><p>When I turned around, I found Samantha standing with her hands clasped in front of her A-line skirt. I shoved the pot holders into her empty hands. \u201cThanks again.\u201d</p><p>She jammed one hand into a skirt pocket, produced a business card. \u201cI guess I should get going. Don\u2019t want to keep you from your work.\u201d She extended her arm, offering the card. \u201cIf you need help with anything, please don\u2019t hesitate to call. I\u2019m home all day. I can be here in a blink. Michelle and I used to\u2014\u201d She cut herself off. \u201cForgive me. Michelle was a good friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand.\u201d I accepted the card and set it on the counter. \u201cThanks again. I\u2019ll keep your offer in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. I can see myself out.\u201d Samantha threw a cute little wave at Jon and hustled toward the door. I watched Jon watch her leave. When he finally glanced my way, I probably wasn\u2019t looking too happy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. Samantha and my first wife were close. She had a very hard time after Michelle died. But I\u2019d rather not talk about that right now.\u201d He hauled me into his arms. \u201cMichelle was my past. You are my future. And if you\u2019re worried about Samantha, don\u2019t be,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s very happily married. And I\u2019m very happily almost-married.\u201d</p><p>The man knew just what to say.</p><p>He also knew just what to do. He kissed me until I couldn\u2019t breathe and I\u2019d forgotten all about whatshername and her lasagna and her stupid cherry pot holders.</p> <p>Oh yes, I was definitely feeling better now. Warm. Tingly. Happy.</p><p>\u201cShall we head back upstairs?\u201d I asked, dragging my fingernails down his chest. I hadn\u2019t seen that chest in three weeks. Long-distance dating sucked. It was so good to be done with that now.</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s go.\u201d Jon tossed me over his shoulder like a caveman. I gave a little shriek of surprise, flopping over to give his cute butt a smack. He gave me one in return as he headed toward the staircase.</p><p>Then the doorbell rang again.</p><p>\u201cOhmygod,\u201d I said to his back. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIgnore it.\u201d</p> <p>Ding dong.</p><p>Still atop Jon\u2019s shoulder, I wriggled. \u201cI just want to have sex. Who would\u2019ve thought that would be such a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a problem. Let\u2019s go have sex.\u201d</p><p>Ding dong.</p><p>\u201cNo. Set me down.\u201d</p><p>Jon grunted.</p><p>Down I slid. On the way, I happened to notice he was sporting a somewhat obvious hard-on. I motioned to his crotch. \u201cYou might want to cover that up.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down, looked up, and gave me a crooked grin. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll chase whoever it is away so we can get back to what we were doing.\u201d He yanked open the door, and another attractive woman stepped into my new home.</p> <p>The woman either didn\u2019t see me or didn\u2019t care. Tall. Brunette. Slim. And also well dressed\u2014her clothes weren\u2019t designer, but they looked like they\u2019d been tailored to fit her perfectly. She blurted, \u201cJon, I need to talk to you right now about Carson. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsay Baker,\u201d Jon interrupted, motioning toward me. \u201cThis is Christine. Christine\u2019s moving in today.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay finally realized I was standing there. \u201cOh! Hello.\u201d She shook my hand. \u201cSo good to meet you. Welcome to the neighborhood.\u201d She thumbed over her shoulder, toward the open door behind her. \u201cI live across the street.\u201d Looking slightly wilted, she frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot you were moving in today. Jon told me last week. He\u2019s been very excited.\u201d She glanced at Jon. \u201cI\u2019m guessing Samantha\u2019s already been by to welcome Christine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I said. \u201cShe brought lasagna.\u201d That was slightly bitchy of me to rub it in, I\u2019ll admit. I\u2019ll probably pay for it, one way or another.</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s smile was only slightly forced. \u201cOf course she brought lasagna. Enjoy. The woman is the best cook on the block, now that Michelle\u2014I mean, Samantha makes everything from scratch. Me, I\u2019m lucky if I don\u2019t burn a frozen pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d I admitted. Two neighbors. Two welcomes. And both had mentioned Michelle, Jon\u2019s deceased wife. I was beginning to worry I had some insanely perfect shoes to fill.</p><p>We exchanged a smile. For some reason, regardless of her mention of Michelle, I had a feeling I might get along with this neighbor. The jury was still out on Samantha.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I guess I\u2019ll head out now. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re both very\u201d\u2014Lindsay\u2019s gaze paused on Jon\u2019s crotch before jerking away\u2014\u201cbusy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming by.\u201d Jon grabbed the doorknob, ready to close the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d On the porch now, Lindsay spun around to face him. She opened her mouth to say something but then shut it. \u201cYes.\u201d She waved at me. \u201cAgain, welcome. If there\u2019s anything you need, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I waved back.</p><p>Jon shut the door. He gave me a look that made my heart flutter. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get back to welcoming you home\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ding dong.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cWe might as well forget it. It\u2019s not happening. I didn\u2019t know you were so popular.\u201d We\u2019d met on an online dating site. Jon had flown out to meet me exactly one month after we\u2019d started chatting online. And he\u2019d made the trip every other weekend after that, for the next five months. I mentioned, once or twice, coming out to see him instead, but he\u2019d insisted it was better for him to do the traveling. He could write it off as a business expense. I couldn\u2019t. And once I got over the suspicion that he was actually married and trying to keep me from finding out, I couldn\u2019t argue with that logic. All that to say, this was the first time I\u2019d seen him in his hometown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2018popular,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cMy neighbors are all just extremely nosy. You\u2019re the first woman who\u2019s been in my house since ... since Michelle died.\u201d</p><p>While our two visitors had already mentioned his wife, today was the first time Jon had actually said her name in my presence. I saw that as a sign. \u201cSpeaking of Michelle, you promised to tell me what happened when I moved in. So I knew how to handle Josh. Here I am.\u201d</p><p>He started to respond, but the doorbell cut him off. He lifted an index finger.</p><p>Ding dong.</p><p>He opened the door to reveal yet another attractive woman. Stepford Wife Number Three was suited up tight in Hugo Boss, her hair coiled on the back of her head. Her makeup was flawless but understated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if this is a bad time... .\u201d The woman, who was still standing on the front porch peered in at me. \u201c... but I saw Samantha and Lindsay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course it\u2019s not a bad time.\u201d Jon motioned her inside. \u201cThis is Christine. Christine, this is Erica Ross. She lives next door\u2014on the other side.\u201d He motioned toward the opposite side of our home.</p><p>\u201cGood to meet you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the neighborhood,\u201d Erica said, shaking my hand. She produced a card. \u201cIf you need anything, feel free to call. I work quite a bit, but my husband\u2019s home with the kids during the day. Adam\u2019s pretty handy\u2014unlike Jon here.\u201d Erica and Jon exchanged a smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Jon admitted. \u201cI won\u2019t even try to argue with that. Which is why I have a list of trusted contractors on file.\u201d</p><p>Erica continued, \u201cMichelle used to call Adam whenever she had a minor emergency. Plugged sink, that kind of thing. He doesn\u2019t mind at all. Gives him something to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d I put the card in my pocket.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jon echoed, looking like he might shove the woman out if she didn\u2019t leave on her own.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay,\u201d Erica said, turning toward the exit. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to meet a client. But I didn\u2019t want to go without at least saying hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was very thoughtful. Thanks.\u201d I gave her a wave as she hurried out the door.</p><p>Jon closed and locked the door behind her. \u201cOkay, now that\u2019s enough of the neighbors. I don\u2019t give a damn if the mayor rings my doorbell to give you the keys to the city. I\u2019m not answering. We\u2019re going to our room.\u201d He grabbed my hand and took the stairs two at a time. \u201cI\u2019m going to have sex with you if it kills me.\u201d</p><p>Kills him? I wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to that statement.</p><p>The truth of the matter was, the moment was over. Between worrying about being interrupted again, and curiosity about the wife Jon hadn\u2019t talked about before today, I was more interested in getting back to the discussion we\u2019d started before Erica\u2019s entry.</p><p>Once we were inside the bedroom, Jon, true to form, went for my neck.</p><p>I held him off with outstretched hands. \u201cHang on, there, Dracula. I want to talk about Michelle first. How did she die?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jon said, sitting on the bed. What do you want toto know about my first wife?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Standing next to the door, I said, \u201cWell, how she died, for starters.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded. Looking solemn, he patted the bed, inviting me to sit beside him. I did. \u201cMichelle had a lot of issues. Emotional problems. Not many people knew. Not her friends. Not her parents. Not even Josh. Only her doctors and me. It started almost immediately after we were married. She seemed happy for a little while, maybe six months or so, but then my crazy work schedule got to her. She became lonely. Depressed. I suggested we start trying to have a child, and her mood picked up again.\u201d His smile was wistful, sweet. \u201cI thought we were going to be okay. But when she didn\u2019t get pregnant right away, her depression came back. And it was worse. I suggested we give up, think about adopting to take the pressure off. She insisted we keep trying. So we saw a specialist. Had some tests run. Turns out she had some kind of hormonal imbalance. She was given some pills and a few months later, she was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t gotten to the part about her dying, but I was willing to be patient. This was, by far, the most words I\u2019d heard Jon speak consecutively since meeting him. He wasn\u2019t the chit-chatty kind.</p><p>\u201cAfter Joshua came home, things were good. Perfect. She was busy. Happy. She poured her energy into taking care of our son. She volunteered at his school. She made cupcakes for his bake sales. She helped him with his homework and hauled him to soccer practice and baseball games. Her world revolved around our boy for ten years. She was a wonderful mother. A wonderful wife. But when he started to become more independent\u2014as is normal for boys that age\u2014she told me she was ready to have another child. And I was glad to try for another, especially if it meant she\u2019d be happy. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t so easy. She took hormone treatments. But they didn\u2019t help. We even tried IVF. Nothing worked. One day, two years ago, I came home from work to find she\u2019d killed herself.\u201d Jon blinked. His eyes reddened. He sniffled. \u201cI never thought... .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I set my hand over Jon\u2019s. His was trembling. Made me wonder, was he over his wife\u2019s death? \u201cTwo years isn\u2019t a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I even went to a counselor for a while.\u201d He didn\u2019t exactly sound okay. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried that I\u2019ll be comparing you to Michelle all the time, please don\u2019t be. I told you she was my past, and I meant it. She\u2019s gone. I\u2019m ready to move on. I\u2019m looking back now only because you asked me to. From this point forward, we\u2019ll be looking to the future. Our future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d I wasn\u2019t one hundred percent convinced. \u201cI quit my job for you. I gave up my apartment. I don\u2019t have a safety net, if this doesn\u2019t work out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need one, Christine. Trust me. Please.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to trust him. I was almost afraid not to.</p> <p>Shifting to face me, he took my hands in his. \u201cLook, I told you things won\u2019t be perfect. And it won\u2019t be easy. My hours are crazy. I\u2019m not home much. Josh will need time to adjust to having another woman in the house. But I will be here for you, just like I was for Michelle.\u201d</p><p>Feeling slightly chilled, I crossed my arms over my chest. \u201cI\u2019m a little scared. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. I would be, too.\u201d He pulled me into a hug. I relaxed in his embrace. He was warm and strong and I wanted to believe he was the man of my dreams. Easing back, he brushed my hair out of my face and gave me a sweet, gentle kiss. \u201cI want you to always feel you can be honest with me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, there\u2019s one room I haven\u2019t had a chance to show you yet. I think now\u2019s the time.\u201d He stood, offering his hand. I accepted it. Down we went, to the main floor of the house, through the kitchen, and down a second, steeper set of stairs to the finished basement.</p><p>I stopped at the bottom of the steps, clapped my hands over my mouth. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I said through my fingers, my eyes sweeping over the bright, cheery space. I saw three long counters, dotted with various sewing machines. Three dress forms stood along one wall, in front of floor-to-ceiling shelves. And sitting on a stand was a very special machine.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your sewing studio,\u201d Jon said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d I made a beeline for the commercial grade embroidery machine. That one alone cost anywhere from ten to fifteen thousand dollars. I\u2019d been dreaming of getting one for ages. Gaping, I glanced around the room again. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to have everything you\u2019d need to make your dream come true. I couldn\u2019t expect you to launch your clothing line with that rusty old Singer of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you for real?\u201d I asked, throwing my arms around his neck. I kissed him all over his face. \u201cOhmygod, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d His eyes twinkled. How I adored those twinkles. I adored a lot more than his twinkles. Just tell me this man is everything he seems to be. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve seen your surprise, how about we get that truck unpacked?\u201d</p><p>I could care less about all the crap I\u2019d hauled here now. Outside of my clothes and a few personal items, none of it was worth anything. None of it would fit in this glorious house. But I had to return the truck to U-Haul in the morning. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Jon gave my butt a little tap as he led me toward the garage. \u201cAnd maybe when we\u2019re done, you\u2019d like to take a nice, long bath... .\u201d A bath? My apartment had only had a tiny shower stall. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d taken a bath. \u201c... together.\u201d</p><p>A hot man. A gorgeous house. A dream studio. Could my life get any better than this?</p> <p>\u201cAnd tomorrow, you can go shopping for material,\u201d he added.</p><p>Shopping?</p><p>I wasn\u2019t in Stepford. I was in heaven.</p><p>The next morning, I was sorting through my sewing pattern collection when the doorbell rang. Jon was upstairs sleeping. So was Joshua. That meant it was up to me to answer. Looking glorious (not) in a ratty pair of sweats, a T-shirt that said, NY L OVES ME, and a ponytail, no makeup, I checked the clock as I padded barefoot to the front door.</p><p>The bell rang two more times before I finally answered.</p><p>What a surprise (not). It was Samantha, Lindsay, and Erica. Samantha was holding a plate covered in foil. Lindsay had a steaming carafe of something that smelled incredible, and Erica was holding a white bakery box.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d I stepped aside to invite them in. \u201cWhat a surprise. At nine o\u2019clock in the morning. On Labor Day weekend.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay, donning a semi-scowl, gave me a quick up-and-down inspection. \u201cWe didn\u2019t wake you, I hope.\u201d She lifted the carafe. \u201cI brought caffeine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t wake me, and thanks.\u201d I had to admit, nobody had ever gone to such lengths to make me feel welcome before. In the city, it was a big deal if my neighbors gave me a little nod in the stairwell. I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about this. Was it a suburbia thing?</p><p>\u201cI made muffins this morning. They just came out of the oven,\u201d Samantha said as she click-clacked past me.</p><p>\u201cI brought bagels.\u201d Erica, following on Samantha\u2019s heels, lifted the box. \u201cI hope you like Einstein\u2019s Everything bagels.\u201d</p><p>I motioned them all into the kitchen. \u201cI do, thanks.\u201d After four tries, I found the cupboard with the cups. I grabbed four and set them on the island-slash-breakfast bar. Then I went in search of plates.</p><p>\u201cI just love Everything bagels,\u201d Lindsay said, pulling out a stool and sitting.</p><p>\u201cMe too. The saltier and garlickier the better,\u201d Erica said, sitting beside Lindsay.</p><p>\u201cI prefer plain,\u201d Samantha said, taking the third stool.</p><p>Standing on the opposite side of the bar, I placed a plate in front of each of them.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lindsay poured a steaming cup of coffee and handed it to me. I took a whiff. My mouth watered. \u201cWhat kind of coffee is this?\u201d I sipped. Delicious. But hot. I set down the cup to look for knives.</p><p>\u201cMy own blend. I may not bake.\u201d Lindsay put a bagel on her plate. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not much of a cook. But when it comes to coffee, I know a thing or two. Erica, tell me you didn\u2019t forget cream cheese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Erica spread a handful of little packets on the counter.</p><p>We all settled in, nibbling on the world\u2019s best muffins and munching on bagels for a few minutes.</p><p>It was Lindsay who eventually broke the silence. \u201cWe thought we owed you an apology for yesterday,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cOh? Why\u2019s that?\u201d I asked around a mouthful of muffin.</p><p>\u201cBecause we all just met you, and right off the bat we were talking about Michelle,\u201d Erica said. \u201cTalk about insensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand.\u201d I spread some more cream cheese on my bagel. \u201cJon told me you were close friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we were. For ten years. Since the day they moved in.\u201d Lindsay gave me a charming smile. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t be friends with you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d At least, I thought I was glad. A part of me was unsure about this whole thing. These three women, The Pack, seemed a little too eager to be my friends. It was odd. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJon told us you were living in New York,\u201d Erica said. \u201cI imagine you think we\u2019re strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, of course I don\u2019t.\u201d I felt my face warming.</p><p>Erica laughed. She tucked her hair behind her ear, revealing a simple, but pretty, diamond earring. \u201cLiar. I lived in New York for two years before I married Adam.\u201d She glanced down at the enormous diamond ring on her finger. \u201cThis has got to be a culture shock for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, maybe it\u2019s a little strange,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>The three friends exchanged nods.</p><p>Samantha, looking as perfect and perky as ever, smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re not as desperate for friendship as you probably think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re desperate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to be friendly.\u201d Samantha leaned closer. \u201cYou see, you don\u2019t know it yet, but you\u2019re going to need all the friends you can get.\u201d</p> <p>Now, that was a weird thing to say.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause that man upstairs\u2014the one you\u2019re about to marry\u2014he\u2019s not exactly what he appears to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think he killed his wife,\u201d Lindsay whispered.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cShe committed suicide,\u201d I said, wondering why they would think such a thing.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know these women. They could be lying to make me leave. Maybe they\u2019re all in love with Jon.</p><p>\u201cSuicide? That\u2019s what he told you?\u201d Giving me a pitying look, Erica shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie. If you don\u2019t believe us\u2014and really, why would you?\u2014check it out for yourself.\u201d She motioned for a pen with her hand. I found one in a drawer, along with a little spiral notebook. She pulled a sheet out and wrote a website on it, folded it, and handed it to me. \u201cI hate to be the one to tell you this, but Jonathan Stewart was investigated for murder. He hasn\u2019t been brought up on charges ... yet. They couldn\u2019t find enough evidence. But the case is still open. Here\u2019s the write-up in our local paper.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay reached for my hand. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>I was dumbfounded. Speechless. What the hell was this? \u201cJon said she was depressed,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t get pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepressed?\u201d Samantha pulled a cell phone out of her pocket, hit some buttons, and handed it to me. \u201cDepressed people isolate themselves from friends, from family. They don\u2019t go to parties. They don\u2019t laugh with friends. This picture was taken the day before Michelle died. At our neighborhood block party. Does she look like she was isolating herself?\u201d</p><p>I looked.</p><p>First, Michelle could pass for my doppelganger. That was freaky enough. But second, she looked like she was having a great time at the party. And when I say great, that might be a slight understatement.</p><p>A shiver swept up my spine.</p> <p>\u201cThere are more pictures,\u201d Samantha said. \u201cHit the button.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to see more.\u201d I handed Samantha the phone and glanced down at my plate. My appetite was gone. Had I made the mistake of a lifetime? Had I left my job, my life, to move in with a murderer? \u201cThe pictures don\u2019t prove anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. They don\u2019t,\u201d Erica said. \u201cBut we\u2019re hoping the police will find some solid proof soon. You could help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to dig for clues while I\u2019m living with a man you believe killed his wife?\u201d This was crazy. Insane. Unbelievable.</p><p>I needed to find out more. About Jon, yes. But also about these women. I was having some doubts about Jon. Any girl would. After all, I\u2019d learned a long time ago that something\u2014or someone\u2014who seemed too good to be true generally was. But I was also having some suspicions about my three neighbors. What were their stories? Why were they so hell-bent on convincing me Jon killed his wife?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust us. I can appreciate that,\u201d Erica said. \u201cAt this point, all you have is what we\u2019ve told you. But once you do a little digging, you\u2019ll realize who has been telling you the truth and who has been lying.\u201d She stood, motioning to the other two. \u201cLadies, I think we\u2019ve taken up enough of Christine\u2019s time.\u201d She gave me a smile that seemed genuine. \u201cOur offers still stand. If you need anything, from any of us, we\u2019re here for you.\u201d She was the first to head for the door. Samantha was second. Lindsay was the last.</p><p>At the door, Lindsay leaned over and whispered, \u201cI really like you already. Please be careful.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>I couldn\u2019t push the freaking button. I was too afraid of what I\u2019d see.</p><p>After The Pack cleared out, I returned to my girl-cave and tried to get back to work. As I moved things from one place to another, I kept telling myself they\u2019d been lying to me. Jon\u2019s wife had killed herself just like he told me. When I could no longer believe that, I switched to the theory that they weren\u2019t lying\u2014they really believed Jon might be a killer\u2014but the police were wrong. Jon was innocent.</p><p>Eventually, after several hours, I hadn\u2019t completely convinced myself of that explanation, either. So I\u2019d done what any normal girl would do. I powered up my laptop, jumped a few hoops to get it connected to the house\u2019s Wi-Fi, and typed in the URL Erica had written out for me.</p><p>It was there now, on my browser\u2019s search line. But I couldn\u2019t hit the button, calling up the page.</p><p>Hit the button, dammit. You need to know the truth.</p><p>Hand on the mouse. Cursor sitting on top of the SEND button, I closed my eyes. The muscles of my hand tightened. My heart constricted. My lungs slowly deflated.</p><p>I clicked.</p><p>I swear, my heart stopped completely.</p><p>After waiting a handful of seconds, I forced my eyes open.</p><p>The newspaper article was open. Oh God. I was about to learn whether I\u2019d just made the mistake of a lifetime.</p><p>The first thing I saw was a photograph of a smiling, pretty Michelle Stewart. The sight of that image felt like a sock in the gut. The headline was even worse.</p><p>Husband Suspected in Wife\u2019s Mysterious Death.</p><p>Shit!</p><p>Footsteps pounded overhead. They came closer. Someone was coming down the stairs. I clicked the red X, closing the page.</p><p>\u201cChrissy? Are you down here?\u201d Jon called from the stairs as he stomp, stomp, stomped down them.</p><p>My hands were shaking as I grabbed the box of patterns I\u2019d been sorting and pretended to be working. \u201cYep, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Jon turned the corner.</p><p>There he was. So handsome. Strikingly handsome. Was that the face of a killer? Were those dark brown eyes the eyes of a murderer? He smiled at me. The expression looked genuine. He looked happy, as glad to see me as I had been to see him only yesterday. \u201cHello there. Settling in okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I sure am.\u201d</p><p>He came closer, too close. I felt my body stiffening, even though I knew that one newspaper article did not mean he was definitely a killer. I hadn\u2019t even had a chance to read the article. Perhaps the headline had been misleading. Perhaps the article\u2019s author had taken liberties with the facts in the case.</p><p>Perhaps I was hoping for a miracle.</p><p>He bent to kiss me but stopped short. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Clearly, the man knew how to read body language.</p><p>How to respond to that question?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just feeling a little ... overwhelmed, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He straightened up. His expression was puzzled, not at all hostile or suspicious. \u201cOverwhelmed about what?\u201d</p><p>Of course, he had to ask that.</p><p>\u201cAbout ... being a stepmother. About facing this huge change. We don\u2019t know each other as well as we probably should, so there\u2019s that, too.\u201d It was a partial truth, as close as I dared get.</p><p>He glanced at the box at my feet then up into my eyes. \u201cI understand.\u201d He motioned to the box. \u201cCan I help you unpack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet, but I think I can handle this. Are you hungry?\u201d I asked, thinking it might be wise to deflect his attention. \u201cDo you want me to make you something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t bring you here to become my live-in waitress. Go ahead and keep working. I can find something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour neighbors stopped by. They brought muffins and bagels. They\u2019re on the counter.\u201d</p><p>Now his expression turned tense. \u201cThey did?\u201d Underlying the tension, I sensed a little hint of hostility. I hadn\u2019t seen any of that yesterday. Okay, maybe I had. But I\u2019d assumed that was because they\u2019d interrupted us. \u201cThey were here this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Is that a problem? Do you dislike them? I didn\u2019t get that impression yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t \u2018dislike\u2019 them. Not at all.\u201d As if a switch had been thrown, his expression brightened again. His stop-your-heart smile was back in place and the twinkles I\u2019d always found so charming began twinkling. That shift had alarms ringing in my head. Back in college I\u2019d dated a guy who\u2019d had a bad temper. His moods shifted like that. Hot. Cold. Happy. Furious. Not a good sign. \u201cIf I can\u2019t help you, I guess I\u2019ll go upstairs, drag my lazy son out of bed, and get us something to eat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSounds like a good plan.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a friendly, chaste kiss on the mouth then stared into my eyes for a handful of heartbeats. I wasn\u2019t the first to look away. I didn\u2019t want him thinking I was hiding something. I didn\u2019t want him knowing I was afraid, or suspicious, or having second and third doubts about the move. More than anything, I didn\u2019t want him suspecting I knew about that newspaper article.</p><p>He straightened up. \u201cShout if you need anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill do.\u201d I waited until he had closed the door at the top of the stairs before I turned back to the computer. This time, I was determined to read the whole article. I needed to find out the truth, ugly or not.</p><p>The article was dated September 22nd, 2008.</p><p>Michelle Stewart, 28, was rushed to University of Michigan Hospital on Saturday, September 20th, 2008. It was thought at the time she had attempted suicide, although that wouldn\u2019t explain all the evidence found at the scene.</p><p>Stewart died at the hospital within hours of being admitted and mystery surrounds her death. On September 23rd, less than forty-eight hours after her death, Stewart\u2019s husband, Jonathan Stewart, was brought in for questioning. At this time, no formal charges have been filed.</p><p>Authorities admit this case is shrouded in mystery. The Ann Arbor PD is not willing to provide many details in the case. However an informant has come forward to tell me Michelle Stewart had notified Jonathan that she wanted a divorce shortly before her death. At this time, that cannot be confirmed.</p> <p>An autopsy has been performed but police are not releasing Michelle Stewart\u2019s cause of death. Items removed from the home paint a gruesome picture. Until more details are released, we\u2019re left to wonder and speculate on what happened on Saturday, September 20th. It\u2019s possible we may never know.</p><p>I took a long, deep breath. It was far from condemning, much too vague to tell me if I had anything to worry about or not. I decided I needed to do a search, see if the reporter had written any follow-up articles on the case. Or see if the case had been reported by any other newspapers.</p><p>An hour later I had nothing else. Strangely, that article was the only one I could locate on the Internet. A search under both Michelle\u2019s and Jon\u2019s names had turned up nothing. Not even the expected online phone directory. It was as if, outside of that newspaper article, they didn\u2019t exist in cyberspace. Just for kicks, I Googled my own name. Sure enough, there were pages of links, though many of them weren\u2019t for me. My name wasn\u2019t exactly unique. I shared a name with a famous handbag designer, for one. I was going to have to assume a new identity when I (hopefully) released my clothing line.</p><p>I decided to Google my new neighbors next. But I found nada, nothing, not one single blog entry, Facebook page, or Classmates profile. Like Jon and Michelle, Samantha Phillips, Lindsay Baker, and Erica Ross did not exist.</p><p>Feeling a little twitchy after having accomplished so little, I went back to sorting my sewing stuff, organizing it in the nifty boxes tucked into the floor-to-ceiling wall of built-in storage cubicles. I played episodes of Project Runway on my computer as I worked. The noise kept my mind somewhat occupied until, a little after six, Jon came down to check on me.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. You\u2019ve been down here all day. How\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked, looking all tall and dark and mysterious as he leaned against the door frame.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m almost done. This room is amazing. So many places to store things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d Pushing away from the door, he prowled nearer, stopping so close I could easily reach out and run my hand down his broad chest. Despite what I\u2019d been told about him, the familiar butterflies started fluttering in my belly. I was still wildly attracted to him. And, more than that, I wanted to believe he was being wrongfully accused of a nonexistent crime. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>My stomach growled. I\u2019d been so busy, I\u2019d forgotten to take a break for lunch. \u201cStarved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on up. I grilled us some steaks.\u201d</p><p>My mouth watered. \u201cSteaks? I haven\u2019t had a steak since the last time you came to visit.\u201d</p><p>He offered a hand and I accepted it, and together we clomped up the stairs. The moment we stepped into the kitchen, the aroma of grilled meat hit me.</p><p>\u201cOh wow, does that smell amazing.\u201d</p><p>He escorted me to a chair at the dining room table. Josh was waiting, in his chair, his thumbs flying over the keyboard of his cell phone.</p> <p>Jon\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cJosh. Phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Dad. Just a minute.\u201d He punched a few buttons then slid the phone\u2019s display over the keyboard and put it in his pocket. After giving me a weak \u201chey\u201d he grabbed a foil-wrapped potato out of the bowl sitting in the table\u2019s center and started unwrapping it.</p><p>I did the same. And, in silence, we ate our first dinner as a family. It was all very ordinary. Josh shoveled his food into his mouth like he hadn\u2019t eaten in weeks while Jon was more well-mannered, cutting small pieces of meat and chewing. I wasn\u2019t more than halfway finished when Josh asked to be excused. At his father\u2019s nod, he bounded from the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Ethan\u2019s,\u201d Josh announced.</p><p>\u201cBe home by nine,\u201d Jon called after him.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if he tasted the food,\u201d I said, chuckling as I listened to the distant thud of the front door.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d Jon motioned to my plate. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s delicious. I\u2019m just taking my time, enjoying each bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. After dinner, how about we settle down to watch a movie? I have to head in to work for a few hours tonight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight? On a Sunday?\u201d Was I really feeling so let down?</p><p>\u201cI told you my hours would be rough. I need to take care of a few things so that there won\u2019t be any snags tomorrow morning. And I\u2019d rather do it now than at three A.M.\u201d His look was apologetic as he stood with his empty plate.</p><p>Deciding I was full, I followed him into the kitchen, wrapping up the rest for tomorrow\u2019s lunch. We headed into the family room and he turned on the ginormous TV while we made ourselves comfy on the couch. He pulled me into the crook of his arm as he channel-surfed. \u201cWhat are you in the mood for?\u201d he asked, blazing through the hundreds of channels in his satellite TV lineup.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019d like to talk.\u201d</p><p>Click. The TV went black.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He set the remote down. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour neighbors.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose to the top of his forehead. \u201cWhat happened this morning? Did they say something to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout Michelle.\u201d</p><p>Truth? Or lie?</p><p>I didn\u2019t move three hundred miles to live with a man I couldn\u2019t trust. I had to hear his side of the story. I owed him that much ... didn\u2019t I?</p><p>\u201cYes. They told me... .\u201d Shit, this was rough. \u201cThey said... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed Michelle,\u201d he finished for me. \u201cIs that what they said?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cWhat else did they tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said the case is still open.\u201d</p><p>He shoved his fingers through his hair. He stared down at the floor. He sighed. He did all the things a man who is furious, but who doesn\u2019t want to look angry, does. His jaw tensed. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I have an alibi. The case was closed.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know what to believe, do you? You\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>I hated feeling this way, I really did. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set up a meeting with the detective tomorrow. He\u2019ll answer all your questions. Until you know where you stand\u201d\u2014he stood, turned stiffly away\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll keep my distance. I can stay at the office.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. \u201cJon, I\u2019m sorry. Please don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. This isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d His jaw was clenched so tightly, the column of his neck protruded. \u201cA word of advice. You might want to check out those new friends of yours, too, before you believe everything they tell you. They might not be killers, but they aren\u2019t perfect. Nobody is.\u201d</p><p>He left.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>\u201cHello, Miss Price, Jon Stewart said you needed to speak with me?\u201d The police officer offered a hand. He wasn\u2019t wearing a uniform. Worn jeans. T-shirt with an Ann Arbor Police Department logo printed on the left chest. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say he was in his forties. But he was built like a guy twenty years younger. \u201cDetective Foster.\u201d He motioned through a doorway. \u201cHow about we go somewhere quiet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice.\u201d I followed Detective Foster down a white-walled corridor and into a small room furnished with a table and a couple of chairs. It was small. Cramped. Smelled like stale smoke and sweat. The overhead fluorescent light fixture flickered. At the detective\u2019s invitation, I sat in one of the metal and plastic chairs.</p><p>He took the chair opposite me, leaned forward, resting his elbows on the tabletop. \u201cNow, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I appreciate your taking the time to talk to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure. Not a problem.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s a holiday. I\u2019m off the clock. Just dropped in to take care of a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Michelle Stewart\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Stewart said you had some questions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI read an old article in a newspaper that suggested her death might not have been a suicide.\u201d</p><p>The detective didn\u2019t respond right away, which made me wonder whether he\u2019d tell me the truth or not. To agree to meet with me like this, at the drop of a hat, had to mean something. Did he owe Jon a favor? Were they old friends? Had he been instrumental in getting Jon off the hook? Would my poking around kick up a hornet\u2019s nest? \u201cThat article was partially right. There was reason to suspect her death wasn\u2019t a suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t give you that information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the case still open, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is. But Jon\u2019s been cleared. He had a rock-solid alibi.\u201d</p><p>Cleared.</p><p>I was almost afraid to believe what the detective was saying. I heard myself make a little squeaking noise. \u201cYou\u2019re sure he\u2019s innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. He was seen in a public place by several people, including a very reliable witness, at the time of her death. There is absolutely no way he could have killed his wife.\u201d</p><p>A nervous chuckle bubbled up my throat. I couldn\u2019t hold it back. \u201cYou have no idea how worried I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d He glanced at his watch again. \u201cAny other questions?\u201d</p> <p>I bolted from my chair. \u201cI\u2019ve taken enough of your time. I\u2019m sure you have more important things to do than to reassure me that I wasn\u2019t about to marry a murderer.\u201d</p><p>Foster\u2019s smile was genuine. \u201cNo problem.\u201d He stood, opened the door.</p><p>On the way out, Jon\u2019s warning played through my head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Can I ask you one more question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, looking a little stiff. \u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre any of the neighbors suspects?\u201d</p><p>The detective\u2019s smile was coy. He took a moment to answer. \u201cLet\u2019s just say there are a few people who haven\u2019t been cleared yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I wanted to kiss the man but I didn\u2019t. For one thing, he was wearing a wedding ring. Instead, I practically danced out of the police station. My heart felt light. My over-wound nerves were unknotting with each deep breath I took. Ah, the joy of breathing easy. I hadn\u2019t even realized how freaked out I\u2019d been.</p><p>I sang to Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cTelephone\u201d as I drove home. At the top of my lungs. I collected a few stares as I waited for the traffic light to change. But I didn\u2019t care. I was too happy to worry about what anyone thought. Jon\u2019s wife might have been killed. That was a terrible tragedy, one I shouldn\u2019t take lightly\u2014not for Josh, not for Jon\u2014but at least I didn\u2019t need to worry that I was living with a killer.</p> <p>After checking the house, and finding I was alone\u2014Jon had said he was going to work and Josh was at a local fair with a friend\u2014I headed down to my girl-cave and pulled out my sketchbook. It had been weeks since I\u2019d had time to work on my collection, with the move and everything. I flipped through my drawings.</p><p>Flat.</p><p>Boring.</p><p>Blech.</p><p>Yuck.</p><p>What in the world had made me think these designs were any good? Sheesh.</p><p>I flipped to a fresh page and gathered a handful of freshly sharpened pencils.</p><p>Hours flew by.</p><p>I took the occasional break to stretch and eat. Before I knew it, the world outside my window was dark. I took a look at the day\u2019s work\u2014hoping I wouldn\u2019t open my sketchbook tomorrow and think it all sucked\u2014before shutting everything down and going upstairs.</p><p>The house was dark. \u00dcber quiet. Empty.</p><p>I padded into the kitchen for a snack before heading into the family room. I channel-surfed for about two minutes. Cut off the TV. Nothing worth watching. I glanced outside at the deck, the nicely wooded backyard, the silvery moon.</p><p>What the heck? I headed outside and flopped onto one of the chaise lounges on the deck.</p><p>The air smelled great, like freshly mown grass and damp earth. It was so quiet I could hear the insects, the birds, the skittering of an animal somewhere\u2014I hoped that was just a squirrel. Finding one of Josh\u2019s baseball bats sitting propped up against the house, I moved it next to my chair. Just in case.</p><p>I glanced up. There were a couple of floodlights pointed down at me. They weren\u2019t lit, so they weren\u2019t activated by a motion sensor. Must be a switch inside somewhere.</p><p>The distant sound of someone shouting echoed through the neighborhood. It was coming from ... I turned my head ... that way.</p><p>Hmmm ...</p><p>I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m nosy by nature. Add in the possibility that one of my neighbors might be a suspected murderer, and I couldn\u2019t resist the impulse to snoop. I followed the sound of the voices. They were coming from Erica\u2019s house. She was the one who was yelling. Interesting. Miss Cool, Calm, and Collected was having a moment.</p><p>There was no fence between our yards. Convenient.</p><p>The visibly furious Erica was in the family room, which, like ours, opened onto a wide deck in the backyard. Her back was to the door wall, arms flailing. Thanks to the fact that the wide glass doors were open, I could catch bits and pieces of what she was saying. None of it was nice. Her poor husband. She didn\u2019t have a shred of respect for the bastard. Not an ounce.</p><p>But hey, she\u2019d said he was handy with power tools. That had to count for something.</p><p>After throwing one last insult about his lack of skills in the bedroom\u2014low blow, if you asked me\u2014she stormed out of the room. The show was over. Just as I was about to head back home, something lunged out from behind a low shrub and sank its fangs into my ankle.</p><p>I screamed like a girl. Couldn\u2019t help myself. Then I did what anyone else would do. I kicked my foot like a wild woman while running as fast as I could with some ferocious beast tearing at my flesh. It was agony. I mean, seeing-stars painful. Stomach-clenching painful. Tears-welling painful. I slammed my ankle against everything I could. A tree trunk. The deck post. The house.</p><p>The damned thing wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>Every cuss word I knew flew from my mouth as I clawed at the furry beast, trying to tear it off. From the weak light leaking out through the glass door, I could see the animal was brown. The coat was smooth, like a dog\u2019s.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s a rat.</p><p>Gag.</p><p>Desperate now, I grabbed the baseball bat, swung.</p><p>Crunch.</p><p>Another gag.</p><p>I shook my leg. The crunched animal flopped lifeless onto the deck. I stooped down to get a look at it, wondering if I should put it in a box, in case rabies was suspected.</p><p>Big ears. A little pointy nose. Long, skinny legs. And a rat tail.</p><p>What the hell is that?</p><p>Creeped out, my ankle throbbing, I set the bat down and went inside to check my leg and look for a box. After cleaning my wound and a ten-minute search that got me nowhere, I opted to sacrifice one of my designer shoe boxes. I went for my least favorite\u2014apologies to Lauren Jones. Box in hand, I headed back to the family room. Before heading out, I searched the wall for the light switch. Found it. Didn\u2019t find the ratdogwhatever.</p><p>Gone?</p><p>Something caught my eye. A flash of gold. I squinted into the darkness about thirty feet from the deck. Were those ... eyes? Glowing? Big eyes. Was it a big dog? Coyote? Did they have mountain lions in Michigan?</p><p>I dove back inside the house and slammed the French doors, throwing the lock. Evidently, the ratdogwhatever had just become something else\u2019s dinner.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to be dessert.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>It was dark. I was in bed. The lights were out. And my bandaged ankle was under a sheet and a blanket. I squinted at the clock. It was three in the morning. I blinked up at Jon, who was standing next to the bed. \u201cHow do you know I\u2019m hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the bandages and bloody towel in the bathroom.\u201d He sat. The bed sank, and I sort of rolled downhill, closer to him.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Of course you did. Sorry. I guess I forgot to clean up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was outside in the backyard, enjoying the nice evening, when something jumped out of nowhere and bit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Let me see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow? Can\u2019t it wait until morning? I mean, I cleaned it up real good, and it doesn\u2019t look as bad as I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... suppose.\u201d He stood. \u201cHow did your meeting with Detective Foster go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe explained everything. And I feel so bad that I doubted you. I mean, we haven\u2019t known each other long, and we dated long distance, so we\u2019re still kind of strangers. But I should have trusted my instincts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your instincts tell you I\u2019m ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good man, though flawed. At least, that\u2019s what you tell me.\u201d</p><p>His chuckle reverberated through every cell in my body. It was a very pleasant sensation.</p><p>I slid a hand over his thigh, gave it a little squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me, won\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d He stripped off his shirt. The dim light leaking through the open drapes skimmed over the swell of his shoulders, highlighting them while keeping his face masked in darkness. \u201cThat happens to be one of my faults, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hold grudges. For a long time.\u201d</p> <p>I figuratively stepped into his shoes. They weren\u2019t very comfortable. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t blame you in this case. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d react if you thought I\u2019d killed someone.\u201d</p><p>The sound of a zipper being opened\u2014ziiiip\u2014cut through the silence. The sloughing of material followed. And after that, a heavy male sigh. \u201cOkay. I forgive you.\u201d He dove onto the bed, landing next to me, the force of his landing sending me bouncing up into the air. A shrill little squeak burst from my mouth just as he caught me midair and wrestled me onto my back.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t such a long time,\u201d I said, running my hands down the sides of his torso. His body was to-die-for beautiful. I couldn\u2019t keep my hands off.</p><p>\u201cI guess the definition of \u2018long\u2019 is relative. Now, how about we start over? You\u2019ve just moved in and we\u2019re both insanely happy ... and horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, we are.\u201d I wrapped my legs around his waist, my arms around his neck, and kissed him.</p> <p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>The rolled-up flier, printed on neon green paper, was rubber-banded to our front door the next morning. I found it when I went out to check the mailbox.</p><p>Figuring it was an advertisement for lawn cutting, I shoved it in my pocket and continued my trek to the end of the driveway. Lindsay came stomping outside just as I was yanking open the mailbox. She let the huge cardboard box she was carrying fall to the ground. It landed with a dull rattle.</p><p>Intrigued, I waved, donned a cheery smile\u2014which wasn\u2019t such a hard thing to do after last night\u2014and said, \u201cHaving a yard sale?\u201d</p><p>It was Tuesday. The day after a holiday. The first day of school. Seemed like the most unlikely day to have a yard sale, but whatever.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not selling this stuff. I\u2019m giving it away.\u201d She nudged the box with her foot. \u201cI\u2019ve got some good things in here. Come on over and take a look.\u201d She thumbed over her shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s more inside, too.\u201d</p> <p>In my book, free was another word for junk. But I was curious. \u201cOkay.\u201d I headed across the street and peered into the box while Lindsay headed into the house.</p><p>The carton was full of electronics. A Nikon digital camera and an Apple iPad were on top. They couldn\u2019t work. Right? Nobody would give away something that nice. When Lindsay came staggering out with the second box, I held up the two items that had caught my eye. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with these?\u201d</p><p>She grunted. \u201cNot a thing.\u201d She dropped the second box next to the first.</p><p>\u201cNothing? They work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re practically new. Both have a factory warranty. I think we\u2019ve had the camera for only three months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d My bullshit meter was screaming at full volume, but what did I have to lose by taking them? I tucked my new treasures into the crook of my arm and dug back into the box, in search of more goodies. \u201cIf they work, why are you giving them away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I just found out the bastard is cheating on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhhh.\u201d Now, things were starting to make sense. I gently set the items back in the box. I wasn\u2019t about to take something that wasn\u2019t Lindsay\u2019s to give away. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d She planted her hands on her hips and glared out at the street. \u201cIt\u2019s better I found out now, rather than later. Sure wish I\u2019d had the guts to do this sooner. The bastard\u2019s been cheating on me for over two fucking years. Two years.\u201d She dug the camera out and shoved it into my hands. \u201cTake it. Please. He won\u2019t give a damn. It\u2019ll give him an excuse to go buy the latest and greatest model. After all, that\u2019s what he likes to do best\u2014trade up.\u201d Then, to my surprise she snatched it back, set it in the box, and hauled the whole carton into her arms. Before I realized what she was doing, she shoved it into my arms. \u201cAs a matter of fact, take all this stuff. The camera\u2019s cords and lenses and manual are in there. Same with the iPad\u2019s accessories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can.\u201d She gave me a little push.</p><p>\u201cNo, really. I have a camera. And I don\u2019t read much. I doubt I\u2019ll have any use for the iPad... .\u201d My voice trailed off.</p><p>Lindsay clapped her hands over her face.</p><p>While I stood there holding the box, trying to think of what to say, she was slowly sinking. Not because she was standing in quicksand or anything, but because she\u2019d gone semi-boneless and was crumpling to the ground. Some strange sound\u2014a ... burble?\u2014came from behind her hands.</p><p>Shit, she was crying.</p><p>If there was anything I couldn\u2019t handle, it was the sight of a grown adult crying.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, \u201cif it means that much to you, I\u2019ll take the stuff.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop crying.</p><p>I bent over her. \u201cI said, I\u2019ll take the box.\u201d</p><p>She cried harder.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you want?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cTake it all,\u201d she said between sobs. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll take everything. But only if you stop crying.\u201d</p><p>She stopped.</p><p>Great.</p><p>Wonderful.</p><p>Just nifty.</p><p>Now, I was stuck with two boxes of stuff that belonged to someone else. I wondered if I might find a way to get it all back to him, whoever he was.</p><p>She blinked red, watery eyes up at me. \u201cThanks.\u201d She snuffled, dragged her hand across her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ... welcome?\u201d I motioned to Jon\u2019s house\u2014my house. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll take this box over and come back for the second one.\u201d</p><p>Making a full recovery, Lindsay scrambled to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll help. There are about ten more boxes in the house.\u201d</p><p>Ten? Did I actually agree to take more than two?</p><p>Stomping across the lawn, she said over her shoulder, \u201cI want it all out before my kids get home from school. They\u2019re not going to take this well.\u201d Turning to face me, she blinked a few more times. \u201cThey liked the bastard. They loved him. He\u2019s the only father they\u2019ve known.\u201d Jerking around, she ran into her house and slammed the door.</p><p>We had all fifteen\u2014she\u2019d underestimated\u2014loaded into the garage within an hour. Right about the time Lindsay was stacking the last box in place, Joshua came racing into the garage.</p><p>He skidded to a stop. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some old things Lindsay wanted to get rid of,\u201d I said. Hoping to distract him, I asked, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a half day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI better get home,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cCarson and Avery will be home soon. Thanks, Christine. I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I said to her back.</p><p>Josh flipped open the top box. \u201cOh cool! An iPad! Can I keep it?\u201d</p><p>I slapped the flap down. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving all this stuff back to its rightful owner. As soon as I can figure out how to do that. I don\u2019t even know who it belongs to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can help.\u201d He dug deeper into the box. \u201cI recognize this camera. It\u2019s Matt\u2019s stuff. He took pictures at our block party with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know Matt?\u201d I asked, marveling at the number of words Josh had actually spoken today. To me. It was an all-time record. Could he be getting used to me already?</p><p>\u201cSure. Everyone knows Matt. He\u2019s okay.\u201d Josh dropped the camera back into the box. \u201cIf you want to know how to find him, I bet Mrs. Ross could tell you.\u201d He motioned toward Erica\u2019s house. \u201cI saw her talking to him sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the tip.\u201d Remembering I\u2019d forgotten to get the mail, I headed back down the driveway. The mailbox was packed full. Most of it was advertising. I dumped it all, and the rolled-up flier, on the table in the foyer.</p><p>\u201cAnything for me?\u201d Josh asked, coming in through the garage.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t sorted the mail yet. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Are you expecting something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know.\u201d He shrugged, grabbing the flier and unrolling it. \u201cOh, look at this, Mrs. Wahlen\u2019s dog is missing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Wahlen\u2019s dog?\u201d I echoed, peering at the printed flier. The photo was black-and-white and grainy, but there was no question. That was the thing that had bitten me last night. \u201cThat\u2019s what that was? A dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkippy\u2019s creepy-looking. And mean,\u201d Josh said. \u201cEveryone in the neighborhood hates him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very nice.\u201d Now I was feeling bad, knowing I\u2019d killed some lady\u2019s beloved pet. Kind of. After all, he was mean. Josh said so. Hopefully hiding the guilty look on my face, I went back to sorting the mail. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, I kind of feel bad for Mrs. Wahlen. She loves that creepy dog. Buys it ugly little sweaters and boots to wear in the winter. Mr. Wahlen died a few months ago. The dog is all she has now.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I\u2019d killed an elderly woman\u2019s only family member. Now I really felt like crap.</p><p>Finished sorting the mail, I gave Josh a shrug. \u201cNothing for you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go out and look for Skippy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very nice thing to do.\u201d</p><p>I think his cheeks pinked up a little. He shuffled his feet. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be nice. I want to buy a game for my DS. Maybe she\u2019ll pay a reward.\u201d He rolled the flier back up.</p><p>I didn\u2019t believe that was the only reason why he was going in search of the so-called lost pet. But I figured I\u2019d let him save face. \u201cAh, okay.\u201d Of course, I knew he wasn\u2019t going to find the dog\u2014at least, I was pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t. That meant he wasn\u2019t going to collect any reward. \u201cWhat game do you want to buy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhost Trick. My dad won\u2019t buy it for me. He says I can wait \u2019til my birthday. But that\u2019s months from now.\u201d</p><p>I mentally filed away the game\u2019s name, thinking I might pick it up for him just because.</p> <p>He headed for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be around.\u201d He waved. \u201cDo you want me to ask Mrs. Ross if she has Matt\u2019s phone number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I can ask her myself. Later. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He stepped onto the porch, his body half-in, half-out of the house. \u201cShe\u2019s outside now. I\u2019ll send her over.\u201d A second later, before I could stop him, he hollered, \u201cHey, Mrs. Ross, Christine needs to talk to you!\u201d</p><p>Two minutes later, Erica was at my door.</p><p>Decked out head to toe in clothes that made me green with envy, she raised one perfectly plucked eyebrow. I made a mental note to tame my own overgrown eyebrows pronto. \u201cJoshua said you needed to speak with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Reluctantly, I pulled her inside, away from the door. I didn\u2019t want Lindsay to catch wind of what I was trying to do. But I couldn\u2019t stomach the thought of keeping someone else\u2019s belongings. \u201cI need to get in touch with Lindsay\u2019s ... er, ex-boyfriend, I guess it would be. Josh said his name is Matt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you need me to do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a phone number? An address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Darn. I was hoping.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cWhat made you think I would know how to contact him? He was Lindsay\u2019s boyfriend, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua said you talked to him sometimes.\u201d At the sight of something dark, something a little creepy, glittering in her eyes, I quickly redirected the conversation. \u201cWhat about a last name? Did Lindsay ever tell you his last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. Well, she probably did, when she first introduced him to all of us. But I don\u2019t recall what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. I guess that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Erica asked, not budging from my porch.</p><p>\u201cWell ... I have his things.\u201d I thumbed over my shoulder. \u201cLindsay sort of insisted. She wanted everything gone before her kids got home from school. I\u2019d like to return his belongings to him.\u201d</p><p>Erica looked genuinely confused. \u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the impression she\u2019s angry with him. She said something about him cheating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She blinked. Swallowed. Then smiled. Leaning close, she whispered, \u201cWhile I\u2019m here, did you have a chance to read that article?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think you believe what you believe for a reason, but I don\u2019t see anything in that article to make me believe it, too.\u201d I shifted back a little, giving myself more space. \u201cIt was all very vague. There was a mention of evidence, but nothing specific. And, after talking to a detective at the police department, I\u2019m pretty confident I have nothing to worry about.\u201d I left out the part about the police investigating the neighbors. For all I knew, I could be talking to Michelle\u2019s murderer right now. There was something very unsettling about Erica Ross. She gave me an odd feeling, one I didn\u2019t care for. Keeping her at arm\u2019s length was probably a good idea.</p><p>Her smile faded. \u201cKeep digging. There\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about Jonathan Stewart. He told you she was depressed, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They were trying to have a child, and she couldn\u2019t conceive. And that led to her committing suicide. I guess they even tried IVF. Nothing worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d Erica planted one manicured hand on her hip. \u201cFirst, she loved Joshua too much to kill herself and leave him motherless. Second, we were very close and never once did she mention any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it is an extremely personal issue.\u201d</p><p>She waved off my comment with the flip of a hand. \u201cWe go to the same OB-GYN. We talked about everything. Everything.\u201d She tapped her chin with an index finger. \u201cYou know, there might be a way for me to find out if she\u2019d been referred to a specialist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know... .\u201d The fact that Erica was encouraging me to dig deeper into this mystery made me want to believe she wasn\u2019t the killer. I mean, surely the killer, or anyone who knew who the killer was, would want me to keep believing Michelle Stewart had killed herself. Right? But Erica wasn\u2019t doing that. She was pushing me to find out more. \u201cOkay. See what you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get back to you tonight.\u201d Erica glanced at her watch. It was a Rolex. A real one. \u201cGotta go. I need to meet a client in a half hour.\u201d She waved over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOkay. \u2019Bye.\u201d Standing at the door, I watched Erica hustle past a hunched-over lady with wispy white hair waddling down the street, pushing a walker. The wheels bump, bump, bumped every time they hit a crack. The woman saw me at the door and turned her walker toward our front walk.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen my Skippy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>I was looking into the gray-blue eyes of a distraught woman. How could I lie to her?</p><p>That\u2019s just it. I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did see your dog,\u201d I answered.</p><p>The woman\u2019s weathered features brightened instantly. \u201cYou did? You saw my Skippy? Where? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night.\u201d I thumbed over my shoulder. \u201cOn my back deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s not there now.\u201d How was I going to tell this sweet old lady that her beloved pet had been eaten by some huge dog ... or cat ... or whatever? I couldn\u2019t do that. Then again, how cruel would it be to let her keep thinking he might be alive?</p><p>\u201cShow me now, dammit,\u201d Mrs. Wahlen snapped, \u201cor I\u2019ll call the police.\u201d</p><p>Maybe sweet wasn\u2019t the right adjective.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I offered a hand to her as Mrs. Wahlen stepped up onto the porch. She waved it away. \u201cI can do it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, ma\u2019am. Didn\u2019t mean to offend.\u201d</p><p>She grumbled as she stomped over the threshold. I followed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know who the dog belonged to,\u201d I answered, pushing the door open wider to accommodate her walker. \u201cIt was last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I put fliers on everyone\u2019s door. On your door. You could have at least called to tell me you\u2019d seen him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get a flier.\u201d</p><p>The lady, whose mind was definitely still razor-sharp, made a point to look at the rolled-up flier, sitting on top of the mail.</p><p>Busted.</p><p>\u201cI ... erm, that\u2019s your flier? I didn\u2019t read it yet.\u201d I snapped the rubber band still circling it. \u201cSee? It\u2019s still rolled up.\u201d After dropping the rubber-banded tube back on the table, I directed Mrs. Wahlen through the house to the French doors. She sniffed as she glanced around. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I opened a door for her. \u201cBut he was outside here last night.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Wahlen slid four fingers into her mouth and produced an eardrum-piercing whistle. \u201cSkippyyyyyy!\u201d</p><p>That dog wasn\u2019t going to respond, no matter how loud she whistled.</p><p>\u201cWhere was my baby when you saw him?\u201d Mrs. Wahlen asked, squinting against the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cRight there, on the deck.\u201d I pointed at the spot where I\u2019d left him. I noticed the dark stain on the wood too late.</p><p>Leaving her walker behind, Mrs. Wahlen hobbled outside and bent down. She poked at the spot with an arthritic finger. \u201cIs that ... blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d My heart started thumping loudly in my ears.</p><p>Mrs. Wahlen looked at the bat, which was lying next to the stain. \u201cDid someone hurt my Skippy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt him.\u201d At her glare, I amended my answer. \u201cWell, maybe I hurt him a little. I didn\u2019t know he was a dog.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her face turned the shade of a tomato. \u201cHow could you not know that? The ears? The tail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was dark outside. I didn\u2019t see a collar or leash. I thought he was a wild animal.\u201d I pulled up my pant leg. \u201cHe bit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he bit you,\u201d Mrs. Wahlen scoffed. \u201cYou were hurting him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he bit me first. Then I ... sort of ... accidentally ... erm ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy Skippy wouldn\u2019t attack anyone unprovoked. Now, where is he? Did you take him to a vet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, well. I don\u2019t know where he is. When I came inside to find a box or something to put him in\u2014so I could take him to a vet, of course\u2014another animal, a bigger one, grabbed him ...\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes widened. Her tomato-red face went instantly white. Afraid she was about to pass out, I grabbed her arm, but she yanked it away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, you murderer!\u201d Mrs. Wahlen stomped\u2014as hard as a hundred-year-old woman could\u2014back inside, reclaimed her walker, and headed out the front door. Once she was safely down the porch steps, she turned and shook an arthritic finger at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll be hearing from my lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Nifty. I was being sued. For killing a dog that had attacked me. With any luck, the attorney would tell her to drop it and that would be the end of that. But still, even if there was no lawsuit, my conscience was going to nag me for years about this one. I donate money to the Humane Society every year. Animal cruelty is my thing. My cause.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look for his call then,\u201d I said, thinking I might offer to pay a settlement if I was contacted by a lawyer. I didn\u2019t have a lot of money in the bank, and I didn\u2019t have a full-time job, but I had sold my apartment for a tidy profit. I would sleep better at night if I donated some of that cash to Mrs. Wahlen\u2019s pet replacement fund. \u201cOne question, though. Was Skippy up-to-date on all his shots?\u201d</p> <p>The woman leered at me then stormed away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no?\u201d</p><p>Someone was screaming. Outside. The sound was shrill. Eardrum-splitting. I thought someone might be dying. I pictured severed limbs, spurting blood. So, of course, I went racing outside to see.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what I imagined.</p><p>There were no severed limbs. No spurting blood. Just two little people\u2014imagine Thing One and Thing Two from The Cat in the Hat, sans the red suits\u2014racing up and down the front sidewalk, screeching at the top of their lungs like stuck pigs. Oh, and they were smiling. It would seem they were making that noise for the hell of it.</p><p>Immediately, I unchecked the Have Kids box on my mental Ultimate Things to Do list. With my luck, my kids would possess supersized lungs like these two lovely angels. And the energy of a pack of hyenas.</p> <p>As I was about to go back inside, a serene-looking Samantha strolled onto her porch. Seeing me, she smiled and waved.</p><p>Before I could ask her whom the little monsters belonged to\u2014thank God, that could\u2019ve been a bad thing\u2014they started trotting toward her, yelling, \u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>Poor woman.</p><p>As I watched them bounce around her like jumping beans, knocking flowerpots over and trampling the petunias, I concluded she was either an angel or on Valium. There could be no other explanation for how she maintained her cool while chaos erupted all around her.</p><p>I returned her wave when she glanced my way, and in she went, following on the heels of Things One and Two. The blissful silence returned.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anything interesting to watch now, so back in I went. I headed down to my girl-cave and got to work. Roughly an hour later, I heard the doorbell. Being a girl who had lived in the city for years, I was starting to have some serious people-withdrawal. All this quiet, the solitude, the peace, it was getting to me.</p><p>I opened the door. Samantha. Smiling. As usual, she was wearing pristine vintage clothing\u2014Chanel today\u2014and her hair and makeup were flawless. If I was going to start spending a lot of time with this woman\u2014which was still very much in question\u2014I was going to have to do better than sloppy sweats and a ponytail. After all, I was a clothing designer. \u201cHello, are you busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Come in.\u201d I ushered her inside, to the kitchen. \u201cSomething to drink?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d She settled on a bar stool and watched as I poured myself a diet cola. She waved away a second offer at a glass.</p><p>I sat beside her. \u201cYour children are very ... energetic. Very cute.\u201d I wondered where they were now.</p><p>\u201cThank you. They\u2019re napping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I sipped my cola, wondering if Samantha had come over for some adult time or if she wanted to talk about something specific.</p><p>\u201cHave you had any luck with your little investigation?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Aha, so there was an ulterior motive. \u201cI have. I learned Jon has an airtight alibi. But that\u2019s as far as I\u2019ve gotten. I don\u2019t even know what sort of evidence was found when the police arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cI came to return Michelle\u2019s Cuisinart. She\u2019d loaned it to me a few days before. I was the one who found her.\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t Jon said he was the one who discovered her? Had he lied? Or forgotten?</p><p>\u201cOkay, so tell me. What did you see? Blood? Signs of a struggle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, none of those.\u201d Samantha spun the swiveling stool around, so her back was facing the counter. \u201cShe was right there, lying on the floor, a wire dog cable hanging around her neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ... ?\u201d When Samantha didn\u2019t add any more details, I asked, looking up, at the ceiling, wondering how the former Mrs. Stewart had hung herself. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I missing something? A broken window? Signs of a struggle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There was none of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what makes you think it wasn\u2019t suicide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, the cable wasn\u2019t attached to anything. It was just looped around her neck. Did she strangle herself by holding it there? Can you do that? Second, can you think of anyone who has killed herself in the middle of her kitchen? It\u2019s such an odd place to pick. Could you imagine her strolling around her house, that cable knotted around her neck, and her stopping right there saying, \u2018I think I\u2019ll die right here,\u2019 and pulling the chain? And third, Michelle would never do anything so ... dirty ... in her kitchen. She was a germ-aphobe, especially when it came to Joshua. He\u2019d been sick a lot that summer. She was bleaching and Lysoling everything. If she ever thought to kill herself, she\u2019d do it someplace safe, somewhere easy to clean, like her bathroom. And I told the detective that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrangled?\u201d I stared at the floor, almost able to picture Michelle Stewart lying there, her sightless eyes staring back at me. I shivered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Samantha spun back around. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you think that the instant she passed out, the cable would loosen and she\u2019d start breathing again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d My throat was dry. I gulped half my glass of cola.</p><p>\u201cBut you said Jon has an alibi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d I emptied the glass. \u201cWhy do you suspect him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, everyone knows that the spouse is usually the killer. Plus, I\u2019d heard them arguing that week. More than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything. Married people fight,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always lead to someone dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cBut I\u2019ve watched enough episodes of CSI to know that a strangling is a more intimate way of killing someone. The killer has to get close to the victim, within reach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStands to reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is generally why they\u2019re someone the victim knows.\u201d Little did Samantha realize, that statement put her, and her friends, on my short list of suspects.</p><p>\u201cIt was in her house. The kitchen. There was no sign of a break-in,\u201d Samantha continued. \u201cYet another reason to believe it was someone she knew well. Like Jon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, who else would Michelle let into the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides her husband? And me, of course ...\u201d Samantha\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou don\u2019t think ... Do the police suspect me?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, doing my best to hide the truth. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you talked to the detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you that. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>She blanched. \u201cLindsay told me. Was she lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. I see good news travels fast around here,\u201d I said to nobody in particular. \u201cI did talk to the detective. But he wouldn\u2019t even tell me as much as you did.\u201d</p><p>Samantha shifted in her seat, checked her watch. \u201cOh darn. I need to get back. Need to take the bread out of the oven.\u201d She slid from the stool. \u201cDo you believe what the detective said about Jon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. It sounded like there was absolutely no question of his innocence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s good news for you? I imagine you weren\u2019t too thrilled to learn you\u2019d just moved in with a suspected murderer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI imagine nobody would be thrilled to learn that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Samantha strolled to the front door, seeming to be in no hurry to get to her baking bread. \u201cI guess I must believe it, too, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll believe whatever you want,\u201d I said as she stepped outside. As soon as I closed the door, I went down to the girl-cave to take some notes. What Samantha said made a lot of sense. At least, the part about the untied cable and the notion that Michelle might have known her killer.</p> <p>At this point, I was ninety-nine percent sure Michelle Stewart had been murdered. I made a list of suspects. It was short. Very short. And I had serious doubts about all of the people on it. There was Jon, whom I couldn\u2019t remove yet because of that inconsistency in his story versus Samantha\u2019s. But I was pretty sure it wasn\u2019t him. Samantha was on there, too. And Lindsay. Erica was the last name on the list. Because Lindsay, Erica, and Samantha were pushing me so hard to investigate, I was having a difficult time believing any of them were the killer. Jon had an alibi.</p><p>That left ... who else?</p><p>I needed to find out who else might have been close enough to Michelle to be invited inside the house. I was missing something. Something big. The puzzle pieces just weren\u2019t fitting. Who would kill Michelle Stewart? And why?</p><p>The more I learned, the more I needed to know.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p> <p>There was a dead cat on the front porch. Make that, a mangled dead cat. Creepy eyes wide open. Mouth agape in an eternal hiss, teeth bared. It was dead for sure. I\u2019d nudged it with a toe. It was stiff.</p><p>I slammed the door and locked it.</p><p>Jon, why aren\u2019t you home yet?</p><p>I checked the clock. It was after midnight. I\u2019d been so sure the sound I\u2019d heard outside was him, I hadn\u2019t thought twice about throwing the door open to greet him. But instead of getting a nice, warm hug, I\u2019d received the shock of the night.</p><p>This whole dead animal thing was getting much too common.</p><p>Inching open the door, I checked to see if it was still there.</p> <p>Yep.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>I went to the girl-cave and retrieved the shoe box that had originally been intended for Skippy. Then I collected a pair of thick rubber gloves and a set of salad tongs. There was no way in hell I was touching that ... thing. Out I went, back onto the porch, yellow gloves gleaming, metal tongs reflecting the overhead porch light. I gingerly grabbed a leg with the tongs, lifted. The foot slipped loose, and the animal hit the porch with a stomach-turning smack. Swallowing bile, I made a second attempt, this time grabbing the base of the tail.</p><p>Success. I slammed the box top on and, leaving my tool on the porch, hurried the makeshift coffin into the attached garage, trying hard not to inhale through my nose. As disgusting as the animal had looked, I was sure it smelled even worse. Into a black trash bag it went. And the bag\u2014tied, knotted, triple-knotted\u2014went into a trash can. Lid on. Hopefully the garage wouldn\u2019t stink like dead cat by tomorrow.</p><p>That unpleasant task completed, I spun around.</p><p>\u201cGak!\u201d I screamed as I smacked right into a man\u2019s wide chest. I jerked my head back and let out an audible exhale. \u201cOhmygod, you scared me. I didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>Jon was holding the tongs. He gave my rubber-covered hands a pointed look. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I snatched the tongs out of his hand and threw them into the nearest garbage can. \u201cWe can\u2019t use those anymore. They\u2019re dirty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can wash them.\u201d</p><p>A very reasonable suggestion. Unfortunately, in this case, it wouldn\u2019t work. Those tongs could be sterilized, sanitized, boiled in bleach, and I wasn\u2019t going to touch them. \u201cSure. But they have dead cat germs on them.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows scrunched together. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a dead cat on our porch. I didn\u2019t want to touch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Where\u2019d you put the cat?\u201d</p><p>I pointed at the can. \u201cIt\u2019s boxed, bagged, and tied.\u201d I snapped off the rubber gloves and they joined the tongs. \u201cIt\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. I guess I\u2019ll dispose of it tomorrow.\u201d He looped an arm around my waist, leading me back into the house. \u201cAnything else exciting happen today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see,\u201d I said, walking arm-in-arm with Jon up the stairs. \u201cThis morning, Lindsay forced me to take her ex-boyfriend\u2019s stuff because she\u2019s mad at him. And Mrs. Wahlen is suing me for killing her dog, Skippy. By the way, I\u2019m still unclear whether I need to go get a rabies shot since she wouldn\u2019t tell me if Skippy was up-to-date on his shots. Oh, and Skippy was eaten by some big animal last night. At least, I think he was. I saw something. Some eyes. Big, glowing eyes. And then Samantha came over to talk about ... to visit. And Josh had a half day at school. He took off with his friends for a few hours then came home and went straight to his room. Didn\u2019t say a word to me. And finally, well, I already told you about the dead cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you had an interesting day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA strange, bizarre day is more like it. And here I thought living in the \u2019burbs would be boring.\u201d</p><p>He stripped off his shirt and gave me a hungry man leer, and I knew my day was going to end on a much higher note. He pulled down his pants, and all thoughts of dead cats and ex-boyfriends flew from my mind. \u201cCome here.\u201d He took my hands and led me to the bed. \u201cLet me show you why living in the \u2019burbs will never be boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d I said, as I slid between the sheets and into his arms. \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a dinner party and you\u2019re invited. Six o\u2019clock. Tonight.\u201d</p><p>That was the greeting I received when I answered the front door the next morning. The party holder was Erica. She was dressed for work, knotted up in a chic black suit and a killer pair of Manolos. Someday I would just love to raid her closet. \u201cThanks for the invite. Shall I bring something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a notebook. Something small that you can conceal easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t a casserole be more appropriate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this case. I\u2019ve invited everyone I could think of who knew Michelle.\u201d Her purse started buzzing. She dug inside, checked her phone, then hit a button, ending the noise. \u201cI\u2019d like you to come over at five. I\u2019ve asked Lindsay and Samantha to come early, too, so we can make plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlans for what?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. I\u2019ve never seen a more elegant shrug in my life. \u201cOur interrogations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>Erica\u2019s purse buzzed again. Scowling, she checked her phone. \u201cDammit.\u201d Hit the button. \u201cGotta go. See you at five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and if you happen to see a cat running around, please let me know. Ramzes got out last night and he hasn\u2019t come back. The kids are a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat?\u201d I echoed.</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s rare breed, Ural Rex. It was a nightmare getting him into the States. We bought him from a breeder in Russia during a family vacation. I\u2019d hate to think I might have to go to all that trouble again. At any rate. He\u2019s brown with a wavy coat and a mostly black head.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019s now an occupant of our garbage can. I forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if I see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Thanks.\u201d When her purse buzzed yet again, she sighed and hurried toward the door, throwing a wave over her shoulder. \u201cWork calls. See you at five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you then.\u201d</p><p>Ural Rex. From Russia. Great.</p><p>I closed the door and headed upstairs to wake Josh. He didn\u2019t have a lot of time to get ready for school. Only about twenty minutes. His door was open. I could see some hair poking out from under the covers. I flipped on the light. \u201cRise and shine. The bus\u2019ll be here in twenty.\u201d Stepmotherly duty done, I trotted back downstairs to start the coffee. Josh came dragging down just as the first drops were hitting the carafe. His eyes were bloodshot, deep black smudges staining the skin under them. His clothes were rumpled, as if he\u2019d slept in them\u2014he probably had. And his unzipped, bulging-with-books backpack was dragging on the floor behind him. But more importantly, he was sporting the worst bed head I\u2019d ever seen. He substituted an empty mug for the glass coffeepot for a few seconds, replacing it when his cup was full.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard caffeine stunts your growth,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cUhn,\u201d was his response. He blinked slowly.</p><p>I pointed at his head. \u201cHair.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a baseball cap off a nearby table and smacked it on his head. After downing a few gulps of coffee, he lumbered toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cHave a nice day,\u201d I called, exaggerating the cheerfulness in my voice. Smiling at his back, I said to myself, \u201cI think I could get used to this. If the whole dead animal thing would just stop.\u201d</p><p>I headed into the shower, spying a sleeping Jon as I tiptoed through our bedroom and into the attached bath. I was tempted to crawl back under the covers and snuggle up to him, but I resisted the temptation and went for a shower instead. When I came back out, he was gone. And I was home alone, again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After dressing, I killed some time down in the girl-cave, working on some sketches and scouring the web for inspiration. At noon, I headed out to check the mailbox. Thing One and Thing Two were racing tricycles down the sidewalk. Thing Two clipped the back of my leg with a pedal as she was roaring by.</p><p>Samantha, whom I hadn\u2019t realized was sitting on the front porch, called out an apology. Finding the mailbox empty, I cut across our yards, joining her on her porch.</p><p>She was dumping a few pills out of a prescription bottle as I climbed the steps. Recognizing the fact that I\u2019d seen her, she lifted the bottle, saying, \u201cAnxiety,\u201d before tossing the tablets into her mouth. She washed them down with a gulp of vitamin water. \u201cWhat do you think about Erica\u2019s dinner party. Brilliant, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound convinced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think the killer will slip up and say something self-incriminating\u2014assuming, that is, the killer is one of the guests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... I have a little secret weapon... .\u201d Samantha waved me into the house. She dug a small bottle of pills out of her handbag, sitting on the console table just inside the door.</p><p>Stunned, I asked, \u201cYou\u2019re going to dose everyone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. This stuff won\u2019t hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sleeping pills. I have insomnia.\u201d She dropped the bottle back in her bag. \u201cI read online that they work like truth serum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut sleeping pills will just put people to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I only give them a light dose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to find out what really happened to your fianc\u00e9\u2019s first wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but giving innocent people drugs is taking things too far.\u201d</p><p>Samantha sighed. \u201cOkay. You\u2019re right.\u201d She headed back outside.</p><p>Following her, I said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so. I mean, if someone had a reaction, you could put someone in the hospital. Or worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That would be terrible.\u201d She returned to her chair.</p><p>I leaned against one of the vertical porch posts. \u201cWe can get people talking other ways. Less dangerous ways.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a strong punch. Alcohol makes people talk more, be more impulsive, more honest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely. I can whip up a killer punch\u2014no pun intended.\u201d She waved at Things One and Two. \u201cTime for lunch, kids.\u201d</p><p>I straightened up, prepared to scamper down off the porch before the two wild things came up. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, later.\u201d</p><p>I wondered if I\u2019d talked her out of spiking the punch. As much as I hoped I had, I figured it was maybe fifty-fifty I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>At exactly five fifty-nine the last guest arrived at Erica\u2019s dinner party. All totaled, including Erica, Lindsay, Lindsay\u2019s \u201cdate,\u201d Nicole, Samantha, and me, there were ten people at the party. None of them were kids. Erica had shipped hers off with her husband before I\u2019d arrived, and Lindsay and Samantha had opted to leave theirs at home, too.</p><p>Upon the arrival of the last person\u2014a nurse working with Michelle\u2019s former OB/GYN\u2014the girls set their plans into motion. The first goal was to serve light hors d\u2019oeuvres so that the effects of the punch would be exaggerated. Dinner would be served later.</p><p>Within a half hour, it was obvious their scheme had worked.</p><p>\u201cThat dress is butt ugly,\u201d one guest said, her perky little nose scrunched up in disgust. Pointing at another guest, she said, much too loudly, \u201cI would never, ever put that shape of skirt on a curvy client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least my dress fits,\u201d the recipient of her verbal assault tossed back. \u201cYours is so tight, I can see every lump of cottage cheese on your thighs. I\u2019m guessing you spent a hell of a lot of money on your nose, your lips, and your boobs. Why wouldn\u2019t you get lipo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s leaving me for another man,\u201d the third guest sobbed.</p><p>\u201cI hate my job. My boss is an ass,\u201d said another.</p><p>\u201cI paid ten grand for new boobs and they are hideous,\u201d wailed the first. \u201cAnd that bitch is so right. I should\u2019ve gotten the lipo. What the hell was I thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis punch is delicious,\u201d said the woman with the cheating husband as she poured herself another glass.</p><p>We exchanged grins. Samantha shrugged. \u201cI told you, I have a killer punch recipe.\u201d</p><p>If nothing else, this was going to be one very interesting evening.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me there\u2019s nothing but alcohol in it,\u201d I said, watching as things started heating up.</p><p>Samantha nodded. \u201cI promise, I didn\u2019t even bring the pills.\u201d</p><p>We huddled in the kitchen, planning our strategy. Erica gave us a rundown of each guest, why they were invited, and why they were suspects. The fashion critic, Rachel, was Michelle\u2019s former personal shopper. She regularly spent hours in the Stewart home, helping Michelle plan outfits for the many charity events she attended. There was a rumor that she was in debt and desperate for cash. The fashion victim, Theresa, was the nurse at Michelle\u2019s former OB. She wasn\u2019t a suspect per se, but Erica had hoped to get some information about Michelle\u2019s alleged fertility problems. The dumped wife, Kelly, was the mother of one of Joshua\u2019s friends. She visited Michelle occasionally, enough that Michelle would have let her into the house without thinking about it. And even two years ago, there\u2019d been rumors about her marriage being on the rocks. There\u2019d also been rumors that Kelly had a thing for Jon. The last guest was Heather, also someone who\u2019d met Michelle through Josh. Michelle had told Erica only a few days before she\u2019d died that she\u2019d had a huge blow-up-drag-down fight with Heather over something that happened between her son and Josh.</p><p>\u201cTime to get to work.\u201d Feeling like a football coach, I pointed at Erica. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start with the nurse? You know her best, since she works for your doctor.\u201d Erica agreed with a nod. Next I pointed at Kelly. \u201cLindsay, why don\u2019t you take the friend with the gay husband? She\u2019s in I-hate-my-husband mode. You just broke up with a boyfriend\u2014\u201d Lindsay blanched then gave Nicole a guilty look. \u201cSorry. Didn\u2019t mean to bring up a touchy subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019re on a mission. I get it.\u201d To Nicole, Lindsay said, \u201cLong story. I\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d Lindsay glanced over her shoulder, at her target. \u201cIf she knows anything about Michelle\u2019s death, I\u2019ll get it outta her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d I motioned to Samantha next. \u201cSamantha, why don\u2019t you take Heather the boss-hater? I\u2019ll take the one that\u2019s left, Rachel, the personal shopper.\u201d I checked my watch. \u201cHow about we reconvene in a half hour and see what we need to do next? And let\u2019s keep that punch flowing.\u201d</p><p>Off we went, to question our so-called persons of interest.</p><p>I headed for my target, who was standing next to Heather, pointing out all the flaws in everyone\u2019s fashion statement. According to Erica, Rachel worked as a personal shopper-slash-stylist and had reportedly made a lot of deliveries to the Stewart household in the past. Since fashion was my thing, I figured I stood as good a chance as any of getting her to talk.</p><p>\u201cHi there, I see you have an interest in fashion,\u201d I said as I approached her with a full glass of punch. I motioned to her empty glass, trading it for the full one in my hand.</p><p>After nodding a thanks, she said, \u201cI\u2019m a stylist and personal shopper.\u201d She gave me an up-and-down look. I was wearing one of my own dresses. \u201cWho are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s my own. I\u2019m a designer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She gave my dress a closer look. \u201cNice. Have you had samples made? I\u2019d love to show this piece to a few of my clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I\u2019m working on it.\u201d</p><p>She dug into her purse, produced a card. \u201cWhen you do, I hope you\u2019ll keep me in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Thanks. I understand you worked for Michelle Stewart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelle was one of my best clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Rachel gave me a sad look. \u201cActually, she was my best client. My business has taken a nosedive since she died, and\u2014don\u2019t tell anybody\u2014I had to take a part-time job, working at JCPenney to make ends meet. You won\u2019t tell anyone, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019d hate for them to know.\u201d She plucked a nonexistent piece of fuzz from her skirt. \u201cMy business is all about appearances, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, I know.\u201d</p><p>She smoothed her sleeve. \u201cI mean, who would want to pay top dollar to a part-time sales clerk to be their stylist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry your business has suffered. Has it been a long time since you\u2019ve shopped for a client?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cYes, it has been a long time, since the week before Michelle died.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat long ago? That\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d met with Michelle the week before she ... you know. She had a few events coming up, and she wanted me to come by. In fact, we had an appointment for that very day. But I didn\u2019t get the chance. I was ... well, detained.\u201d Her face turned red. \u201cParking tickets. I was in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I patted her shoulder. \u201cSorry for dredging up unhappy memories. Hopefully you\u2019ll pick up some new clients soon. I\u2019d better move on to the other guests.\u201d Feeling a little guilty for pretty much dumping her after that confession, I explained, \u201cI\u2019m new in town. Would hate for anyone to feel slighted. Say, maybe you can come back another day, and I\u2019ll take you down to my studio, let you get a firsthand glimpse of my collection.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes actually sparkled. \u201cI would love that.\u201d</p><p>After making the rounds, filling punch glasses, I was the first to return to our predetermined meeting spot. The other ladies soon joined me. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we can cross Rachel off the list,\u201d I said. \u201cHer business has tanked since Michelle died. She has no motivation to kill her best client. She was anticipating more business from her in the upcoming weeks. So if her motivation was money, it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense. Plus, she has an alibi that should be pretty easy to verify.\u201d I glanced at the other ladies. \u201cAnybody get something good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot nothing from Kelly,\u201d Lindsay said, \u201cother than she was very sad to learn about Michelle. Evidently, she called her often to talk about her troubles with her husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeather seems to be a dead end, too,\u201d Samantha said, frowning. \u201cThat big so-called fight was just about Joshua borrowing a pair of her son\u2019s gym shoes. The shoes were ruined, and there\u2019d been conflicting stories about who was responsible. I don\u2019t know. Even if they were Alexander McQueens, a pair of shoes is hardly worth killing over.\u201d</p><p>All of us shared a heavy sigh.</p> <p>\u201cBut wait. All\u2019s not lost,\u201d Erica said. \u201cI had Theresa, Dr. Orenstein\u2019s nurse. I\u2019m thinking we need to follow up on the doctor. Evidently, he had a secret thing for Michelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThing?\u201d I echoed.</p><p>\u201cObsession,\u201d Erica clarified.</p><p>\u201cA secret obsession,\u201d Lindsay repeated. \u201cThat could be a motivation for murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>Erica continued, leaning in, \u201cEvidently, Jon\u2019s story about her going to a fertility specialist was partially true. Michelle did ask for a referral. But Dr. O insisted she didn\u2019t need one and persisted in treating her himself. It\u2019s possible Michelle didn\u2019t tell Jon the truth, letting him think she was going to someone else. Jon wasn\u2019t fond of Dr. O and had told her to change doctors.\u201d</p> <p>Lindsay\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cNow, that is interesting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d someone shouted from the living room.</p><p>I jerked around, catching Heather tossing a glass of punch into Rachel\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHow dare ...\u201d Eyelashes dripping, mouth agape, Rachel grabbed the first thing she touched\u2014a potted plant\u2014and threw it. Heather ducked. The pot hit the wall and shattered. Dirt flew everywhere. The plant landed on Kelly\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Kelly screeched, untangling philodendron leaves from her hair. \u201cI just paid two hundred dollars to get my hair done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d I mumbled, watching Kelly lurch to her feet. \u201cThis is getting ugly. Fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d Erica shouted over the mounting wave of expletives filling the room. She waved her arms. The cuss words just kept flowing.</p><p>\u201cIf you paid that, you were robbed,\u201d Rachel sneered. \u201cI\u2019ve seen better dye jobs walking out of Fantasic Sams.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly charged at Rachel like a bull, nostrils flaring, fury burning in her eyes. She tackled Rachel to the ground, and a catfight ensued. There was hair flying, clothes tearing, fingernails clawing. A couple of the other guests jumped into the fray before we could get it broken up, and before we knew it, we were ducked behind the kitchen island while things crashed and shattered all around us.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, what the hell did you put in that punch?\u201d Erica snapped.</p><p>Crack.</p><p>Samantha shrugged.</p><p>\u201cJust alcohol,\u201d I said. \u201cRight, Samantha? You only put alcohol, like you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ...\u201d</p><p>Crash.</p><p>\u201cDammit, I think that was the plasma TV.\u201d Erica poked her head up. \u201cYes, that was the plasma.\u201d She glared at Samantha.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that, whore!\u201d Kelly screeched.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you put in the punch?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cNo drugs.\u201d Samantha raised her hands. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is in that punch?\u201d I eyeballed the bowl, not sure whether I should empty it to keep them all from drinking more or just put it away, in case someone had a bad reaction. \u201cIt can\u2019t be just fruit juice and ginger ale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d Samantha sighed. \u201cI got a truth potion from someone I know. She promised it was safe, made from all organic ingredients. I\u2019ve used her potions before. Never had a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA potion?\u201d I echoed.</p><p>Ka-blam.</p><p>Erica sank to the floor. \u201cSamantha, do you have a Valium on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Samantha produced a bottle from her skirt pocket, dumped a handful out, and handed them to Erica. \u201cTake a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Erica dry-swallowed half of them. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>Smash.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Samantha said, sounding a touch defensive. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the punch, do you think we\u2019d have what we do on Dr. O?\u201d</p><p>Erica shrugged. And sighed. \u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Crack.</p><p>Lindsay giggled.</p><p>We all looked at her. She was batting her eyelashes at her new friend, Nicole.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think she\u2019s turning lesbian?\u201d I whispered to Erica.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s no more a lesbian than I am. But I\u2019m not going to tell her that. She\u2019ll figure it out. But I will say one thing\u2014she has great taste in women. Nicole\u2019s very attractive.\u201d That statement had me second-guessing both their sexual orientations. To Samantha, Erica said, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough. My living room is destroyed. My dining room table is covered with broken glass. I\u2019d like to preserve at least some of my furniture. How about making it stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d After straightening her hair, Samantha stood up. \u201cExcuse me, but ... dinner is served.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>It was a freaking miracle.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>An hour later, Lindsay, Erica, Samantha, Nicole, and I were sitting in the middle of a war zone. The police had just left, toting away Rachel for assaulting Kelly with a fireplace poker. We hadn\u2019t known it, but she had a record for felony assault. If not for her alibi, she would have moved to the top of our Persons of Interest list.</p><p>As it was now, we had only one name on that list\u2014Dr. O, the OB. And at this point, we didn\u2019t have any substantial proof he belonged there.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Lindsay asked, glancing at her watch, then at Nicole. \u201cIt\u2019s almost eight. I need to get home and relieve the sitter soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I told her. \u201cI think we\u2019ve accomplished all we can tonight. I\u2019ll take what we found out to the police tomorrow. Maybe they can do something with it.\u201d</p><p>Erica and Samantha agreed that was a good idea.</p><p>Lindsay looked unsure as she stood. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll go. Do we want to meet tomorrow sometime?\u201d</p><p>Erica shook her head. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s bad for me. I have meetings all day. What about Saturday?\u201d</p><p>Everyone checked their calendars. Saturday it was. Lunch at Samantha\u2019s.</p><p>Nicole gave us all a handshake. \u201cThis was the most interesting dinner party I\u2019ve ever attended.\u201d She left with Lindsay.</p><p>Erica headed into the great room to look at her smashed television. I joined her.</p><p>\u201cThat is a sad, sad sight,\u201d I said.</p><p>Erica shrugged. \u201cI was thinking about getting something bigger. I work my ass off. What the hell?\u201d She circled around the far end and stooped down to pick it up. I took the other end, and together we hauled the broken TV out to the garage. When we went back inside, Samantha was hard at work, cleaning up the kitchen. Erica found some trash bags, handed me one, and together we picked our way through the great room, broken glass crunching under our feet. A little while later, Erica went back to the kitchen, her bag full.</p><p>She dunked a glass into the punch bowl.</p><p>I waved my hands. \u201cUm, Erica ...\u201d</p><p>Too late. She\u2019d downed the punch faster than a thirsty sailor. Smiling, she smacked her lips. \u201cThat punch is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lethal,\u201d I reminded her.</p><p>\u201cIt is not. It\u2019s just punch. And a few organically grown herbs.\u201d That was yet to be proven. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get violent, and I have nothing to hide.\u201d She refilled her glass and emptied it. \u201cSamantha, this is some damned good punch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Samantha beamed. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should ease up on the punch.\u201d I tried to take the glass from her. She didn\u2019t let me. \u201cYou took those Valiums earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Erica chugged a third glass then crunched across the room to the couch. She plopped down, flung a leg over her knee.</p> <p>She patted the seat and crooked a finger at me. \u201cCome here. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>I lifted an empty flowerpot. \u201cBut don\u2019t you think we should get things cleaned up? I\u2019m happy to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that. The kids and that ass I\u2019m married to will be home in a few minutes anyway. But the hell if I care. The lazy bum has nothing better to do. He can clean it up tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I exchanged looks with Samantha.</p><p>Samantha glanced at her watch. \u201cI need to get the twins into bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that. Joshua can get his own ass in bed. He\u2019s not two. I need someone to talk to.\u201d</p><p>Samantha made a hasty exit, leaving me with Erica, who was in the mood to talk.</p><p>Erica let her head flop back. Her eyelids fluttered closed. \u201cDid you know that dumb bastard hasn\u2019t even tried to get a job? It\u2019s been five years. Five long years. He knew I wanted to have another baby before Paris started school. But now ...\u201d Rocking her head to the side, she looked at me. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Erica. Are you sure it\u2019s too late? You\u2019re not even thirty-five yet, are you? I\u2019ve heard of women in their forties\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand him. Can\u2019t stand his voice. Can\u2019t stand looking at him. And most definitely can\u2019t stand him touching me.\u201d Crossing her arms over her chest, she gripped her upper arms. \u201cCan you blame me for taking a lover?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe some people would. But I didn\u2019t plan on cheating. It just sort of happened. We were both there. Lindsay had to leave, and the next thing I knew, we were making out in her living room.\u201d</p><p>Was Erica telling me ... was she sleeping with Lindsay\u2019s ex-boyfriend? Was Erica the other woman?</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMatt. I thought you figured it out already. That\u2019s why you asked me about him, right?\u201d Erica got up, sauntered into the kitchen, helped herself to another glass of punch, and drank it without taking a break to breathe.</p><p>In the interest of preserving her marriage\u2014which was probably on its way to hell, anyway\u2014I took the liberty of emptying the punch bowl down the drain. \u201cActually, no. I asked because I wanted to return his stuff. It\u2019s still in my garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She scribbled a phone number on a napkin. \u201cHis phone number.\u201d She slid the napkin across the granite counter. \u201cThe best time to reach him is early afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I tucked it into my pocket just as the echo of voices signaled the return of Erica\u2019s family. \u201cWell, I\u2019d better be going.\u201d</p> <p>Erica threw her arms around me. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. We\u2019re going to be good friends. I can tell already.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure about that, not after she found out about her cat. Speaking of which ... \u201cUm, Erica, I need to talk to you about your missing cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened here?\u201d Erica\u2019s husband bellowed.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d Erica said, shooing me toward the door. \u201cParis, upstairs.\u201d She pointed and a pretty little girl of about ten stomped toward the staircase. Then Erica turned an angry glare at her husband. \u201cListen up, asshole. I\u2019ve had one hell of a day. Don\u2019t you dare take that tone with me.\u201d</p><p>I made a beeline for the front door.</p><p>The sounds of their argument followed me through the house and even outside. As I scuttled across the front lawn, heading home, someone grabbed my arm, giving it a tug.</p><p>I gave a little yipe! and spun around, half-expecting something to fly at my head.</p><p>Jon chuckled. Sneaky bastard.</p><p>\u201cOhmygod, where did you come from?\u201d I asked him, clapping a hand over my racing heart.</p><p>\u201cI was just heading to the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had some things to handle at work. They couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. You missed the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d Looking all tall and dark and mysterious\u2014the moonlight did amazing things for the man\u2019s face\u2014he gathered my hair over one shoulder. Then\u2014no surprise here\u2014he started nibbling on my neck. Outside. In the middle of the front lawn.</p><p>\u201cJon ...\u201d I said, tipping my head to give him better access. Little tingles were quaking through my body. They felt mighty good. I decided I didn\u2019t need to tell him about the party right now. It could wait. \u201cWhere\u2019s Josh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp in his room. Why?\u201d He nibbled on my earlobe.</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t think he should see us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee us doing what? We\u2019re not having sex ... yet. I\u2019m just having a little snack.\u201d He nipped at my neck.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think he likes me as it is. I don\u2019t want him to dislike me even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d He dragged his tongue down the column of my neck and I shivered.</p><p>\u201cBecause he hasn\u2019t spoken to me in days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just stress. Tests. That kind of thing. Don\u2019t worry. He likes you just fine. Now, since you\u2019re so concerned about people seeing us, why don\u2019t we go inside?\u201d Before I could respond, he scooped me off my feet.</p><p>Grinning at nobody in particular, I tossed an arm around his neck. As he climbed the stairs, I squinted at a dark shadow sitting smack-dab in front of the door. My blood, which had warmed up nicely, chilled. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He halted at the door. \u201cCan you grab the doorknob for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s under your feet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything.\u201d In he went. He set me on my feet before pushing on the door to shut it.</p><p>I caught it just before it slammed, snapped on the porch light.</p><p>\u201cOh shit! What is that?\u201d I stabbed a finger at the little pile of brown fur lying in front of the door. \u201cSee? I told you I saw something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably a dead rabbit or cat,\u201d he reasoned, acting as if it was no big deal to find dead animals lying on the welcome mat. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Jon, there was a dead cat there last night. That\u2019s two nights in a row. Whoever heard of such a coincidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hardly a coincidence. There are a lot of stray animals around here. I used to leave food out for them. Some of them keep coming back, looking for more.\u201d</p><p>Was I buying that explanation?</p><p>He licked the spot on my neck, the one that sent tingly shivers down my spine, and I decided I didn\u2019t care. If it was still there in the morning, I\u2019d worry about it then.</p><p>Laughter. In my dreams. Women laughing. Talking. A party?</p><p>My eyes opened.</p><p>The laughter continued.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t dreaming.</p><p>Driven by overwhelming curiosity, I checked the clock. It was a little after midnight. I carefully extricated myself from Jon\u2019s embrace\u2014yes, he was a cuddler when he slept\u2014and went to the window.</p><p>More laughter. Shadows moving. There. It was coming from Samantha\u2019s yard.</p><p>I had to know what was going on. Having slept in a T-shirt and sweats, all I had to do was grab a pair of flip flops and quietly head downstairs. I bypassed the front door, opting for the French doors opening onto the back deck. Out I went into the cool, cloudless night. Yet another round of laughter beckoned to me, coaxing me to wander farther away from the house. My shoes smack-smacked under my feet, but nobody would hear. The laughter and lively chattering would drown out the sound.</p><p>Creeping closer, almost at the far side of Samantha\u2019s house, I kept to the shadows. For some reason, I didn\u2019t want Samantha, or whoever it was, to know I was spying.</p><p>But just as I rounded the far corner, everything went silent. No laughing. No chattering. Not even any insect buzzing. A strange chill raced up my spine.</p><p>I turned to go home. Stopped.</p><p>Were those ... ? Glowing eyes. Two. No, four. No ... six.</p><p>Three pairs of eyes were staring at me from the shadows between the houses. I had no idea what they belonged to. Dogs maybe. Big dogs. Instantly, the vision of that little scraggly Skippy came to mind. One of these ... dogs ... had snatched him. I knew it. What would they do to me?</p><p>Nothing if I could help it.</p><p>I backed up, moving as slowly, as quietly as possible.</p><p>Avoid eye contact, I told myself, remembering the first rule of Aggressive Dogs 101.</p><p>Protect your head and neck.</p><p>Remaining standing, but turning sideways, I inched along the back wall of the house. My foot landed on something soft. Rubber.</p><p>Squeak.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>One of the animals stepped out of the shadow. It was big, muscular, a dog of some kind, with a long pointed snout and a thick, dark coat. For some reason, my gaze snapped to its eyes. Blue? A clear, ice blue. The dog\u2019s ears twitched, and I yanked my gaze away, hoping it wouldn\u2019t attack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lifted my foot off the toy and another loud squeak cut through the thick silence as the hollow rubber inflated again. I held my breath when a second dog cleared the shadows. It stopped a few inches behind the first, flanking it on the right.</p><p>Watching me.</p><p>Still. Silent. Tracking my movements.</p> <p>The third stepped forward. It was holding something in its mouth. Small. Brown. Furry.</p><p>Now I had an idea where all the dead cats were coming from.</p><p>The dog with the dead animal slowly crept forward, ears back, tail low. I smooshed my back against the house and held my breath as it moved close, closer, too close. It stopped a couple of feet away, lowered its head, and dropped its prize onto the dewy grass. Then, moving just as cautiously as it had when it approached, it backed away. When it met up with the other two, the pack turned around and raced into the still, dark shadows.</p><p>Finally, I was able to breathe again.</p><p>Afraid the dogs would be back at any moment, I hightailed it out of there, dashing around the side of the house. Something jumped out of the shadows just as I was about to turn the front corner. I slammed into it, bounced backward and landed on my ass. The air left my lungs with an audible \u201coof.\u201d</p> <p>Jerking my head, I looked up.</p><p>Jon.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep doing that?\u201d I said, not hiding my exasperation.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, me? I was just looking for you. You\u2019re the one who keeps slamming into people. You need to watch where you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do watch where I\u2019m going. You\u2019re so freaking quiet and sneaky, I don\u2019t see or hear you coming.\u201d I started to push to my feet. I got a little help from Jon.</p><p>He dusted my ass, then gave it a pat. \u201cI\u2019m not sneaking up on you on purpose. When I didn\u2019t see you in the house, I got worried.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. Fine. Thanks for coming after me. As it turns out, you had good reason to be worried.\u201d I started toward the house, Jon falling into step beside me.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran into a pack of dogs. Big ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not at all. They didn\u2019t seem aggressive. Although there was something really weird about them.\u201d At the front of the house now, I glanced back.</p><p>\u201cWeird? Like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Just ... something.\u201d I wrapped my arms around myself as a little shiver shot up my spine. \u201cOne of them had a dead animal in its mouth. It brought it to me, dropped it at my feet. Like it was some kind of gift.\u201d I stepped up onto the porch and checked the welcome mat. Dead animal\u2013free.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call animal control tomorrow.\u201d Jon reached around my side and opened the door. \u201cI think it would be better if you stayed inside after dark until those animals are caught. It\u2019s after midnight. What made you go outside in the first place?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI heard voices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoices?\u201d he echoed, stepping into the foyer.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Women\u2019s voices. I thought it might be Erica. And maybe Samantha. So I came outside to check.\u201d</p><p>As Jon reached for the door to close it, the soft sound of a woman\u2019s laughter carried through the still night.</p><p>\u201cThere it goes again! Did you hear that?\u201d Pushing past Jon, I rushed back out onto the porch, following the direction of the sound with my eyes.</p><p>Not far away, I caught sight of a tall shadow. Thin. \u201cSamantha?\u201d I called as I skipped down the front porch steps. I halted in the middle of the front yard, realizing there were shadows bouncing around the taller one. Big, dog-shaped shadows. Taking a step backward, I bumped into a walking brick wall. \u201cI think those might be the dogs I saw before. Is that Samantha? She\u2019s not afraid. Are they her dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, you might say that.\u201d Jon looped an arm around my waist, hauling me up to him.</p><p>\u201cBut ... I didn\u2019t know she had dogs. I\u2019ve never heard barking, never seen them outside doing their doody\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t disturb them. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201d</p><p>I took one last look at the strange scene\u2014straight out of Dances with Wolves\u2014then let Jon lead me back into the house. This time, he shut and locked the door as soon as we were inside.</p><p>Feeling even more shivery than before, I asked, \u201cIs it just me, or do you think it\u2019s a little strange that Samantha is outside after midnight playing with her dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people might think a lot of what goes on in this neighborhood is strange.\u201d</p><p>That statement got my attention. \u201cLike what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jon shrugged and, taking my hand, headed toward the stairs.</p><p>I yanked my hand away, planted my feet, and refused to budge. \u201cJon, what did you mean by that? Ever since I arrived, I\u2019ve been feeling like things around here are a little ... off. Is there more going on than a few dead stray cats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d He swept my hair over one shoulder. There was no doubt what he was about to do next.</p><p>I shrugged away before he got his first nibble. \u201cJon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissy.\u201d He cupped the back of my head, pulling me into a kiss.</p><p>Just as his mouth settled over mine, I shoved him. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work. You\u2019re not going to distract me. What aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m not keeping anything from you.\u201d Undeterred, he lunged forward, tackling me, looping his arms around my knees. I flopped over his shoulder like a big bag of ... something ... as he stood up.</p><p>I smacked him on the back, once for each step he ascended, the sound of each strike punctuating my words. \u201cJon.\u201d Smack. \u201cYou can.\u201d Smack. \u201cGet all caveman.\u201d Smack. \u201cOn me.\u201d Smack. \u201cBut I\u2019m not giving up.\u201d Smack. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He set me on my feet at the top of the stairs and gave me some seriously hungry eyes. \u201cHave I told you how sexy you are when you\u2019re annoyed?\u201d</p><p>Argh! I shoved past him, slamming the door behind me and locking it.</p><p>Jon knocked. \u201cBaby, let me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you tell me what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re hiding something. What is it?\u201d</p><p>He audibly sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to ask them. I can\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left my job, my home, to come here. You should be able to tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, giving the door my best mean eyes. \u201cYou can sleep in the guest room.\u201d Frustrated, I flopped onto the bed and stared up at the ceiling.</p><p>Six hours later, I gave up. There was absolutely no chance I was going to fall asleep. Feeling groggy, confused, foggy headed, and slightly depressed, I jumped into the shower, hoping some scalding hot water would wake me up a little. It helped. Figuring a half of pot of coffee would help even more, I staggered down to turn on the coffeemaker.</p><p>When I rounded the corner, lumbering into the kitchen, I stopped dead in my tracks.</p><p>There was a wire dog cable lying on the kitchen floor.</p><p>Right where Michelle had died.</p><p>Was this some kind of warning? A joke?</p><p>Telling myself it was nothing, absolutely nothing, a weird, terrible coincidence, I dashed outside, down to Samantha\u2019s house, and up her front porch steps. She answered my knock dressed in yet another adorable vintage dress, her hair and makeup picture-perfect. Like always. \u201cGood morning, Christine. What a surprise.\u201d She looked me up and down. I knew I wasn\u2019t looking my best, but who would in my shoes?</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I snapped, trying to peer around her. I didn\u2019t hear any barking. Surely there\u2019d be barking from those huge dogs.</p><p>What the hell was going on?</p><p>\u201cI need to talk,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She escorted me into the kitchen.</p><p>No sign of dogs.</p><p>She invited me to sit at her breakfast bar and poured a cup of coffee.</p><p>No sign of dogs. Or kids, for that matter. The kids, I might guess were still sleeping. But the dogs ... ?</p><p>She asked, \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I saw last night, for starters. And then what I found this morning.\u201d</p><p>Her lip twitched, but otherwise she remained as cool and collected as usual. \u201cWhat did you see last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Outside. At roughly midnight. Playing with some ... dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat couldn\u2019t have been me. I was sleeping. And I don\u2019t have any dogs. After I came home from the party, I took a Xanax and had some wine... .\u201d She slumped onto the stool next to me. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll admit, I don\u2019t remember anything about last night. All I recall is going to bed and waking up this morning.\u201d Staring down at the counter, Samantha clasped her hands in her lap. \u201cMy feet were a little muddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you black out?\u201d</p><p>Samantha nodded. \u201cI guess so, if you\u2019re sure it was me you saw.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t one hundred percent certain. \u201cAre you taking more than Xanax? And Valium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a drug problem?\u201d</p><p>She shot to her feet, hurried to the sink, and began scrubbing an empty, presumably dirty, pot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t like what I was seeing.

Was there something else you needed to talk about? You mentioned something about this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019ll never guess what I found this morning, lying on my kitchen floor. Right where Michelle died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dog cable.\u201d Weighing Samantha\u2019s nonresponse, I added, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s a coincidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Did you ask Jonathan about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a chance.\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to tell her we slept in separate rooms.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to\u2014\u201d A crash upstairs cut Samantha off. She gave me another semi-wilted smile. \u201cThe monsters have risen.\u201d</p><p>Taking the hint, I stood. \u201cI\u2019ll head home.\u201d I reluctantly left.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p> <p>I scuttled back home and cautiously entered the house, listening for sounds of a would-be killer. Silence. Feeling slightly tense, I went into the kitchen. The cable was gone. I wasn\u2019t sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing. Or maybe neither.</p><p>I headed upstairs.</p><p>Josh was gone\u2014hopefully at school.</p><p>The bed in the guest room was made. I guessed Jon had gone to work. No good-bye. As usual. After checking every room in the house for an unwanted visitor, I showered, dressed, then headed down to the girl-cave. Flipped on the lights. As I headed toward my drawing desk, there was a loud buzz and a zap and then everything went black.</p><p>Standing in the middle of the room, I blinked, frozen in place, instantly terrified. Was this a trap? Or merely a short circuit? My heart thumped against my breastbone. My ears strained, listening. Nothing. Just silence.</p><p>One second passed. Another. Nobody grabbed me. Nobody clobbered me over the head.</p><p>A short circuit. That was all it was.</p><p>Slowly, gradually, I started breathing again. My heart rate settled into a more normal pace. Already becoming disorientated in the blackness\u2014I couldn\u2019t see my hand in front of my face, literally\u2014I turned around, extended my arms, and took one, two, three baby steps. I hoped I was heading in the right direction! I took a few more, expecting to feel the wall enclosing the side of the staircase any time now ... any time ...</p> <p>Crack.</p><p>Crash.</p><p>Instinctively I dove forward, away from the earsplitting noise. Something had fallen. Something huge. Finally, my hands smacked into a wall. I flattened my body against it and caught my breath again.</p><p>Dust choked me.</p><p>I was feeling closed in, suffocated, trapped. Using the wall to support me, I sidestepped five, ten paces. Hit another wall. I groped. It was the cubbie wall. Damn, I\u2019d gone the wrong way! I was cowering in the far back corner of the room. Which meant the thing that crashed was probably blocking the exit. This was not going to be fun.</p><p>I reversed directions, walking carefully until I couldn\u2019t go any farther. Something big and wooden was lying in a heap on the floor, directly in front of the staircase. Fortunately I discovered\u2014after feeling my way around like a blind woman\u2014I could climb over it. When I stepped foot on the staircase, I gave a little shout of victory.</p><p>I threw the door open and squinted against the bright light. All it took was one quick glance in the kitchen to see the power hadn\u2019t gone out in the whole house. Just the basement. Lucky me. I looked down the steep staircase. The light spilling from the floor above illuminated part of the rubble at the bottom. Looked like one whole section of the cubbie wall had fallen. I was damned lucky I hadn\u2019t been standing there when it had given way. I might have.... I could have been....</p><p>If I\u2019d been standing just a few feet over, I very well would have been the second woman to die in this house.</p><p>Another coincidence?</p><p>Feeling a little sick, I flopped onto a bar stool and let my head fall. It landed on the cool granite countertop.</p><p>I\u2019d almost died.</p><p>Was it an accident? Or not?</p><p>I sat there, stunned, staring at the back of my eyelids for who knew how long. A knock at the front door brought me out of my stupor.</p><p>I opened my front door to discover I was having guests for an early lunch. Samantha, Lindsay, and Erica were standing on my porch, each of them holding a covered dish.</p><p>\u201cI brought a salad,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing that not even I can burn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPasta from Juliano\u2019s Restaurant,\u201d Erica said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I brought dessert,\u201d said Samantha, following the other two ladies into the house. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind our little surprise visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind at all.\u201d I shut the door and followed them in the kitchen.</p><p>Finally, one of them clued in on my dazed condition. \u201cChristine, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m not sure. Something just happened. Downstairs.\u201d I pointed and all three of them looked toward the basement.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lindsay asked, plunking the salad bowl on the counter. \u201cYou look absolutely petrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I almost died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lindsay rushed to me, eyes flying over me, probably looking for injuries.</p><p>\u201cI went downstairs to work and the light went out. It\u2019s freaking dark down there when there are no lights. And then I was trying to get back upstairs but there was a crash, and, and ...\u201d I swallowed but my mouth and throat were stone-dry. Lindsay rushed to the refrigerator, grabbed a water bottle, and handed it to me. After thanking her, I continued, \u201cThe built-in shelf fell, right in front of the stairs. If I\u2019d gone the right way, instead of back\u2014I got a little turned around\u2014it would have landed on me.\u201d</p><p>All three women gaped at me. Then two of them looked at Erica.</p><p>Quietly, she said, \u201cAdam built those shelves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t think about him,\u201d Lindsay said.</p><p>\u201cMichelle would let him into the house without a second thought,\u201d Samantha said, softly.</p><p>We all looked at Erica.</p><p>Erica shook her head. \u201cNo, it couldn\u2019t be Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you home with him that day?\u201d Samantha asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Erica fiddled with her hair.</p><p>\u201cThen you can\u2019t know that for sure. Right?\u201d Lindsay asked.</p><p>\u201cI know he wasn\u2019t home,\u201d Erica repeated, sounding absolutely certain. We all waited for her to tell us why she was so sure. She sighed. \u201cI came home early that day. His car was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he drove it around the block and parked it?\u201d Lindsay reasoned.</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Everyone, including me, gave Erica a pitying look.</p><p>\u201cDammit, don\u2019t look at me like that. I\u2019m not fooling myself. I know for a fact that Adam wasn\u2019t home because I sent him and the kids to my parents for a long weekend. I wanted some time to myself.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that made sense. But why had it seemed so difficult for Erica to spit it out? She was acting guilty, like she was hiding something.</p><p>\u201cThat was the weekend I found out Matt was cheating on me for the first time... .\u201d Lindsay said softly. She seemed to be talking to herself, not to anyone in particular.</p><p>Now I understood why Erica had tried to avoid telling us she\u2019d been home alone.</p><p>Lindsay lifted her gaze to Erica but didn\u2019t say a word. I think she understood, too.</p><p>\u201cWe should eat before everything gets cold.\u201d I jumped to my feet. After setting out all the essentials and pouring drinks, I sat down at the dining table with my three friends. Over heaping plates of pasta, we talked about the case. Turned out the doctor was a dead end. Erica had been able to sweet-talk Theresa into checking his schedule that day. He\u2019d delivered not one, not two, but three healthy baby boys that day. He didn\u2019t leave the hospital until after five P.M. And that could be confirmed.</p><p>The doctor wasn\u2019t the killer.</p><p>Which left ... the three women sitting around me and ... ?</p><p>Josh skulked into the kitchen just as I was about to say something. He looked ... strange. Tense. His eyes snapped to mine. They were dark. Cold. Empty.</p><p>That was one person we\u2019d never considered.</p><p>\u201cJosh ... ?\u201d I said.</p><p>He knew the victim.</p><p>He had access to the victim.</p><p>But two years ago he would have been just a child. Much too young to do anything so horrid.</p><p>A sick feeling swept through me.</p><p>\u201cNo school?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick.\u201d Josh jerked his gaze away and left the room. A chill skittered through my body.</p><p>Could it be Josh?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the problem is with Josh lately,\u201d I grumbled, not really expecting anyone to respond. \u201cI thought we were getting along okay, but the last few days, he\u2019s been so ... tense.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat if it was Joshua?\u201d Lindsay whispered as if she\u2019d read my mind.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he kill his own mother?\u201d I asked, afraid to hear the answer. Lately it seemed he\u2019d gone out of his way to stay away from me. But that was expected, normal. After all, he was a preteen. They were prone to mood swings. And getting adjusted to having a new adult in the house took time. There\u2019d been no sign of instability, no sign of hostility. At least nothing out of the ordinary. Every teenager got cranky sometimes.</p><p>Could a ten-year-old child really kill his mother? Could a child live with that kind of guilt for years? Would a child who had killed his mother even feel guilt? How would he hide what he\u2019d done from everyone?</p> <p>\u201cErica, I started to tell you something the night of the party,\u201d I said, intentionally shifting the conversation. I wasn\u2019t comfortable with the direction my thoughts had drifted.</p><p>Erica nodded. \u201cOf course, Josh,\u201d she said, ignoring me. \u201cWe should\u2019ve thought of that possibility sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cat\u2019s dead,\u201d I said.</p><p>Erica didn\u2019t respond. Didn\u2019t blink an eye. \u201cChristine, have you noticed anything unusual around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cAnything. Anything at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed ... neighbors getting wasted and dancing around their front yards in the middle of the night. Having affairs because they hate their husbands. Becoming lesbians because they\u2019ve been heartbroken one too many times. But I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s pretty normal stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right. That is pretty normal stuff, compared to\u2014\u201d Erica cut herself off. \u201cI\u2019m thinking more like finding dead animals at your doorstep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Erica slapped her flattened hands on the table. \u201cThey\u2019re gifts. For Jon. A plea for forgiveness. It makes perfect sense, and it explains why we suspected Jon in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I said, not following.</p> <p>Lindsay agreed with a nod. \u201cHe knows the truth. We smelled the deceit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s protecting his son,\u201d Samantha explained, her pretty ice-blue eyes full of understanding. \u201cJon has been protecting Joshua all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? Why would Josh kill his mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing it was The Change,\u201d Samantha said, shaking her head. \u201cHe probably couldn\u2019t help himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat change?\u201d I was so fricking lost. Would somebody explain it in simple terms? \u201cWhat about the shelves falling? The dog cable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn accident, I\u2019m guessing,\u201d Lindsay said.</p><p>\u201cAdam built some shelves in our house, too. They fell,\u201d Erica admitted. \u201cThe cable was probably left by Jon. He might\u2019ve been trying to secure Josh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSecure Josh?\u201d I echoed.</p><p>Samantha pulled a pill bottle out of her purse, studied it, then dropped it back in. \u201cHow terrible for Jon. To lose his wife and then face the stigma of a police investigation. Not to mention, I\u2019m sure he was terribly worried about what would happen to Josh if anyone discovered the truth. And here, I thought I had a lot of stress to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I said.</p><p>Samantha, Lindsay, and Erica exchanged glances. Finally Erica spoke, \u201cThere\u2019s something you don\u2019t know about us. All of us. You see, we\u2019re not exactly what you think we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right.\u201d Samantha emptied her purse onto the table. I counted five prescription bottles. \u201cI am addicted to prescription drugs. Lindsay is sexually confused. And Erica hates her husband and is sleeping with a younger man. But that\u2019s not the worst of it. Not by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>I held my breath, knowing I was finally going to have the answers I\u2019d been searching for.</p><p>Samantha folded her napkin and, after dry-swallowing a handful of pills, clasped her hands in her lap. \u201cI started taking Xanax years ago. For anxiety. Then I added Valium to my daily diet. And sleeping pills. I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. The stress. My husband is a demon, and I do mean that in the most literal sense. If you have any doubt, just look at my children.\u201d</p><p>Demon spawn? They were a little loud, slightly wild, but hardly the offspring of the devil.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have my reasons for resenting my worthless husband,\u201d Erica said. \u201cHe\u2019s a dragon. Because of his hair-trigger temper, he hasn\u2019t been able to keep a job for more than a month. And he won\u2019t try anger management therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy run-around, cheating ex-boyfriend was a fae. I\u2019m telling you, they cannot be monogamous. It\u2019s simply not in their blood. I know that now. And we\u201d\u2014Lindsay motioned to Samantha, and Erica\u2014\u201care werewolves. So was Michelle. You saw us. With Samantha.\u201d</p><p>My gaze snapped back to Samantha\u2019s eyes. Ice-blue. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as werewolves,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, there is,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cYou\u2019re not only sitting at the table with three, but you\u2019re living with one, too.\u201d</p><p>This was crazy. Insane. Silly.</p><p>A joke. Had to be.</p><p>I stood. I sat back down. I stammered. Finally, I was able to speak. \u201cFirst you tried to convince me that Jon killed his wife. Now you\u2019re telling me he\u2019s a werewolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Erica said. \u201cJon\u2019s not the werewolf, although he isn\u2019t what you\u2019d call human, either. Josh is a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do about Josh?\u201d Lindsay asked, genuine concern pulling at her brows. \u201cWe can\u2019t take this to the police. You know what will happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t. You\u2019re right about that.\u201d Erica\u2019s gaze swept around the table. \u201cWe have to keep it to ourselves. We know the truth at last, and we can let it rest. It\u2019s the best thing for everyone. It\u2019s what Michelle would want. He\u2019s made it through his first Change. He isn\u2019t dangerous anymore.\u201d</p><p>Was I buying this?</p><p>Hell, no.</p><p>Not at all.</p><p>Were these people all crazy?</p><p>I just wanted them to leave. Now. My skin was feeling creepy-crawly. My insides were twisted into knots.</p><p>\u201cChristine, you\u2019re looking a little pale,\u201d Lindsay pointed out.</p><p>I stood, bracing my hands on the tabletop. My knees were soft, my head a little swimmy. \u201cI think I need to go lie down.\u201d</p><p>They all stood at the same time and filed toward the door.</p><p>Lindsay was the last to leave. She touched my arm, and I twitched, some instinct inside of me jumping at the contact. \u201cIf you want proof, come outside tonight. Midnight. It\u2019s a full moon. You\u2019ll see for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I shut the door and vowed I wouldn\u2019t get anywhere near a door or window after eleven tonight.</p><p>Of course, I broke that vow.</p><p>At exactly midnight, I stepped out onto the deck. And I watched the three women who were slowly becoming my friends change into wolves.</p><p>After swallowing the contents of my stomach a few times, I staggered back inside and stumbled right into Jon\u2019s arms. I flung myself as far from him as I could, then turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cDid Josh kill his mother?\u201d I blurted.</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t answer right away. He looked torn, guilty, conflicted.</p><p>I saw red.</p><p>\u201cJon, you know I\u2019ve sensed something wasn\u2019t right about this place since I arrived. I\u2019m telling you right here, right now, that you owe me the truth.\u201d Folding my arms, I took another step backward, afraid I might do something impulsive if I didn\u2019t put some space between us. I couldn\u2019t ever remember being so angry, so hurt. \u201cIf you can\u2019t trust me with all your secrets, every last one, I have to leave. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cPlease, sit down.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I followed him into the family room and sat.</p><p>He sat opposite me, on the ottoman, elbows resting on his knees, body angled forward. \u201cI take it you know about Lindsay, Samantha, and Erica?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Couldn\u2019t say the words yet. It was all too freakish to speak aloud.</p><p>\u201cThen you know werewolves exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what does that have to do with Josh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I told you about Michelle having trouble getting pregnant was true. After trying for years, we adopted Joshua, knowing he would become a werewolf someday. I thought we could handle his first turning without help. I was wrong.\u201d He gritted his teeth and stared down at the floor. \u201cI\u2019ll regret that mistake for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Werewolves. Changing. What the hell? Was I having a nightmare? Was this all a big joke? I felt like I\u2019d fallen down the rabbit\u2019s hole and landed in some kind of freakish Wonderland that not even Lewis Carroll could have cooked up.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked as I struggled to sort through what I was hearing, thinking, feeling.</p><p>\u201cDuring a werewolf\u2019s first turning, the wolf instinct can be very strong. Too strong. Joshua was young. He couldn\u2019t control it.\u201d A tear slipped from Jon\u2019s eye. \u201cMy wife.\u201d He dropped his face into his cupped hands. Didn\u2019t speak for a long time. I didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have wanted me to turn Josh in, knowing what would happen to him. I knew, too. We couldn\u2019t... . I couldn\u2019t... .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jon\u2019s eyes found mine. \u201cYou\u2019ve always called me Dracula\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe to you, but it was closer to the truth than you realized.\u201d</p><p>I staggered to my feet. Stunned. Too overwhelmed and shocked to think straight. But I knew one thing. I was hurt. Deeply. Jon hadn\u2019t trusted me enough to tell me the truth. About himself. His son. His wife. Not even his neighbors.</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d he asked as I headed toward the foyer.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I need some time to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it makes any difference, I do trust you, Chrissy. That\u2019s why I told you the truth.\u201d</p><p>A tear dribbled down my cheek. I sniffled, dragged my hand across my face. \u201cIt sure took you a long time, though.\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet and slowly walked toward me. \u201cYou\u2019re right. But am I the only one who was afraid to trust, Chrissy? Or were you putting up a few walls, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a pointed look.</p> <p>Shoot, he was right.</p><p>I fell right into defense mode. \u201cBut if you hadn\u2019t given me a reason to be distrustful\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissy, the first day you were talking about safety nets.\u201d</p><p>I was. I had. Shit. How could I have been so insensitive?</p><p>\u201cJon, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, interrupting me. \u201cI want you to be a part of every aspect of my life. The dark and the light.\u201d Closing the distance between us, he clasped my upper arms in his fists and searched my eyes. I don\u2019t know what he saw, but it couldn\u2019t have been what he\u2019d been hoping for. \u201cYou have to be willing to trust me. Do you want to? Are you capable of trusting anyone? Or do you need to jump off the high wire now and let your safety net catch you?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to answer him.</p><p>He released my arms and I breathed easier. And yet I felt worse. Cut off from him. As if I\u2019d lost him already, despite his words. And, oh God, how awful that hurt. Like a red-hot blade plunged into my gut.</p> <p>This man had grieved the death of a wife and still fiercely protected the child who\u2019d killed her.</p><p>This man had gone out of his way to make me feel at home, welcomed.</p><p>This man had silently endured my distrust since the day I\u2019d moved in, waiting patiently for me to decide whether or not I could trust him.</p><p>What the hell was I doing? How could I even think to leave this man?</p><p>Eyes burning, I flung myself at him. He caught me, just like I knew he would, and pulled me into a bone-crushing embrace. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I said to his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I was basically sabotaging our relationship from the minute I stepped out of that truck. It\u2019s a wonder you didn\u2019t throw me out then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that. I need you too much. You\u2019re my safety net.\u201d He stroked my hair, cupped my chin, and lifted it until our gazes met. \u201cTell me you love me.\u201d His eyes were pleading.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my safety net, too. I love you, Dracula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Chrissy.\u201d He kissed me and I kissed him back. He would never again doubt how I felt about him. Never. Vampire or just a guy who works some crazy hours, this man was my dream man. Mr. Perfect. I was going to do everything in my power to be his Mrs. Perfect.</p><p>On Halloween, I received a very special gift\u2014the ring, and the proposal that I\u2019d been waiting for. Of course, I very happily accepted both. I\u2019d found a home, a future, a family. Here. In Jonathan Stewart\u2019s arms. In his house. In his town.</p><p>Not to mention, a very dedicated, well-dressed, wonderfully goofy Pack of friends to dance with in the moonlight.</p><p>As the old saying goes, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. That was never more true than on Lancaster Street. Samantha Phillips was jealous of Lindsay Baker\u2019s freedom. Lindsay Baker envied Erica Ross\u2019s lifestyle\u2014the cars, the clothes, the vacations. And Erica Ross begrudged Samantha\u2019s job as full-time mother.</p><p>But they all envied Michelle Stewart. Because everyone knew a vampire\u2014who perhaps was a little too undead to be fairy-tale Prince Charming material\u2014was still a better catch than a hotheaded dragon, a runaround fae, or a demon with an attitude.</p><p>WHAT\u2019S YOURS IS MINE</p><p>JESS HAINES</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Fashion fades, only style remains the same.</p><p>\u2014Coco Chanel</p><p>\u201cThat is a darling color! Very flattering with your skin tone.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra, who had been busily staring into space while her nails were being painted, blinked and turned her attention to the woman in the chair next to her. A \u201ccity bitch,\u201d Vera would have called her. The woman\u2019s hair was chemically blond and straight, her tan spray-on, and her face painted with colors that gleamed and glittered like the jewelry on her wrists and throat.</p><p>Cassandra couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cThank you. I like that shirt. Gucci?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose. Dolce,\u201d the woman admitted, flexing her toes in a way that had the lady working on her pedicure scowling. She fluttered her already painted fingernails in greeting. Rhinestones flashed. \u201cI\u2019m Tiffany. Tiffany Winters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra Sachs. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>The intricate dance of Who Has More Money had only just begun. Cassandra surreptitiously eyed the purse at the foot of the woman\u2019s cushy chair; she couldn\u2019t see the brand name, but the Prada sunglasses hanging off a strap were a clue.</p><p>Tiffany smiled, revealing blindingly white teeth. \u201cSay, I\u2019m new to town. I just moved into the Still Waters community.\u201d Another hint, this one as subtle as a solid gold brick to the face. Still Waters was one of the most exclusive\u2014and expensive\u2014gated communities in town. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know of any places closer than Manhattan that have some real nightlife, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, absolutely!\u201d Cassandra ignored Ling\u2019s gasp when she shifted to ensure the huge rock on her finger caught the light, figuring her nail stylist would fix the smeared polish without a fuss. Ling made a small sound in her throat that might have been a curse, but she was paid too much money to scold one of her best customers. \u201cAs a matter of fact, we\u2019re neighbors. I live in Still Waters, too. A few of us get together and go to the Smoke &amp; Whiskey downtown for drinks a couple nights a week. You\u2019re welcome to join us.\u201d</p><p>The two women chatted for a while, their despairing nail technicians doing their best to ensure no more polish was smeared as the ladies moved just so to ensure their skin, jewelry, and clothing was displayed to best advantage, preferably with brand names visible at all times. Cassandra finally felt she had the upper hand when Tiffany\u2019s blue eyes (contacts, she was sure) widened perceptibly at the sight of the pink diamond on her ring finger. It caught the light as no imitation would, practically crackling with sparkles.</p><p>Tiffany did as any woman would when confronted by such an eye-catching stone. She cooed over the diamond, clearly lusting after one of her own.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, you must have found yourself quite a catch to get a rock like that!\u201d</p><p>Cassandra\u2019s lips curled, practically purring with pleasure. \u201cOh, he is, no doubt of that. Gabriel\u2019s great-great-grandfather was a partner in the original Kimberley diamond mine excursion. He could have lived on the trust his father set up, but he opened his own architectural firm instead.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s eyes widened, suitably impressed. Cassandra, for her part, was not about to let an opportunity to pry slip by.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? What does your husband do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Tiffany said, airy tones dripping with indifference, \u201cI\u2019m not married. Not anymore, as far as I\u2019m concerned. My husband dealt in security and built custom firearms. We had our differences and separated last year. The divorce is nearly finalized, and I\u2019m not in any rush to replace him. The alimony and sales of my artwork keep me comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra clicked her tongue, making sympathetic sounds, eyes bright as she studied Tiffany more closely. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame things didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any kids and we discovered late in the relationship that we both wanted different things out of life. The separation was amiable, and the divorce was relatively painless. Truthfully, it\u2019s better this way for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got such a bright outlook on things. You really should meet the other ladies. I think a girls night out would be just the thing. Meet us at the Smoke &amp; Whiskey tonight at ten. I\u2019ll introduce you to everyone.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s plush lips curved in a wicked smile as she leaned back in her salon chair, closing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll like this one,\u201d Cassandra said, stirring her martini with a thin crystal swizzle stick. \u201cNew to town, no kids, no husband, and positively desperate to fit in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesperation should suit our needs quite nicely,\u201d Vera replied before she sipped her lemon drop, crossing her slender legs primly at her ankles. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time we took in new blood? If we don\u2019t work to expand our ranks as much as we have our fortunes, we\u2019ll never have the kind of influence over the Were communities that Gabriel keeps going on about. If he wants to be the next Rohrik Donovan, he needs to work for it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh please,\u201d Alexis scoffed, waggling fingers wrapped in jewels in airy dismissal. \u201cOur husbands would have done something about it already if they knew how. Their little yacht club meetings and golfing excursions are just excuses to avoid facing facts\u2014that scouting their usual haunts isn\u2019t going to get us any new wolves. It just goes to show that, as always, it\u2019s the women behind the men in power who really make history.\u201d</p><p>Heather shifted uncomfortably, twining her fingers in her long auburn hair as her attention shifted back and forth between the other ladies. She opened her mouth to add her thoughts to the conversation, but Cassandra smoothly overrode her.</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may, if we are going to take over recruitment for the pack, we might as well start somewhere. I think this woman could be a good fit. She already lives in the community and she\u2019s newly divorced\u2014which means she\u2019ll be lonely and looking for a man soon enough.\u201d</p> <p>Heather opened her mouth again, but this time Vera cut her off. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that volunteering Charles or Lucas as a fit for this woman we haven\u2019t met is such a good idea. Make her one of the pack? Sure. Hand her over to the available men? Not unless she\u2019s breeding pups before she\u2019s turned. Which doesn\u2019t solve our numbers problem for the short term.\u201d</p><p>Alexis smirked, drawing her straw across her tongue in a playful, flirtatious bid to draw the attention of one of the men at the bar before adding her thoughts. \u201cDivorc\u00e9es are generally bitter, lonely people. Not the mothering sort, if she doesn\u2019t have rugrats already, I\u2019m sure. She can choose someone else; perhaps one of the hopefuls that Gabriel keeps going on about inviting to those dull brunches of his... .\u201d</p><p>Cassandra gave Alexis a withering look, which went ignored. Her smile was cold enough to make Vera and Heather drop their eyes submissively, knowing better than to tease her about her husband\u2014or his parties.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Alexis. I\u2019ll be sure to tell him you think so,\u201d Cassandra said, her tone flat enough that Alexis finally realized she was in error.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cassie, you know I didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d</p> <p>Alexis had turned her eyes down, but her tone told the lie. Cassandra leaned forward, her ample cleavage spilling from her low-cut top, drawing the eyes of several men at the tables around them as she settled her hand on the glass tabletop next to Alexis\u2019s drink. One nail had formed into a talon, etching a fine line of warning into the glass between them.</p><p>Alexis audibly gulped and lowered her head contritely, a faint sound like a whine dying in her throat. Cassandra stared at her across the table, the others keeping their eyes down as she tapped her fingers impatiently. Finally, she spoke, her words cold and biting.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like how the pack is run, you may rise to the challenge to change it. Otherwise, I suggest you remember who is in charge before your mouth gets you into trouble.\u201d</p><p>Alexis nodded once, sharply, ducking her head further. Cassandra laughed and leaned forward enough to brush her finger along Alexis\u2019s arm, making her flinch. \u201cSilly pup, look what you\u2019ve made me do! I\u2019ve just had my nails done, too.\u201d</p><p>The others exclaimed over the now cracked veneer of polish on her finger, clucking their tongues over the damage. Before long, Cassandra rose, putting the full force of her chilly smile on Alexis again.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go meet the new girl, shall we?\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>The body is meant to be seen, not all covered up.</p><p>\u2014Marilyn Monroe</p><p>The beautiful people of New Jersey often convened on the Gold Coast or fled to Manhattan when they wanted to see and be seen. For those who wanted to do so in the relative privacy of a community too expensive for the locals and too subdued for the tourists, the residents of Saddle River often looked no further than their own backyards to the elegantly overpriced charms of the Smoke &amp; Whiskey.</p><p>The nightclub was in good form when Cassandra arrived. She was fashionably late and prepared with a newly restored manicure as she glided down from the heights of her Navigator and passed the keys for her SUV to the valet.</p><p>She sauntered up the solar light\u2013lined walkway to the entrance where a host held the door for her. She promptly paused to bask in the recessed spotlights and let the crowd inside take in the view of her in all her chic splendor. As was to be expected, a low murmur of appreciation started up amidst the candle-lit interior as the tall, Amazonian brunette in killer Ferragamo pumps and a sleek Valentino dress surveyed her domain, finding it wanting.</p><p>Particularly when Tiffany appeared behind her, settling into an equally statuesque pose in her Manolo strappy stilettos\u2014making her just a smidge taller\u2014as she came to a glittering rest in her vintage Versace beside Cassandra.</p><p>\u201cLovely evening for a night out,\u201d Tiffany purred. \u201cI had no idea there was nightlife this close to home.\u201d</p> <p>Said nightlife was composed of a number of men and women at low, intimate tables talking over drinks while candles sparked and sputtered in dark alcoves, and the gentle strains of soft jazz came from an easily forgettable band on the stage across the room. Smoke drifted from dry ice placed in hidden recesses and gave the place its namesake, admirably reproducing the atmosphere of a Prohibition-era speakeasy. The club tried hard to pull off the air of \u201cupper class dive,\u201d but failed miserably thanks to the glint of crystal and glow of real teakwood from the bar and tables.</p><p>Cassandra eyed the bangles clinking on Tiffany\u2019s wrist as the blonde airily brushed her hair back, revealing equally jangly earrings. Tr\u00e8s out of style, but Cassandra delighted in not telling her that.</p><p>\u201cQuite. If it gets too dull, we can always go to Manhattan,\u201d Cassandra said, gesturing to the table where Vera, Heather, and Alexis had already settled, nursing drinks that glowed in the subdued light of the club. \u201cAh, there we are. Let\u2019s go have a seat, shall we? You can meet the other ladies of Still Waters.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany confidently took the lead; the other girls\u2019 expressions ranged from wary to impressed at Cassandra\u2019s restraint for allowing her to go first. Tiffany didn\u2019t appear to notice the others\u2019 discomfort as she swept around the table to shake hands as she was introduced. For her part, the alpha bitch was amused, finding this potential new blood to be the sort of headstrong woman necessary to build the Diamondfangs into a pack that might someday overcome the Moonwalkers.</p><p>\u201c... and so,\u201d Tiffany finished explaining her circumstances on moving to town as she shook Vera\u2019s hand, meeting the woman\u2019s eyes as her grip tightened uncomfortably. \u201cI\u2019ve only been in town for a couple weeks, but I think I\u2019ll be settled in before long. The divorce is nearly final. I do have to say, while I\u2019m pleased to find myself in such company, I can\u2019t stay long tonight. We can meet again soon. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all be fast friends.\u201d</p><p>Vera showed her teeth in the semblance of a smile, her eyes briefly taking on a glimmer of something unnatural as she held on to Tiffany\u2019s hand long past when she should have let her go.</p><p>\u201cIs that right? You look familiar. Are you sure you\u2019ve only been in town for two weeks?\u201d</p><p>Tiffany gave Vera a tight smile of her own, but said nothing, pulling her hand back hard enough that it was obviously an effort. Cassandra made a faint hissing noise between her teeth, and Vera gradually relented, looking away. Alexis sipped her drink, her expression turned wary and calculating as she watched the exchange, while Heather\u2019s attention was focused on the band across the room.</p><p>\u201cQuite sure,\u201d Tiffany replied. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to New Jersey since, oh, before I was married. I used to travel extensively, so perhaps you saw me in the airport on my way to South Africa or Versailles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouth Africa?\u201d One perfectly sculpted brow arched as Alexis regarded Tiffany over the rim of her drink, a sardonic twist to her cherry lips. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019d be doing there. The place has nothing to offer but backward politics and savages, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s smile turned murderous. \u201cVisiting family, actually. My mother is from Johannesburg. Also, I often visit to acquire more tribal artwork and supplies for my gallery. Many people admire the richness and beauty of the culture.\u201d</p><p>Alexis reddened and muttered something apologetic into her drink. Cassandra watched all of this with the avid gaze of a cat who has spotted a wounded bird fluttering within reach of its paws.</p><p>Heather dove to the rescue, her voice sweet and sincere as she sidled her chair a bit closer to Tiffany. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to that nonsense, she\u2019s just being her usual catty, bitchy self. We are glad to have you here!\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s narrowed blue eyes slid from Vera to rest on Heather, her expression lightening considerably. \u201cThank you. What a doll you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come shopping with me tomorrow? I heard there\u2019s a new store with vintage Louis Vuitton that just opened up in Manhattan.\u201d Heather\u2019s wide brown eyes were completely guileless, and the others couldn\u2019t restrain their eye rolls as she squealed in excitement at Tiffany\u2019s nod. \u201cExcellent! Give me your address, I\u2019ll pick you up at noon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tiffany did, smiling wolfishly as she slid a business card across the table. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Vera watched Tiffany leave with narrowed, distrustful eyes. The woman positively sauntered off, clearly pleased at how Alexis and Heather had warmed to her.</p><p>\u201cI think we have a winner, ladies,\u201d Cassandra said as she ran her fingertip along the edge of her glass, making the crystal sing.</p> <p>Heather nodded enthusiastically, while Alexis reddened. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Cassandra scolded. \u201cI don\u2019t think you scared her off. Besides, she\u2019s taken to Heather, and I\u2019m sure she can salvage any hurt feelings and bring the girl around to seeing things our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like her,\u201d Vera stated flatly. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s what she seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither are we,\u201d Heather replied.</p><p>The women quieted briefly, sipping at their drinks. Heather frowned, glancing back and forth between the others. Seeing as no one was talking, she broke the silence with a few chipper words.</p> <p>\u201cI think she\u2019s great. I can\u2019t wait to get to know her better. If she became part of the pack, we could set her up with one of the single wolves. Who hasn\u2019t been mated yet? Oh, I bet she\u2019d be a great match for Travis or Damon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop that prattling?\u201d</p><p>Heather regarded Vera with a hurt expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen her somewhere before,\u201d Vera muttered. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where, but I know I have. Something about her is dangerous. We need to know more about her before we take her into the pack.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra was not amused. \u201cIf you can provide proof of whatever it is that has you worried, I\u2019ll take it into consideration. Until then, we go forward as planned. Heather will gather more information tomorrow and question her about her feelings on Others. Yes?\u201d</p><p>Heather nodded, smiling brightly.</p> <p>\u201cThere, you see? We\u2019ll get to know her better and take it from there. I doubt she\u2019ll be willing to sign a contract within a single day, anyway. We have time.\u201d</p><p>Vera still wasn\u2019t convinced, but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cEven if she poses a threat now, she won\u2019t be one for long. I\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>I\u2019ve been getting some bad publicity, but you got to expect that.</p><p>\u2014Elvis Presley</p><p>Tiffany toyed with the curtains while she held her cell phone to her ear, staring out over the wide expanse of her backyard to the ring of trees that surrounded her property. After a few rings, a gruff voice harrumphed in her ear.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think I\u2019d be hearing from you this soon. Run out of money already? Alimony isn\u2019t due yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass, Richard,\u201d she said, turning away from the window. \u201cI want you to tell me what you know about Cassandra Sachs and the women she surrounds herself with\u2014Heather, Alexis, and especially Vera.\u201d</p><p>He paused. Coughed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re trying to hunt on your own? Look, I know you didn\u2019t like our methods\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t call for a lecture. Tell me what you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dangerous, Tiff. Diamondfangs. Rich, snobbish, always looking to expand their ranks with more of the same. They\u2019ve taken lawyers, CEOs, even a couple of state senators, and made them werewolves. They\u2019ve got some kind of political agenda. I wouldn\u2019t mess with them. If they\u2019re sniffing around you, get out of town. I\u2019ll send over some people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Tiff, this isn\u2019t like before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Richard. It\u2019s not. You\u2019re not my white knight, come to save the day.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cDamn it, babe, you always do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s why we\u2019re not seeing each other anymore. Or have you forgotten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied, dull anger coloring his tone. \u201cOf course not. How could I? You never let me forget.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany fingered the framed image of herself in a wedding dress, leaning against a much larger man in a tuxedo who had his arm wrapped tightly around her. They were smiling, squinting against bright sunlight as they stood in a field dappled with spring flowers. Happy. Different.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think now\u2019s the time to discuss this. All I called for was information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s never been the right time. Look, we could put off filing the papers. Try this again. Why don\u2019t you just come home? You know I\u2019m crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>She tilted the frame until it was lying facedown, turning away. \u201cIt\u2019s not my home. The hunting and the killing\u2014that isn\u2019t my world anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, it doesn\u2019t have to be. Let me handle it like I always did. You don\u2019t have to do anything. You never did. You wanted to come on the hunt, and you did. You wanted to stop, and you stopped. What\u2019s there to argue about?\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s fingers clenched around the phone until the plastic squeaked. She eased up, taking a breath to calm herself, though it didn\u2019t help much. The words were still bitter, harsh, and she regretted them the moment they passed her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou really want me to just sit on my ass on the sidelines while you put your life on the line, night after night? I won\u2019t do it, Richard. Don\u2019t ask that of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went into this relationship knowing what it meant. I never lied to you. I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s a problem now.\u201d</p><p>Distantly, the sound of a horn blared. Tiffany reached for her purse, voice inflectionless. \u201cGood-bye, Richard.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for him to reply before snapping the phone shut and tossing it in her purse, clacking down the stairs to meet with Heather.</p><p>The silver Lexus idling in her circular drive looked right at home next to Tiffany\u2019s white Mercedes. Heather waved, giving Tiffany a cheerful smile that was soon returned in kind. There was no visible sign of her anger from a moment before.</p><p>\u201cHey, ready to go shopping? Hop in!\u201d</p><p>Tiffany settled in on the passenger side, slipping on a pair of sunglasses as Heather took off down the drive, sparing her a surreptitious glance now and again.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p><p>Tiffany blinked, startled, before allowing a bitter smile to curve her lips. \u201cSorry. Just got off the phone with my ex. Ever since the divorce ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, say no more,\u201d Heather said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, honey, once we hit the stores and start spending, you\u2019ll forget all about him. We\u2019ll find you someone new. Someone better!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a bit early for that,\u201d Tiffany replied, tone dry. \u201cLet\u2019s stick with the shopping for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You know, who needs men? You\u2019ve got us now.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany laughed. \u201cEasy for you to say. Don\u2019t you have a husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do. One that\u2019s never home, same as the rest of the werewives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>Heather flushed. \u201cSorry. Just an inside joke. Cassandra, Heather, Vera, and I, we\u2019re all such bitches, we call ourselves the werewives. We\u2019ve been using that nickname for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny thing to call yourselves,\u201d Tiffany murmured, gaze focused steadily on the world passing them by.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t afraid of werewolves, are you? They aren\u2019t so bad. From what I hear, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Nothing like that. Honestly, I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve known any. Just what the papers tell me.\u201d</p><p>Heather was scandalized. \u201cYou don\u2019t honestly believe what they print in the papers, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. I think a lot of things get nothing but bad press, werewolves included. I\u2019d love to meet one sometime. Find out what they\u2019re really like,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cReally? Most people wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with them.\u201d</p><p>A low, throaty laugh made Heather glance guiltily at her guest, biting her lower lip. Tiffany wiped unshed tears of mirth from her eyes, ever so careful not to smudge her mascara. \u201cHoney, you have no idea. Despite what the papers might say, there are plenty of people out there\u2014me included\u2014who are curious about Others and would be delighted to have a chance to meet one in person. Vampires, werewolves, wizards\u2014they\u2019re different. Unique. The possibilities fire the imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not that different,\u201d Heather muttered, reddening.</p><p>Tiffany arched an artificially bleached brow, then shrugged and laughed again. \u201cYou are too funny! If it bothers you that much, we\u2019ll talk about something else. Like calling yourself a bitch. I don\u2019t see why you think so. You\u2019ve been very sweet to me.\u201d</p><p>Heather gave her a sheepish smile before returning her attention back to the road. She hadn\u2019t intended to bring up the subject so soon, or with such a lack of subtlety, and was thankful that Tiffany was the one who was turning the topic back to something less dangerous.</p><p>\u201cWait until we both have our eye on the same purse or pair of shoes, then ask me that again.\u201d</p><p>The two laughed, together this time, and the topic shifted to far more comfortable topics: fashion, favorite brands, and which celebrity was sleeping with whom. They didn\u2019t speak about Others again for the whole of the trip; not at the store where they each bought a new purse, nor at the caf\u00e9 they stopped at for a light lunch and cocktails. The pair gushed about their purchases, stopping at a few more boutiques (each finding the perfect pair of summer sandals, along with darling sundresses and earrings to match), before ending their trek at a Starbucks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you coming to the party tonight?\u201d Heather asked as she sipped her grande nonfat iced mocha raspberry latte.</p><p>Tiffany stirred her chai tea with a straw, eying Heather over the rim of her drink. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a party. Am I invited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! It\u2019s at Alexis\u2019s house, everyone who\u2019s anyone in the neighborhood was invited. She must have forgotten to mention it last night. It\u2019s not a big deal, just a little barbeque. If she gets uppity, we\u2019ll go back to my place and mix some margaritas.\u201d</p> <p>Tiffany laughed, the sound attracting admiring glances from a few of the men and a number of glares from some of the women cradling drinks or hunched over laptops as they worked on the next Great American Novel. She touched her hair, then plucked at one of the buttons on her silk blouse, frowning.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind stopping at my place so I can drop off my things and freshen up a bit before we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! Let\u2019s get moving, then, don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tiffany said, her eyes narrowing and her smile turning sly. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>Just because you got the monkey off your back doesn\u2019t mean the circus has left town.</p><p>\u2014George Carlin</p><p>Alexis\u2019s mansion sprawled across the verdant grounds of the property with all of the glamour and poise of a movie starlet. The trees lining her driveway glittered with twinkling lights, urging guests to come along to see the wonders of her garden. Row upon row of Jaguar, Mercedes, Audi, BMW, and Lexus luxury cars had been positioned just so, shining to advantage in the lights spilling from the house. Gabled windows and wrought-iron balconies gave the manor a European flavor, and the sounds of chatter, music, and laughter spilled from open French doors.</p><p>Tiffany followed in Heather\u2019s wake, adjusting the strap of her purse as she paused in the foyer, bright blue eyes scanning the interior.</p><p>Much like the cars, many of the people inside had positioned themselves to advantage. They cradled drinks as they chatted in small groups of four or five, clustered around the baroque Louis XIV furniture done in rich tones of red and gold that matched the marble floors and sweeping columns in the open receiving room.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Tiffany said as her eyes locked on a man in a casual Tony Bahama polo and sleek J. Crew slacks. \u201cI see one of my clients. I\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d</p> <p>Heather nodded, but Tiffany wasn\u2019t paying attention, already stalking across the room like a hunting cat on the prowl, lacquered hand extended for the surprised gentleman to take as he noticed her. \u201cTodd, it\u2019s been ages... .\u201d</p><p>The smooth way Tiffany went in for the kill drew Heather\u2019s admiration instead of her ire. Though she wasn\u2019t pleased at being ditched, she soon shrugged it off and followed her nose, trailing the distinct, musky scents of her favored pack mates. Her own stride became smooth, quiet, the stalking of a predator, leading the people around her to unconsciously move aside as she found her way to the back doors leading outside. A bright smile was soon plastered on her face as she took an empty seat beside Alexis on the patio. Cassandra returned her smile, eyebrows arching high.</p><p>\u201cI take it things went well today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes!\u201d Heather gushed. \u201cLadies, we have a winner. She\u2019s curious about Others and said she wants to meet a werewolf. How about that? I think she might go for it. I really do.\u201d</p><p>Alexis frowned, her voice heavy with skepticism. \u201cAre you sure about that? Most humans wouldn\u2019t be so quick to put themselves within arm\u2019s reach of a supernatural creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, we haven\u2019t exactly been forthcoming with her about ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not cut out to be one of us,\u201d Vera said, dripping disdain as she lounged back in her chair and stabbed the air with her martini olive\u2019s toothpick for emphasis. \u201cShe\u2019s well-dressed and obviously has connections, but we hardly know a thing about her. I don\u2019t want her here. Not until we\u2019re sure she\u2019s not a threat.\u201dCassandra ignored Vera, narrowed eyes remaining locked on Heather, her expression otherwise unreadable. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you think we should have said something to her already? She hardly knows us. No matter what she says, no one is prepared for being faced with the real thing. Not the first time. Think of the danger she could pose by knowing too much too soon.\u201d</p><p>Heather pouted. \u201cI thought you wanted her in the pack, Cassie? I didn\u2019t tell her anything. I just asked a few questions and got her opinion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt just seems a bit rushed. If you\u2019re sure it\u2019s safe, I suppose we should take advantage of her interest while we can. Where is she now?\u201d</p><p>Heather gestured back the way she had come, lowering her voice\u2014completely unnecessarily, considering no one but members of the pack were mingling outside. \u201cShe came with me. She saw someone she recognized, so she\u2019s distracted for a bit, but she\u2019ll be joining us shortly. We should tell her tonight. We really should.\u201d</p><p>Alexis shrugged, sipping her martini before placing the glass on the table and leaning forward, her eyes gleaming with mischief. \u201cYou know, if she\u2019s really as interested as you say, I\u2019ll bet we could sell her on joining us before the next full moon. Cassie, if you can convince Gabriel to let Heather sign her, I\u2019ll bet we\u2019ll have her on a contract before the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>They were interrupted by a discreet cough, a man holding a tumbler of brandy coming to a stop next to Alexis\u2019s chair. \u201cLadies, I trust you\u2019re enjoying yourselves?\u201d</p><p>Murmurs of assent and a few pithy greetings were exchanged. Alexis was not amused by the interruption.</p><p>\u201cDarling, do you know anything about our new guest, Tiffany ... What did you say her last name was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinters,\u201d Cassandra supplied. Vera growled softly, but didn\u2019t say anything once she caught Cassandra\u2019s warning look.</p><p>\u201cTiffany Winters. We\u2019re discussing bringing her into the pack.\u201d</p><p>Everyone ignored Vera\u2019s scowl.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Maxwell usually handles the background checks. I think he\u2019s by the barbeque, why don\u2019t you ask him?\u201d said Samuel.</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d Alexis whined, \u201cwe want to know now, not next week. Can\u2019t you ask him? Or see if Gabriel will okay us issuing a contract? We don\u2019t want to miss out on this one.\u201d</p><p>His dark brown eyes rolled heavenward, muttering something unheard. She reached up to adjust the lapel of her husband\u2019s Dolce &amp; Gabbana jacket, frowning at a crease in the otherwise sleek lines. He waved her off before inclining his head in deference to Cassandra at her pointed look.</p><p>\u201cAll right, ladies, I\u2019ll check with Gabriel. Give me a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a peach!\u201d Heather favored him with a brilliant smile that he was quick to return. Alexis turned that formidable frown on her, but it was blithely ignored. Cassandra\u2019s attention sharply turned on Vera when she hissed something unpleasant under her breath and shoved her chair back, stalking into the house.</p><p>\u201cTrouble brewing,\u201d Alexis murmured. Heather and Cassandra said nothing, their eyes briefly glittering with a touch of luminescence as they locked on Vera\u2019s retreating form.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re up to.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany, who was laughing softly at something one of Todd\u2019s companions said, quieted and turned to face Vera. Brows arched on high and painted mouth puckered in a moue of surprise, she batted her lashes and pressed a hand to her chest. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re up to,\u201d Vera repeated, her teeth showing in a shark-like grin, \u201cand don\u2019t play the innocent. It\u2019s so tacky.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany stared at Vera, her cheeks flushing. Todd and his friends\u2014as well as a few of the other guests nearby who had \u201coverheard\u201d the conversation\u2014were staring at Vera as though she\u2019d grown another head. With a hasty \u201cexcuse us,\u201d Tiffany gestured sharply for Vera to follow her as she spun away from the group, seeking privacy. Speculative, disapproving whispers trailed in their wake, growing louder as they left the room.</p><p>Before long they found privacy in the form of a study, bookshelves lining one wall and a set of oxblood chairs placed around a low table and desk. It was all Tiffany could do to keep from slamming the door behind them once Vera marched in, right on her heels.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d Tiffany snapped, eyes flashing as she gestured back the way they had come. \u201cI was in the middle of a very important business deal! Couldn\u2019t you have waited until I closed him before interrupting to bitch at me?\u201d</p><p>It was Vera\u2019s turn to flush, though she wasn\u2019t dissuaded. With difficulty, she drew in a few calming breaths, settling her nerves so her eyes wouldn\u2019t glow with her increasing anger.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she enunciated carefully around growing fangs, \u201cdon\u2019t belong here. You\u2019re not part of this community, and I can smell the trouble following you. You should go back to wherever you came from and leave us alone.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany sniffed indignantly. \u201cVera, I don\u2019t know where you got these crazy notions about me, but I\u2019m not here to cause trouble for anyone. All you\u2019re accomplishing right now is embarrassing yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what the others say. You\u2019re up to something. I\u2019m going to find out what.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany met her gaze, her jaw set and fists clenching at her sides. Her nostrils flared as she tilted her head up, causing her carefully maintained coiffure to shift, blond strands slithering over her shoulders and hissing softly against the silken fabric. Her voice took on the same whispery tones\u2014soft, dangerous, and deadly.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to watch yourself, Vera. Dig too deep and you won\u2019t like what you find.\u201d</p> <p>Vera watched her go, the door clicking quietly shut behind her as the sound of her Prada heels clacking against the marble floors faded into the hum of the party.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Money is your servant\u2014do not let it be your master.</p><p>\u2014An American Proverb</p><p>The women were not surprised to see Tiffany paused on the threshold of the patio, searching the fire pits and tables for her friends. The people outside turned to watch as she passed, their eyes flashing brilliant hues of green or gold as her scent\u2014heavy with the reek of agitation even through the cloud of citronella\u2014caught their interest. Once they noted where she was headed, many returned to their conversations or to picking at the hors d\u2019oeuvres, but several continued to watch her with veiled interest as she paused behind the seat Vera had earlier vacated.</p> <p>\u201cLadies. Sorry I took so long to join you.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s tone was light, but her white-knuckled grip on the back of the latticework iron chair bespoke her irritation. Heather, who had been nervously nibbling her bottom lip, leaned forward and put her hand lightly on Tiffany\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Vera didn\u2019t find you, did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d she replied, her smile cold and humorless, \u201cbut don\u2019t worry. We came to an understanding of sorts.\u201d</p><p>The others were clearly interested in hearing about it, but too polite to push\u2014beyond more than overly curious, questioning expressions\u2014and Tiffany was not budging in her silence on the topic. After a wordless conversation composed of nothing but significant looks, raised brows, and slight twitches of lips shared between Cassandra and Tiffany, they came to an understanding.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t ask. You won\u2019t like the answer.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Come on, you know you want to tell us what happened.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s none of your damned business.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know she\u2019ll give us the details when you\u2019re not around anyway. You might as well tell us your side of it now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s my story to tell or not. Don\u2019t push me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you sure? It might not be wise to keep so much to yourself. \u2019</p><p>\u2018Drop it.\u2019</p><p>Eventually, Cassandra broke eye contact, feigning a sudden and intense interest in her drink. Gradually, Tiffany\u2019s grip on the back of the chair loosened, and she gestured at the partygoers mingling and chatting nearby.</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of people here I don\u2019t recognize. Heather, I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d be a love and introduce me, would you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course she will,\u201d Cassandra said. \u201cWe\u2019ll all join you. There are a few people I\u2019d like for you to meet, too.\u201d</p><p>Heather shot a helpless look at Cassandra, and then pushed her chair back with a harsh scrape over the patterned brick. Alexis smirked, but didn\u2019t utter a word, setting her drink aside so she could smooth out her skirt and brush her hair back over her shoulder.</p><p>Cassandra hooked her arm through Tiffany\u2019s and paraded her through the gathered throngs in the gardens and around the fire pits as if she were a show pony. She breezed through introductions, highlighting a few interesting tidbits and assets\u2014both of Tiffany and of the people she was meeting\u2014before pushing her along to the next group. Once she was introduced to a few of the young men Cassandra called \u201cterminally single,\u201d Tiffany\u2019s mood lightened considerably, as she batted her lashes and flashed dazzling smiles at the more attractive of the bunch.</p><p>Several of them returned her obvious interest in kind with heated looks and a choice turn of phrase, but she expertly maneuvered through their flirtations without insulting or abandoning her hosts.</p><p>\u201cI do believe Travis has taken a shine to you,\u201d Alexis remarked as they paused in their rounds for drinks and to nibble a few hors d\u2019oeuvres. \u201cHe\u2019s still watching us. Look.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany giggled, a cute, girlish sound that drew more curious eyes their way. \u201cOh stop. I was just playing with the boy. He\u2019s too young for me, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo harm in having a bit of fun with him, though,\u201d Heather said.</p><p>Cassandra chuckled at the exchange before popping a slice of strawberry in her mouth, and then urging the girls to continue their rounds.</p><p>They gradually worked their way deeper into the garden toward those who were clearly more familiar with the house and each other, and were more interested in talking business than showing themselves off as the people inside were doing. There were not many women this far from the lights and tiki torches, and much of the talk was hushed, muted by distance or burbling fountains. Some\u2014but not all\u2014were older, and all of them radiated strength and vitality that was lacking in those who stayed closer to the house. Cassandra made the effort to introduce Tiffany to each person, and her introductions became more formal and elaborate.</p><p>Lastly, they joined Cassandra\u2019s husband, Gabriel, who was speaking to Alexis\u2019s husband and a trio of older gentlemen. Cassandra drew Tiffany in front of her, settling her hands familiarly on the girl\u2019s shoulders, earning speculative looks from the men.</p><p>\u201cDarling, this is Tiffany Winters, that charming woman I\u2019ve been telling you so much about. Tiffany, this is my husband, Gabriel Sachs. I\u2019ve been meaning to introduce you two all night.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel cut a fine figure in his fitted slacks and a button-down shirt that put the tailors of Savile Row to shame. He had the tanned skin and sun-bleached hair of a man who spent a great deal of his time outdoors, and proved that he wasn\u2019t afraid of hard work by his rough, calloused hand, which closed gently around Tiffany\u2019s. He inclined his head, gaze sliding to Cassandra before returning to the new girl.</p><p>\u201cA pleasure, Tiffany. I\u2019ve heard so much about you.\u201d He smiled as her cheeks colored in a blush, and extended his hand to each of his companions, introducing them in turn. \u201cMight I introduce Arthur Norris, Basil Thornwood, Phillip Edgington, and Dr. Greene?\u201d</p><p>A quick round of welcoming words, handshakes, and head nods set Tiffany at ease. More so when one of them asked who her husband was, noting the ring she had not yet removed. It was enough to make her laugh, holding her hand up so the gem could catch the light.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let this fool you. I\u2019m only wearing it as a reminder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what a woman as lovely as you is doing here alone. If only I were a few years younger, so I could catch your eye as those young bucks by the house do,\u201d lamented Phillip, a silver-haired gentleman. He caught and held her upraised hand so that he could bow over it, his thumb lightly stroking her knuckles. Tiffany demurely lowered her eyes, while the other ladies were busy rolling theirs. \u201cDo feel free to call on me, charming thing that you are. I\u2019d delight in your company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, Phillip. I\u2019ll be sure to look you up.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel cleared his throat. \u201cRight, then. Well, we do need to get back to business here... .\u201d</p><p>Cassandra\u2019s eyes narrowed, but she nodded, and the other girls followed her lead as she backed away. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk more later.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t answer, his gaze locked on Tiffany as he spoke in low tones to his companions.</p><p>Heather and Alexis were quite pleased, speaking with carefully reined enthusiasm. Cassandra was silent, brooding, and Tiffany gave no hint as to her feelings about her introductions beyond a sly curve to her lips.</p><p>\u201cWell, this has been rather enlightening,\u201d Tiffany said.</p><p>\u201cI hope the whirlwind introductions didn\u2019t leave you dizzy,\u201d said a man waiting in the shadows of a nearby cherry tree. His teeth gleamed, a slash of pearl in the dark as he smiled, before he stepped forward to offer his arm to Tiffany. He inclined his head to the other girls, who were unamused by his theatrics. \u201cI beg your pardon, ladies. I hope you don\u2019t mind if I steal Tiffany away for myself for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, Travis,\u201d drawled Heather. \u201cI\u2019m sure you two will have fun.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany feigned a blush and smiled up at Travis, taking his offered arm. Cassandra shook her head and the three werewives drifted off as Travis led Tiffany back toward the house.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to end well,\u201d Alexis mused.</p><p>\u201cFor who? Him or her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d Alexis said, gesturing for the girls to walk with her toward the woods at the edge of the property instead of back toward the mansion. \u201cI foresee her eating him alive and spitting him out. He\u2019ll moan to the other males about what a frigid bitch she is. Then, in a few days, she\u2019ll seduce another one of them and start the cycle over again.\u201d</p><p>Heather nearly choked on the drink she was sipping, a touch of laughter in her whispered words. \u201cKeep it down, someone will overhear. What makes you say that? You barely know her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019ve known enough like her to see the signs. She\u2019ll keep working her way up the social ladder until someone takes her in hand.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra frowned. \u201cIf that\u2019s really the case, we need to contract her\u2014and do it before she pushes one of the boys too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel didn\u2019t seem very interested. He might not let us do it,\u201d Heather said.</p> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll talk to him about it after he gets home. I need to clear my head so I can think. You ladies want to go for a run?\u201d</p><p>Heather glanced back toward the house, frowning. \u201cI\u2019d like to, but I\u2019m Tiffany\u2019s ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll make it home fine, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Alexis said. Heather gave her a scathing, offended look before collapsing into giggles as Alexis added a leer and suggestive waggle of her brows to go with it. \u201cCome on. The party is winding down anyway. Let\u2019s go have some fun.\u201d</p><p>Together the ladies drifted into the woods, pausing only to remove their shoes. Once they had their heels in hand, they did not stop until they reached a small clearing far from the lights and prying eyes at the party. Alexis cursed when her silk skirt caught on a thorn and tore, yanking the delicate material free so hard that she widened the rip. Heather smothered a laugh, while Cassandra busied herself with removing her blouse.</p><p>\u201cThere goes fifteen hundred dollars.\u201d Alexis sighed, tugging the offending material off and hanging it on a low-hanging branch.</p> <p>Vera silently drifted out of the shadows, her eyes aglow and her feet bare, Jimmy Choos dangling from one hand. She took in the scene, the curl in her lip lessening when she noted Tiffany\u2019s absence.</p><p>\u201cI take it Gabriel said no?\u201d</p><p>Heather, busy removing her own clothing, huffed impatiently. \u201cDarling, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so dead set against her. Even if you\u2019re suspicious of her, it wouldn\u2019t kill you to be polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rich. I don\u2019t have to be nice.\u201d</p><p>Heather frowned at her. \u201cIt certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt for you to try once in a while. Besides, Gabriel hasn\u2019t given his answer yet. Cassie will convince him tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a little lip action, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Alexis muttered. Cassandra shot her a glare that she pretended she hadn\u2019t seen. \u201cGive the man some deep throat and he\u2019s yours.\u201d</p> <p>Heather and Vera broke out in laughter while Cassandra swiped nails arched into talons at Alexis, who danced out of the way just in time. Grinning, she shimmied out of her skirt and top a safe distance away as Cassandra growled and huffed, tugging off her own clothes and folding them into a neat pile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you for that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot to catch me first!\u201d</p><p>Alexis laughingly dashed off into the dark, her body changing as she ran. Her skin grew darker in tone, limbs stretching, bones and tendons cracking as the shift brought out her inner beast. Without losing a single stride, she was soon running on four legs rather than two, the gray-coated timber wolf racing deep into the forest.</p><p>Vera, who had already shed her clothing and jewelry in preparation for a shift, set the bundle of her belongings aside and joined her. Her coat as a wolf was as dark as her deep auburn hair, a rusty reddish brown that easily blended with the forest. Cassandra raced to catch up, ghosting between the trees as a pale gray shadow, seen only briefly as she flashed through patches of moonlight that filtered through the canopy of foliage. Heather was the last to shift, a mousy brown color, smaller than the others, but much faster. She soon caught up, and they were away, a silent pack running together and enjoying the freedom of the night.</p><p>Tiffany stepped out from between the trees, tucking a video camera back into her purse before she toed the clothing the girls had left behind.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>I don\u2019t need a man in my life.</p> <p>\u2014Enya</p><p>Afew days after the party, the ladies made plans to meet again. Cassandra had been attempting to corner Gabriel long enough to speak to him about Tiffany, but he was too tied up in both his company and his pack\u2019s business to discuss it. She\u2019d put off getting together as long as she could; Tiffany had started questioning Heather about whether she\u2019d upset Cassandra.</p><p>As they didn\u2019t want to have her snatched up by another pack or to take the lack of time spent together as a slight, Cassandra was bound and determined to make this their last social call before she put a contract in front of Tiffany.</p><p>By way of apology, Cassandra had offered to pick up the tab for dinner at a new restaurant that had just opened a few blocks from Times Square, some fanciful place with a theme of diamonds and crystals. It was all the rage, garnering rave reviews in the local papers and an excellent ZAGAT rating. Anybody who was anybody had been spotted there. It was, rather inevitably, called Star Dust.</p><p>Tiffany had gladly accepted, and the women met outside the restaurant, decked out in shining Gucci as only it had the requisite number of rhinestones to match their need to outshine the restaurant\u2019s d\u00e9cor.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you all again,\u201d Tiffany said. She smiled at Alexis and Cassandra when they joined her at the fringes of the line waiting to get in. Her expression quickly turned neutral when she saw Vera bringing up the rear, trailing a few yards behind the others.</p><p>\u201cYou, too! I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s taken me so long to get away. My husband has been an absolute beast these past few days, and I simply haven\u2019t had the time.\u201d</p><p>Heather, Vera, and Alexis nearly choked on their laughter at Cassandra\u2019s statement, though they quickly got it under control. Tiffany smiled, shaking her head. \u201cMen can be such a pain, I know.\u201d</p><p>Alexis, curious, broke in. \u201cSpeaking of which, how did things go with Travis?\u201d</p><p>Heather and Cassandra both shot her a warning look, while Tiffany simply shrugged. \u201cNot as well as I had hoped it would. Let\u2019s discuss it over drinks, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Cassandra took the lead, the other girls falling into step behind her as they headed to the front of the line. Security took one look at the designer clothes, the painted faces, the svelte bodies, and the killer heels, and let them pass without hesitation, drawing aside the white velvet rope to allow them inside.</p><p>There was not a single voice of complaint from the people waiting in line, as not a one would dare\u2014until they were out of earshot, that is.</p><p>Once he spotted her, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 came around his lacquered white podium to extend a welcoming hand to Cassandra, beaming. Like much of the furniture, his tuxedo was white, his tie, cuff links, and pocket kerchief of a fine silver material. Columns of white and silver marble flanked the doors. Crystal vases filled with crystal flowers sat on low silver tables, and the white couches for waiting guests were full. Against the alabaster white walls, it was much like stepping into an icy cavern, too perfect, too austere, to be welcoming.</p><p>They fit right in.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle, lovely to see you again. Your table is ready. Right this way.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the restaurant was done in similar style. The music drifting from hidden speakers was soft, melodic, with chimes resonating with the crystal and silver statues that gleamed and glittered from recessed alcoves around the room. The raised ceiling was painted such a deep, dark blue that the tiny lights set into it made it feel as though one were outdoors, staring up at a velvet night sky filled with stars. Even the hum of conversation was muted, giving the place an intimate feel, as though one were lost in the icy tundra of the frozen north.</p><p>Once they were seated, Tiffany lounged back, examining the menu. \u201cWell, this all looks very good. What do you recommend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should try the grilled salmon salad with orange-basil vinaigrette. I hear salmon is good if you need to lose weight.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany lowered her menu to give Vera a flat stare, clearly not amused at the insinuation. Vera gave nothing back, her expression bland and innocent. Heather, exasperated, gestured at the menu.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you like. Everything I\u2019ve had here is excellent. Try their house drink, though, the Starlight is amazing.\u201d</p><p>Some of the tension at the table eased, and before long the waiter came and went with their order. Tiffany surprised them all by offering to cover the drinks, looking very deliberately at Vera when she said it. No one argued, and everyone was fairly quiet until the waiter returned with their cocktails. Once they had their drinks in hand, everyone relaxed a bit more. Tiffany exclaimed over the sweet liquor, thanking Heather for the recommendation before sighing dramatically and pressing a hand to her brow.</p><p>\u201cI need some help.\u201d</p><p>Alexis frowned, glancing at Cassandra. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Travis,\u201d Tiffany said, cradling her drink as she leaned forward. \u201cCan one of you please get him to stop calling me? I swear, that man hasn\u2019t given me a moment of peace since the party.\u201d</p><p>The other women shared confused and mildly alarmed looks, and Heather sputtered something unintelligible before Cassandra held up her hand for silence. \u201cWhat happened at the party? I thought you two were getting along so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I. Until he started telling me how much I reminded him of his sister.\u201d</p><p>The other girls couldn\u2019t help it. They all cracked up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d gasped Alexis, carefully wiping tears of laughter from under her eyes so as not to smudge her mascara, \u201coh, that\u2019s terrible! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>Heather, once she got her sniggering under control, put a sympathetic hand on Tiffany\u2019s arm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart, we\u2019ll find you someone better. There are plenty of men in the pa\u2014from the party who are single. There\u2019s Damon or Michael or, oh, I\u2019ll bet you\u2019d get along great with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, darling, she probably doesn\u2019t remember the names of half the men she was introduced to at the party,\u201d Alexis said with saccharine sweetness, the underlying warning completely going over Heather\u2019s head as she pouted at being interrupted. Tiffany didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure I\u2019m interested anymore,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Vera smirked. \u201cHow terrible for you. No one to take care of you ... All alone in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to take care of me. I do just fine on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that now. I wonder why you tried so hard to pretend not to be interested at the party? Phillip and Travis certainly didn\u2019t seem to mind your attention\u2014and no matter what you say, I\u2019ll bet the entire time you were thinking about what you could get out of it.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s jaw clenched and spots of color rose high on her cheekbones. Vera idly traced her index finger through the condensation on her glass before pushing it away and rising.</p> <p>Alexis and Heather gave Vera exasperated looks. Cassandra ignored Vera as she walked toward the ladies\u2019 room, hips swaying.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind her,\u201d Cassandra said. \u201cShe\u2019s just PMSing because she isn\u2019t the center of attention.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany pouted after Vera\u2019s retreating form, though her icy blue eyes gleamed with calculation under the mask of hurt. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind so much if I knew why she took such a dislike to me. Does she think I\u2019m competition? I thought she was married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVera\u2019s always had a thing for Travis,\u201d Alexis mused, stirring her drink as she leaned back in her chair and gave one of the waiters watching her from across the room an excellent view of her crossed legs as she adjusted her skirt just so. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s peeved that he\u2019s given up on her and taken an interest in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it isn\u2019t that. She\u2019s had a problem with her from the start. I think she\u2019s pissed because you\u2019re single and successful enough to live in our neighborhood without the benefit of a man to pay your way,\u201d Heather declared.</p><p>The others regarded Heather with new respect for her astute observation.</p> <p>\u201cBut,\u201d she added, ruining the moment, \u201cwe still need to set you up with someone nice. I\u2019ll bet you an experienced man like Phillip would last longer than the playboys like Travis, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany nearly spewed her drink, covering her mouth with one hand while the other reached for a napkin to blot her lips. Cassandra and Alexis were too busy giggling over the thought to be of any help, all of them gasping and laughing. Talk turned to simpler, less dangerous topics\u2014what was coming up on tomorrow\u2019s daytime soaps, the scandalously awful shoes one of the women wore to the party, and whether they should go shopping or barhopping after they ate. Even Vera was civil when she returned, keeping most of her snarky comments limited to her observations about the fashion faux pas several of Alexis\u2019s guests made at the party.</p><p>Cassandra came very close to pulling the contract out of her purse to slide across the table to put in Tiffany\u2019s hands. All that stopped her were Vera or Tiffany\u2019s occasional comments that cut through the air of camaraderie. Just when things would settle down, one of them would slip, and they would bristle at each other until Heather or Alexis changed the subject.</p><p>Finally, exasperated, Cassandra turned to Tiffany and bluntly invited her on a coffee date\u2014alone\u2014the next day so they could have a private chat.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Tiffany said, looking uncertainly between Heather and Cassandra, \u201cwe were going to go to one of those Botox parties tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll reschedule,\u201d Heather said quickly upon catching Cassandra\u2019s look.</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh, all right, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Cassandra said, a sly smile curving her lips.</p> <p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.</p><p>\u2014Abraham H. Maslow</p><p>Four timber wolves raced through the shadows of a New Jersey forest, hunting under a gibbous moon. Save for the occasional chirp of insects or hoot of an owl, all was quiet, the denizens of the forest knowing better than to explore with predators such as these on the prowl.</p><p>Until Alexis scrabbled over a large rock and snagged a claw, breaking it.</p><p>The others came to a halt as she tumbled to a stop in a snarling bundle of teeth and bristling fur. Cassandra padded over to investigate, sniffing as Alexis held out the offending paw, whimpering. After giving the wound a lick, Cassandra turned back in the direction of her home, where they had started their run. Vera and Heather both whined at having their playtime cut short, but after an authoritative bark from Cassandra, quieted and followed without further complaint.</p><p>Vera and Heather still frolicked on the way back, chasing after the occasional mouse or other small creature stirred up by their passing. Cassandra stayed beside Alexis, ignoring her plaintive whines and exaggerated limp.</p><p>They emerged from the shadows of the birch and evergreens bordering Cassandra\u2019s property, lying down on the smooth carpet of grass that led right up to the woods. Sleek fur rippled and twitched, and the grinding and popping of bones and sinews rearranging rang out as the four wolves began their change back to human.</p><p>Vera groaned as the last joint snapped back into place, watching with a critical eye as her claws receded. \u201cDamn. I\u2019m going to have to get these done again.\u201d</p><p>Alexis\u2019s fur ruffled as she gave Vera an irritated curl of her lip before completing her change. The other ladies didn\u2019t answer; they were too busy with their own shifts from wolf to human to respond. Heather chuffed, blowing like a bellows as she collapsed on her side, having run harder than the others.</p><p>The thick fur slowly withdrew into Alexis\u2019s skin, talons and paws gradually lengthening and softening into human hands again. She quickly lifted her arm, squinting in the moonlight as she examined her nails.</p><p>\u201cUgh, my whole nail cracked. Gross! I guess we were all due for a mani-pedi, anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can go after Cassie meets with Tiffany.\u201d</p><p>Heather rubbed her jaw, popping it and speaking around fangs that had not quite finished reforming into flat human teeth. \u201cAre you going to give her the contract this time? I saw it sticking out of your purse at the restaurant earlier.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra rolled her ankles to get the joints to set properly, ignoring Vera\u2019s scowl. \u201cYes. I wanted to give it to her then, but it didn\u2019t seem like the right time. I thought it might be better if I spoke to her one-on-one instead of having the whole group there to pressure her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake, Cassandra,\u201d Vera said. \u201cShe isn\u2019t pack material. I don\u2019t know why none of you are listening to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t listening because there\u2019s no basis for your concern! You keep saying she\u2019s a threat, but you won\u2019t talk to her yourself and don\u2019t back up what you\u2019re saying with anything that proves she has any intention of hurting us,\u201d Heather snapped.</p><p>Taken aback, Vera stared for a moment, mouth agape. She first looked to Alexis, then Cassandra for help or sympathy, and found none. Both were shaking their head at her, agreeing with Heather.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Vera said, settling back in the grass and steepling her fingers, \u201cI\u2019m still looking for something that proves what I already know to be the case. I told you all that I know I\u2019ve seen her somewhere before. I think she has a connection to the hunters in New York. It\u2019s not easy digging up information on them, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think so, though? She said she was interested in meeting a werewolf, not killing one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen her somewhere before. Maybe on the news, or somewhere on the Internet. Not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s her?\u201d</p><p>Taking offense at the tone of the question, Vera bristled, glaring at Cassandra. \u201cAlmost positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost positive is not sure,\u201d Cassandra said, rising and sauntering to the lounge chairs where they had laid out their clothing. She shrugged on her shirt, not bothering to button it up. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume anything when it comes to the welfare of the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that should go both ways! We don\u2019t know for sure that she\u2019s not a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we do know she has an interest in werewolves, and that our pack will grow stagnant and gradually disappear if we don\u2019t add new members to it. We can\u2019t afford to let someone interested slip through our fingers. I will ask her what her intentions are, and offer the contract. If she wants to use it against us, then I promise you I will kill her myself.\u201d</p><p>Vera subsided, mostly satisfied. Heather, now in jeans and a light T-shirt, shifted her weight and wouldn\u2019t meet Cassandra\u2019s eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you going to turn her right away if she signs the papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Cassandra said, folding her skirt over her arm and walking toward the house, not looking back. \u201cIt depends on what Gabriel has to say about it.\u201d</p><p>Alexis gasped. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t asked him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. He hasn\u2019t been home.\u201d</p><p>The other ladies shared knowing looks, but didn\u2019t say a word, following silently in Cassandra\u2019s wake.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t bother to look up from his desk when Cassandra appeared in the doorway of his study.</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I really need to talk to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive me about an hour. I need to finish reading this brief,\u201d Gabriel said, not looking up from the papers spread over his desk. It was the first time he\u2019d been home before eleven in two weeks.</p><p>Cassandra leaned on the door frame, toying with the diamond pendant on her necklace as she considered him. He\u2019d barely noticed her short satin robe, the one he\u2019d taken such delight in rubbing himself against less than a month before. Gabriel hadn\u2019t joined her for dinner before her run, hadn\u2019t answered her text messages or e-mails, and had been too exhausted for the last several nights to talk to her about anything beyond kissing her good night\u2014if she was still awake when he got home\u2014before he crawled into bed. She hadn\u2019t asked what was on his plate, but she had gleaned from a few conversations overheard that it involved the welfare of the entire pack.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t her, she was sure. Judging by the dark circles under his eyes, she was quite certain it really was work that kept him from home and from showing any interest in sex. Aside from that, if he\u2019d been cheating, she would have smelled the scent of another bitch on him\u2014so that wasn\u2019t it. He really was working himself to the bone.</p><p>This called for desperate measures.</p><p>She slunk forward, putting a roll into her hips, catching his eye. He looked up, twitching a jet brow, one hand racing through dark hair starting to show the first hints of silver at the temples. Cassandra moved behind him, rubbing at the thick knots of tension in his shoulders. He gradually relaxed into her hands, eyes closing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re working too hard. Come to bed.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed, arching his back so she could reach his shoulder blades. \u201cI can\u2019t, love. This needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll still be here in the morning.\u201d Cassandra leaned over to whisper in his ear, nipping his earlobe as one hand slid down his chest to the hard bulge in his pants. \u201cLet me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, arching up against her questing hand. It didn\u2019t take long before she\u2019d drawn down his zipper and slid aside his silk boxers, freeing him from his pants. Deft fingers worked his arousal with practiced swiftness.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t object, his fingers digging into the armrests of his chair until the leather creaked under his hands, watching as if mesmerized by the way she squeezed and stroked him, the way he grew and pulsed under her touch.</p><p>His breath hitched in his throat as she bit his ear again, tilting his head to the side to give her access to his throat. A very trusting move on his part. Trailing her lips over the stubble on his cheek, Cassandra whispered again, her voice low and throaty.</p><p>\u201cI need something from you.\u201d</p><p>In a blur, she was suddenly on her back on his desk, Gabriel pressed between her dangling legs. Papers scattered, flying everywhere before drifting to the floor. His eyes, usually a soft brown, now burned with a harsh amber light as he bent over her, hands exploring the smooth satin of her robe before tearing it open. Cassandra returned his growls in kind, wrapping her legs around his waist to yank him forward, nails raking down his back.</p><p>\u201cI need\u2014\u201d She gasped as he bit her, nails convulsing against his back.</p> <p>\u201cI know what you need,\u201d he rumbled, rough hands sliding lower on her body. Her hips moved to meet his exploring fingers, even as she made a guttural sound of denial.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted, grasping and pulling at his hair until he paused, looking at her. \u201cSomething else.\u201d</p><p>He slumped, then rose just enough to meet her own burning, glowing eyes. It took a few breaths for him to calm enough to answer. He had to speak carefully, enunciating each word carefully around the mouthful of fangs he\u2019d sprouted.</p><p>\u201cAnything. You know I\u2019ll always give you whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra smiled, bared teeth behind those painted lips grown into dagger points much like his own.</p><p>\u201cI want Tiffany Winters. I want her in the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>And for the rest of the night, neither of them had a chance to fit in another word.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.</p><p>\u2014Ralph Waldo Emerson</p><p>The next day, Cassandra settled in a seat on the patio outside of one of the quieter Starbucks in the neighborhood, cradling an iced latte. Tiffany looked up from her cell phone, setting it aside with a smile as she eased back into the wrought-iron chair. Aside from the occasional patron moving in and out of the coffeehouse, they were alone.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to talk to me?\u201d</p><p>Cassandra crossed her legs, leaning back in her chair while one finger toyed with the condensation on her latte. She stared directly into Tiffany\u2019s eyes, taking her measure before speaking in carefully noncommittal tones.</p><p>\u201cHeather told me that you had an interest in werewolves. Meeting them, in fact. What if I told you that I could help you with that?\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s gaze searched Cassandra\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019d say I was skeptically hopeful. Ever since the Moonwalker pack showed themselves, I\u2019ve wanted to meet one. Except for Rohrik Donovan and the rest of the Moonwalkers, they don\u2019t exactly advertise their whereabouts, and he doesn\u2019t meet with people just to satisfy their curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I suppose he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will?\u201d</p><p>Cassandra paused, latte halfway to her mouth. \u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I knew before I moved here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Vera right, then? Are you here to cause us trouble?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Tiffany held out a hand, imploring Cassandra to stay seated. Though a touch of yellow had crept into her irises, Cassandra stilled, her mouth pressed into a thin line of displeasure.</p><p>\u201cVera may have made the connection between the New York branch of the White Hats and myself because I used to be married to one of them.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra swiftly rose with a harsh screech of iron over concrete, her nails forming into claws. Tiffany stayed in her seat, her hand reaching out imploringly. \u201cPlease, hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve heard enough,\u201d Cassandra replied tartly, reaching for her Herm\u00e8s purse.</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t.\u201d Tiffany insisted in such a sharp tone that Cassandra stilled, eyes narrowed to gleaming yellow slivers. Tiffany pressed on, unfazed. \u201cJust listen to me. I\u2019m not married to him anymore. When I first met Richard, I knew he was a hunter, but I didn\u2019t take part in that business. It took me a while to see what he was doing was wrong, and I divorced him with good reason. I thought maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014if I managed to meet one of you I could find some way to make up the damage I caused by standing by and supporting him for so long.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra regarded Tiffany for a long moment, taking shallow breaths through flared nostrils, more interested in her scent and the sound of her heartbeat than in her words or pleading looks. There was an understandable trace of fear under the vanilla and sandalwood musk of her Shalini perfume, but no discordant undertones of a lie.</p><p>Though Cassandra did not retract her claws, some of the beast withdrew from her eyes, and she slowly settled back into her seat. Tiffany\u2019s gaze still searched her face, fingers tight around her cup and breath held as she waited for a response. It took some time for it to come, but when it did, she couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cIf that is truly the case, then I am assuming you came here wanting to bolster our ranks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra stared at the girl until she shifted her weight and looked away, unnerved by those yellow eyes. \u201cWere you going to tell any of us this? Or were you just waiting for Heather or one of the men to present you with a contract?\u201d</p><p>Tiffany had the grace to blush, though she was quick to shake her head. \u201cNo, no, it wasn\u2019t like that. It never felt like the right time. Vera was so dead set against me that I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d ever have the chance. Of if any of you would listen to reason once I brought it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra regarded her for a moment longer in uncomfortable silence before coming to a decision. She reached into the purse on her arm, withdrawing neatly tri-folded documents and sliding them across the table. Tiffany\u2019s expression quickly shifted from apprehension to shocked delight as she unfolded the Notice of Mutual Consent to Human/Other Citizen Relationship and Contractual Binding Agreement.</p><p>\u201cIf this is really what you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it is!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014then fill the papers out and come to dinner tonight. My house. Dress to impress. I\u2019ll introduce you to some of the others, and when one of them is ready, they\u2019ll sign and file the rest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tiffany\u2019s face fell as she realized that meant that the papers weren\u2019t ready to be lodged in a court\u2014in effect, binding her for the rest of her life to one of the werewolves and giving them the right to feed on or make her one of them\u2014though she soon perked up at the invitation.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you, Cassie. I can\u2019t begin to tell you how happy this makes me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet,\u201d Cassandra drawled. \u201cYou still need to find a host who will take you. And I do expect you to behave yourself and not antagonize Vera anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo more than try. Those papers include the pack privilege clause. If you find a host who will have you\u2014and I assure you that it will not be easy with your past\u2014it will leave you open to attack from any member of our pack, not just whoever signs with you. I suggest you find a way to smooth things over with Vera.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany frowned, skimming over the documents. \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d Glancing up, she offered Cassandra a sunny smile, clearly quite pleased with this turn of events. \u201cThank you again. Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t regret this decision.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra said nothing in reply, turning and walking away.</p><p>Once Cassandra left, Tiffany took her time polishing off the rest of her coffee as she read through the contract, enjoying the time in the sun. Very little of it was different from the standard contracts often available at local courthouses. The pack privilege allowed any werewolf in the pack to hurt or even kill their applicant without legal repercussions; these days, the clause was standard language in contracts for dangerous supernatural creatures who lived in groups, such as vampires and werewolves.</p> <p>Tucking the papers under her arm, she rose, withdrawing her cell phone as she headed to her car. In moments, she\u2019d drafted a text message and sent it to Richard, then drove home.</p><p>It took some time to get ready. Some of the benefits of having spent time on the fringes, getting to know her husband\u2019s profession, were the access to his connections, the combined gathered intelligence on Others by the White Hats\u2014and the toys.</p><p>After a long, luxurious bath in scented oils, relaxing her muscles, she padded nude through her walk-in closet, choosing and then discarding a number of outfits. For the dinner, she needed to wear something both fashionable and functional; nothing so skintight as to reveal the weaponry concealed on her person. Searching blue eyes soon found the perfect outfit. She chose a Christian Dior dress with flared sleeves to make for an easy draw of her silver-coated daggers. It had a high enough slit on either side of the skirt to easily reach the guns strapped to her garters, and looked killer with a matching pair of Louboutin heels.</p><p>Her phone rang out the strains of Bach, announcing an incoming call from Richard. Again. And a third time.</p><p>She ignored the calls in favor of examining herself critically in a floor-length mirror.</p><p>The quick-draw bands at her wrists faded into the shadows of the sleeves of the black, silver, and gray fabric of the dress, but were still too conspicuous. With the addition of some thick Swarovski bracelets studded with diamonds and opals, a matching choker, and a touch of Chanel No. 5 at her wrists and throat, she felt ready to take on the entire pack.</p> <p>For the thrill of it, she twisted and hurled one of the daggers in one smooth motion, embedding it in the frame of the dresser across the room, just above where her cell phone still rang and rang. A smile curved her lips when she noted the blade had landed precisely on the knot of wood she\u2019d been aiming for.</p><p>With leisurely strides, she crossed the room, glancing down at the phone before working the dagger out of the wood. Tucking it back within its sheath, she then turned her phone off and slipped it in her purse, heading for the door.</p><p>As much as she hoped things would stay civil tonight, she would be prepared for anything.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>The first sign of a nervous breakdown is when you start thinking your work is terribly important.</p><p>\u2014Milo Bloom</p><p>Cassandra greeted Tiffany at the door, taking in her outfit in one quick, critical sweep. It dragged a reluctant smile out of her, for it met and exceeded every expectation for the impromptu dinner she\u2019d arranged.</p><p>Getting Gabriel to agree to stay home for the affair had not been terribly difficult. At his word, the remaining single males in the pack, to a one, had agreed to come. Many of them had arrived early in hopes of making a good impression, and were not disappointed by the entrance of the leggy, stunning blonde who put the shining crystals and modern art in Cassandra\u2019s smallest, most intimate dining room to shame.</p> <p>Tiffany sat near Gabriel and Cassandra at the head of the table, setting her purse at her side and placing the signed contract beside her plate. She accepted a glass of wine and the brief introductions of the few men she hadn\u2019t met at Alexis\u2019s party a few days before. Several of the more prominent members of the pack had come as well, including the other werewives and their spouses. Vera, thankfully, kept her comments to herself, though she was clearly displeased with this turn of events.</p><p>Though no one mentioned anything about the pack at first, after Cassandra\u2019s cook brought out the hors d\u2019oeuvres, guests complimented Cassandra on the fare and the talk took a more serious shift. Gabriel cleared his throat, getting the silent attention of his guests within moments.</p><p>\u201cThank you all for coming on such short notice,\u201d he said, giving Tiffany a nod. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard by now that we have a new applicant for membership in our pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, is that what this is all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Phillip. I\u2019ll thank you not to lick your chops like a big, bad wolf and scare our honored guest away.\u201d That garnered some laughter, as well as a wink and a grin in Tiffany\u2019s direction from Phillip. The laughter became more genuine at her blushes. \u201cAs most of you know, expanding our numbers has always been a priority. The Diamondfang pack has welcomed society\u2019s elite into our ranks for decades, long before humanity openly acknowledged the existence of the supernatural. Now, under the circumstances, I felt it best if we addressed some important aspects of her request as a group, rather than allow speculation and rumors to sully what should be a joyous occasion.</p><p>\u201cTiffany Winters has admitted to connections to a group of hunters\u2014the White Hats\u2014in New York.\u201d</p><p>The room exploded with dissent, exclamations of shock and outrage, several of the werewolves rising from their seats or even letting a touch of their inner beasts peek out of their eyes as they snarled their displeasure. Vera seemed especially incensed, her accusing tones laced with triumph as she rose from her seat and pointed at Tiffany, sneering as she shouted, \u201cI knew it! I told you she was trouble!\u201d</p><p>Tiffany scowled, but said nothing, clutching her hands tightly together in her lap. She wouldn\u2019t meet the eyes of any of the wolves, knowing better than to give their aggression ammunition by giving them challenging looks.</p><p>Gabriel watched for a few moments, eyes narrowed. Shortly, his calm, collected, and deadly quiet voice cut through the din.</p><p>\u201cSit down. All of you.\u201d</p><p>None dared disobey the alpha, though many of those who weren\u2019t glaring at Tiffany were giving him sidelong looks.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said, once the low rumble of opposition subsided to quieter levels, \u201cshe has informed us that she was connected to one by marriage, but no longer. She is not part of that world anymore, and wishes to make amends for her participation in their activities by bolstering our ranks. It is not an unreasonable request\u2014and she could be a valuable addition to this pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Vera sneered, \u201cand I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still willing to take her in, knowing what she is.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gave Vera a flat look. She soon quieted and turned her eyes down. Phillip, who had remained silent during the uproar, cleared his throat and spoke up after receiving a nod of acknowledgment from his pack leader.</p><p>\u201cIt takes an extraordinary person to admit when they are in the wrong. More so for someone to take so little prompting to wish to be a part of our pack. Ms. Winters, I will sign the contract, if you will accept me as your host.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany gasped, her hand flying to her mouth as happy tears sprung to her eyes. Though some of the Weres maintained their dubious expressions, most showed grudging approval; a handful even clapped to show their support. Before she could answer, Vera snarled, slamming her hand on the table hard enough for the silverware to rattle.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you people are falling for her story! Have any of you checked her background to ensure she\u2019s who she says she is? That she\u2019s really divorced? That she didn\u2019t come here armed to kill us all?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel growled, a deep, harsh sound that rolled through the room like thunder. Much to the other diners\u2019 surprise, it was Tiffany\u2019s voice that lashed out rather than their pack leader\u2019s. She rose to her full height to point an accusatory finger at Vera.</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to be saying any of those things about me. You haven\u2019t gotten to know me or given me any chance to prove myself to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to prove. You\u2019re connected to hunters, and that makes you a menace to every one of us!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt anybody, you crazy bitch!

Who do you think you\u2019re fooling?\u201d Vera snarled, her eyes glowing, ignoring the horrified looks of the other guests and the tugging on her arm by her husband in an effort to get her to settle down. \u201cIf Phillip signs that contract, I will hunt you down and kill you myself.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s glare turned icy, reaching for a wineglass so she could fling the contents at her. Vera\u2019s face and white Burberry top was splashed with the bloodred 2006 Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild Pauillac.</p> <p>Save for Vera\u2019s breaths, hissed through her teeth, dead silence reigned.</p><p>With careful, measured motions, the werewife rose from her seat, towering in her Proenza heels. No one, not even Gabriel, was ready to interfere.</p><p>Slowly, deliberately, Vera picked up a plate of crackers and Almas caviar (which, fortunately for Gabriel, was the cheaper, darker variety) and hurled it across the table at Tiffany. She ducked out of the way just in time for Damon, who was coming to her side in defense, to be beaned with it instead.</p><p>Howling a challenge, Vera vaulted onto and then across the table in one smooth motion, evading her husband\u2019s grasping hands as he shouted at her to calm down. Tiffany shoved herself backward, knocking her chair over and sprawling as she tripped on her long skirt. Most of the other wolves quickly backed out of the way. Fur sprouted on Vera\u2019s hands and arms, her face elongating as she dived off the table to where Tiffany now cowered on the floor.</p><p>She never landed. In one smooth movement, Cassandra rose from her chair and grabbed Vera by the throat, using the partially turned werewolf\u2019s own momentum to swing and hurl her across the room. Vera slammed into the opposite wall, leaving a huge dent and sending artwork and mirrors crashing to the floor. She slumped to the ground, dazed and unmoving.</p> <p>Tiffany was quick to tuck her silver dagger back in its sheath, praying none of the werewolves had noticed the weapon before it was hidden under her jewelry and sleeve again.</p><p>Gabriel and Cassandra both hurried to check on her and offer their apologies for Vera\u2019s behavior, but many of the other werewolves were still too shocked and appalled by this turn of events to do more than offer incredulous stares from their seats. Tiffany waved off the offers to help her up\u2014not wanting them to accidentally spring the mechanism that would flick the daggers out of their sheaths\u2014and rose rather ungracefully to her feet.</p><p>No one said a thing as she strode over to her fallen chair to pick up her purse\u2014now spattered with caviar and crumbled bits of cracker\u2014and stalked out, not looking back.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was uncalled for.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany didn\u2019t say anything as Heather fell into step beside her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave. We can send Vera home.\u201d</p> <p>Tiffany still said nothing, but her lips thinned as she hurried her pace and adjusted her purse strap, heels clacking on the drive as she sought her car.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re angry,\u201d Heather said with a sigh, matching her stride, \u201cbut Phillip was really impressed back there. He\u2019s asking where the contract is so he can sign it right now.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany came to an abrupt halt, smudging her mascara as she wiped away angry tears. \u201cDon\u2019t bother, Heather. Clearly I\u2019m not welcome here. Vera has been an utter prat ever since I came to town, and now that she knows about my past, she\u2019s never going to believe that I didn\u2019t come here with bad intentions.\u201d</p><p>Heather didn\u2019t respond, biting her lower lip. Tiffany took a few deep breaths before continuing in a calmer tone.</p><p>\u201cI should have known it wouldn\u2019t work out. This was all too good to be true. Maybe I\u2019ll just go back to Johannesburg. Be closer to my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d Heather exclaimed. \u201cYou just got here! Don\u2019t go yet. Come on, Phillip really wants you to stay, and so does Gabriel and Cassandra. And me! We can work something out. Vera was just looking out for us in her own way\u2014I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll come around once you\u2019re one of us. Really one of us, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany dug through her purse for a tissue, sniffling and blotting at her eyes. \u201cAre you sure? I mean, I\u2019d love to be a part of the pack, but not if Vera\u2019s going to keep sniping at me for the rest of my life because of something in my past. It is the past, and what\u2019s done is done\u2014I can\u2019t change it, but I don\u2019t want to be paying for it the rest of my life, either.\u201d</p><p>Heather put an arm around Tiffany\u2019s shoulder, giving her a comforting squeeze. She nonchalantly flicked bits of caviar off of her dress before putting her hands on Tiffany\u2019s shoulders. Heather held her there until she lifted her head and met her eyes, taking in the serious set of her jaw and clear concern in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You aren\u2019t that person. I know you\u2019re not. Everyone\u2019s a bit upset right now, but they\u2019ll come around and see it, too.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany dabbed at her eyes again, pulling away. \u201cVera won\u2019t. She never will.\u201d</p><p>Heather hesitated, glancing back to the house. Though Tiffany had put some distance between herself and the house, Heather was sure that a few of her packmates were listening in, particularly when she spotted Cassandra and Alexis watching from one of the bay windows overlooking the front yard. Cassandra made an impatient \u201cget on with it\u201d gesture, so Heather turned back to Tiffany, straightening.</p><p>\u201cShe may not, but the rest of the pack will. Eventually. We\u2019ll fix this somehow. Look, why don\u2019t you go home for now\u201d\u2014Heather flinched at the sound of Cassandra\u2019s angry curse, though Tiffany couldn\u2019t hear it\u2014\u201cand get cleaned up, and I\u2019ll call you in the morning. We\u2019ll go relax at the spa for a while.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany glanced over her shoulder at the house, frowning. \u201cOkay. What about the others? Do you think Cassandra and Alexis are still going to want to be friends with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they do. And if not, I\u2019ll talk sense into them. Now you go home and get some rest. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d Heather said firmly, urging Tiffany to turn back to her car and get moving again.</p><p>Tiffany did, unable to see the unnatural yellow glitter to Heather\u2019s eyes as she watched her walk away.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>Realize that if you have time to whine and complain about something, then you have the time to do something about it.</p><p>\u2014Anthony J. D\u2019Angelo</p><p>After that spectacular conclusion to dinner, Vera had been told none too politely to keep her head down, and to stay away from Tiffany until the matter of the contract was sorted out. She didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>Despite Phillip\u2019s protests that he was still interested and Cassandra\u2019s pleading for Gabriel to give the girl another chance, he had dismissed the rest of his pack with a note of caution to hold on any actions involving Tiffany\u2014whether it be contracting her or destroying her out of hand\u2014until he had a chance to investigate matters further. Cassandra knew exactly what that meant. Later, privately, even her best efforts didn\u2019t budge him. Gabriel did not want to endanger the pack, or see it torn apart over the inclusion of a member some of them clearly viewed as an enemy.</p><p>Cassandra was still incensed that he hadn\u2019t given in to her demands to contract Tiffany despite that thing she did with her tongue.</p><p>Instead, he\u2019d enjoyed every minute of her attentions, waited until she\u2014or rather, he was done\u2014and then told her in no uncertain terms that he was not going to put the pack at risk by accepting Tiffany into their ranks until he was assured that she posed no danger.</p><p>Quite the argument ensued. By the end of it, even Cassandra had to admit that Vera had a point. Tiffany presented a danger to their pack even if she wasn\u2019t a member of the White Hats anymore. There was no telling how close she was to her ex-husband or what he might do if he found out she had signed a contract with a werewolf, let alone become one of them. The contract would have to be filed in court, thus becoming a publicly accessible document\u2014meaning, through the Freedom of Information Act, the White Hats could easily find out that one of their own had turned against them.</p><p>It was a substantial risk that Gabriel was not willing to take. The more Cassandra thought about it, the more she saw the inherent danger as well.</p><p>At tennis practice at Alexis\u2019s house the following morning, Cassandra confessed as to Gabriel\u2019s feelings on the matter, and that she had changed her mind as well.</p><p>\u201cOh Cassie,\u201d Heather said, skipping back to smoothly return Alexis\u2019s serve with a backhanded sweep of her racket, \u201cthat just isn\u2019t right. You know it\u2019s not fair to her. All she wants is to be our friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd join the pack. Don\u2019t forget that,\u201d Alexis shouted from across the court.</p><p>Cassandra snorted, scuffing her shoes against the court. Heather frowned at her, unable to give a proper glare with her gaze torn between her friend and the oncoming ball. She didn\u2019t miss a beat, returning every volley and drop shot Alexis tried pulling to win the point even as she laid into Cassandra.</p><p>\u201cVera\u2019s just being paranoid. I know she wants what\u2019s best for the pack, but so do I\u2014and I think we need fresh blood to revive the older stock. Considering how long it\u2019s been since the last time we contracted someone, we\u2019re never going to find anyone so easy to convince as Tiffany Winters again. Someone who fits our standards\u2014and comes to us, no less\u2014is unheard of, and don\u2019t pretend like you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. We aren\u2019t the Moonwalkers in New York, no matter how badly we wish we were. We need to take advantage of this while we can.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe can\u2019t be one of us, darling. Gabriel said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always do what Gabriel tells you?\u201d</p><p>Alexis hurled a particularly vicious shot over the net that Heather had to scramble to catch and return. It certainly got her attention.</p> <p>\u201cHoney, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re looking at this clearly. She was married to a White Hat. Bane of our existence? Hunts our kind on the weekends for sport? I\u2019m with Cassie and Vera on this. Don\u2019t question the pack leader\u2019s judgment. We all need to back off.\u201d</p><p>Heather growled softly, the sound echoing across the court, punctuated by the sharp thock of the ball being slapped across the court hard and fast\u2014too fast for Alexis to keep up with, scoring Heather the first point. Cassandra rose to take her place on the court.</p><p>The two faced off as Alexis settled primly on a bench, taking a sip of Evian as she watched the pair. Cassandra prepared to serve, pausing just long enough to speak a few words first.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t overstep your bounds, Heather. You don\u2019t rank high enough in the pack to challenge Gabriel. Or me.\u201d</p><p>Heather\u2019s normally warm brown eyes now glittered gold, and she said nothing while dashing across the tarmac with supernatural speed to reach the ball. The two women played a silent game, daring each other with sharp, cutting movements, each working to outdo the other.</p> <p>Sweat freely dripped down their bodies, the world narrowing to one competitive moment, every action and reaction calculated to win the point and end the game. Cassandra hit the ball high and deep into Heather\u2019s court, forcing her to exercise extra speed and leap unnaturally high to reach it.</p><p>With a rush, Heather dashed forward to meet the lob, using an overhead smash to gain the point and end the game.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push too hard, Cassie,\u201d Heather said, tossing her racket aside with a clatter and rubbing the sweat off her brow with her arm. \u201cYou and Gabriel aren\u2019t the only voices in the pack.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra and Alexis watched with narrowed eyes as Heather spun on her heel and left the court, leaving them behind.</p><p>Cassandra sipped at the mai tai Alexis had prepared for her, crossing her legs at the ankles as she relaxed in the kitchen. They\u2019d waited a few minutes before they followed Heather inside, leaving her alone as she stalked off to one of the guest bedrooms to cool down and shower in peace.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not worried about what she said, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cassandra replied, not meeting Alexis\u2019s questioning gaze. \u201cNot worried. Concerned. Vera and Heather both make good points, but I don\u2019t think now is the time to tell Tiffany that we don\u2019t want her around or that we won\u2019t be turning her into one of us. It might be better if we distance ourselves instead.\u201d</p><p>Alexis pulled her towel from around her neck and dabbed at her forehead and cheeks before picking up her own drink and leaning against the marble countertop, taking a sip before answering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if Tiffany will accept that. Do you think Gabriel will ever let one of us contract or turn her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? No.\u201d</p><p>Alexis paused in lifting her drink back to her lips, brow cocked. \u201cAnd do you think she\u2019ll accept that?\u201d</p><p>Cassandra shook her head, setting her drink down and pushing it away. The two women said nothing for a time, the silence between them growing heavy.</p><p>Shifting her weight and looking away, Alexis broke the silence by turning around and busying herself with tidying the kitchen counters, even though the maid and the cook had already done so earlier in the day. In her Juicy shorts and Nikes with sparkling pink swooshes, she didn\u2019t look like much of a domestic, but she did her best impression as she banged cabinets and put the drink mixes away.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t trust her, you know,\u201d Alexis said, keeping her back to Cassandra as she reached up into one of the cabinets to adjust some of the dishes.</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let her go around thinking she\u2019s still welcome, either. One of us is going to have to tell her.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra harrumphed, a low growl rumbling in her throat. Alexis was careful not to meet her gaze, keeping her head down and her arms wrapped protectively around her stomach when she turned around.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should do it together. We can tell her to come over to Tiffany\u2019s later, and we can sit down as a group and discuss it like civilized people. If we keep Vera out of it, maybe she\u2019ll even listen to us.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra\u2019s eyes flashed gold, matching her eye shadow, and her lip lifted in a silent snarl before she huffed out a breath of air and let fallen lids obscure her gaze. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s an option. If we tell her, she might react badly. Go back to her husband, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t tell her,\u201d Alexis countered, \u201cshe might get it into her head that she still has a chance at becoming one of the pack, and end up doing something foolish. Worse, one of the boys might go along with it, and then where will we be? You saw how they were looking at her last night and how she had them wrapped around her fingers at the party. We can\u2019t take the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose not.\u201d</p><p>Alexis tossed her towel down on the counter before levering herself up to sit on it, reaching for her drink again. \u201cIf we tell her that we\u2019ll still be her friends, but gradually work our way out of her life and not invite her to all of the parties, maybe she won\u2019t take it quite so hard. We\u2019ll be safe, she\u2019ll be screwed, and we can all get on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra laughed, some of the tension easing out of her shoulders. \u201cIf she accepts it as easy as that, I\u2019d be very surprised. I suppose we can give it a shot. Maybe after enough time passes, Gabriel will change his mind. For now, I\u2019m sure Heather can keep her entertained when we\u2019re not around.\u201d</p><p>Heather walked in, now dressed in jeans and a Gucci T-shirt, rubbing the towel through her hair. \u201cDoubtful. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect you would,\u201d Alexis said, pushing a third drink down the smooth countertop. Heather caught it easily and took a deep pull. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree it\u2019s all for the best.\u201d</p><p>Heather downed half the drink in a go, earning raised brows and concerned looks from the other two ladies. She set the glass down with a clack, nearly breaking it.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t like it. But it\u2019ll have to do.\u201d</p><p>The two nodded and smiled, glad to hear she agreed. Until she added a quiet \u201cfor now\u201d under her breath.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Live by the gun, die by the gun.</p><p>\u2014Tupac Shakur</p><p>\u201cI have something you should see.\u201d Cassandra harrumphed as she dug through her closet, looking for a pair of shoes to wear, her cell phone tucked to her ear. \u201cVera, I know you just want to help, but you need to lay off. We\u2019re handling this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have proof this time.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra paused, one foot halfway into her Bottega Veneta platform wedge sandals. She was already irritated at Vera for tricking her into picking up by calling from an unfamiliar number\u2014her husband\u2019s office line\u2014after calls from her cell went unanswered. Vera was quick to fill the silence, the urgency in her tone not feigned in the least.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s one of them, Cassie. Be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all meeting at Heather\u2019s house in two hours. Bring whatever you found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVera\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it. I know. I\u2019ll behave myself.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra\u2019s tone was icy, commanding, and brooked no refusal. \u201cSee that you do. Another slip like the one you made at dinner, and I\u2019ll personally see to it that there\u2019s nothing left when the police come to pick you up for harming a human outside of a contract.\u201d</p><p>Vera was met with the click of a dial tone before she could reply.</p><p>Though a trifle peeved at being hung up on, Vera tossed the cordless phone she\u2019d borrowed from her husband\u2019s office onto the bed and gathered the printouts of articles she\u2019d found on the Internet. She was rather proud of the glossy quality her husband\u2019s printer had spit out, showing Tiffany on the edge of a pack of scruffy-looking hunters with a gun in her hand and a White Hat pin prominently tacked to the lapel of what looked like a knockoff Ralph Lauren blazer.</p><p>So tacky.</p><p>Alexis slowly exhaled, her eyes closed, one hand palm up, the other down, resting them on her folded legs. The taste of incense was heavy on the air, and the soft instrumental music and burbling water from a nearby fountain assisted her to find her center.</p><p>Since it had been cut short, and tensions had been high the entire time, the tennis match hadn\u2019t helped her to work off the excess supernatural energy of her second nature as it normally would have. With all of the stress from Vera and Tiffany\u2019s sniping and fighting, she had felt it necessary to call in an emergency session with her private yoga instructor. It took some pleading and persuading, but he had eventually conceded, and cancelled one of his morning appointments for her.</p><p>The meditation wasn\u2019t doing much to calm her. She was certain there must be something she was doing wrong\u2014but she didn\u2019t dare speak, knowing her yogi would instruct her if he determined she was not properly following the path of Ashtanga Yoga to serenity and enlightenment. Really, the only reason she was interested in continuing the lessons was because the instructor was one of those hard-bodied men who was Alpha enough to get her to obey his instructions without question, and because the meditation did, to some degree, help her calm herself and maintain greater control over her inner beast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRemember to breathe,\u201d her yogi said, pressing his hand into her lower back to force her to correct her posture.</p><p>With a slight nod, she took in the scent of sandalwood and musk, taking it through her mouth instead of her nose despite the taste it left on her tongue. She didn\u2019t want to destroy her sense of smell for the rest of the day.</p><p>If there was a hunt, she might need it later.</p> <p>Heather rushed about her home, getting her maid to tidy the house before sending her on an errand so the woman wouldn\u2019t become suspicious or overhear the conversation once the other werewives and Tiffany arrived. She made sure she had plenty of alcohol on hand\u2014she thought they might need it once the news was given.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t looking forward to telling Cassandra that she\u2019d stopped at the courthouse that morning to file the signed and notarized papers Tiffany had forgotten and left behind at dinner last night.</p><p>Tiffany had everything she intended to bring with her to Heather\u2019s house spread out on her bed.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew Cassandra was reconsidering allowing her into the pack after all that Vera had said. The offer to meet again at Heather\u2019s was what tipped her off. Neutral ground; a place she would hesitate to cause a scene, because the property belonged to a friend.</p><p>Tiffany had given careful thought to what she needed to bring with her, and felt that the netbook computer to play a video on, the photographs, and the piece of jewelry she\u2019d stolen from Vera when the ladies left their clothing behind in the woods at Alexis\u2019s party would serve her purposes admirably.</p> <p>Though they had never said as much, the Diamondfangs had always worked under the radar of the press and the hunters, working through society\u2019s elite. Its members would never want to be outed as real monsters lurking under the fa\u00e7ades of ruthless businessmen and women\u2014but now Tiffany knew who most of them were, and had the pictures and dossiers to prove their connections.</p><p>She would get what she wanted, or the werewives would be exposed to the world for the bitches they were.</p><p>Vera arrived early, papers tucked under her arm in a neat leather portfolio she\u2019d also borrowed from her husband\u2019s office. Heather was surprised to see her, but didn\u2019t question it, figuring that it would most likely be for the best once she delivered her news. That way she could be present to deflect any immediate attack Vera might attempt.</p><p>Alexis was next, breezing inside with a calm, collected air and trailing the scent of incense behind her. The other girls wrinkled their noses at the stink, but she ignored them, dropping into the plush cushions of a couch. She kicked off her embossed leather Alaia sandals and swung her legs up onto the couch, lounging comfortably. Cassandra was not far behind, arriving only fifteen minutes after the scheduled meeting time. She drew off her Versace sunglasses once she was inside and tossed her Yves Saint Laurent purse on the couch next to Alexis, putting her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cHmph. She\u2019s planning to be fashionably late again, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d Heather said, waggling her BlackBerry. \u201cShe sent me a text that she was running behind. Had to pick something up on the way, she said.\u201d</p> <p>Vera frowned, stalking over to a chair that gave her a good vantage of the rest of the room, as well as the front door, so she\u2019d know the moment Tiffany arrived. Cassandra huffed and toyed with a few strands of her hair, giving the other girls a hint as to just how peeved she was by the whole situation.</p><p>Alexis gestured her over, tucking in her legs to make room. \u201cCome on, Cassie. Come sit and relax. Breathe, darling. My instructor tells me that controlling your breathing is essential in learning how to control your life force. Or something like that.\u201d</p><p>The other girls stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, frowning at the looks they were giving her. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the road to spiritual development. That\u2019s very important, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, whatever,\u201d Cassandra said, rolling her eyes before tucking her skirt under her and settling primly on the edge of the cushions. \u201cHeather, be a love and get the drinks started, would you? I have the feeling we\u2019re all going to need them before this is over.\u201d</p><p>By the time Heather returned with the drinks, Tiffany was just pulling into the driveway. The other girls feigned indifference, but the amber glow to their irises and tension in the set of their shoulders gave them away. Tiffany brought a Claire Chase messenger bag in addition to her purse, tucking the strap over her shoulder before striding with her head held high to meet with the werewives inside.</p><p>Heather met her at the door, showing her into the room and seating her as far as was polite from Vera as was possible. The two ladies glared daggers at each other, but were civil enough to exchange tight nods, never taking their eyes off one another.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Tiffany said, pausing to sip at the Long Island iced tea\u2014heavy on the rum\u2014that Heather had pushed into her hand, \u201cnow that I\u2019m here, I\u2019m not sure where to begin.\u201d</p> <p>Cassandra cleared her throat. \u201cTiffany, you know that we all like spending time with you and having you here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of you?\u201d</p><p>Vera smirked at Tiffany\u2019s pointed look, her lip gloss adding an extra sparkle to that killer smile.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. Now, you know what we are. By your own admission, you\u2019ve known for a while. While we certainly appreciate your desire to join us, I\u2019m sure you can understand why we might be hesitant to let someone with your ... background ... join our ranks.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany turned her disapproving look from Vera to Cassandra, her frown deepening. Cassandra didn\u2019t give, meeting her gaze without flinching, and holding it as an uncomfortable silence stretched out between them. Tiffany would neither acknowledge nor deny that she was a threat, while Cassandra wouldn\u2019t let her ignore the possibility any longer.</p><p>While their bodies tensed and gazes narrowed, Alexis sat up, and Heather chewed on her lower lip as the two had their stare down.</p><p>As it seemed neither was willing to break the silence and put an end to the silent contest of wills, Vera cut in by dropping her file folder on the coffee table with a crack sharp enough to draw all eyes.</p><p>\u201cI believe what she\u2019s trying to say is, your past history does not make you a suitable candidate for our pack.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany ground her teeth, setting her drink aside with some care and leaning forward in her seat to point an accusatory finger at Vera. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the first thing about me, Vera, and don\u2019t pretend otherwise. None of you, not even Heather, knows me well enough to make that kind of assumption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d Vera purred. \u201cThen, by all means, enlighten us about these.\u201d</p><p>With that, Vera opened the file and spread the newspaper articles and accompanying photographs over the coffee table for all to see.</p><p>The headlines of the articles screamed about the injustices and property damage caused by illegal battles between humans and Others. The anti-Other groups had picketed Other-sympathetic businesses, destroyed entire buildings, and killed several vampires and werewolves without valid warrants. Interspersed with the articles were pictures. Irrefutable pictures of Tiffany showing her allegiance as a White Hat, with the trademark white cowboy hat pin attached to her lapel in every one.</p><p>Protest marches. Riots. One even showed her with several other White Hats on the run from police dressed in full riot gear, a flaming building in the background. Surrounded by others like her, all wearing the same pins or logo emblazoned on their shirts.</p><p>Tiffany whitened under the bronze shimmer of her foundation, her lips pressed into a thin line as all eyes turned to her.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>Wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are.</p><p>\u2014Kurt Cobain</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said before that I\u2019ve made mistakes,\u201d Tiffany said, avoiding the accusatory looks from the rest of the ladies by staring down at the photos spread on the table in front of her. Heather was particularly incensed, her balled fists and clenched teeth betraying her raw anger and hurt. \u201cI have no good excuse for those pictures. They were taken while I was still married to my husband\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you admit you hunted us before?\u201d Vera\u2019s tone was triumphant and poisonously sweet, her nail polish fracturing as the tips of her fingers grew into claws.</p><p>Tiffany looked up and met Vera\u2019s yellow eyes with her own icy blue ones, baring her teeth in the semblance of a smile. Slowly, deliberately, she reached down to the messenger bag at her feet. The others tensed, ready to react if she pulled a weapon\u2014but all she withdrew was a tiny laptop.</p><p>\u201cVera, I\u2019ve said a number of times already that I haven\u2019t participated in that lifestyle for quite a while. Though I suppose that\u2019s not entirely true.\u201d</p><p>As Tiffany spoke, she booted up the netbook, searching for a file. Though wary, the other women watched her without interrupting, four pairs of glowing amber irises focused with single-minded intensity on her every move.</p><p>\u201cYou see, I realized early on that you were going to make things difficult for me. I prepared for this eventuality the only way I knew how\u2014using skills I earned while working with my ex-husband. I do want to caution you all that this is not the only copy, and that if something happens to me or you do not reconsider your actions and my future place in your pack, this video will be uploaded onto YouTube and forwarded to every TV station in the country.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Though that last statement caused some confusion, in moments, all four of the werewives were on their feet, growling and snarling in rage. The video quality was far from that of a high-definition movie, and the playback of the audio was choppy, but there was no mistaking Vera, Cassandra, Alexis, or Heather\u2019s faces taken from some nearby vantage point in the trees\u2014or their shifts in the woods outside of Alexis\u2019s home into werewolves.</p><p>They all watched, stunned, silent, as their banter was captured on film, as was their undressing and their change into their inner beasts. Tiffany didn\u2019t have to tell them what a danger this video posed to them. They knew. To a one, they knew that they could be connected to their husbands, some of the richest and most influential businessmen in the state\u2014if not the country\u2014and that it could bring the livelihoods of their families and fellow pack members crashing down around them if it ever went public. Cassandra in particular went cold, considering her husband, who was running for office next term, would likely flay her and the other werewives alive if he ever caught wind of the existence of that video.</p><p>After the wolves had rushed off into the woods to play, it showed close-ups of the clothing and jewelry left behind by the women, then faded to black. As soon as it ended, Tiffany snapped the netbook shut and tucked it back in her bag, ignoring the bared fangs, the glowing eyes, the twitching claws, and the deep rumbles emanating from their chests. Crossing her legs and folding her hands primly in her lap, she raised her chin and regarded Cassandra expectantly.</p> <p>Heather was the one who spoke first, her voice deep and guttural as she fought to get a handle on her rage.</p><p>\u201cHow could you? That isn\u2019t fair, Tiffany! Why would you do such a terrible thing?\u201d</p><p>Tiffany was startled into a laugh, though there was nothing funny about the situation. \u201cFair? You call this fair? Heather, you\u2019re the only one of the Diamondfangs who has listened to me from the start. I\u2019ve got nothing against you. The rest of you need to listen to me, this time, and believe me when I say that I don\u2019t intend to cause you any harm unless you decide against honoring my request. All I wanted when I came here was to find a home in this pack. Nothing has changed. File the papers, do what you need to do to initiate me, and that video will disappear.\u201d</p><p>Alexis, trembling and white in the face, raised a clawed finger that still sparkled with the crumbled remains of her Gold Pearl nail polish. \u201cYou have no right to demand anything from us. Videos and pictures can be doctored. You have no way of proving that it\u2019s really us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Cassandra, who had been too stunned to react immediately, showed her fangs in a fierce and humorless grin. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly believe we\u2019d give you what you want or let you walk away from this. Bravo for the attempt\u2014but there\u2019s no way you could ever prove to anyone that your film is real.\u201d</p> <p>Tiffany smiled slyly, reaching for her messenger bag again. \u201cThat\u2019s why I saved some other evidence.\u201d</p><p>Alarmed, the four girls watched with slack jaws as she withdrew a glittering diamond tennis bracelet, dangling with a \u201cVK\u201d charm\u2014Vera\u2019s missing jewelry, taken the same night Tiffany recorded them in the woods after the party.</p><p>One that had been clearly visible mixed in with the clothing at the end of the video.</p><p>The other girls shot Vera a look. She was pale, her fists clenched so tightly that spots of blood were pooling under her fingernails.</p><p>\u201cYou little thief! How dare you!\u201d</p><p>Tiffany smirked. \u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas. This isn\u2019t the only thing I took\u2014just the most obvious. Travis told me how often you forgot and left jewelry behind when you went hunting with the pack\u2014or stayed the night at his place. Tsk, Vera. I doubt your husband would approve.\u201d</p> <p>Vera\u2019s reaction was immediate and intense. With an enraged howl, she leapt toward Tiffany, closing the distance between them with supernatural speed, hands arched into claws.</p><p>Though Cassandra and Heather moved to stop her, Tiffany was on her feet in no time, ducking behind furniture and flicking her wrists to dislodge daggers from sheathes hidden under the cuffs of her Marc Jacobs peasant blouse.</p><p>Everyone froze at the unmistakable gleam of silver.</p><p>\u201cVera, sit down!\u201d</p><p>Cassandra\u2019s voice, usually smooth and sure, cracked on a high note. Aside from the unbelievable fuck up of leaving evidence of her shift behind, she was terrified that Vera or Tiffany might actually attack one another. Free of a contract, Tiffany\u2019s injury could mean a death sentence for all four of the women if Vera didn\u2019t back off. Plus, the silver weapons Tiffany was holding were deadly weapons\u2014even a small nick could do enough damage to incapacitate or kill them.</p><p>Vera stayed where she was, straining against the solid hold Cassandra and Heather had on her arms. Her glittering gaze, maddened with rage, never left Tiffany\u2019s.</p><p>Alexis moved to take Cassandra\u2019s place restraining Vera, whose skin was starting to darken with fur and muscles were now bulging unnaturally under her clothing. Moving slowly, carefully, palms up to show she meant no harm, Cassandra edged closer to Tiffany. With any luck, she could draw close enough to incapacitate her without risking injury.</p><p>\u201cWhat does a hunter want with our pack? Did someone send you?\u201d</p> <p>Tiffany\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t waver from Vera, though one of her hands shifted so the weapon was now pointed at Cassandra, making her flinch and stop in her tracks.</p><p>\u201cLike I told you before, I\u2019m not a hunter anymore. If I show myself in Manhattan after dark, the vampires will kill me. If I show up in Central Park, the Moonwalkers will kill me. If I show up anywhere the White Hats are planning a raid, they will kill me.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany was met by incredulous stares. All the while, she maintained her fighting pose, poised and ready to strike at a moment\u2019s notice. After giving her statements time to settle in, she continued, very slowly lowering her weapons in a bid to show she wasn\u2019t about to attack\u2014but would be ready to defend herself if need be.</p><p>\u201cI want what you have. I want your strength, your speed, your stamina. Your ability to heal. I\u2019ve had too many trips to the hospital, and too many brushes with death to kid myself. The only way I\u2019ll ever be able to survive in this world, particularly with my past, is with a supernatural edge.\u201d</p><p>Heather, Alexis, and Cassandra were stunned speechless for the second time in as many minutes, hardly able to believe Tiffany\u2019s motivations.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve what we have!\u201d</p><p>Vera gave voice to a thunderous growl, the glasses rattling on the table nearby as she bumped into it when she struggled against Alexis and Heather\u2019s hold. They managed to keep her from breaking free, but just barely.</p><p>With a contemptuous sneer, Tiffany finally shifted her gaze to Cassandra, whose mouth was working soundlessly as she tried to find the words to speak. Vera used the distraction, forcing a quick shift and using her superior strength to slide out of Alexis and Heather\u2019s grasp, yanking her arms free with an audible rip of clothing. They stumbled forward, and then fell to their knees when she slammed her fists down on their shoulders.</p><p>It took a talented shifter to rearrange the bones and tendons in their body so rapidly without being crippled by the mind-numbing pain of the change. Rather than assume the form of a wolf, she\u2019d chosen the half-man, half-wolf shape that all werewolves were forced to take during the height of the full moon, her body reformed into the dog-headed beast of legend. Her clothing fell in tatters at her clawed feet, the leather bands of her sandals groaning and snapping, and she shook her muzzle hard enough for her earrings to give a discordant jangle. The jewels at her ears and throat glittered obscenely against her pelt, a mockery of the fashionable image she\u2019d projected only moments ago.</p><p>Now towering over the other women, Vera\u2019s sleek fur bristled, dagger fangs dripping saliva as her lip lifted. She stalked forward with murderous intent, clawed, furry arms outstretched to wrap Tiffany in a crushing embrace.</p><p>Cassandra stepped in her way, shouting at her to stop, but Vera batted her across the room hard enough to send her careening into an end table, shattering the furniture.</p><p>Tiffany stood her ground as Vera came on, staring up and up into the massive Were\u2019s murderously glowing eyes. Defiant to the last, Tiffany curled her own lip, tossing her hair back as she raised a dagger in invitation.</p><p>\u201cBring it, bitch.\u201d</p><p>With an ear-shattering howl, Vera sprang forward.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Life contains but two tragedies. One is not to get your heart\u2019s desire; the other is to get it.</p><p>\u2014Socrates</p><p>Gaping jaws and talons snapped and clacked as the twisted, furred creature that was Vera pressed the attack. Despite her size and bulk, she moved with supernatural speed, though her paws slid on the smooth marble tile and prevented her from launching into a full charge.</p><p>Tiffany moved with the grace of a dancer, arching, twisting, skipping back from swiping claws. She wanted to be turned\u2014but not crippled in the process.</p><p>For her part, Vera didn\u2019t take any care as to how sloppy and uncoordinated her attacks were until after the first burning swipe she received on the inside of one massive, hairy arm. She yelped, dropping onto all fours and backing up, tail between her legs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tiffany circled around, balanced on her toes, ready to spring away if she needed to. The other girls were only just struggling to their feet when Vera sprang with catlike agility, diving in low so talon-tipped fingers could close on the hunter\u2019s ankle, yanking her off her feet. Tiffany was unable to compensate and lost her balance, crashing onto her back and sending one of the daggers clattering across the floor to slide under a couch, far out of reach.</p><p>Before any of the other werewives could stop her, Vera was on top of Tiffany\u2019s sprawled form, one paw on her shoulder to keep her down and massive jaws diving for her throat.</p><p>Tiffany didn\u2019t hesitate to bury the remaining dagger in Vera\u2019s side, the sharp metal sinking between her ribs with the ease of a hot knife through butter. Vera\u2019s head snapped back and she howled in pain, her talons ripping through Tiffany\u2019s silk blouse, and then her skin as she convulsed and jerked away. The knife came free as she pulled back, and Tiffany dropped it in favor of scooting back across the slick floor as far from Vera as possible and grabbing at her bleeding shoulder, crying out in pain.</p> <p>By then Cassandra and Alexis had regained their feet. Heather, the weakest of the three, was still clutching at the back of her neck and moaning on the floor. Cassandra was a little unsteady, but she put herself between Vera and Tiffany, her jaw tight and a muscle ticking in her cheek as she placed her fists on her hips. She glared down at Vera, who was whimpering and rolling on the floor, writhing against the silver burn now racing through her bloodstream. It wasn\u2019t enough to kill her\u2014the blade hadn\u2019t struck anything vital or damaged any internal organs\u2014but she\u2019d be in a great deal of pain for the next few days, and left with a permanent scar.</p><p>Assuming Cassandra let her live, that is.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re happy,\u201d Cassandra said, a scowl twisting her features as she kicked Vera\u2019s bleeding side, drawing another choked yowl of pain out of her. \u201cYou\u2019ve just signed our death warrants, you moon-crazed, silver-tainted, imbecilic whore!\u201d</p><p>Heather\u2019s head jerked up, her eyes widening. She gasped when she spotted all of the blood now pasting Tiffany\u2019s shirt to her chest, then dragged herself to her feet using a nearby chaise as leverage. \u201cCassie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I told you once\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCassie!\u201d</p><p>Cassandra turned a withering glare on Heather, and she shrank back from the heat in her gaze, voice a low whisper.</p><p>\u201cI filed the contract.\u201d</p><p>Everyone\u2014Alexis, Tiffany, Cassandra, and Vera\u2014turned their attention on Heather, who wrapped her arms around her stomach and looked away so she wouldn\u2019t have to meet the incredulity and anger in their gazes.</p><p>\u201cI filed it this morning. Before the meeting. I knew none of you would ever do it, and I didn\u2019t agree with Gabriel saying no.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany gave voice to a raspy, triumphant laugh, sitting up and tossing her hair back over her shoulder, though some of the longer strands were now red with blood and clung to her chest and shirt. Cassandra sucked in a breath through her teeth, her gaze torn between Tiffany and Heather, who was busy hugging herself and trying to look as small as possible. Alexis simply ran her palm over her face, though she was admittedly relieved that it now meant there was no liability connected to herself as far as this unbelievable fuck up on Vera\u2019s part was concerned.</p> <p>Tiffany used her free hand to grab a nearby lamp pole to lever herself to her feet. The wounds weren\u2019t too deep, but they stung when she moved around, dragging a wince out of her. Cassandra tensed, but made no move to help, not wanting to risk being struck by another silver weapon she might have hidden in her clothes.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Alexis ventured, hoping to defuse some of the tensions between the women now that the worst seemed to be over, \u201cI suppose that means you\u2019re really going to be one of us, now. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s sunny smile was at odds with her pallor and the way she swayed on her feet. Despite the pain, she stood tall and proud, arms folded in front of her chest. Lifting her chin, she turned that pleased grin on Alexis, her look just as predatory as any of the werewolves could have pulled off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. None of you will regret the decision. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Vera growled, the low rumble cutting off into a pained whine when Cassandra shoved her again with her foot until she subsided. Cassandra whirled on Tiffany, eyes narrowed and brows furrowed into tight knots as she stalked forward, though she still left a healthy distance between them.</p><p>\u201cYou may have gotten your way, but you\u2019ll have to rise through the ranks just like the rest of us did. Gabriel isn\u2019t going to make it easy for you, and neither will the rest of the pack. What you did was inexcusable, and hardly fitting behavior for a member of the Diamondfangs. I have the feeling you\u2019ll be spending the next couple of years proving yourself to the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s smile faded, and she inclined her head by way of apology. She was still far too pleased to be terribly sorry. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you wish, so be it. I suppose I have nothing but time now, so I\u2019ll spend as long as it takes to prove my worth.\u201d</p><p>Heather paused in rubbing the back of her neck, still sore from Vera\u2019s blow, to turn a puzzled look on Tiffany. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s why I came to you instead of the vampires, don\u2019t you? I wanted immortality without the nighttime limitations, and I got it. Under the circumstances, it seems to me being furry for a few nights out of the month isn\u2019t such a bad deal. Now that what\u2019s yours is mine, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to earn the respect of the pack. We can start with my overseas connections\u2014which should help the pack expand its influence enormously. It\u2019s only a fair trade, considering.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra snorted, leaning back on her heels and eyeing Tiffany with a sly twist to her lips. The other girls were staring blankly now, even Vera, too surprised to contradict her.</p><p>\u201cReally, now. That\u2019s why you wanted to join us so badly? Immortality?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You think I like the idea of being a monster? What\u2019s the point if you don\u2019t get something out of it\u2014like living forever?\u201d</p><p>Cassandra startled everyone by throwing her head back and laughing, covering her eyes with her hand. Her shoulders shook so hard with mirth that she couldn\u2019t speak right away. Irritated, Tiffany huffed, looking at Heather, who was watching her with wide eyes, her hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny about that?\u201d</p><p>Heather shook her head, not wanting to be the one to break the news. So Alexis did it for her.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you should\u2019ve stuck with the vampires. Werewolves aren\u2019t immortal. We have decreased life spans because of our nature.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany blinked. \u201cCome again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecreased. Life. Span,\u201d Alexis repeated. \u201cWe\u2019re destined to die young. Well, relatively.\u201d</p><p>Already pale from blood loss under the bronze shimmer of her makeup, Tiffany grew whiter still. She staggered a few steps to collapse into a nearby chair. Heather grimaced when she saw the bloody handprint left behind on the furniture, but felt it was the wrong time to caution her guests about keeping the place tidy.</p><p>\u201c... but ... but I thought ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong, obviously,\u201d Cassandra said, lacing her tone with as much sympathy as she could muster. Under the circumstances, it wasn\u2019t much. \u201cSorry, sweetness. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t know. I thought the White Hats were better informed than that.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany shot her an angry look, though she was still too shocked and weak to do more than raise a shaky fist at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t care about the details, I just went with Richard when he went on hunts. No one ever told me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet used to it,\u201d Heather snapped, her own patience at an end. \u201cYou\u2019re one of us now. Welcome to the werewives.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>If you want to know what God thinks of money, just look at the people he gave it to.</p><p>\u2014Dorothy Parker</p><p>Six Months Later</p><p>Alexis stirred her martini, watching a woman ordering one of the cabana boys at the hotel pool to get her a towel and something from the bar. The werewives had decided a vacation down to Atlantic City was in order, and were making the most of the time away from their husbands by shopping, gambling, visiting the local clubs, and soaking up sun by the poolside. Now, resting at a glass table with a view overlooking the rest of the patio, the pool, and the ocean in the distance, the ladies were relaxing after a long, hard day of wearing out the magnetic stripes on their husbands\u2019 credit cards.</p><p>Alexis studied the woman with interest. She was dark-haired and golden-skinned, probably from out of town. Her bikini and matching sarong were ones Alexis had considered buying herself when she was shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue earlier in the week. The rock on her finger shone brightly enough that Alexis was glad she\u2019d remembered to bring her Christian Dior sunglasses with her.</p><p>The lady said something so sharply that the boy taking her order was quick to pick up her purse for her when she gestured for it, and then rushed off to fetch her drink. Though the sight of the tight butt as he bent over to pick up the bag was distracting, Alexis used the excuse of plucking the olive garnishing her drink out and shaking it in the woman\u2019s direction to turn the attention of the other werewives her way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Heather glanced over the rim of the oversized pi\u00f1a colada she\u2019d ordered, then shrugged. \u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra nudged her Prada sunglasses down to rest on the tip of her nose and tipped her sunhat up. She watched the girl snap her fingers as she made demands that the hotel personnel scurried to carry out, catering to her whims as if she were the Queen of England.</p> <p>\u201cShe looks like she\u2019d be a pain in the ass to break in,\u201d Vera commented, not bothering to crane her neck to take a look.</p><p>Tiffany slid behind her, giving her a hug as she put one of the two cocktails she was carrying down on the table in front of Vera, giving her an air-kiss on the cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s why I love you. You\u2019re always so positive about these things.\u201d</p><p>Vera gave Tiffany a vicious, toothy grin, which was soon returned in kind. Tiffany slid into her own seat, crossing her legs so that her Zac Posen floral skirt rode up high on her thigh, distracting several of the men working and lounging near the pool.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve taken chances before,\u201d Cassandra said, smiling wryly at Tiffany and toasting her with her drink. \u201cWhat do you think, darling?\u201d</p><p>Tapping her cheek with one French-manicured fingernail, Tiffany made a big production of thinking about it, taking her time while the other women rolled their eyes and sipped at their drinks. Lips curved into a Cheshire grin, she curled her fingers around her glass, hairline cracks appearing in her polish as her nails began forming into talons.</p> <p>\u201cI say it doesn\u2019t hurt to give her a chance. After all, she looks like she\u2019d fit right in.\u201d</p><p>The woman, thanks to the Bulgari sunglasses shading her from the sun\u2019s glare, failed to notice five pairs of glowing, golden eyes simultaneously focused upon her with predatory intent. </p> </body></html>"]
