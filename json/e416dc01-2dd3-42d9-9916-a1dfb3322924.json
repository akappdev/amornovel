The kind of voice that sent little shivers down a woman\u2019s spine. It came out of the bottomless shadows near the base of Eclipse Arch, the stone monolith that dominated this secluded stretch of rocky beach.</p><p>Hannah Harte jerked her gaze away from the sight of Perry Decatur\u2019s disappearing taillights and spun around. Her pulse, already beating briskly as a result of the unpleasant tussle in the front seat, shifted into high gear.</p><p>Maybe getting out of the car had not been one of her brighter ideas. This stretch of Bayview Drive was a very lonely place at this hour of the night. Nice going, Hannah, she thought. The old frying-pan-into-the-fire trick. And you\u2019re supposed to be so sensible and cautious. The one who never takes chances. The one who never gets into trouble.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d She edged back a step and prepared to run.</p><p>The man on the beach sauntered casually out of the dense darkness of the arched rock and stepped into the cold light of the late-summer moon. He was less than twenty feet away.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Harte,\u201d he said. Cold, ironic amusement filtered through the words. \u201cDon\u2019t you recongnize a no-good, low-down, untrustworthy Madison on sight?\u201d</p><p>She took in the stark profile, the glint of silver light on midnight-dark hair, and the air of arrogant, prowling grace. She didn\u2019t need the additional clues of a leather jacket, a black crew-neck T-shirt, and jeans.</p><p>Rafe Madison. Her generation\u2019s most notorious member of the disreputable, thoroughly scandalous Madison clan. For three generations, ever since the legendary street fight between Mitchell Madison and Sullivan Harte in front of Fulton\u2019s Supermarket, the Hartes had dutifully warned their offspring not to get involved with the wild, unruly Madisons.</p><p>Rafe had apparently made it a point to live up to his family\u2019s scandalous heritage. The product of an affair between his sculptor father and a model, Rafe had been orphaned along with his brother at the tender age of nine. Both boys had been raised by their disreputable grandfather, Mitchell, who was, according to Hannah\u2019s mother, in no way qualified to be a father.</p><p>Rafe had blossomed into the quintessential bad boy, but he had somehow managed, by the skin of his teeth, to stay out of jail. As far as most people in Eclipse Bay were concerned, it was only a matter of time before he wound up behind bars.</p><p>He was twenty-four, four years older than herself, Hannah thought. It was common knowledge that his grandfather was furious with him because he had dropped out of college in the middle of his sophomore year. Rafe had done a short stint in the military, and from all accounts, he had managed to prove all the recruitment posters wrong and emerge with no marketable skills. Word had it that this summer Mitchell was trying to coerce him into going to work for his older brother, Gabe, who was attempting, against all odds, to revive the family business. No one expected Gabe to succeed in that endeavor.</p> <p>Although she and her family spent every summer and many weekends and vacations here in Eclipse Bay, Hannah had had no direct contact with Rafe while she was growing up. The four years\u2019 difference in their ages had, until tonight, served to keep their orbits safely separated, even in this small seaside community where both families had deep roots. Four years was a chasm when one was a kid.</p><p>But tonight was her twentieth birthday. In the fall she would start her junior year of college in Portland. For some reason the four years between herself and Rafe Madison no longer seemed an impenetrable barrier.</p><p>Her first reaction to the realization that he had witnessed the struggle in the front seat of Perry\u2019s car was overwhelming mortification. Hartes did not indulge in public scenes. Just her dumb luck to have a Madison hanging around when she broke that unwritten rule. Anger warred with acute embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cDo you do this a lot?\u201d she asked gruffly.</p><p>\u201cDo what a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHide behind large rocks in order to spy on people who want to have private conversations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to admit that the entertainment options in this town are a little limited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s especially true if you\u2019ve got a severely limited concept of what constitutes entertainment.\u201d Everyone knew that Rafe\u2019s motorcycle was frequently spotted in the small parking lot behind Virgil\u2019s Adult Books and Video Arcade. \u201cWhat do you do when you\u2019re not being a voyeur?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA voyeur?\u201d He whistled softly. \u201cThat\u2019s a fancy word for a Peeping Tom, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought so. Wasn\u2019t absolutely sure, though. I dropped out of college before we got to some of the more up-scale words.\u201d</p><p>He was mocking her. She knew it, but she was not certain how to deal with it.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t brag about leaving school if I were you.\u201d She clutched her purse more tightly in front of her body, as if it were a magic shield she could use to ward off any demonic vibes Rafe might be emitting. \u201cMy father says that it\u2019s too bad you blew off your future like that. He says you have potential.\u201d</p><p>Rafe\u2019s teeth flashed briefly in a sardonic grin. \u201cLots of people have said that over the years, starting with my first-grade teacher. But they\u2019ve all concluded that I won\u2019t ever live up to whatever potential I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an adult now. It\u2019s your responsibility to make your life work properly. You can\u2019t blame your failure on others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never do that,\u201d he assured her earnestly. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that I am solely to blame for my own screwups.\u201d</p><p>She was out of her depth here. She tightened her grip on the purse and took another step back.</p><p>\u201cYou sort of implied that you and the guy who just took off came here to talk privately.\u201d His words pursued her in the darkness. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get the feeling that the two of you were having what you\u2019d call a meaningful conversation. Who was the jerk, anyway?\u201d</p><p>For some oblique reason she felt compelled to defend Perry, who, unlike Rafe Madison, would amount to something someday. Or maybe it was her own self-image she wanted to protect. She did not like to think of herself as the kind of woman who dated jerks.</p><p>Not that Perry was a jerk. He was a budding academic.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Perry Decatur,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cHe\u2019s a grad student at Chamberlain. Not that it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGuess he thought the evening was going to end a little differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerry\u2019s okay. He just got a little pushy tonight, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPushy, huh? Is that what you call it?\u201d Rafe gave an easy shrug. \u201cWell, it looked like you pushed back pretty good. For a minute there, I thought you might need a little help, but then I realized that you were handling him just fine on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerry is hardly the violent type.\u201d Outrage flared. \u201cHe\u2019s a grad student, for crying out loud. He plans to teach political science.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that right? Since when is politics a science?\u201d</p><p>She was pretty sure that was a rhetorical question. \u201cHe expects to be offered a position on the faculty at Chamberlain as soon as he gets his Ph.D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot. If I\u2019d known that, I wouldn\u2019t have worried about you even half a minute while the two of you were staging that arm-wrestling contest. I mean, a guy who\u2019s going for his Ph.D. and plans to become a hotshot professor at Chamberlain wouldn\u2019t try to force himself on a woman. Don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>She was profoundly grateful for the simple fact that it was midnight. At least Rafe could not see the hot color she was almost sure was staining her face a vivid shade of pink. \u201cThere\u2019s no call to be sarcastic. Perry and I had a disagreement, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you date a lot of jerks?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop calling Perry a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just curious. Can\u2019t blame me under the circumstances, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can and I do.\u201d She glared. \u201cYou\u2019re being deliberately obnoxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not quite as obnoxious as the jerk, huh? I haven\u2019t even touched you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up. I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to mention it, but you are standing alone here on an isolated stretch of road in the middle of the night. Like I said, it\u2019s going to be a long walk back to your folks\u2019 place.\u201d</p> <p>She seized the only weak point she could find in his logic. \u201cI\u2019m not alone.\u201d</p><p>In the pale moonlight, his smile gleamed dangerously. \u201cWe both know that as far as your family is concerned, the fact that I\u2019m here with you makes your situation worse than being alone. I\u2019m a Madison, remember?\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin. \u201cI don\u2019t give a darn about that stupid feud. Ancient history, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Ancient history. But you know what they say about history. Those who don\u2019t learn from it are condemned to relive it.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she stared at him. \u201cYou sound just like Aunt Isabel. She\u2019s always saying things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Hannah was floored. \u201cYou\u2019ve talked to my aunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe talks to me.\u201d He raised one shoulder in another dismissive gesture. \u201cI do some work around that big house of hers sometimes. She\u2019s a nice old lady. A little strange, but then, she is a Harte.\u201d</p> <p>She wondered what her parents would say if they discovered that Aunt Isabel hired Rafe to do odd jobs around Dreamscape. \u201cI guess that explains where you picked up the quote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d actually read it in a book, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows you do most of your reading at Virgil Nash\u2019s p**n shop.\u201d Lord, she sounded prissy. \u201cI doubt that you\u2019d find a quote like that in any of the books or magazines he stocks.\u201d</p><p>Rafe was silent for a beat, as if her comment had surprised him. But he recovered immediately. \u201cRight. Mostly I just look at the pictures, anyhow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet the jerk reads a lot.\u201d</p><p>Quite suddenly she\u2019d had enough. It was time to level this playing field. Rafe Madison had four years and a lifetime of experience on her, but she was a Harte. She could hold her own against a Madison.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t come here to play some voyeuristic games,\u201d she said coldly, \u201cwhat are you doing at Eclipse Arch at this time of night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing you are,\u201d he said very smoothly. \u201cMy date and I had a little disagreement, and she kicked me out of her car.\u201d</p><p>Hannah was astonished. \u201cKaitlin Sadler threw you out of her car because you wouldn\u2019t have sex with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t argue about having sex,\u201d he said with devastating honesty. \u201cWe argued about the fact that she\u2019s dating other guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d It was no secret that Kaitlin had been seeing other men. \u201cI hear she wants to marry someone who can take her away from Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard right. Obviously I\u2019m not in a position to do that, what with my failure to achieve my full potential and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I don\u2019t even have a steady job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose Kaitlin would consider flipping veggie burgers at Snow\u2019s Caf\u00e9 a position with a lot of guaranteed upward mobility,\u201d Hannah mused.</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t. She made that real clear.\u201d</p><p>Hannah was appalled to realize that she felt an insidious little tendril of sympathy for him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to admit that you certainly can\u2019t afford to keep her in the style to which she wants to become accustomed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I thought we had an understanding that while we were seeing each other, neither of us would fool around with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaitlin, I take it, didn\u2019t share that understanding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. She said she didn\u2019t want to be tied down to me. Made it clear that her first priority was finding a rich husband. Naturally, I was crushed to learn that I was nothing more than a plaything for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Crushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Madisons have feelings too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe family likes to keep it quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Sort of ruins the image.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You know, you\u2019d be surprised how irritating it is to date a woman who is actively hunting elsewhere for a wealthy husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaitlin\u2019s definitely active,\u201d Hannah said neutrally. \u201cEveryone in town knows it.\u201d</p><p>Rafe smiled thinly. \u201cAs of tonight she can be active with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose she was upset when you told her you didn\u2019t want to continue in the role of, uh, plaything?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe was pissed as hell.\u201d</p><p>She tried to read his face in the shadows, but it was impossible to tell what he was thinking or feeling. Assuming that is, that he was thinking or feeling anything at all.</p><p>\u201cI get the impression that you are not particularly devastated by the breakup in your relationship,\u201d she ventured cautiously.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019m devastated. I just told you, I\u2019m a sensitive guy. But I\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Kaitlin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorrying about Kaitlin\u2019s feelings is not real high on my list of priorities at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Hannah gazed at him in amazement. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ve actually got a list of priorities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so it isn\u2019t a computer-generated five-year master plan like the one you\u2019ve probably got tacked up on your bedroom wall. But some of us have to make it up as we go along.\u201d</p><p>She winced at the thought of the list of personal goals she had made for herself at the start of the summer. It was, indeed, hanging on the bulletin board over her dresser. It was an updated, more finely tuned version of the list she had made when she graduated from high school. Formulating objectives and then plotting a course to reach those objectives was second nature to her. Everyone in her family was trained to be organized and forward-looking. As her father, Hamilton, was fond of saying, an unplanned life was a messy life.</p> <p>Madisons, on the other hand, were notorious for their propensity to be driven by quixotic obsessions, quirky desires, and the occasional wild hair. When a Madison was consumed by a passion, people said, nothing was allowed to get in the way. Rafe\u2019s casual attitude toward the breakup with Kaitlin Sadler tonight was convincing evidence that she did not rank as his passion.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll bite,\u201d Hannah said, still uncertain about whether or not Rafe was teasing her. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your list of priorities?\u201d</p><p>For a moment she thought he was not going to respond. Then he shoved his hands deeper into the pockets of his leather motorcycle jacket and turned slightly to face the bay.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think my plans would be of much interest to you,\u201d he said laconically. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to get a Ph.D. or anything.\u201d</p><p>She watched him, unwillingly fascinated now. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He fell silent for a moment. She had the impression that he was engaged in some kind of internal debate.</p> <p>\u201cMy grandfather says that when I\u2019m not busy screwing around I have a head for business,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cHe wants me to go to work for Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t want to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison Commercial is Gabe\u2019s baby. He\u2019s in charge, and that\u2019s the way it has to be. We get along okay, but I learned a few things about myself in the army. One of them was that I\u2019m not cut out to take orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo surprise there, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Rafe took one hand out of his pocket, scooped up a small stone, and sent it skipping out across the dark water of the bay. \u201cI want to do my own thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to work in a corporation or a bureaucracy either,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m going to open my own business as soon as I graduate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot it all planned, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely. But by the time I get out of college I should have most of the details nailed down. What about you? What\u2019s your chief objective?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo stay out of jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s certainly an impressive career goal. I\u2019ll bet you need to study for years and years and probably do an internship and a residency as well in order to achieve that objective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone I know seems to think that not ending up in prison will be a major accomplishment for me.\u201d He swung back around to look at her. \u201cWhat about you? What kind of business are you planning to open, Ms. Most Likely to Achieve?\u201d</p><p>She took a few steps across the pebbly beach and sank down on a rock. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. I\u2019m still researching possibilities. I\u2019ve been talking to my dad. He says that the secret is to carve out a small niche in the service sector. One that big companies can\u2019t fill because of their size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething along the lines of outcall massage, or maybe one of those private escort services?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the ads in the Yellow Pages. You know, the ones aimed at traveling businessmen and conventioneers. Discreet personal services offered in the privacy of your hotel room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, your sense of humor is as limited as your idea of an evening\u2019s entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you expect from a guy who doesn\u2019t have his Ph.D. ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much, obviously.\u201d She drew up her knees and wrapped her arms around them.</p><p>He moved to stand next to her rock. \u201cSorry. I shouldn\u2019t have teased you like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find your niche or whatever. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs marriage on your list of personal objectives?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him, startled. \u201cWell, yes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ll probably marry someone like the jerk, right?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI was never serious about Perry. He was just someone to have fun with this summer.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cNot that he turned out to be a lot of fun tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not Mr. Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet you\u2019ve got a long list of requirements that Mr. Right will have to meet before you agree to marry him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The dry question made her uncomfortable. \u201cSo, I know what I want in a husband. So what? Just because you don\u2019t make long-range plans doesn\u2019t mean everyone else has to play their life by ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Without warning, he dropped down onto the rock beside her. The movement was easy, almost catlike. \u201cTell me, what kind of hoops will Mr. Right have to jump through before you\u2019ll agree to marry him?\u201d</p><p>Stung, she held up one hand and ticked off the basics. \u201cHe\u2019ll be intelligent, well educated, a graduate of a good school, and successful in his field. He\u2019ll also be loyal, honorable, decent, and trustworthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo criminal record?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely no criminal record.\u201d She held up her other hand and continued down the list. \u201cHe\u2019ll be dependable, kind, sensitive, and capable of making a commitment. Someone I can talk to. Someone who shares my interests and goals. That\u2019s very important, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll also get along well with my family, love animals, and be very supportive of my career.\u201d</p><p>Rafe lounged back on his elbows. \u201cBut other than that, just an ordinary guy?\u201d</p><p>For some inexplicable reason his mockery hurt. \u201cYou think I\u2019m asking too much?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled faintly. \u201cGet real. The guy you\u2019re looking for doesn\u2019t exist. Or if he does, he\u2019ll have some fatal flaw that you didn\u2019t expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d She narrowed her eyes. \u201cHow about your Ms. Right? Got any idea of what she\u2019ll be like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Doubt if there is one. Not that it matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not interested in a monogamous commitment?\u201d she asked acidly.</p><p>\u201cNo, because the men in my family aren\u2019t much good when it comes to marriage. Figure the odds are against me getting lucky.\u201d</p> <p>She could hardly argue that point. His grandfather\u2019s four spectacularly failed marriages were common knowledge. Rafe\u2019s father, Sinclair, had had two wives before he had engaged in the tumultuous affair with his model that had produced his sons. The assumption was that if he had not died in the motorcycle accident, Sinclair would have racked up a string of divorces and affairs that would have made Mitchell\u2019s record pale in comparison.</p><p>\u201cMarriage should not be viewed as a lottery or a crap-shoot,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious step, and it should be treated in a logical, rational manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s that easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said it\u2019s easy. I said it should be approached with intelligence and sound common sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re teasing me again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFace it\u2014we Madisons don\u2019t usually do things that involve common sense. We probably lack that gene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that garbage. I\u2019m serious about this, Rafe. I refuse to believe that you can\u2019t change what you see as your destiny.\u201d</p><p>He slanted her an appraising glance. \u201cYou really think I could be the one to break the mold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to break it badly enough, yes, I really think you can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing. Who would have thought a Harte would be such a dreamer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, what are you going to do with your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he drawled, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that the cult and guru businesses are profitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet serious. You\u2019ve got your whole life ahead of you. Don\u2019t throw it away. Think about what you want. Make some concrete plans. Develop solid goals and then work toward them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think my present career objective is a worthy goal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaying out of jail is okay as far as it goes. But it\u2019s not enough, Rafe. You know it isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got at the moment.\u201d He glanced at his watch. The dial glowed in the moonlight. \u201cI think it\u2019s time that you went home.\u201d</p><p>Automatically she looked at her own watch. \u201cGood grief, it\u2019s after one. It\u2019s going to take at least half an hour to walk home from here. I\u2019ve got to get going.\u201d</p><p>He came up off the rock in a fluid movement. \u201cI\u2019ll walk with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes it is. I\u2019m a Madison and you\u2019re a Harte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if something were to happen to you between here and your place and your folks found out that I was the last guy to see you, I\u2019d get the blame, for sure.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnd maybe get tossed into jail by Chief Yates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And that would put a real crimp in the only viable career plan I\u2019ve got at the moment.\u201d</p><p>The broad, semicircular sweep of the bay began in the distance behind Hannah, near the treacherous waters of Hidden Cove. It ended somewhere up ahead in the darkness, at a jutting piece of land known as Sundown Point. There were no streetlamps on the long, curving bluff road that rimmed the restless waters of Eclipse Bay. The sparse lights of the pier, the marina, and the town\u2019s tiny business district lay more than two miles to the rear, in the direction of Hidden Cove.</p><p>Up ahead, Hannah could make out only a vast pool of darkness. Sundown Point was invisible in the all-enveloping night. She knew that a handful of cottages and homes were scattered along the heavily wooded bluffs, but she saw no illuminated windows. Her family\u2019s summer place was nearly a mile from here, perched over a small, sheltered cove. Her aunt\u2019s big house, Dreamscape, was at least another half mile beyond that.</p><p>It was, indeed, going to be a long walk.</p><p>She glanced back over her shoulder. The faint glare of a well-lit parking lot could be seen on the hillside. It emanated from a clearing in the trees above the town. The parking facility belonged to the Eclipse Bay Policy Studies Institute, a recently established think tank that had been built close to Chamberlain College.</p><p>\u201cMy parents are up there at the institute tonight,\u201d she said at one point, just for something to say. \u201cThey\u2019re attending the reception for Trevor Thornley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hotshot who\u2019s running for the state legislature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She was surprised that he was aware of Thornley\u2019s campaign. He didn\u2019t seem like the type who paid attention to politics. But she refrained from making that observation aloud. \u201cIt looks like the event is running late. I may even get home ahead of Mom and Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for you, hmm? You won\u2019t have to go into a lot of awkward explanations about why you came home with me instead of the jerk tonight.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, surprised. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them what happened in the morning.\u201d</p><p>He slapped his forehead with the heel of his palm. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I keep forgetting. I\u2019m with Ms. Goody Two-Shoes here. Of course you\u2019ll tell your parents that you spent the night on the beach with me.\u201d</p><p>Shock brought her to a sudden halt. \u201cI did not spend the night on the beach with you, Rafe Madison. And if you dare tell your friends down at the Total Eclipse Bar and Grill that I did, I swear I will... I will sue you. Or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to announce to the whole town that we did it under Eclipse Arch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not.\u201d She gripped her purse more tightly and started walking quicker. The sooner she got back to the house, the better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rafe fell into step beside her again. She was intensely aware of him. She had walked this road many times over the years, but never at this hour. Crime was minimal in Eclipse Bay, but not completely absent, especially during the summer when out-of-town visitors flocked to the beach. She was very glad to have company tonight. The long walk home alone would have been more than a little nerve-racking.</p><p>Half an hour later they reached the tree-lined drive that led to the Harte summer cottage. Rafe walked her to the porch steps and stopped.</p><p>\u201cThis is as far as I go,\u201d he said. \u201cGood night, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>She went up one step and paused. It struck her that the strange interlude was over. A wistful sensation trickled through her. She stomped on it with all the ruthlessness she could muster. It was okay to have a few romantic fantasies about Rafe Madison. He was the most notorious male in town, after all\u2014at least, the most notorious in her age group. But you couldn\u2019t get serious about a guy like this. There was no future in it.</p> <p>\u201cThanks for seeing me home,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Not like I had anything better to do tonight.\u201d In the yellow glare of the porch light his eyes were enigmatic pools. \u201cGood luck with that five-year plan of yours.\u201d</p><p>Impulsively she touched the sleeve of his jacket. \u201cThink about making some plans of your own Rafe. Don\u2019t screw up your whole life.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. Without warning he leaned forward and brushed a quick, stunningly chaste kiss across her mouth. \u201cA man\u2019s got to capitalize on his strong points, and I\u2019m so damn good at screwing up.\u201d</p><p>The brief, casual kiss caught her off guard. Heat infused her whole body. It was followed by a tingling sensation. She covered the awkward moment by hurrying up the rest of the front steps.</p> <p>At the door she paused to dig out her key. Her hand trembled slightly as she unlocked the door. When she finally got into the house, she turned to look back at Rafe. He was still standing there, watching her. She raised one hand in farewell and then quickly closed the door.</p><p>The rumble of voices awakened her the next morning. She opened her eyes and found herself gazing into a wall of fog.</p><p>Morning mist was a regular feature of summer and early fall. It would likely burn off by noon, although the cloud cover might last all day. With luck there would be enough scattered sunshine to drive the temperature into the mid-seventies in the afternoon, but that was the most that could be expected. Nobody came to Eclipse Bay to get a tan. Southern California beaches catered to those who liked to fry their bare skin in the glow of the big nuke in the sky. The wild, rugged beaches of the Oregon coast were for people who preferred to put on a windbreaker and brave the morning fog to explore tidal pools and rocky shoreline caves. They were for those who appreciated adventurous walks along high, windswept bluffs and views of seething seawater churning in stony cauldrons at the bottom of steep cliffs.</p><p>The voices downstairs grew louder. Her parents were talking to someone in the kitchen. A man. She could not make out the words, but the conversation sounded tense.</p><p>She listened for a while, curiosity growing swiftly. Who would come calling at this hour? Then she caught a name. Rafe Madison.</p><p>\u201cOh, damn.\u201d</p> <p>She tossed aside the covers, scrambled out of bed, and hurriedly pulled on her jeans and a gray turtleneck. She stepped into a pair of loafers, ran a brush through her hair, and headed for the stairs.</p><p>She found her parents at the kitchen table with a balding, heavy-bellied man she recognized instantly.</p><p>\u201cChief Yates.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Morning, Hannah.\u201d Phil Yates nodded in his ponderous fashion. He had been the only law enforcement in town for as long as Hannah could recall, but this was the first time he had ever come to the Harte cottage.</p><p>She masked her uneasiness with a bright smile and turned to her parents for an explanation. A single glance was enough to tell her that something was terribly wrong.</p><p>Elaine Harte\u2019s attractive face was tight with anxiety. Hampton\u2019s jaw was set in a grim line. A formless dread wafted through Hannah. It was as if a ghost had brushed up against her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked with an urgency that made her father\u2019s eyes narrow behind his glasses.</p><p>\u201cI was just about to come upstairs and wake you, dear,\u201d Elaine said quietly. \u201cChief Yates has some bad news.\u201d</p> <p>For one horrifying instant Hannah had a vision of Rafe lying sprawled on Bayview Drive, the victim of a hit-and-run. He\u2019d had an even longer walk home last night than she\u2019d had.</p><p>She went to the table and gripped the back of the empty chair. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaitlin Sadler was found dead at Hidden Cove this morning,\u201d her father said in somber tones.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d Not Rafe, then. He was safe. Hannah sank down into the chair. Then the name registered. \u201cKaitlin Sadler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like an accident,\u201d Yates said. \u201cApparently she fell from the path above the cliffs. But I\u2019ve got to ask you a few questions.\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice got Hannah\u2019s full attention. Rafe was okay, but his girlfriend was dead. It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out why Chief Yates had come here today. When a woman died under mysterious circumstances, the cops always came looking for the boyfriend or the husband first. Her brother had told her that.</p><p>Hamilton studied her with a troubled look. \u201cThere seems to be some confusion, Hannah. Phil says that Kaitlin was on a date with Rafe Madison last night. But Rafe told Yates that he was with you last night at about the time that Kaitlin died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe explained to Phil that that was not possible,\u201d Elaine said crisply. \u201cYou were with that nice young man from Chamberlain College. Perry Decatur.\u201d</p><p>Yates cleared his throat. \u201cWell, now, I talked to Mr. Decatur. He says that\u2019s not quite true.\u201d</p><p>Hamilton flicked an irritated glance at Yates\u2019s broad, patient face. \u201cWe also told him that even if you hadn\u2019t been with Decatur, you were highly unlikely to have been anywhere near Rafe Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of the fact that Hartes don\u2019t socialize with Madisons,\u201d Yates rumbled. \u201cBut young Rafe swears he was with Hannah here, and I got to check out his story.\u201d</p><p>The full implications of what he was saying finally hit Hannah. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. You just said Kaitlin\u2019s death was an accident. Is there some question about how she died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t rule out the possibility that she jumped.\u201d Yates wrapped one ham-size fist around a mug of coffee. \u201cThat girl always was kind of high-strung.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elaine frowned. \u201cShe comes from an unfortunate family situation, but I never heard anyone suggest that she might be suicidal.\u201d</p><p>Yates sipped his coffee. \u201cThere\u2019s another possibility.\u201d</p><p>They all looked at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cThere may have been an argument,\u201d Yates said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Elaine whispered. \u201cAre you saying she might have been pushed off the path?\u201d</p><p>Hannah planted her hands on the table \u201cWait a second. Are you suggesting that Rafe Madison killed Kaitlin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould have been an accident,\u201d Yates said. \u201cLike I said, maybe they got into a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s crazy. Why would Rafe do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord around town is that he didn\u2019t like the fact that she was seeing other men,\u201d Yates said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hamilton looked at her. \u201cRafe is trying to use you for an alibi, honey. I don\u2019t like him dragging you into this one damn bit. But I\u2019ll deal with that later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, listen to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now you just need to tell Yates where you were last night between midnight and two this morning.\u201d</p><p>Hannah braced herself for the explosion she knew would follow. \u201cI was with Rafe Madison.\u201d</p><p>Kaitlin Sadler\u2019s death was officially ruled an accident three days later. It took a lot longer for the firestorm of gossip to fade. The news that Hannah had been with Rafe Madison the night Kaitlin died swept through the small community with the force of a tsunami. Few believed for a moment that the pair had engaged only in casual conversation.</p> <p>The one person who seemed genuinely happy about the fact that Rafe and Hannah had spent two whole hours together on a moonlit beach was Hannah\u2019s great-aunt Isabel Harte.</p><p>At eighty-three, Isabel was the sole self-avowed romantic in the family. She was a retired professor of English lit who had never married. She lived alone at Dreamscape, the huge three-story mansion her father had built with the fortune he had made in fishing.</p><p>It was Isabel who had provided the seed funding for Harte-Madison, the commercial real estate development company founded by Sullivan Harte and Mitchell Madison all those years ago. The bitter feud that had destroyed the firm as well as the friendship between Sullivan and Mitchell was a source of frustration and disappointment to Isabel. She still harbored dreams of ending the rift that had shattered the partnership and ignited the hostility between the two men.</p><p>Hannah was very fond of her great-aunt. She was also well aware that her parents had been trying to get Isabel to sell Dreamscape and move into an apartment in Portland. But Isabel refused to budge.</p><p>On the fourth day of the seething rumors, Isabel sat with Elaine Harte in the Harte family kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so romantic,\u201d Isabel said, blithely indifferent to Elaine\u2019s exasperated expression. \u201cJust like Romeo and Juliet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Elaine gasped.</p><p>\u201cDarn right,\u201d Hannah said from the doorway. \u201cWe all know what happened to Romeo and Juliet. A very nasty ending, if you ask me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis would be Romeo and Juliet with the right ending,\u201d Isabel said, unperturbed. \u201cA happy conclusion that would end the long-standing feud between the two families.\u201d</p><p>Elaine raised her eyes to the heavens. \u201cSullivan and Mitchell are engaged in a feud, Isabel. The rest of us just ignore each other. Rafe Madison has no real interest in a nice girl like Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks, Mom.\u201d Hannah went to the counter to pour herself a cup of coffee. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just label me boring and be done with it?\u201d</p><p>Elaine gave her a repressive look. \u201cYou know perfectly well what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure do, Mom.\u201d Hannah made a face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re absolutely right. Rafe doesn\u2019t have any interest in me. I\u2019m not his type.\u201d</p><p>Isabel\u2019s vivid blue eyes brightened with interest. \u201cWhatever do you mean, dear?\u201d</p><p>Hannah smiled wryly. \u201cRafe thinks I\u2019m a prim, prissy, goody-goody overachiever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about him?\u201d Isabel asked quickly.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s wasting his life. Told him so, too. The only thing we had in common the other night when we ran into each other on the beach was the fact that we both had to walk home after a bad date. Trust me, seduction was the last thing on his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, almost no one in town believes that,\u201d Elaine said grimly. \u201cI\u2019m told that Kaitlin Sadler\u2019s brother believes far worse. He\u2019s convinced that Rafe really did shove Kaitlin over that cliff and later seduced you in an effort to persuade you to cover up for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cPoor Dell. He\u2019s lost his sister, and all everyone can talk about is how Rafe spent the night making wild, passionate love to me on the beach.\u201d</p><p>Isabel\u2019s eyes lit with speculative interest. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose that he actually did\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he did not,\u201d Hannah said brusquely. \u201cI told you, all we did was talk.\u201d</p><p>Elaine shook her head. \u201cI believe you, dear. And I\u2019m relieved to know that Rafe was nowhere near Kaitlin at the time she died. I just wish that he had found someone else to give him his alibi that night. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to be a long time before people stop talking about this unfortunate affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually it\u2019s kind of weird when you think about it,\u201d Pamela said the next day over veggie burgers and French fries at Snow\u2019s Caf\u00e9. \u201cI mean, what are the odds that either you or I would ever spend a couple of hours on a beach with a guy like Rafe Madison?\u201d</p><p>Hannah eyed her friend over the top of the bun. Pamela attended Chamberlain College. She had her sights set on a career teaching English literature to undergraduates. She already wore the uniform of the successful young academic: black tights, chunky black shoes, a long black skirt, a slouchy jacket, and glasses with thin frames. Her shoulder-length brown hair was held at her nape with a mock-tortoiseshell clip.</p><p>\u201cI admit the odds are not high.\u201d Hannah took a mouthful of her tofu burger. \u201cIt was just one of those things. I owe it all to Perry Decatur.\u201d</p><p>Pamela made a face. \u201cSo much for your mom\u2019s opinion of Perry. She was so sure he was the nice, upwardly mobile type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s definitely committed to upward mobility. Probably go far in the academic world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not a nice guy, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmooth. Slick.\u201d Hannah thought back to the scuffle in the front seat and shuddered. \u201cNot nice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pamela glanced around the crowded caf\u00e9. Apparently satisfied that no one could overhear, she leaned across the table and lowered her voice. \u201cSo what really did happen between you and Rafe Madison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I told you, we just talked. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Pamela\u2019s eyes clouded with disappointment. \u201cThat\u2019s all? Honest truth?\u201d</p><p>Hannah briefly considered the insignificant good-night kiss Rafe had given her. \u201cPretty much.\u201d</p> <p>Pamela flopped back in her chair. \u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Intelligent, educated, clearheaded women like us know better than to marry guys like Rafe Madison. But that doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t be fun to fool around with one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little hard on the reputation, especially in a town like Eclipse Bay. Trust me, I know this now. After those infamous two hours on the beach with Rafe Madison, my image as a nice girl has plummeted to somewhere in the vicinity of zero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe least you could have done for yourself was have a good time on the way down.\u201d</p> <p>Rafe phoned the day he left town. Hannah was alone in the house at the time. When she heard his voice on the other end of the line she had a feeling he knew that her parents had driven into Eclipse Bay together.</p><p>\u201cI owe you,\u201d he said without preamble.</p><p>\u201cNo, you do not owe me.\u201d She clutched the instrument very tightly. His voice was as sexy on the phone as it was at midnight on a shadowed beach. \u201cI just told the truth, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything that simple for you, Miss Voted Most Likely to Succeed? Black and white? True or false?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this case it is, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care that everyone in town thinks I did a lot more than hold your hand that night?\u201d</p> <p>She sought refuge in irrefutable fact. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even hold my hand.\u201d</p><p>There was a short beat of silence on the other end of the line. She wondered if he was thinking about that meaningless little kiss he had given her just before he sent her into the house. It was certainly on her mind.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cBut I still owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. No big deal. Besides, to be honest, I owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am no longer known around town as Miss Boring Goody Two-Shoes.\u201d</p><p>There was another beat of silence. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely not boring.\u201d</p><p>She was not sure what to say to that. She wrapped the cord around her hand and kept her mouth shut. It was an exercise in self-discipline.</p> <p>\u201cHannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said last night. Good luck with that five-year plan of yours. I hope things work out the way you want. Hope you do okay with your own business.\u201d He paused. \u201cHope you find a guy who meets all those requirements on that list, too.\u201d</p><p>He sounded sincere, she thought.</p><p>\u201cRafe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said to you that night, too. Get a life.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Portland, Oregon</p><p>The present...</p><p>The long, pearl-studded train of the creamy candlelight-satin wedding gown cascaded in graceful folds behind the bride as she glided to a halt in front of the altar. She smiled demurely at the groom through a gossamer cloud of veil. The organ music trailed off. A respectful hush fell. The minister cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s it for me,\u201d Hannah murmured to her assistant as they retreated to the portico in front of the church. \u201cI\u2019m out of here. You can handle the receiving line. The limo is ready. Keep an eye on the four-year-old nephew. He\u2019ll probably make another grab for the bride\u2019s train when she walks back down the aisle. See you at the reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so perfect.\u201d Carla Groves seized a tissue and dabbed at her eyes. She peeked back into the church. \u201cThe flowers, the candles. Everything. The bride looks as if she just stepped out of a fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you this, Carla, but you aren\u2019t going to last long in this business if you weep every time you send a bride up the aisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s so beautiful. Practically glowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Hannah snapped the lock on her briefcase. \u201cLooks even better this time than she did the last time. Probably because her budget was much larger. She did very well in the divorce settlement, you know. Had a great lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Carla rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re such a cynic, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I agree with you. Jennifer Ballinger does make a lovely bride. And a very profitable one for Weddings by Harte. This is her second marriage with us, and I have every expectation that in a couple of years she\u2019ll come back to this firm for her third. Nothing like a repeat customer, I always say.\u201d</p><p>At five-thirty that evening, Hannah stepped out of the elevator into a corridor decorated in shades of tasteful beige and walked down the hall toward the door of her apartment. Her footsteps were hushed by the thick, pale carpeting, but the door of the suite next to hers opened before she reached it.</p><p>Winston rushed out to greet her with as much enthusiasm as a properly bred Schnauzer considered appropriate to exhibit upon such occasions. As always, the sight of the small, elegant, salt-and-pepper dog hurrying toward her lowered Hannah\u2019s stress level by several degrees.</p><p>She smiled as she crouched to scratch Winston behind the ears. He gave a discreetly muffled whine, quivered with pleasure, and licked her hand.</p><p>\u201cHello, pal. Sorry I\u2019m late. Been a long day.\u201d</p><p>Winston looked up at her through a fringe of long, silvery lashes, understanding in his intelligent eyes.</p><p>Mrs. Blankenship struck her head around the edge of the door. \u201cOh, there you are, dear. Winston was starting to get a trifle anxious. How did the wedding go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing out of the ordinary. The usual number of snafus at the reception. The caterer turned up with a cheese tart instead of the asparagus canap\u00e9s that the bride had selected. The photographer helped himself to a couple of glasses of champagne and started to flirt with the bartender. The flower girl came very close to getting into a food fight with the four-year-old nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the usual, then.\u201d Mrs. Blankenship nodded wisely. She always loved to hear about the weddings. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure you nipped all the potential disasters in the bud behind the scenes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I get paid to do.\u201d Hannah leaned down to pat Winston, who bounced around her high heels. \u201cI think the bride was satisfied. As far as she was concerned, everything went off as if the whole thing had been staged by a computer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mrs. Blankenship pursed her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s an appropriate image, dear. The thought of a computer-generated wedding is really quite dreadful. It sounds so cold. Weddings are supposed to evoke all sorts of wonderful emotions, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Mrs. Blankenship, behind the scenes, a well-managed wedding has a lot in common with a launch of the space shuttle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, dear, I hate to mention this, but you\u2019ve become increasingly cynical ever since you ended your engagement last year. It\u2019s so sad to see a young, healthy, vibrant woman like you turn jaded. Maybe you took on too much when you signed up for all those evening classes at the college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Blankenship\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been working much too hard for the past year. Perhaps you need a vacation. Go someplace where you can relax and regain your interest in your business and your social life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no social life to revive, Mrs. Blankenship. And as for my career, nothing will ever make me starry-eyed about my business. The only weddings that I actually enjoy doing are those in which I know for a fact that the couple met through my sister\u2019s agency. At least I can feel reasonably confident that those marriages have a good chance of lasting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, your sister does have a knack for matchmaking, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d Mrs. Blankenship got a dreamy expression in her eyes. \u201cShe obviously has a wonderful sense of intuition when it comes to that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to disillusion you, Mrs. Blankenship, but Lillian uses a computer, not her intuition.\u201d Hannah dug her keys out of her massive shoulder bag. \u201cDoes Winston need a walk right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dear, we just got back from our walkies,\u201d Mrs. Blankenship said.</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Hannah went to her own door and unlocked it, Winston trotting eagerly at her heels. \u201cThanks again, Mrs. Blankenship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, dear.\u201d Mrs. Blankenship paused. \u201cYou know, you really should consider taking some time off. Your busy season is finished. You could slip away for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny you should mention that, Mrs. Blankenship. I was just thinking the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Blankenship beamed. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to hear that. You really haven\u2019t been quite the same since your engagement ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral people have mentioned that.\u201d Hannah opened her door. \u201cOne theory is that I have been possessed by an alien entity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever mind. Good night, Mrs. Blankenship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, dear.\u201d</p><p>Hannah stepped into the small hallway, waited until Winston came inside, and then swiftly shut the door. She flipped on the lights.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute to change, Winston. Then I\u2019ll find us both something to eat.\u201d</p><p>In the bedroom she stripped off the jacket and skirt of her blue business suit, then pulled on a pair of black leggings and a cozy cowl-necked tunic and slipped into a pair of ballet-style flats. Pausing for a moment in front of the mirror, she brushed her hair behind her ears and anchored it with a narrow band.</p><p>When she was ready, she padded back down the hall into the kitchen and dug one of the expensive, specially formulated dog bones out of a box for Winston. The Schnauzer took it very politely from her fingers.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy.\u201d</p><p>Winston needed no further urging. He set to work on the bone vigorously.</p> <p>Hannah opened the refrigerator and meditated on the sparse contents for a moment. After a while she removed a hunk of sheep\u2019s-milk feta cheese and a nearly empty bottle of Chardonnay.</p><p>She arranged her small haul on a tray and carried it into the second bedroom, where she maintained a home office. Winston followed, the remains of his bone wedged firmly between his jaws. Sinking down onto the high-backed chair, Hannah propped her feet on the corner of the desk and munched a cracker with some of the cheese on it.</p><p>Winston took up his customary position on the floor beside the desk chair. Muted crunching sounds ensued.</p><p>\u201cBrace yourself, Winston.\u201d Hannah reached for the phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to check my messages. Who knows what excitement awaits us?\u201d</p><p>The automated answering service surrendered three offerings. The first was from a florist, reporting that the orchids Hannah had ordered for the Cooke-Anderson wedding were going to cost more than expected.</p><p>\u201cI told the client that they would be expensive.\u201d</p><p>The second message was from her brother, Nick, letting her know that he had just mailed the manuscript of the most recent addition to his successful suspense series to the editor. \u201cI\u2019m taking Carson to Disneyland, and then we\u2019re going on down to Phoenix to see Sullivan and Rachel. Probably be gone for most of the month. You know how to reach me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time he married again,\u201d Hannah said to Winston. \u201cAmelia has been gone for three years now. He and little Carson have been alone long enough.\u201d</p><p>Winston jiggled his brows.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. I\u2019m a fine one to talk.\u201d</p><p>She punched the key for the last message... and nearly fell off her chair when she heard Rafe Madison\u2019s unmistakable, bottom-of-the-sea voice. Her heels came down off the desk with a small thud. She sucked in a half-strangled breath and sat forward abruptly. The Chardonnay sloshed wildly in the glass. Several drops went over the rim and hit Winston between his ears.</p><p>He looked up from his bone with a puzzled expression.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Winston.\u201d She grabbed a napkin and blotted the wine off the top of his head. \u201cI was a little stunned there for a second, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to faint or anything.\u201d</p><p>She tossed the napkin into the wastebasket, inhaled slowly, and took a steadying swallow of wine.</p><p>She had not heard his voice in eight years, and although this time around it was only a recording, it had the same impact on her tonight as it had the last time. Small flashes of electrical energy snapped through her nerve endings. Her stomach seemed to float in midair.</p><p>\u201cThis is Rafe Madison...\u201d</p><p>The last conversation she\u2019d had with him flitted through her mind. Good luck with that five-year plan of yours. I hope things work out the way you want.</p><p>She wondered if he\u2019d ever gotten his act together.</p><p>\u201c. . . Got the message you sent through your lawyer. The answer is no. Looks like we\u2019ve got a few things to talk about, and I don\u2019t plan to do it through our attorneys. See you in Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d The old memories went up in smoke and the present came crashing back. She stabbed the replay key. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c. . . The answer is no... . See you in Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>She had not misunderstood. His answer to her offer was loud and clear.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve got a problem, Winston.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the bombshell on her sister the following morning.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, he refuses to sell?\u201d Lillian demanded on the other end of the line. \u201cThat house belonged to our great-aunt, not his. He can\u2019t refuse to sell.\u201d</p><p>Hannah listened to the muffled sounds of a printer in the background. Lillian was hard at work. She ran her matchmaking firm, Private Arrangements, out of an office in a high-rise located only a few blocks away from the one in which Hannah and Winston lived.</p><p>\u201cYou were there when Isabel\u2019s will was read,\u201d Hannah reminded her wearily. \u201cShe left the house equally to Rafe and me. The lawyer says he can do whatever he wants to do with his half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Maybe you didn\u2019t offer him enough money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe negotiations didn\u2019t even get that far. I just sent a message to him through the lawyer telling him that I would be willing to buy out his half of the house. I expected him to come back with a price.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat on earth do you suppose he plans to do with half of Dreamscape?\u201d Lillian mused.</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d Hannah frowned at the array of wedding photos that decorated her office wall. \u201cBut I have plans for Dreamscape, and I\u2019m certainly not going to let him stand in my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to meet with him in Eclipse Bay, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like I\u2019ve got much choice. I want Dreamscape. Somehow I\u2019ve got to talk him out of his share of the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t heard much about Rafe in recent years. Just that he got married and divorced.\u201d</p><p>Hannah thought about her midnight conversation with Rafe. The men in my family aren\u2019t much good when it comes to marriage... . Figure the odds are against me getting lucky...</p> <p>\u201cDivorce is a Madison family tradition,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s a very common tradition for a lot of families these days.\u201d Lillian made a tut-tut sound. \u201cI don\u2019t know why so many people refuse to see the obvious. Marriage is a partnership. It should be entered into the same way one would go into any serious business arrangement. All the factors should be examined from every angle before a commitment is made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLillian\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a staggering amount of scientific evidence that suggests that couples who are properly matched using modern psychological tests and personality inventories are far more likely to succeed at marriage than those who let their emotions\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Lillian. I\u2019ve heard your professional pitch before, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. You know me. I get a little carried away sometimes.\u201d Lillian hesitated. \u201cAbout Rafe Madison\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019s changed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d Hannah rose, phone in hand, and went to the window. \u201cWonder if he achieved his big career objective?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know he had one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he had one, all right.\u201d Hannah studied the view of the bridge-studded Willamette River. \u201cHis great ambition was to stay out of jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven the direction in which everyone seemed to think he was headed eight years ago, that would have been a major accomplishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we would have heard if he had gone to prison.\u201d Hannah tightened her grip on the phone. \u201cThat kind of news would have been hot gossip in Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but as far as we know, he hasn\u2019t been back to Eclipse Bay very often since Kaitlin Sadler died. According to Mom and Dad, he makes a couple of short weekend visits to see his grandfather every few months and that\u2019s it. How would anyone know if he\u2019d done time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he was too smart to end up in prison,\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>\u201cSmart does not always equate with common sense. We\u2019re both in the marriage business. We see smart people do dumb things every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>Lillian paused. \u201cYou\u2019re still serious about your plans for Dreamscape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that. My advice is don\u2019t let Rafe know you\u2019ve got your heart set on turning Dreamscape into an inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Lillian made an exasperated sound. \u201cUse your head. If he figures out just how badly you want the place, he\u2019ll hold out for a whopping price for his half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful how much I say. I\u2019m a Harte, remember? I can be cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that,\u201d Lillian said dryly. \u201cYou know, something tells me that it\u2019s a good thing that Mom and Dad went on that monthlong cruise. If they knew that you were getting ready to go toe-to-toe with Rafe Madison over Dreamscape, they\u2019d descend on Eclipse Bay like avenging angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of family interference, I\u2019m counting on you to keep quiet about my decision to go to Eclipse Bay for a while. I want some time to work things out with Rafe. That won\u2019t be possible if I\u2019m inundated with helpful Hartes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep quiet,\u201d Lillian sighed. \u201cI still can\u2019t imagine what Aunt Isabel was thinking. Ever since Rafe used you as his alibi for the night Kaitlin Sadler died, she was obsessed with the notion that the two of you were the Romeo and Juliet of the Harte-Madison feud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe didn\u2019t use me as his alibi,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cI was his alibi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>The weird part was that he had never intended to come back for more than an occasional overnight stay, just the obligatory duty visits to check up on Mitchell. Now he was determined to carve out his future here in Eclipse Bay.</p><p>Go figure.</p><p>Rafe propped one sneaker-clad foot on the bottom rail of the second-story veranda that wrapped around the big house. He braced his elbows on the top rail and watched the sporty little lipstick-red Honda turn into the long drive.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t had a lot of ambitions eight years ago. He\u2019d only known that he had to stop screwing up. Something of a challenge, given where he was coming from. He\u2019d achieved his primary objective, he thought, as he watched the rakish red car come closer. He\u2019d managed to stay out of jail. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wondered if Hannah would be impressed.</p><p>The crimson vehicle came to a halt next to his silver Porsche. An intense rush of anticipation swept through him. He watched the door on the driver\u2019s side of the Honda open.</p><p>The first thing he noticed when Hannah got out of the car was that her amber-brown hair was shorter. Eight years ago it had fallen well below her shoulders. Today it was cut in a sleek, sophisticated curve that angled along the line of her jaw.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look as if she had gained any weight in the intervening years, but there was something different about her figure. The black trousers and snug-fitting black top she wore revealed a fit, lithe body with a small waist, gently flared hips, and discreetly curved br**sts. It took him a few seconds to decide that the difference was the sophisticated confidence with which she carried herself. She had seemed painfully young and na\u00efve that night on the beach. Still a girl in some ways. She was a woman now.</p> <p>She paused, holding the car door open, and leaned down slightly to speak to someone in the front seat. From his vantage point on the upper veranda he could not see who had accompanied her. Sharp disappointment gripped him. For some reason he had assumed that she would be alone. What the hell had he expected? He\u2019d heard that her engagement had blown up a year ago, but that was no reason to think she hadn\u2019t gotten serious about someone else in the meantime.</p><p>The passenger door did not open. Instead, Hannah stepped back to allow an elegantly trimmed gray Schnauzer to bound out of the car.</p><p>Relief whipped through Rafe. Not a boyfriend, after all. Just a mutt. He could handle a dog.</p><p>Sensing Rafe\u2019s presence on the veranda, the Schnauzer came to a sudden halt and looked up at him. Rafe waited for the little beast to start yapping wildly in typical froufrou-dog style. But the Schnauzer did not bark. Instead, he gazed up at Rafe with an air of watchful stillness.</p><p>Okay, so maybe this was not a totally froufrou dog.</p> <p>Hannah looked up to see what had captured her dog\u2019s attention. The light of the late-afternoon sun glinted on her stylish sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cHello, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>That cool reserve hadn\u2019t been in her voice eight years ago, he thought.</p><p>\u201cBeen a while,\u201d he said neutrally.</p><p>\u201cYes, it has,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering, did you ever get a life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on your definition. What about you? The five-year plan turn out the way you expected?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d She moved one hand in a graceful gesture to indicate the big house. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be difficult about his, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHad a feeling you would.\u201d</p><p>She went up the front steps and disappeared into the house. The Schnauzer gave Rafe one last, assessing look and followed Hannah inside.</p><p>He found her standing in the solarium, arms folded beneath her br**sts. She smiled coolly, but her shoulders were angled. She was braced for battle. When Rafe walked into the glass-walled room, the Schnauzer glanced up from an exploration of a potted palm.</p><p>\u201cNice dog.\u201d Rafe crouched and held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Winston,\u201d Hannah said crisply.</p><p>\u201cHello, Winston.\u201d</p> <p>With great dignity, the Schnauzer crossed the tiled floor to where Rafe waited and sniffed politely. Apparently satisfied that the proprieties had been observed, he sat back on his haunches and looked up at Hannah.</p><p>Rafe got to his feet. \u201cI think your dog likes me.\u201d</p><p>She did not look pleased. \u201cWinston is always well behaved. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it if I were you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Maybe he\u2019s waiting until my back is turned to go for my throat. How long have you had him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of years.\u201d</p><p>Rafe nodded. \u201cOutlasted your fianc\u00e9, huh? Lucky dog.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth tightened. \u201cI\u2019m not here to talk about Winston or my ex-fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall all over yourself.\u201d</p><p>She trailed after him down the hall into the big, old-fashioned kitchen. Winston trotted briskly at her heels, pausing here and there to investigate a corner or a piece of furniture.</p><p>\u201cHow did you hear about my engagement?\u201d Hannah asked. Irritation made the question as brittle as thin ice.</p><p>\u201cYou know how gossip travels between the Hartes and the Madisons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, Aunt Isabel told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He set the kettle on the stove. \u201cSent me a note right after the breakup. She seemed delighted. Guess Mr. Right fell a little short in her view.\u201d</p><p>Hannah watched him intently. \u201cHow long have you been here at Dreamscape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot in late last night.\u201d He spooned coffee into the tall glass pot.</p><p>She glanced at the French press coffeemaker he was using. \u201cIsabel never made her coffee in one of those. She always used a regular drip machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is mine. I brought it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She eyed the gleaming stainless-steel vegetable steamer on the counter. \u201cThat\u2019s not Isabel\u2019s either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she walked to the pantry and opened the door. He knew what she saw inside. The supplies he had brought with him included several boxes of his favorite brand of dried pasta in a variety of shapes, a bottle of twelve-year-old balsamic vinegar, and a package of capers preserved in salt. There was also a supply of dried herbs and chiles and some French lentils.</p><p>Hannah closed the pantry door very firmly. \u201cYou\u2019ve certainly made yourself right at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Half this place is mine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLillian was right,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what Isabel was thinking when she made out her will.\u201d</p><p>He poured boiling water into the pot. \u201cYou know damn well what she was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d</p><p>He set the kettle down. \u201cWith a more upbeat ending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am prepared to make you a fair-market offer for your share of Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d He smiled slightly. \u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze across the width of the kitchen. There was steel in her eyes. \u201cDo you intend to make me an offer for my half?\u201d</p><p>He lounged against the counter. \u201cAre you open to one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have plans for Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence. So do I.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a speculative look. \u201cLooks like we have a problem.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThink so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long are you going to stay here in Eclipse Bay?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and turned back to finish the coffee. \u201cAs long as it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can afford to just drop everything and move back here to Eclipse Bay for an unspecified period of time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing holding me in San Diego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019ve been all these years?\u201d Her tone was one of unwilling curiosity.</p><p>Just had to ask, he thought. As if she couldn\u2019t help herself. Good sign. Maybe.</p><p>\u201cFor the most part,\u201d he said easily.</p><p>He pressed the plunger down to trap the grounds in the bottom of the pot. Then he glanced at Hannah over his shoulder. She was watching him with an enigmatic expression.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he prodded softly. \u201cHow long do you intend to stay here in Eclipse Bay?\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cFor as long as it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are three floors. Plenty of bedrooms and baths. Take your pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I think I\u2019ll use my folks\u2019 place,\u201d she said coolly.</p> <p>What had he expected? That would have been too easy, anyway. Nothing ever came easy to him. He had a talent for doing things the hard way.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is Eclipse Bay. You\u2019re a Harte and I\u2019m a Madison, and by now everyone knows Isabel left Dreamscape to both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, people are going to talk, regardless of where you choose to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She watched him pour the coffee. When he handed her the mug, her fingers brushed against his. He savored the small thrill, wondered if she felt anything at all.</p><p>She turned away a little too quickly and paced to the far end of the counter.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back into the solarium.\u201d He led the way out of the kitchen. \u201cWe can sit down out there.\u201d</p><p>Hannah said nothing, but she trailed after him. He watched her settle neatly onto a cushioned white wicker lounger. Winston sauntered into the sunroom, found a satisfactory place near the window, and flopped down on his belly. He rested his muzzle on his front paws and watched Rafe through feathery brows.</p> <p>Hannah turned the mug between her palms. \u201cWhat exactly do you plan to do with Dreamscape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to open an inn and restaurant.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. She stared at him, her eyes widening in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to do what?\u201d Somewhere between a screech and a choking sound.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d she sputtered. \u201cThat\u2019s my plan. At least, the inn part is my plan.\u201d She hesitated, frowning. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about adding a restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have thought about it. The reputation of any hotel is greatly enhanced by a high-quality restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense, but as I recall, your idea of a high-class establishment when you lived here was the Total Eclipse Bar and Grill. I seriously doubt that any place that uses the slogan Where the sun don\u2019t shine is going to show up in your better grade of guidebook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Total Eclipse has its place in the grand scheme of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it.\u201d She eyed him. \u201cJust what do you know about running an inn and a restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked at a five-star place down in San Diego for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrific.\u201d She gave him an icy look. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked in a hotel, so you think you can run one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m stronger in the food-and-beverage area than I am on the innkeeping side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do at this five-star place in San Diego? Wait tables?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about you? Know anything about the innkeeping business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019ve been taking intensive classes in hotel management for nearly a year. Ever since I got the idea of turning Dreamscape into an inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? And just where did you get the brilliant notion of converting this place into a hotel?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cAunt Isabel and I started talking about it a year ago.\u201d</p><p>He whistled softly. \u201cWhat an astonishing coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me.\u201d Hannah\u2019s jaw was very tight now. \u201cShe mentioned the idea to you at about the same time, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Hannah tapped a neatly manicured nail against the side of her glass. \u201cLet me make something very clear. This isn\u2019t an impulse or a flash-in-the-pan idea for me. I\u2019ve done a lot of thinking and planning during the past year. I\u2019ve made my decision. I\u2019m going to sell Weddings by Harte and open this inn. I\u2019m absolutely committed to this project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get real here. Sooner or later we\u2019re going to have to come to some agreement about what to do with Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>He settled deeper into his chair and looked out over the bay. \u201cI\u2019m in no rush.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a frozen smile. \u201cI noticed.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Snow\u2019s Caf\u00e9 had changed little in eight years. Whenever she stepped inside, Hannah always felt as if she had entered a time warp. The colorful posters on the walls were always the same\u2014a mix of classic rock band ads and pithy sayings that reflected the conspiracy theories of the owner, Arizona Snow. The large one over the cash register summed up Arizona\u2019s worldview. The illustration showed two bug-eyed space aliens in heavy-metal attire. They were armed with futuristic weaponry. The slogan underneath read, We\u2019re from the government and we\u2019re here to help.</p><p>The caf\u00e9 was the main hangout for the faculty and students of nearby Chamberlain College. The Eclipse Bay Policy Studies Institute was not far away, but the think tank staff tended to avoid Snow\u2019s. It was no secret that since the day the institute had opened its doors Arizona had viewed the facility with deep suspicion. She was convinced that whatever was going on there constituted a dangerous threat to all those who cherished a free society.</p><p>\u201cOver here, Hannah.\u201d Pamela\u2019s face lit up in welcome. Pamela McCallister was now on the faculty of the English department at Chamberlain, and over the years her upwardly mobile path through the thorny territory of higher education had been marked by subtle but highly significant changes of fashion. She still wore a lot of black, but there was less of the romantic poetess about her now and more of the trendy professional. Her hair was much shorter, marking her shift from student to faculty status. The voluminous bag she carried was made of much more expensive material than the one she had favored eight years ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d Hannah gave her a quick hug before sliding into the booth across from her. \u201cI stopped by Dreamscape, and then I had to take my dog and my luggage to my folks\u2019 cottage.\u201d</p><p>Pamela gave her a knowing look. \u201cYou\u2019re not staying at Dreamscape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe got there ahead of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard his car was seen parked in the drive all last night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s definitely taken up residence.\u201d Hannah snapped the well-worn, plastic-coated menu out of the slot behind the napkin holder. \u201cI think he\u2019s working on the premise that possession is nine-tenths of the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well.\u201d Pamela looked deeply intrigued. \u201cThis is going to be interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed. Can\u2019t wait to see how it plays out.\u201d Pamela\u2019s eyes gleamed behind the lenses of her glasses. \u201cAnd just think, the whole town will be watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad everyone else finds this mess so amusing.\u201d Hannah glanced at the menu and saw that it hadn\u2019t changed in eight years, either. It still featured the same eclectic but curiously inspired assortment of vegetarian burgers, French fries, pizzas, quesadillas, and noodle dishes. \u201cI can assure you that from where I\u2019m sitting, there\u2019s nothing remotely entertaining about it. Rafe made it clear this afternoon that he\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe always was a problem, as I recall.\u201d Pamela propped her elbows on the yellow Formica tabletop and rested her chin on her folded hands. \u201cSo, tell me. Has he changed much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s driving a Porsche these days instead of a motorcycle, but as far as I can tell, he still has no visible means of support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Hannah looked up sharply from the menu. \u201cWhat does \u2018hmm\u2019 mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been some talk that he might have been dabbling in a few less-than-legal activities during the past eight years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. You think I\u2019m sharing Aunt Isabel\u2019s inheritance with a gangster?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one\u2019s really sure, you understand. But you\u2019ve got to admit, the Porsche is a little hard to explain.\u201d</p><p>Hannah thought about that for a few seconds. \u201cWell, one thing\u2019s for certain. Whatever he\u2019s been up to in the past few years, he still views me as a prissy overachiever. Not exactly the basis for a lasting relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s talking duration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse to allow you to live out your prurient fantasies vicariously through me, Pam.\u201d Hannah sighed. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll know soon enough whether or not he\u2019s changed. If he starts spending his evenings down at the Total Eclipse, I\u2019ll get a very big clue, won\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that would be a hint, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s change the subject.\u201d Hannah dropped the menu on the table. \u201cBrad and the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids are great.\u201d Pamela\u2019s eyes softened and lit up with enthusiasm. \u201cI promised them you\u2019d come to dinner soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there with bells on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd Brad? Did he get that joint appointment at the institute yet?\u201d</p><p>Pamela\u2019s smile faded. \u201cWe thought we were going to have some excellent news on that front to announce later this month. But now we\u2019re not so sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething go wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that. The something is named Perry Decatur. As far as we can tell, he\u2019s the one blocking the appointment. He\u2019s been jealous of Brad for years. Probably afraid that if Brad joins the staff at the institute, he\u2019ll be put in the shade.\u201d</p><p>Hannah sat back in surprise. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Perry worked at the institute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you. He left his position at Chamberlain six months ago. His title is Vice President of Finance and Administration. Brings in big donors. Everyone assumes he\u2019s got his eye on becoming director one of these days.\u201d</p><p>Hannah shook her head in wry disgust. \u201cPerry always was a fast talker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever thought you\u2019d come back here for good.\u201d Jed Steadman sat forward in the wicker chair and clasped his hands lightly between his knees. \u201cFigured that with the way things were between you and your grandfather, you\u2019d want to stay clear of Eclipse Bay as much as possible.\u201d</p><p>Rafe stacked his feet on the railing, rocked back in his chair, and took a swallow of beer from the bottle he had brought from the kitchen. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned in the past eight years: Never say never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you.\u201d Jed watched a seagull ride a current of air above the cliffs. \u201cLife takes some twists and turns sometimes. I thought I\u2019d be long gone by now myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Your big plan was to get a job as a foreign correspondent with one of the big-city dailies. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man has to be flexible or he\u2019ll miss out on some incredible opportunities. When Ed Bolton said he would sell the Journal to me a few years ago, I jumped at the chance. As editor and owner, I get to run my own show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot to be said for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right.\u201d Jed slanted him a sidelong glance. \u201cJudging by the Porsche outside, you\u2019ve done okay for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Rafe took another swallow of beer. \u201cManaged to stay out of jail.\u201d</p><p>Jed gave a short bark of laughter. \u201cAlmost forgot. Not doing time behind bars was your big career objective, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Rafe raised the beer bottle in a mocking salute. \u201cAnd here I am today, a resounding success in my chosen field. A lesson for wayward youth across this great land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what is your chosen field?\u201d Jed\u2019s eyes glinted with curiosity. \u201cNo offense, but I never heard that you ever actually got yourself what folks like to call a real job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed.\u201d Jed watched him intently. \u201cThere\u2019s talk going around that you maybe found some, shall we say, unconventional ways to accomplish that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting to sound like a reporter, Jed.\u201d</p><p>Jed held up his hands, palms out. \u201cOkay, I get the point. No more questions in that area. Can\u2019t blame me for asking. I am in the newspaper business, after all.\u201d</p><p>They sat in companionable silence for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cHeard you and Connie split up a couple of years ago,\u201d Rafe said eventually. \u201cSorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d Jed glanced down at his clasped hands and then looked up. \u201cShe went back to Seattle. Couldn\u2019t take small-town life. She\u2019s remarried.\u201d</p><p>Rafe settled deeper into his chair. \u201cI didn\u2019t do any better with marriage myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you even gave it a whirl. You always said you wouldn\u2019t be any good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurned out I was right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne thing you should know,\u201d Jed said quietly after a while. \u201cDell Sadler still thinks you pushed his sister over that cliff. You might want to stay out of his way while you\u2019re here in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What are friends for?\u201d Jed looked down the length of the broad front porch that encircled the mansion. \u201cWhat are you going to do with this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen an inn and a restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew!\u201d Jed was clearly impressed. \u201cTalk about big plans! Gonna cost a bundle, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Hannah stood on the rocky beach below the Harte cottage and watched Winston chase seagulls in Dead Hand Cove. The tide was still out this morning. The five tall, finger-shaped stones that had given the cove its name thrust upward from the wet sand in a pattern that was eerily reminiscent of the outflung hand of a corpse. Or so she and Nick and Lillian had concluded years ago. When the tide came in a few hours from now, all but the very tip of the forefinger would be submerged.</p><p>The cove had been a favorite playground for all three Hartes in their youth. In addition to the macabre rock formation, it boasted an intricate network of small caves in the cliffs that framed the tiny beach. Together with Nick and Lillian, Hannah had spent hours exploring the rocky passages. The caves weren\u2019t dangerously deep or convoluted, and they had made excellent hiding places for adventurous children.</p><p>Out in the cove, Winston dashed off after another seagull. He was certainly enjoying the stay in Eclipse Bay, Hannah thought. What surprised her was that she was strangely content also, in spite of the looming problem of Rafe Madison.</p><p>She and Winston had been here for the better part of a week, but she was no closer to resolving the sticky situation involving Dreamscape than she had been that first afternoon. Rafe refused even to discuss the possibility of selling his share of the mansion. A war of nerves was taking shape. They couldn\u2019t go on like this indefinitely, she told herself. Sooner or later one of them would have to make a move toward ending the impasse.</p> <p>Out on the sand, Winston found a piece of driftwood, seized it in his jaws, and pranced triumphantly back toward Hannah. Halfway across the cove he came to a sudden halt and looked up toward the cliff path.</p><p>Simultaneously a whisper of awareness tingled through Hannah. She sensed Rafe\u2019s presence just before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cNice to see that Winston doesn\u2019t stand on formality all the time,\u201d he said.</p><p>Hannah braced herself for the little shock of excitement she always got when she first encountered him. She turned and saw that he had reached the bottom of the path. He came toward her with that supple masculine grace that was so much a part of him.</p><p>Time had not refined Rafe. The cool, savvy intelligence in his green eyes was more intense and more dangerous\u2014the result of hard experience, no doubt. The bold, sharp planes and angles of his lean face had always had a strict cast, but the years had added an aura of brooding asceticism.</p><p>He had left behind the few traces of young manhood that had still clung to him that night on the beach. Nevertheless, for some reason he actually looked better than ever in a pair of jeans. Beneath the tautly stretched fabric of the black, long-sleeved T-shirt he wore, his shoulders seemed broader and stronger. His stomach was still very flat.</p><p>What was the matter with her? she wondered. For eight years she had excused herself for her small, youthful, short-lived crush on Rafe Madison. After all, he had been the bad boy of Eclipse Bay, and he had once walked her home after midnight. That was enough to induce a few lusty imaginings in any healthy young woman. But she was far too mature for that sort of romantic nonsense now. Wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>She had never admitted the crush to anyone, of course\u2014not even Lillian, although she suspected that her sister had guessed the truth. She had a right to her private little fantasies, she told herself. And it wasn\u2019t as if she had spent the past few years wondering what she had missed. In fact, she had all but forgotten Rafe Madison until Isabel\u2019s lawyer had called to give her the news about the will.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Rafe. Fancy meeting you here. Come to talk about Dreamscape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make it a policy not to talk business before noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you talk about it much after noon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if I feel real energetic.\u201d He leaned down to greet Winston. \u201cI\u2019m on my way into town to check the mail. Thought I\u2019d see if you and the mutt wanted to go along.\u201d</p><p>Her first reaction was surprise. This was the first overture of any kind that he had made since the initial confrontation at Dreamscape. Maybe he was going to blink first.</p><p>Or maybe she ought to be very, very careful.</p><p>On the other hand, sooner or later they had to start communicating.</p><p>\u201cI do need to do some grocery shopping,\u201d she said warily.</p><p>\u201cMight as well go into town together.\u201d He gave her an unreadable smile. \u201cGive the good folk of Eclipse Bay a thrill.\u201d</p><p>She held her blowing hair out of her eyes and peered at him closely. She could not tell if he was joking.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said finally.</p><p>He startled her with a fleeting grin. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I always admired about you. You were never afraid of the Big Bad Wolf.\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand toward Winston. \u201cThese days I\u2019ve got my own wolf.\u201d</p><p>Rafe eyed Winston with an assessing expression. \u201cFive will get you ten that I can take the dog with one hand tied behind my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it, tough guy.\u201d</p><p>An hour later Hannah emerged from Fulton\u2019s Supermarket with a sack in each arm. She looked down the rows of pickups and SUVs parked in the small lot and saw the silver Porsche. Rafe had collected the mail and was waiting for her. He lounged against a gleaming fender, arms folded. A pair of mirrored sunglasses added to the gangster look.</p><p>Winston stood on his hind legs in the driver\u2019s seat, front paws braced against the edge of the door, nose thrust through the open window. It warmed Hannah\u2019s heart to see that he was watching for her return. You could always count on your dog. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was halfway back to the Porsche when, to her astonishment, Rafe gave her a cool, arrogant smile. Very deliberately he uncrossed his arms and reached out to scratch Winston behind the ears.</p><p>It was glaringly evident that Winston did not object. Hannah saw a pink tongue emerge to lick Rafe\u2019s hand. Irritation shot through her. Winston never got chummy with strangers, especially male strangers. Winston had standards.</p><p>Somehow, during the short time that she had been inside the grocery store, Rafe had co-opted her dog.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p> <p>She quickened her steps, so intent on the spectacle of Winston and Rafe\u2019s buddy-bonding that she never saw the big man who had climbed out of a battered pickup until he was directly in her path.</p><p>\u201cHeard you and Madison were back in town,\u201d Dell Sadler said. \u201cCome back to screw on the beach for old times\u2019 sake?\u201d</p><p>Hannah skidded to a halt, barely avoiding a collision. But the abrupt stop sent a shudder through her that dislodged her grip on one of the grocery sacks, and it slipped out of her grasp. She heard an ominously squishy thud. The tomatoes, she thought. Luckily the eggs were in the other bag.</p><p>\u201cHello, Dell,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>She knew very little about Dell Sadler other than that he operated a towing service and a body shop on the outskirts of Eclipse Bay. He was a heavily built man in his late thirties with thinning hair and beefy hands. There had always been a grim, morose air about him, as though he had found life to be a serious disappointment and did not expect matters to improve.</p> <p>\u201cYou two got a lot of gall coming back here after what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, Dell\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stepped toward her, hands balled into fists. \u201cThink I\u2019d be gone by now? Or that I\u2019d forget what happened to Kaitlin? Or don\u2019t you even give a damn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a good place to talk.\u201d With an effort she kept her voice calm and soothing. \u201cMaybe some other time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because everyone else in this town bought that story about you and Rafe Madison getting it on at the beach the night my sister died, don\u2019t think I did. I know damn well he killed her and you lied for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, and I think that deep down inside you know it.\u201d Hannah took a cautious step back, preparing to dart around him. \u201cPlease get out of my way.\u201d</p> <p>He thrust his face forward, raised a hand, and stabbed a finger at her chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you tell me what to do. Maybe everyone else around here kowtows to you Hartes, but I sure as hell don\u2019t. Far as I\u2019m concerned, you and Madison are both scum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened to Kaitlin,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cEveryone was. But I promise you, Rafe had nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have screwed you silly to get you to cover for him the way you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re back in town on account of that big house. Word is Madison wants the whole place for himself. Probably thinks if he does you long enough and hard enough, you\u2019ll turn over your share.\u201d</p><p>Hannah retreated again, clutching her one remaining sack of groceries. She came up hard against the unyielding fender of a big SUV. Dell closed in on her.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way,\u201d she said very steadily, preparing to make a run for Rafe\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m good and ready. I want you to know something. I won\u2019t ever\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Dell broke into a yelp as a hand locked on his shoulder from behind.</p><p>Rafe used the grip to spin Sadler neatly out of Hannah\u2019s path. With seemingly little effort, he pinned the big man to the door of the pickup.</p><p>Simultaneously, Hannah heard a low, fierce growl. She glanced down and saw Winston. The Schnauzer stood braced in front of Dell Sadler.</p><p>\u201cShe asked you to get out of the way, Sadler,\u201d Rafe said in a very soft voice.</p><p>\u201cScrew you, you sonofabitch. You killed Kaitlin, I know you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill Kaitlin. I had no reason to kill her. If you ever decide you want to talk about it, come and see me. But don\u2019t bother Hannah again. She had nothing to do with what happened to your sister.\u201d</p><p>Dell scowled. \u201cTake your hands off me, you bastard.\u201d</p><p>Rafe shrugged, released him, and stepped back. He scooped up the sack of groceries that Hannah had dropped and took her arm.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said.</p><p>She did not argue. They walked quickly back to the Porsche, Winston marching beside them. When Rafe opened the door, the Schnauzer jumped into the small space behind the seats. He kept his nose close to Hannah as Rafe switched on the ignition.</p><p>Hannah was acutely aware of several curious onlookers. \u201cThat little scene will keep tongues wagging for a day or two.\u201d</p><p>Rafe drove out of the small lot onto Bayview Drive. \u201cTold you we\u2019d give the folks a thrill.\u201d</p><p>A short silence fell. Hannah opened her purse and found her sunglasses. She put them on. Winston licked her ear. She stroked him soothingly.</p><p>\u201cTwo-timer,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI saw you licking Rafe\u2019s hand earlier.\u201d</p><p>Winston rested his chin on her shoulder and sighed in content.</p><p>\u201cYour dog and I decided not to duel at dawn after all,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>\u201cYou both chickened out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe prefer to think of it as a negotiated settlement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Translated, I think that means that neither of you was willing to exert yourself to do battle in my honor.\u201d</p><p>Rafe glanced at her, his gaze unreadable behind the shield of his sunglasses. \u201cWhen a guy reaches a certain age, he has to pick and choose his battles. I think it\u2019s called getting smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuses, excuses.\u201d She peeked into the sack that had landed on the pavement. As she had suspected, the tomatoes were little more than pulp inside the plastic vegetable bag. The lettuce and mushrooms looked badly bruised too. \u201cSo much for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Rafe said nothing for a moment. He drove with easy skill, but he seemed to be concentrating on the road with an unnecessary degree of attention.</p><p>\u201cGot an idea,\u201d he said after a while.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you and Winston eat at my place tonight? I\u2019ve got plenty of food.\u201d</p><p>Another overture? Maybe he really was weakening. She tried not to look too eager.</p><p>\u201cSeeing as how there isn\u2019t much that\u2019s very exciting in the other sack of groceries, I believe I can speak for both Winston and myself when I say that we\u2019d be pleased to take you up on that offer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay. Fine. It\u2019s settled.\u201d</p><p>She watched him out of the corner of her eye. \u201cYou appeared to have some hesitation in putting forth your invitation. Was it such a big deal to ask me over to dinner?\u201d</p><p>He flexed his hands on the chunky steering wheel. \u201cHad to work up my courage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was afraid you\u2019d turn me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d She gave what she hoped was a very blas\u00e9 sort of shrug. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to talk about our mutual business problem sooner or later. Might as well be tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t planning to talk about the house tonight.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. \u201cWhat do you plan to discuss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld times, maybe?\u201d</p> <p>She contemplated that for a moment. Then she gently cleared her throat. \u201cYou and I have only one incident between us that could conceivably be classified as old times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But you\u2019ve got to admit it was a hell of an incident. I could have gone to jail if it hadn\u2019t been for you. That would have really messed up my big career plan. I told you that day I called to say good-bye that I owed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill feel that way?\u201d She smiled sweetly. \u201cSell me your half of the house and we\u2019ll call it even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot feeling quite that grateful,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rafe walked back into the solarium just as the September sky finally faded all the way to black. Hannah noticed that he did not turn on any lights. Winston, flat on his belly on the floor, looked up hopefully but lost interest when he saw the two snifters Rafe carried.</p><p>Rafe lowered himself into the wicker lounger next to Hannah and handed one of the glasses to her.</p> <p>She watched the darkness settle over the bay and thought about the arugula, beet, blue cheese, and walnut salad and the pasta she had just finished. Rafe had glazed the walnuts with a little sugar and salt and heated them in the oven before adding them to the salad. The pasta had been flavored with an incredibly rich truffle-infused olive oil. A taste of heaven.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so you can cook,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMan\u2019s gotta have a hobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you on that.\u201d She took a sip of brandy. \u201cFor the record, you can fix dinner for me anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll remember that.\u201d He cradled his snifter in both hands and gazed out the windows into the deepening night. \u201cSorry about that scene with Dell Sadler this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends how you look at the situation, I think. If you hadn\u2019t been with me the night Kaitlin died, you wouldn\u2019t have had the run-in with Sadler today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there is that.\u201d She was very conscious of him sitting there, not more than a few inches away. The darkness intensified the sense of intimacy. \u201cAbout that night\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He took a sip of brandy and waited.</p><p>\u201cWe never really talked about it.\u201d She drew a breath and took the plunge. \u201cYou knew Kaitlin as well as anyone. What do you think happened? Do you think she committed suicide? Or was it an accident?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long time. \u201cI\u2019m almost positive that she did not jump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d</p><p>He studied the brandy glass in his hands. \u201cWhen she kicked me out of her car that night she was pissed as hell. She was angry, not depressed or desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow angry?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head against the back of the lounger. \u201cVery. Said she\u2019d had it with Eclipse Bay and everyone in it. Said she couldn\u2019t wait to blow this burg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking plans for the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo her death must have been an accident.\u201d</p><p>Rafe said nothing.</p><p>Hannah cleared her throat. \u201cI said, her death must have been an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s certainly the most convenient explanation for all concerned.\u201d</p><p>Shock held Hannah absolutely still for a few seconds. She finally found her breath and let it out very deliberately. \u201cYou want to elaborate on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo point.\u201d Rafe sipped his brandy. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. I guess we\u2019ll never know what really happened that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Rafe was quiet for a while. She had the feeling that he had moved onto some other subject in his mind. Whatever it was, he did not seem to be inclined to discuss it, either.</p><p>She tried not to be so acutely aware of him reclining there so close beside her, but it was hopeless. Probably time to go home, she thought. Make that definitely. She was about to mention that it was getting late when Rafe spoke.</p><p>\u201cSomthing I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat went wrong with Mr. Right?\u201d</p><p>For some reason that was the last question she had expected. She hesitated, not certain how far she wanted to go down that particular road.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work out. What about you?\u201d she added quickly to change the subject. \u201cHeard you got married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you that the men in my family aren\u2019t real good at marriage,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, I told you that was an excuse.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Rafe sat up on the edge of the lounger and rested his forearms on his knees. \u201cMitchell called today.\u201d</p><p>Hannah blinked. He could switch topics quickly, too. \u201cYour grandfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants me to come to dinner tomorrow night. Octavia Brightwell will be there. Says he wants me to meet her.\u201d</p><p>Hannah thought quickly. \u201cBrightwell. The owner of that new art gallery near the pier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Rafe set his glass down on the table. \u201cApparently they\u2019re involved, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief. I saw her on the street the other day. She\u2019s young enough to be his granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m told.\u201d He met her eyes in the shadows. \u201cThe thing is, I need a date.\u201d</p><p>She nearly fell out of the lounger. \u201cYou want me to go to dinner at Mitchell Madison\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot anything better to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, gee, when you put it like that, I guess not. As you once observed so pithily, the entertainment options in Eclipse Bay are somewhat limited.\u201d She paused. \u201cYour grandfather won\u2019t be exactly thrilled to see you walk into the house with a Harte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019ll be on his best behavior because of his new girlfriend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMitchell Madison making nice with a Harte.\u201d She smiled slowly. \u201cNow that should be interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>It was his turn to be wary. \u201cYou\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. On one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to promise me that afterward we\u2019ll have our little chat about how we\u2019re going to handle Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>He thought about that for a few seconds. One shoulder rose in a negligent motion. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>She felt a distinct chill all the way down her spine. But it was too late now to wonder if she\u2019d just been had by Rafe Madison.</p> <p>She came awake very suddenly, listening to the silence with all of her senses. Her first thought was that an intruder had entered the darkened house. But in the next heartbeat she reminded herself there was no way anyone could have broken in without alerting Winston.</p><p>She sat up slowly. \u201cWinston?\u201d</p><p>There was no response. She could not feel his weight at the foot of the bed. It struck her that during the past two years she had grown very accustomed to his companionship at night.</p><p>She swung her feet to the cold floor and stood. \u201cWinston? Come here, pal.\u201d</p><p>She did not hear his claws on the hardwood in the hall. Anxiety raised the hair on her arms. She grabbed her robe and stepped into her slippers, listening all the while for the smallest sounds.</p><p>Nothing.</p> <p>She went to the door.</p><p>\u201cWinston.\u201d Louder this time.</p><p>A soft, answering whine came from the foot of the stairs. Winston was in the living room. He did not seem hurt or scared. Instead she thought she caught the unmistakable anticipation of the hunter in the low sound.</p><p>The relief was shattering. Not an intruder, after all. Winston had heard some small creature foraging around outside and had gone downstairs to investigate. Here in Eclipse Bay life was rich for a dog who had been raised in a high-rise apartment.</p><p>Taking a couple of deep breaths to get rid of the light-headed sensation, she hurried out into the hall and went down the stairs.</p><p>Winston was poised in front of the door. He glanced briefly at her and immediately returned his attention to whatever was prowling around outside. He scratched at the wood hopefully.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, pal. You\u2019re a city dog. You\u2019re not accustomed to the kinds of critters that hang around garbage cans out here in the boonies. Trust me\u2014you don\u2019t want to actually catch one of them.\u201d</p><p>She reached out to pat his head. As soon as she touched him she realized that predatory tension was vibrating from one end of his sleek little body to the other. He ignored her hand. Everything in him was concentrated on whatever it was that had awakened him and drawn him downstairs.</p> <p>Hannah went to the window. She pulled the curtain aside and discovered that sometime during the night a heavy fog had rolled in off the bay. She had left the porch light on, but its glow did not penetrate far into the thick mist that enveloped the house.</p><p>She told herself that she ought to go back to bed and leave Winston to his nocturnal amusements. But for some reason that she could not explain, she lingered at the front door and waited for him to lose interest in whatever skulked in the shadows.</p><p>It seemed a very long time before Winston relaxed, licked her hand, and led the way briskly back upstairs.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>\u201cThink you can get Bryce to tell you about the trips to Portland?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d Rafe propped the phone between his shoulder and his ear, freeing his hands for the job of chopping the onion that sat on the cutting board. \u201cYou know Bryce. He takes orders only from Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mitchell has told him not to talk about the Portland trips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>Silence hummed briefly on the line. Rafe had a mental image of his older brother at his desk in the president\u2019s office at Madison Commercial. It was a good bet that Gabe was dressed in one of his hand-tailored shirts and a pair of expensive trousers. He would likely be wearing a silk tie and Italian leather shoes. He had no doubt arrived at his headquarters at seven-thirty that morning, right after the conclusion of his six a.m. workout at the health club. He would not leave until seven o\u2019clock tonight at the earliest, and when he finally did go back to his austere condominium, he would have a briefcase full of papers with him. Madison Commercial was Gabe\u2019s passion. He had devoted himself to it with the sort of single-minded intensity that only another Madison could comprehend.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been more than ten months,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cEvery Friday. Regular as clockwork.\u201d</p><p>Rafe finished cutting up the onion and tossed the pieces into the food processor. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might be wrong.\u201d Rafe added the pitted olives, three different kinds in all, to the onion. He dumped the rinsed capers and some freshly squeezed lemon juice into the bowl. \u201cBut we both know that if he is getting some kind of regular medical treatments, we\u2019ll be the last ones to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to protect us, I guess.\u201d Gabe hesitated. \u201cHow does he look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealthy as a bull, except for the arthritis. I\u2019m going to see him tomorrow night at dinner.\u201d Rafe paused. \u201cI\u2019ll get to meet the new girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she really young enough to be his granddaughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m told,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>Gabe groaned. \u201cIt would be embarrassing if it wasn\u2019t so downright amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably ought to look on the bright side,\u201d Gabe said morosely. \u201cIf he\u2019s able to keep up with her in bed, he can\u2019t be at death\u2019s door yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that,\u201d Rafe agreed. He snapped the lid onto the food processor. \u201cNot to change the subject, but how did things go last Saturday night with the lovely Ms. Hartinger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss it, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother disaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to admit it, but it was excruciatingly clear that she was interested only in my portfolio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you said she was perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wrong, okay? Get off my case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still say you\u2019re going about this business of finding yourself a wife the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to approach it in a non-Madison way. I explained my theory to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand what you\u2019re trying to do. I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work. It isn\u2019t like acquiring a new office tower for Madison Commercial.

Are you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe agreed to go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, if you want the truth. Probably thinks it\u2019s a step toward getting her hands on Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, uh, led her to think that might be the case?\u201d Gabe asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve got no intention of giving up your claim on that mansion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rafe said, \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when I find out. I\u2019ve got to go now. Talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>Rafe hung up the phone and switched on the food processor. He thought about Hannah while the machine turned the mixture inside the bowl into tapenade. An old proverb flickered through his mind, something about bringing a long spoon when you dined with the devil. Madisons had used it to describe the risks of dealing with Hartes for years.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Rafe wrapped his hands around the porch railing and gazed out over his grandfather\u2019s magnificent garden. A lot of people in Eclipse Bay gardened, but none of them could match Mitchell\u2019s spectacular display of lush ferns, herb borders, and rosebushes. A large greenhouse dominated the far end of the scene. Inside it were more horticultural wonders. A vegetable plot occupied a section near the house. Even in early fall when blooms were fading, Mitchell\u2019s garden was a work of art.</p><p>In the dark months after the death of their parents, Mitchell had taken his two grandsons into the garden a lot. The three of them had spent countless hours there. Mitchell had shown Rafe and Gabe how to prepare the ground, water the tomatoes, and trim rosebushes. They hadn\u2019t talked much, but Rafe knew that they had all found some solace in the work of growing things.</p><p>Mitchell had lived a turbulent life by anyone\u2019s standards. The years had seen the financial and personal devastation brought on by the destruction of Harte-Madison and the ensuing feud with his old army buddy, Sullivan Harte. The turmoil of four divorces and the breakup of innumerable affairs had taken a toll. The loss of his only son, Sinclair, had been a cruel blow. Rafe knew that the unexpected burden of raising two grandsons had come as a shock to a man who, until then, had not worried overmuch about his family responsibilities. But through it all, Mitchell had never lost his interest in gardening.</p><p>Gardening was Mitchell\u2019s passion. As everyone knew, when it came to a Madison and his passion, nothing was allowed to stand in the way.</p><p>Rafe went down the steps. \u201cHow\u2019d you meet Octavia Brightwell?\u201d he asked, partly out of curiosity and partly in a bid to find a neutral topic. Conversations between himself and Mitchell were fraught with problems.</p> <p>For as long as he could remember, he had been at odds with his grandfather. In recent years they had achieved a prickly d\u00e9tente, but that was only because both of them had tacitly abandoned the open warfare that had characterized so much of their earlier communication. Some would say that they had matured, Rafe thought. But he and Mitchell knew the truth. They had both given up butting heads for the most part because it had become obvious that it was a pointless exercise. Which was not to say that they did not occasionally engage in the activity from time to time, just to stay in practice.</p><p>They had both been on their best behavior throughout dinner this evening, he reflected. True, things had been a little tense for a few minutes after he walked in the front door with Hannah, but to his credit, Mitchell had recovered quickly. Rafe\u2019s theory was that the older man was determined to play the genial host in front of his new girlfriend.</p><p>Octavia Brightwell was, indeed, young enough to be Mitchell\u2019s granddaughter. She came as a surprise to Rafe. She had proved to be warm, friendly, and intelligent. He could tell that Hannah had liked her on sight. During the course of the conversation at dinner Octavia had explained that the gallery she had opened in Eclipse Bay was her second. The first was in Portland. This summer she had divided her time between the two locations.</p><p>\u201cShe stuck her head over my garden fence one morning at the beginning of summer and told me that I was handling my roses all wrong.\u201d Mitchell snorted. \u201cTold her I\u2019d been dealing with roses since before she was born. She brought me a book on how to grow roses. Told me to read a few pages. I told her the author of the book was a damn fool. You might say we just hit it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Rafe watched Mitchell pause to remove a dead bloom from a rosebush.</p><p>Something twisted deep inside him at the sight of his grandfather\u2019s hawklike profile. It hit him that the old warrior with whom he had fought so many battles would not be around forever. It was difficult to imagine the world without Mitchell.</p><p>The tough, irascible Mitchell had the usual Madison flaws, Rafe thought, but he had been the one solid anchor in his grandsons\u2019 lives since the day their father\u2019s motorcycle had collided with a truck.</p><p>Rafe thought about the mysterious weekly trips to Portland. If there was something seriously wrong, it did not show. Mitchell used a cane, but he still looked strong and fit. He could have passed for a man fifteen years younger. There was a sharp glint in his slightly faded green eyes. The hard lines of his face had softened little with age. There was a slight stoop to his shoulders these days, and he had lost some muscle with the years, but the physical changes were well concealed by his undiminished will and determination to control his world and everyone in it.</p><p>\u201cI take it you and Octavia spend a lot of time together,\u201d Rafe said as casually as possible.</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d Mitchell nipped off another dead rose.</p><p>This was not going to work, Rafe decided. If Mitchell did not want to discuss his relationship with Octavia Brightwell, that was the end of the matter. His grandfather had never talked much about his affairs and liaisons over the years. When it came to women, he lived by an old-fashioned code. A man did not kiss and tell. He had drilled that same cardinal rule into both Rafe and Gabe.</p><p>Rafe went down the steps and came to a halt on the path beside Mitchell, who was examining a cluster of ferns.</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019ve been going into Portland on a regular basis,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cTo see Octavia?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d Mitchell snapped off another dead flower.</p><p>Rafe knew that was the end of that conversation. Gabe would have been better at this, he thought</p><p>Mitchell squinted at him. \u201cWhat the hell are you and Hannah Harte going to do with that damned house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t decided.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh. Just like Isabel to do something crazy like this in her will. She had some romantic notion about you and Hannah patching up the old feud. Told her she was an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTelling her that she was an idiot was probably not real helpful.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell grunted again. \u201cNobody more contrary than a Harte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept a Madison.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cYou look pretty friendly with Hannah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve reached the friendly stage, but her dog likes me. That\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard she built herself a nice little business in Portland. Organizes weddings or some such nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She says she gets a lot of repeat clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Harte, and that\u2019s not an easy fact to overlook. But I\u2019ve got to admit that she\u2019s got gumption.\u201d A thoughtful expression gleamed in Mitchell\u2019s eyes. \u201cNever forgot what she did eight years ago. Always felt like we owed her something for the way she backed you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was some nasty talk around town for a while. The folks who believed her when she said she\u2019d been with you on the beach that night assumed you\u2019d seduced her just to score some points against the Hartes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI heard that.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell tapped his cane absently against the base of the sundial. \u201cThere are still one or two who think Hannah Harte flat out lied for you that night. They think you really did push Kaitlin Sadler off that cliff.\u201d</p><p>Rafe felt the tension knot deep inside him. He\u2019d always wondered if Mitchell had been one of those who secretly believed that he had been responsible for Kaitlin\u2019s fall.</p><p>\u201cBottom line,\u201d Mitchell continued, \u201cis that we\u2019re beholden to Hannah Harte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate being beholden to a Harte,\u201d Mitchell sighed. \u201cLike a bur under a saddle.\u201d</p><p>Rafe looked at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t know it bothered you all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your problem. It\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d Mitchell narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat are you going to do about it? Give up your half of Isabel\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so.\u201d Mitchell started off in the direction of the greenhouse. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll show you my new hybrids.\u201d</p><p>Rafe glanced back at the screen door. There was no sign of rescue. Reluctantly he trailed after Mitchell.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Gabe a few days ago,\u201d Mitchell said.</p><p>Rafe steeled himself. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he could find a place for you at Madison Commercial.\u201d There was not a lot of hope in Mitchell\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cGive me a break. Would you work for Gabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s brows bristled. \u201cHe expects everyone to jump when he gives an order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat pretty much sums up my problem with him, too.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell grunted. \u201cWell, it was worth a try.\u201d</p><p>They walked the length of the garden in silence. Just before they reached the greenhouse, Mitchell launched a salvo in an entirely new direction.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time you got married?\u201d he said.</p><p>Rafe felt as if he\u2019d been hit in the head with a ball peen hammer. It took him several seconds to recover. He spent the intervening time with his mouth open.</p><p>\u201cMarried?\u201d he finally managed. \u201cAre you out of your mind? I tried it once, remember? It didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to bite that bullet again, sooner or later. You\u2019ve put it off long enough. If you wait too much longer you\u2019ll be so set in your ways you won\u2019t be able to adjust to marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when did you become an expert on marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had some experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again,\u201d Rafe muttered. \u201cFor your information, I\u2019m already set in my ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You\u2019re still young enough to be flexible.\u201d</p><p>The door on the back porch opened. Both men spun around so quickly that Rafe was sure they looked guilty of something.</p><p>An ethereal-looking woman with a mane of fiery red curls stood in the opening.</p><p>\u201cCoffee\u2019s ready,\u201d Octavia Brightwell called cheerfully.</p><p>Rafe did not hesitate. He noticed that Mitchell didn\u2019t pause either. He figured his grandfather was just as relieved by the timely interruption as he was.</p><p>Side by side, they went swiftly back along the path toward the house.</p><p>Hannah slid her key into the front-door lock. \u201cNot that you\u2019ve got any reason to consider my opinion on the subject, but I liked Octavia.\u201d</p><p>Beside her Rafe shrugged. \u201cSo did I. So what? She\u2019s still way too young for him. Gabe\u2019s right. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>Hannah was amused. \u201cThat\u2019s almost funny, coming from a Madison. No offense, but the men of your family aren\u2019t known for feeling shy or awkward about their sex lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different when it\u2019s your grandfather\u2019s sex life,\u201d Rafe said glumly.</p><p>Hannah listened to the sound of dog claws prancing madly on the hardwood floor on the other side of the door. \u201cWell, if it\u2019s any consolation to you, Octavia told me that she and your grandfather are just friends. I believe her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a quick, searching glance as she opened the door. He had been in a strange mood since returning from the after-dinner walk in the garden. Rafe had never been an easy man to read, but now there was a dark, brooding aura emanating from him that had not been present earlier in the evening. She wondered what had been said between him and his grandfather.</p><p>Winston bounced through the open door, torn as always, between the demands of professional dignity and blatant emotionalism.</p><p>\u201cSuch a handsome dog.\u201d She bent down to pat him. \u201cThe finest specimen of Schnauzerhood in the known universe.\u201d</p><p>Winston glowed.</p><p>Rafe watched them with an expression of morbid interest. \u201cHe actually believes you when you say that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? It\u2019s true.\u201d She stood back to allow Winston to trot across the porch and down the steps. The dog paused briefly to thrust his nose into Rafe\u2019s hand, and then he disappeared discreetly into some bushes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hannah reached around the edge of the door and flipped a light switch. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to kick myself for getting involved, but I feel compelled to ask. Did things go okay between you and your grandfather out there in the garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Rafe glided, uninvited, through the opening into the front hall.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She was not quite certain what to do with him now that he was inside her house.</p><p>She held the door open for Winston. He pranced across the porch and into the hall. He headed straight for Rafe.</p> <p>Hannah closed the door and leaned back against it. Rafe crouched to scratch the dog\u2019s ears. Winston promptly sat down and assumed a blissful expression.</p><p>\u201cThere was the usual stuff,\u201d Rafe said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cThe usual stuff?\u201d</p><p>Rafe kept his attention on Winston, who was clearly ready, willing, and able to absorb an unlimited amount of it. \u201cMitchell reminded me that it wasn\u2019t too late to join Madison Commercial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. The usual.\u201d She straightened away from the door and walked into the kitchen. When in doubt, make a cup of tea. \u201cAnd you gave him the usual response, no doubt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, sure. That\u2019s how Mitchell and I communicate. He tells me what I should do, and I tell him I won\u2019t do it. We understand each other perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Isabel always said that you and your grandfather had problems from the day you hit puberty because the two of you were so much alike.\u201d She filled the kettle and set it on the stove.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that theory before.\u201d Rafe gave Winston one last pat, got to his feet, and came to stand in the arched doorway. He propped one shoulder against the frame and crossed his arms. \u201cNeither Mitchell nor I believes it.\u201d</p><p>She was intensely aware of him taking up space in the kitchen. She could feel his disturbing gaze following her every move as she went about the business of preparing a pot of tea.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, you know,\u201d she said gently. \u201cYou\u2019re both strong-willed, arrogant, independent, and downright bullheaded at times. The two of you probably have the same motto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever apologize, never explain.\u201d</p><p>He contrived to look hurt. \u201cHad it occurred to you that I might have something in common with your dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>He smiled humorlessly. \u201cI might actually believe you when you tell me what you really think about me.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows at that. \u201cI can\u2019t see you giving much credence to anyone else\u2019s opinions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShows how much you know. I\u2019m only human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot proof of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll accept strong-willed, arrogant, and independent.\u201d He gave her a derisive look. \u201cBut I object to the last part. What makes you say I\u2019m bullheaded?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled with cool triumph. \u201cYour refusal to talk about how we\u2019re going to deal with the problem of Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. That.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that.\u201d</p><p>He raised one shoulder very casually. \u201cWell, hell, nobody\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept Winston, of course,\u201d she added swiftly, in case Winston had overhead the remark and had started to worry.</p><p>There was a short silence.</p><p>\u201cMitchell said something else while we were in the garden,\u201d Rafe said eventually.</p><p>She glanced at him over her shoulder as she dropped a large pinch of tea into the pot. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>He watched her with shuttered eyes. \u201cHe told me it was about time I got married.\u201d</p><p>For some reason her stomach tightened. She hoped it wasn\u2019t the grilled salmon they\u2019d had at dinner. It had tasted so good going down, but fish could be tricky.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cTalk about pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you responded by telling him to stay out of your personal affairs.\u201d She concentrated hard on the teakettle, willing it to boil quickly.</p><p>Rafe said nothing.</p><p>A tiny shriek rose from the kettle. Close enough, she decided. Grateful for the small distraction, she hastily poured the hot water into the pot.</p><p>It was okay, she thought a moment later. She was cool now. But when she turned around with her most polished smile firmly in place, she discovered that Rafe had left the doorway and was now standing less than two feet away.</p><p>Much too close.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come straight out and say it in so many words.\u201d Rafe\u2019s eyes never left her face. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. I made it clear that I\u2019d do what I wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She tried to think of something clever to say in response to that. She wound up clearing her throat instead. \u201cAnd what do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I want to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>She went very still. The really scary part, she realized, was that she wanted the same thing. She had a hunch that he could see it in her eyes.</p><p>She licked her lips and asked the only question that mattered. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes there have to be a reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She could feel the counter pressing against her lower back. She put her arms out on either side and gripped the curved tile edge. \u201cYes, I think so. Especially given the situation here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSituation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Me. Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if I can\u2019t come up with any reason except the fact that I want to kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe important thing,\u201d she explained very carefully, \u201cthe really crucial thing, is that the reason, whatever it is, must have nothing to do with Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>He raised his hands and slowly folded them around the nape of her neck. His palms were warm and heavy against her skin. She could feel the strength in him but sensed the control. The combination was electrifying.</p><p>His thumbs moved gently just behind her ears. He eased her head back slightly and lowered his mouth to hers.</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with the mansion,\u201d he said against her lips. \u201cYou have my word on it.\u201d</p><p>The kiss was a real one this time, not the chaste, meaningless little brush of the lips he had bestowed on her that night when he had walked her home. And it was just exactly what she had always suspected it would be: devastating.</p><p>Excitement sparked along every nerve ending. The effect was not unlike touching a match to extremely dry kindling. The flames erupted without warning, fierce and intense. A liquid heat welled somewhere in the region below her stomach. She was aware of the beat of her own heart. The breathless sensation would probably have warranted a trip to the emergency room under other circumstances. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rafe deepened the kiss with slow deliberation.</p><p>The stuff of teenage fantasies, she thought. Except that no teenager could have appreciated just how good the kiss really was. Only an adult woman who had learned the hard way that real life was seldom this great could savor the finer points and the little nuances here.</p><p>Rafe crowded her gently up against the counter. She could feel the unmistakable shape of his erection pressed against her thigh.</p><p>Okay, so not all of the nuances here were little.</p> <p>His mouth slanted across hers. He drew his palms down her throat and covered her br**sts. A great urgency went through her. With an effort, she managed to let go of the counter edge. She heard him say something that probably would have gotten him arrested if he had said it in public. He made no effort to conceal his hunger. The knowledge that he wanted her played havoc with the last shreds of her common sense.</p><p>Just a kiss, she thought. How much damage could one kiss do?</p><p>She heard someone moan softly. Probably her, she decided. Not real cool. It was only a kiss, after all. But at the moment she did not care if she was demonstrating a distinct lack of worldly sophistication. The only thing that mattered was getting her arms around Rafe\u2019s neck.</p><p>The instant she achieved her goal she heard a husky groan. Not her this time. Rafe.</p><p>His hands tightened abruptly. She could feel his control slipping away. She wondered if he was aware of it. Then she wondered what she would do if it vanished altogether. Would she care? Should she care?</p> <p>The world tilted on its axis. She realized vaguely that Rafe had scooped her up into his arms. A shiver went through her.</p><p>He paused briefly to switch off the lights. Then he carried her out of the kitchen into the living room. There he put her down on the aging sofa and lowered himself on top of her. His lips went to her throat. She could have sworn she felt his teeth. Another zinging thrill shot through her. She was shivering now. The weight of his body crushed her into the cushions.</p><p>At the sound of dog claws scratching on wood, she opened her eyes for a split second. In the shadows she caught a glimpse of Winston hurrying up the stairs to the second floor. Embarrassed by the unseemly behavior taking place on the sofa, no doubt.</p><p>She ought to be embarrassed too, she thought. And maybe she would be. Later.</p><p>In the meantime, her body was singing a fascinating melody. She had caught a few chords of this particular tune from time to time over the years, but she had never experienced the grand finale.</p><p>She felt one of Rafe\u2019s hands slide beneath her sweater. The clasp of her bra dissolved at his touch. When his thumb lightly touched her nipple she almost screamed. It was as though every inch of her had been sensitized. She was in some never-never land where the line between acute pleasure and pain was murky.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking all day that it would be like this,\u201d Rafe muttered into the curve of her shoulder. \u201cI was going crazy waiting to find out.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved over the curve of her hip. She felt his fingers on the zipper of her slacks. Things were moving swiftly. Much too swiftly. But she could not seem to summon up a lot of good reasons for calling a halt.</p><p>She heard Winston on the stairs again. For some reason the knowledge that her dog had returned to the scene cleared some of the fog from her brain.</p><p>\u201cI think this is far enough,\u201d she managed to get out.</p><p>\u201cNot nearly.\u201d Rafe peeled up the edge of her sweater and kissed one of her br**sts. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting you since you got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>He went very still. Then he raised his head and looked down at her with gleaming eyes. \u201cNice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered. Honest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFlattered,\u201d he repeated carefully. \u201cGreat. Flattered. Shit.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m a prude, or anything, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re still Miss Goody Two-Shoes, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d She was starting to grow annoyed. \u201cIt\u2019s just that in a lot of ways you and I are strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Harte. I\u2019m a Madison. The way I look at it, we\u2019ve known each other most of our lives.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly an interesting viewpoint. Maybe it\u2019s even true in certain ways. But something of an oversimplification, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always talk like this on a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a date we had tonight. I did you a favor.\u201d</p><p>His smile was infinitely slow, infinitely seductive. \u201cWell, in that case, allow me to repay it.\u201d He started to lower his mouth to hers once more.</p><p>She braced her hands on his shoulders to stop him. \u201cMy point\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look of polite surprise. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ve actually got one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point,\u201d she continued grimly, \u201cis that, although we\u2019ve known of each other\u2019s existence most of our lives, it\u2019s stretching things to imply that we\u2019ve been anything more than distant acquaintances. I still say we\u2019re strangers as far as this kind of thing is concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush.\u201d He covered her mouth with the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cMmmph?\u201d Outraged, she grabbed his wrist and tried to yank his hand away from her lips.</p><p>She was so intent on telling him in no uncertain terms that she did not find this kind of stuff a turn-on that it took her a few seconds to realize he was not paying any attention to her. She finally noticed that he was lying much too still, his head turned toward the front door.</p><p>She heard a very soft whine. Winston was standing at the door again, just as he had done last night. His alert, watchful tension radiated clear across the room.</p><p>\u201cHe hears something.\u201d Rafe took his hand away from Hannah\u2019s mouth. He kept his eyes on the dog as he sat up on the edge of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cProbably an animal prowling for garbage.\u201d Hannah hastily pulled her clothing back into place. \u201cA skunk, maybe. Or cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Rafe watched Winston intently.</p><p>Hannah sat up slowly. \u201cHe did this last night, too.\u201d</p><p>Rafe got to his feet and crossed the room to where Winston vibrated at the door. He halted at the window and pulled aside the curtain. \u201cFog\u2019s so thick now you can\u2019t see past the edge of the porch.\u201d</p><p>Winston whined softly. He glanced at Rafe and then at the door and then back at Rafe. The message was clear. He wanted to go outside to investigate.</p><p>A cold chill went through Hannah. It was the same disturbing sensation she\u2019d experienced last night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019s not coming too close to the house,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cWinston would be barking like crazy if there was a critter in the bushes at the edge of the porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Rafe reached for the doorknob. Winston strained forward, preparing to streak through the crack in the door as soon as it appeared.</p><p>Real fear galvanized Hannah. Everything in her was suddenly focused on the danger of opening the front door.</p><p>\u201cWhat, are you crazy?\u201d She leaped to her feet and rushed across the room. She bent down to seize Winston\u2019s collar. \u201cYou can\u2019t send him outside. He was raised in a high-rise apartment in the middle of a city, for heaven\u2019s sake. He knows nothing about wild animals. Whatever\u2019s out there might be a lot bigger and meaner than he is.\u201d</p> <p>Winston tried to pull free of her grasp. He was trembling with eagerness. His nose did not waver from the crack between the door and the frame.</p><p>Rafe glanced down at him. \u201cOkay, city dog. Stay inside and be a sissy. I\u2019ll handle this on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t.\u201d Exasperated, Hannah released Winston and threw herself in front of the door, arms spread wide. \u201cYou\u2019re not going out there, either.\u201d</p><p>Rafe looked amused. \u201cDoubt if whatever is out there is bigger or meaner than me. This is Eclipse Bay, remember? Crime rate around here is almost nonexistent.\u201d</p><p>Winston whined again and bobbed restlessly at Rafe\u2019s heels.</p> <p>Hannah glared at both of them. She did not budge from her position in front of the door. Frantically she searched for a rational, sensible reason for refusing to allow either male outside.</p><p>\u201cCut the raging testosterone, you two. Let\u2019s have a little common sense here, shall we? It is entirely possible that there\u2019s a skunk outside. Does either of you have any idea of just how long it would take to get rid of the smell if you got sprayed? You\u2019d both have to sleep on the beach for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think it\u2019s a skunk.\u201d Rafe looked thoughtful. \u201cA skunk would head straight for the garbage cans. We\u2019d have heard the clatter by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not a skunk, it might be something worse,\u201d she said through her teeth. \u201cMaybe somebody\u2019s pit bull or Rottweiler got loose. For all you know, there\u2019s a whole pack of vicious dogs out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of common sense,\u201d Rafe said mildly, \u201cI think that theory is a bit weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. It\u2019s my theory and I\u2019m sticking to it. Neither of you is going out there and that\u2019s final. Besides, you just got through saying that the fog was so thick you couldn\u2019t see beyond the edge of the porch. It makes no sense to go floundering around in the stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Rafe looked at her. She realized that he was laughing silently.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He pulled the curtain aside again and peered thoughtfully out into the darkness. \u201cJust occurred to me that if you don\u2019t let me outside, I won\u2019t be able to get home tonight, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cYou can leave after Winston relaxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t see a damn thing in that muck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can leave your car here and walk home.\u201d</p><p>He dropped the curtain. His eyes gleamed.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if someone drives past your house early tomorrow morning and sees my car parked in front?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cHalf the town already thinks the worst, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then what about the pack of maddened Rottweilers and pit bulls I\u2019ll have to confront if I walk home?\u201d</p><p>She moved just far enough from the position in front of the door to lift the curtain. A single glance outside showed that the fog was an impenetrable barrier. The light from the yellow lamp over the door was reflected back from what looked like a solid gray wall.</p><p>She looked at Winston. He was now pacing restlessly in front of the door. Whatever it was that he sensed was still out there. She made an executive decision.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll drink the tea I made,\u201d she said. \u201cIf nothing has changed by the time we finish, you can sleep on the sofa tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Rafe said much too easily.</p><p>Winston lost interest in whatever lay out in the fog about the same time they finished the tea. But when Rafe checked the view from the window he was pleased to see that the mist had not dissipated. If anything, it was thicker than ever.</p><p>Luck was with him tonight.</p><p>Hannah came to stand behind him. She peered over his shoulder. \u201cHow does it look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a great night for mad dogs and skunks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot funny.\u201d She hugged herself and rubbed her arms briskly, as though warding off a chill. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go overboard with the gracious hospitality routine. I don\u2019t mind walking back to Dreamscape. It\u2019s not that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She turned away abruptly. \u201cYou can have the downstairs guest room. I\u2019ll get some blankets and a pillow.\u201d</p><p>He watched her climb the stairs. She had been a little too quick to suggest that he stay here, he decided. The expression in her eyes was wrong, too. He wondered how much of this new, brittle tension derived from the scene on the sofa earlier and how much came from Winston\u2019s prowling at the door.</p><p>Logic told him that a few kisses wouldn\u2019t have rattled her this much. She wasn\u2019t a teenager, after all. She was a confident woman who had built a thriving business. It would take more than a sexy tussle on the sofa to throw her. In any event, he was pretty sure that if she really had been upset by the small skirmish, she would have been more than delighted to let him walk home in the fog.</p><p>Instead, she had insisted that he stay here.</p><p>He glanced at Winston. The dog was stretched out on his belly on the rug, nose on his paws, dozing. Hannah had said that it was the second night in a row that he had gone on alert.</p><p>Hannah and Winston were both accustomed to life in the city, Rafe reminded himself. They had merely overreacted to whatever small creature had wandered too close to the house. But if Hannah wanted him to stay here tonight, who was he to argue?</p><p>An hour later he was still awake. Arms folded behind his head, he stared up at the deep shadows on the ceiling. He was intensely aware of the fact that Hannah was just out of sight upstairs. He pictured her in a nightgown. Maybe a frilly little see-through number that showed a lot of skin. Fat chance. More likely a sober, long-sleeved flannel thing that fell to her ankles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Either one sounded interesting, now that he considered the matter. Very interesting, in fact. He was hard as a rock.</p><p>Logic told him that a few kisses shouldn\u2019t have rattled him this much. He wasn\u2019t a teenager, after all. It took more than a sexy tussle on the sofa to throw him.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Chapter 8</p> <p>He awoke at dawn when a cold nose was thrust against the bottom of his bare foot. The shock brought him to a sitting position in a hurry.</p><p>\u201cSonofa\u2014\u201d He broke off when he saw Winston. \u201cNo point in calling you that particular name, is there? You are a son of a bitch. And don\u2019t think it hasn\u2019t occurred to me that the big dramatic act last night at the door might have been just your deliberate attempt to disrupt the mood of the evening.\u201d</p><p>Winston gave him a meaningful look.</p><p>\u201cThings were going pretty damn good until you showed up and made like Mr. Macho Watchdog.\u201d</p><p>Winston turned and trotted to the door. There he sat down and stared intently at Rafe.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, okay. I get the point.\u201d</p><p>Rafe shoved aside the blankets and got to his feet. He found his trousers and reached for his shirt. After a short search he discovered his low-cut boots fooling around with some dust bunnies under the bed.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door to a damp, fog-bound morning. Winston stepped smartly outside and headed for the bushes at the edge of the porch. Rafe went down the steps and followed the little path that led to the storage locker used to house the garbage cans. There were no signs of animal tracks in the vicinity and no claw marks on the wooden lid.</p><p>Having concluded his personal business, Winston hurried over to see what was going on at the garbage can locker. Rafe watched him closely.</p><p>Winston sniffed a bit, but his interest in the locker appeared casual at best. After only a couple of minutes he headed on down the long drive toward the trees that veiled the house and gardens from the narrow road.</p> <p>Rafe followed, watching to see if the dog paid any unusual attention to any particular point along the way. Winston\u2019s progress was slowed by numerous pauses, but none appeared to be any more intriguing to him than another. When he got close to the edge of the property, Rafe decided it was time to call him back.</p><p>\u201cHannah will chew me out but good if she finds out I let you play in traffic.\u201d Not that there was much on this quiet road, especially at this hour of the morning.</p><p>Winston ignored him, displaying a breathtaking disdain for a clear and reasonable command. Rafe concluded that the attitude was either the result of generations of fine breeding or something that had rubbed off from Hannah. He was inclined to credit the latter.</p><p>\u201cCome back here.\u201d Rafe walked more quickly toward Winston, intending to grab him before he reached the road.</p><p>But Winston stopped of his own accord before he got as far as the pavement. He veered left toward a stand of dripping trees and began to sniff the ground with great authority.</p><p>\u201cJust like you knew what you were doing,\u201d Rafe said quietly.</p><p>Winston flitted briskly from one tree trunk to another, pausing to sniff intently in several places. Eventually he lifted his leg. When he was finished he turned to Rafe as if to say that he was satisfied.</p><p>Rafe walked into the stand and took a close look at the tree Winston had marked. He knew that his human senses were abysmally inadequate for the task at hand.</p> <p>He crouched to get a closer look at the ground at the base of the tree. Unfortunately the pebbles that covered the earth made it impossible to detect any footprints. Always assuming that there were any there to detect, Rafe thought.</p><p>He looked at Winston, who was watching him with an inquiring expression. \u201cYou know, if one of us had gotten both your nose and my brain, we\u2019d be in great shape.\u201d</p><p>Winston gave the equivalent of a canine shrug, then turned and went quickly along the drive toward the house.</p><p>Rafe straightened. He was about to set off after the dog when he caught a glint of silver foil out of the corner of his eye. A closer look revealed a tightly wadded candy wrapper lying on the ground near the point Winston had marked.</p><p>Not exactly a major discovery. A stray breeze could have blown it into the stand of trees. It might have been tossed from a passing car or fallen off the garbage truck.</p><p>Or it might have been dropped by someone standing in this very spot about midnight last night.</p><p>He picked up the discarded wrapper and went back down the drive to where he had parked the Porsche. He unlocked the door, opened the glove compartment, and rummaged briefly inside. No luck. He looked at Winston, who was waiting, head cocked, on the porch.</p><p>\u201cUsed to be a time when I carried a spare razor and a few other basic necessities with me for just this sort of occasion,\u201d he explained. He shut the door and pocketed the keys. \u201cBut I got out of the habit.\u201d</p><p>His social life had never really picked up again after his divorce, he reflected. Probably because he had not worked very hard to get it up and running. He\u2019d had other interests to occupy him.</p><p>He stopped once before he went up the steps and plucked a few sprigs of the mint that were growing beneath the garden\u2019s water faucet.</p><p>Back inside the house he spent a few minutes in the downstairs bathroom, where he discovered that none of the Harte males had left a razor behind.</p><p>\u201cThoughtless,\u201d he told Winston. \u201cBut, then, what do you expect from a Harte?\u201d</p><p>He listened to the silence upstairs for a moment before he wandered into the kitchen and started opening cupboard doors. He found the usual assortment of aging condiments and spices that tended to get left behind in a vacation cottage. Salt, pepper, sugar, a half-empty bottle of vanilla extract, and an unopened jar of maple syrup. The last item was the real thing, not caramel-colored sugar water, he noted.</p><p>He took the vanilla extract and the syrup out of the cupboard and went to check the contents of the refrigerator. The eggs and milk were fresh. The loaf of dense, rustic-style bread baked by the New Age crowd who had taken over the old bakery near the pier was a day old.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>The bride\u2019s gown was three sizes too big. She tried desperately to pin it into place, but it was hopeless. She knew that no matter what she did the dress would never look right. The client was in tears. The groom kept looking at his watch.</p><p>She glanced at the clock and saw that the reception was supposed to start in a few minutes. But the caterers had not yet arrived. None of the tables had been set up. The flowers were limp. She opened a case of the premium-quality champagne that she had ordered and discovered bottles of mouthwash inside. She looked around and realized that the musicians had not yet appeared </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On top of everything else, there was something dreadfully wrong with the room. The reception was supposed to be in an elegant hillside mansion overlooking the city. Instead, she was standing in an empty, windowless warehouse.</p><p>The tantalizing smell of something delicious being cooked nearby distracted her from the chaos. She realized that she was very hungry, but she could not abandon the client to go get something to eat. She was a professional, after all...</p><p>Hannah came awake with a start and found herself gazing into the depths of the impenetrable fogbank that hovered outside the window. For a few disorienting seconds she thought she was still in Portland trying to hold together the unraveling threads of a disastrous wedding reception.</p><p>Then she smelled the exquisite aromas from downstairs. Reality returned, jolting her out of bed.</p> <p>Rafe. He had not vanished discreetly at dawn as she had expected. He was down there making himself at home in her kitchen. She had been so sure that he would be gone by the time she awoke.</p><p>She looked at the foot of the bed. There was no sign of Winston. What had become of her faithful pal?</p><p>Now that was a really dumb question, she thought. Winston was a truly fabulous dog in many respects. But in the end, he was still a dog. If she wanted to find him, she had only to follow the smell of food.</p><p>She staggered into the bathroom, the last wisps of the familiar anxiety dream trailing after her. She\u2019d been plagued by the wedding-reception-from-hell nightmare for months before she had made the decision to sell Weddings by Harte.</p><p>She gripped the edges of the white pedestal sink and stared at herself in the mirror. Her hair hung in lanky tangles. There was a sullen, surly look in her eyes, and the flush in her cheeks was unbecoming, to say the least. She could not face Rafe in this condition. Her only hope was a shower.</p> <p>She whipped the long-sleeved nightgown off over her head and stepped beneath the hot spray. Seizing the shampoo in both hands, she went to work with near-violent determination. It had not been a good night.</p><p>When she emerged a short time later she felt infinitely better. She pulled on a sweater and a pair of jeans, brushed her freshly washed hair behind her ears, and anchored it with a headband.</p><p>She took another look in the mirror just before she left the room. With dismay she realized that she still looked a little too pink. Probably because of the shower, she decided. All that heat and steam. The effect would surely fade quickly.</p><p>She squared her shoulders, opened the bedroom door, and stepped out into the hall.</p><p>By the time she got downstairs her mouth was watering. She saw Winston sitting just inside the kitchen doorway. He rose to greet her with his customary gallantry, but it was clear that he was distracted by what was going on in the vicinity of the stove.</p><p>Rafe looked just as she had known he would look in the morning. Incredibly sexy, right down to and including the shadow of a beard that gave the hard planes of his face an even more dangerous cast than usual.</p> <p>It really was not fair. A gentleman would have been gone by dawn. But, then, no one had ever called Rafe Madison a gentleman.</p><p>\u201cRight on time.\u201d Rafe\u2019s eyes gleamed as he surveyed her with one swift, all-encompassing look. He picked up an oven mitt. \u201cYou can pour the coffee.\u201d</p><p>She watched as he removed a pan from the oven. The faint scent of vanilla teased her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrench toast.\u201d He put the pan on the stove and tossed the mitt onto the counter. \u201cBaked instead of fried. Sort of a cross between a bread pudding and a souffl\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at it longingly. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>So the man could cook. She already knew that. It was not a sufficient reason to fall in love. Lust, maybe, but not love.</p><p>She dragged her gaze away from the golden-brown French toast and saw that Rafe was watching her with an odd expression.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the coffee.\u201d She whirled around and seized the pot.</p><p>Rafe arranged the French toast on two heated plates and carried the food to the table. Hannah studied the casually elegant fashion in which the puffy, golden-brown triangles had been positioned. There were little sprigs of fresh mint on top of the toast. The syrup in the small pot in front of her was warm.</p><p>She picked up her fork. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a theory in some quarters that you turned to a life of crime in order to support yourself after you left Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut after dinner the other night and breakfast this morning, I think the evidence is clear that you went to a blue-ribbon culinary academy instead of jail.\u201d</p><p>He looked up very quickly.</p><p>She paused with a bite of French toast poised in midair. \u201cGood heavens, I was joking. Did you really take cooking classes?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. Then shrugged. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She was fascinated. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I got married. In the back of my mind, I think I always had this idea that when you were happily married, you ate at home most of the time. But Meredith wasn\u2019t big on cooking, so I took over the job. The better I got at it, the more restless and unhappy Meredith became.\u201d Rafe made a dismissive gesture with one hand. \u201cAfter a while I realized that she wasn\u2019t real big on staying at home, either.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him in disbelief. \u201cMeredith left you because you\u2019re a fantastic cook and because you like to eat at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, those weren\u2019t the only reasons,\u201d Rafe admitted. \u201cShe might have been willing to tolerate my cooking if I had agreed to go to work at Madison Commercial. But I refused, so in the end she gave up on my future prospects and left.\u201d</p><p>Hannah savored another bite of French toast while she thought about that. \u201cI\u2019m sorry your marriage didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be. I figure it\u2019s your fault that it bombed.\u201d</p><p>She nearly dropped her fork. \u201cMy fault. How in the world can you blame me?\u201d</p><p>He met her eyes across the short expanse of the table. His mouth curved slightly. \u201cThat night on the beach you told me I didn\u2019t have to follow in my father\u2019s and my grandfather\u2019s footsteps when it came to marriage, remember? So a couple of years later, I figured I\u2019d give it a try. I mean, after all, it was advice from Miss Overachiever herself. How could it be wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, hold on one dang minute here.\u201d She aimed the fork at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame me just because you chose to follow my perfectly good advice and then messed it up by picking the wrong woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a Madison. I was bound to pick the wrong woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a cop-out excuse if I ever heard one and you know it. You will not use it again, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He halfway lowered his lashes. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She subsided slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re the only person on the face of the earth who made a mistake when it came to selecting the right mate, you know. I didn\u2019t do any better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you did. You just got engaged. You never got married.\u201d</p><p>She made a face and forked up another bite of toast. \u201cI\u2019ll let you in on a little secret. The only reason I didn\u2019t make the mistake of actually marrying Doug was because he very kindly dumped me before we got to the altar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a lawyer, a partner at a very prestigious firm in Portland. We met when I did his sister\u2019s wedding. We had lots of things in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe fit all the criteria on the Mr. Right list you gave me that night on the beach?\u201d</p> <p>She winced. \u201cYou remember that list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever forgot it. Made a profound impact on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He picked up his coffee mug and swallowed meditatively. \u201cProbably because I knew I\u2019d never come anywhere near to meeting even half the requirements and specifications on it.\u201d</p><p>His words blindsided her. \u201cIt really bothered you that you couldn\u2019t make my Mr. Right list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood grief, that\u2019s crazy. You were never interested in me. To you I was just some na\u00efve, prissy little overachiever. Miss Goody Two-Shoes, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the fact that I personally couldn\u2019t make your Mr. Right list that bugged me. It was the fact that there was such a thing as a Mr. Right list and you knew all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, I didn\u2019t even know the damn list existed,\u201d Rafe explained patiently. \u201cThat put me at a serious disadvantage. And when I found out that women like you had one and the kind of stuff that was on it, I knew I was in deep trouble.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head once, dazed. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something, Miss Goody Two-Shoes. That night on the beach you were all those things you just said\u2014na\u00efve and prissy and all that. But I figured you were also an authority on one important thing. You knew what it took to make a good marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? But I\u2019d never been married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but you\u2019d been raised in a family that looked pretty damn perfect to me. Happily married parents and grandparents. No divorces. No scandals. I assumed that you knew what it took to make it all happen.\u201d</p> <p>Understanding dawned. Rafe had no firsthand knowledge of how a good marriage functioned because, unlike her, he\u2019d never witnessed one close up. Divorce ran as strongly as green eyes in the Madison clan.</p><p>\u201cI see. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I have concluded that my original Mr. Right list was flawed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Why?\u201d</p><p>She propped her elbows on the table and rested her chin on the heels of her hands. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something that I\u2019ve never told anyone else. I swear, if this gets out I will throttle you, Rafe Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, Doug had his own list, and I failed to meet all of his specifications and requirements.\u201d</p><p>Rafe blinked. Then his mouth curved slowly into a grin. \u201cThe guy had a Ms. Right list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. He was decent enough to point out the areas in which I was deficient. He made suggestions for improvement. I got ticked.\u201d</p><p>Rafe\u2019s grin metamorphosed into a chuckle. The chuckle erupted into a full-throated roar of laughter.</p><p>She watched him, wondering if he was going to fall out of his chair. Winston, ears cocked, looked intrigued. Rafe\u2019s howls filled the kitchen.</p><p>It took a while for him to pull himself together. Hannah filled the time by pouring herself another cup of coffee and feeding Winston a scrap of leftover French toast from her plate.</p><p>Rafe\u2019s shoulders eventually stopped shaking. He sprawled in the chair, one hand on his flat belly, and subsided slowly into a grin.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound sorry at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you find it so amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to know,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cWhere did you fall short?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I just cooked breakfast for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He had a point. \u201cI fit most of the criteria, you understand. I came from a successful family. I was well educated. I had demonstrated initiative and determination by founding my own business. I was well connected in the community. I shared a lot of Doug\u2019s interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cBut it turned out that Doug was making long-range plans to enter the political arena. He\u2019s a good man. I think he really has something to contribute. But he needed a wife who could handle the sort of social and personal demands that go with that kind of job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHence the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The more I realized that he was serious about a political career, the more we both came to the conclusion that I couldn\u2019t handle being a politician\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>Rafe reached for the coffeepot. \u201cWelcome to the select club reserved for those who fail to make the Mr. and Mrs. Right lists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks. Is there a merit badge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. So, tell me, what did you do with your own list?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI amended it.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her with a strange expression. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ve still got one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But it\u2019s a lot shorter now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. What\u2019s on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d She broke off at the sound of a car turning into the drive.</p><p>Winston was at the door in a flash. He gave the appropriate warning woof. Alert but not yet alarmed. On the job.</p><p>The low rumble shattered the fragile intimacy that had enveloped the kitchen. Rafe turned his head to check the drive. Hannah followed his gaze. The fog had burned off enough to allow her to see the vehicle that was approaching the house. A green Volvo.</p><p>\u201cAnyone you know?\u201d Rafe asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recognize the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to hide in a closet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d She pushed back her chair and got to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a friend of my folks\u2019 who found out that I\u2019m in town and stopped to say hello.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked at her. \u201cWhoever it is, he or she will have seen my car by now. Probably recognized it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you are having coffee with me is no one\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t just coffee,\u201d Rafe said as she went past him into the living room. \u201cBut who\u2019s going to argue?\u201d</p><p>She was saved from having to respond because she was already halfway to the front door. She patted Winston, who looked like a ballet dancer, poised and ready on his paws.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, pal. I don\u2019t think a burglar would arrive in a Volvo.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door. A polished, good-looking man emerged from behind the wheel of the Volvo. He wore a navy blue polo shirt, a pair of gray trousers, and loafers. There was a designer logo stitched on the left side of the shirt. The pants appeared to have been hand-tailored, and the loafers had little tassels. She was almost certain that the hair had been styled in a salon located somewhere other than Eclipse Bay.</p><p>When her visitor spotted her waiting in the doorway, he gave her a dazzling smile that lit up the foggy morning like a lighthouse beacon.</p><p>\u201cLooks like Perry has started bleaching his teeth,\u201d she murmured to Winston.</p><p>Winston rumbled deep in his throat and trotted after her as she went out onto the porch.</p> <p>\u201cHannah.\u201d Perry Decatur jogged toward the steps. \u201cHeard you were in town. Great to see you again. You look fabulous.\u201d</p><p>At the last minute she realized his intention and braced herself. He swept her into an embrace that would have been more appropriate for lovers who had been separated for years by war and star-crossed fates. She felt the breath go out of her lungs as his arms closed around her.</p><p>A low growl reverberated across the porch. For one horrible moment, Hannah was not sure if the sound had come from Winston or Rafe.</p><p>\u201cCute dog.\u201d</p><p>Perry released Hannah, bent down, and thumped Winston lightly on his broad, intelligent head without going through the civilized formality of allowing Winston to sniff his fingers first.</p><p>Winston\u2019s silvery brows bristled with indignation, but he was too well behaved to make a scene. He did, however, display a discreet glimpse of fang. Could have been an accident, Hannah thought.</p> <p>Perry straightened quickly. \u201cDogs love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d Hannah looked at Winston. \u201cThank you, Winston. I can handle this. You may go back inside and finish your breakfast.\u201d</p><p>With a last glare at Perry, Winston turned and stalked back into the house.</p><p>\u201cFine-looking animal,\u201d Perry said approvingly. \u201cDo you show him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow him what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant, is he a show dog?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cPut Winston in a ring and make him perform stunts for a bunch of judges? Are you mad? I wouldn\u2019t dream of doing such a thing. He would be mortified.\u201d</p><p>Perry managed a forced chuckle. \u201cI see. Well, how have you been, Hannah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. That\u2019s just great.\u201d He angled his chin in the general direction of Rafe\u2019s car. \u201cI see you\u2019ve got a visitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee sounds terrific.\u201d</p><p>She chose to ignore the unsubtle hint. \u201cI\u2019m a little busy, Perry.\u201d</p><p>The bright light of his smile dimmed a bit. \u201cHannah, I really need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t wait.\u201d Perry paused a beat and lowered his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s important. Not just to me but to a lot of people here in Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>She wavered. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too involved to explain out here.\u201d</p><p>He moved past her with a breezy arrogance that made her want to stick out a foot and trip him. She avoided the temptation. If Winston was capable of good manners and restraint in the face of extreme provocation, she could do no less.</p><p>She went thoughtfully back into the house and closed the door. Perry was already in the kitchen, introducing himself to Rafe.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met.\u201d He thrust out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Perry Decatur. I\u2019m with the institute. Sorry to interrupt breakfast. Hannah and I are old friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe Madison.\u201d Rafe kept his fingers wrapped around his coffee mug and managed to overlook Perry\u2019s outstretched hand. \u201cI know all about your old friendship with Hannah. I was the one who walked her home that night eight years ago when she decided to end her date with you a little early. But I\u2019m sure you heard all about that.\u201d</p><p>Perry blinked a couple of times and dropped his hand. But if he found the moment awkward, he gave no hint. \u201cWhat a coincidence, the three of us getting together over coffee after all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, life\u2019s funny that way, isn\u2019t it?\u201d The gleam in Rafe\u2019s eyes was diamond-hard. \u201cSo, what do you do at the think tank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVice President of Finance and Administration.\u201d</p><p>Perry removed a small gold case from his pocket and produced a card. When Rafe did not reach for it, he put it down on the table next to the empty syrup jug. He took one of the chairs, twitched it around, and sat down back to front. Very confident. Very much at home in this house. Hannah ground her teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the guy who deals with the donors and contributors who fund the research projects,\u201d Perry said.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you hustle cash for the institute,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>Hannah raised her eyes toward the ceiling, but there was no help from that quarter.</p><p>If Perry was insulted by Rafe\u2019s description of his job, he managed to conceal it behind a small chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, but I really don\u2019t have time to go into it now.\u201d</p><p>Hannah dropped down into her chair. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me exactly why you\u2019re here, Perry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to invite you to attend the reception for Trevor Thornley at the institute tomorrow night,\u201d Perry said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Hannah said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not big on political receptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is an important event,\u201d Perry said seriously. \u201cThornley\u2019s going to formally announce his intention to enter the U.S. Senate race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>Perry pursed his lips. \u201cWell, the thing is, when I heard that you were back in town, I more or less assured the director of the institute that I could convince you to come to the reception. It would look very good to have a Harte there, if you know what I mean. Your family has always carried a lot of weight here in Eclipse Bay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rafe gave a rude grunt and reached for the coffeepot.</p><p>Hannah eyed Perry with renewed caution. \u201cYou promised your boss that you would produce me tomorrow night, didn\u2019t you? And he\u2019s going to be annoyed if I don\u2019t put in an appearance.\u201d</p><p>Perry sighed. \u201cI would take it as a great personal favor, Hannah. Tomorrow night is very, very important to me, careerwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else is on the guest list?\u201d</p> <p>Perry appeared briefly surprised by the question. But he switched gears swiftly. \u201cThe usual local honchos, of course. Plus all the folks who backed Thornley\u2019s previous campaigns. We\u2019ve also got some heavy-duty movers and shakers from Portland coming in. The big catch of the evening is Tom Lydd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom Lydd of Lydd-Zone Software?\u201d Hannah asked.</p><p>\u201cOne and the same.\u201d Perry tried and failed to look modest. \u201cI\u2019ve been courting him for months, trying to get him to endow a research fund at the institute. I don\u2019t mind telling you that the fact that he agreed to attend tomorrow night is a very, very good sign. I\u2019ll have his name on an endowment agreement by the end of the week if all goes well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig coup for you, I imagine,\u201d Hannah said politely.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t get any bigger than Tom Lydd.\u201d Anticipation glittered in Perry\u2019s eyes. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that if I land an endowment from him, my position at the institute will be rock solid. I\u2019ll be in line to take over as director when Manchester retires next year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d Hannah said. She paid no attention to Rafe, who was watching her with a bemused expression.</p><p>Perry chuckled. \u201cI think we can agree that \u2018wow\u2019 is the operative word. I\u2019ve got plans for the institute. Big plans. When I take over I\u2019m going to turn it into one of the most influential social policy think tanks in the country. We\u2019ll be able to make or break political candidates. Anyone in the Northwest with an eye on political office will come to us for consulting advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Perry patted her hand with the same air of condescending approval that he had exuded when he patted Winston\u2019s head. Hannah had the same reaction Winston had had. It was all she could do not to bare her teeth.</p><p>She could tell from the glint in Rafe\u2019s eyes that he had caught her reaction. Perry, however, did not appear to notice. Goal accomplished, he was already halfway out of his chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be very busy tomorrow evening,\u201d he said en route to the front door. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to swing by here to pick you up. Why don\u2019t you meet me at the institute? Say, eight o\u2019clock? Dressy but not formal attire. I\u2019m sure you know the drill.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, Perry.\u201d She followed him back outside onto the porch.</p><p>He paused on the second-to-last step and glanced over her shoulder, evidently assuring himself that he could not be overheard by Rafe. Then he lowered his voice to a confidential tone.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you and Madison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have heard by now that Aunt Isabel left her house to both of us. Rafe and I are discussing how to handle Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>A concerned frown furrowed Perry\u2019s brow. \u201cEveryone in town heard about that will. Isabel must have been going senile there at the end. Why didn\u2019t you let the lawyers work it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe didn\u2019t want to involve lawyers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Perry slanted a thoughtful glance at the door. \u201cProbably thinks he can get a better deal on his own. You\u2019re lucky that I\u2019m the one who happened to drop by this morning. Anyone else might have taken one look at that domestic little scene in the kitchen and jumped to the wrong conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat conclusions?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about. You, Madison, the breakfast dishes. Hell, it isn\u2019t even nine o\u2019clock yet. Looks like the two of you just spent the night together. If that kind of talk got around\u2014\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms, leaned one shoulder against the post, and looked at him. \u201cAre you going to spread the rumor that I\u2019m having an affair with Rafe Madison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Hell, I\u2019m probably the one person in town who doesn\u2019t believe that you let him seduce you on the beach the night Kaitlin Sadler died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your faith in my virtue. But what makes you so sure I didn\u2019t let Rafe seduce me that night?\u201d</p><p>Perry chuckled indulgently. \u201cAs I recall, you were a bit na\u00efve, not to say, downright inhibited about sex in those days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, because I wasn\u2019t interested in getting into the backseat with you that night, it\u2019s highly unlikely that I fooled around with Rafe Madison later? Is that your logic?\u201d</p><p>Perry gave her a knowing look. \u201cAs I said, I realize that there\u2019s nothing going on between the two of you, but a word to the wise. Eclipse Bay is still one very small town. You\u2019d better be a little more careful about appearances in the future. Someone else might get the wrong idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the advice, Perry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne other thing you should know.\u201d He glanced toward the door behind her again and then leaned forward and dropped his voice still lower. \u201cThere\u2019s some serious question about Rafe Madison\u2019s source of income.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you implying, Perry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not one to make accusations, but there\u2019s talk that he may be involved in some less-than-legitimate investments, if you catch my drift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean he may be a gangster?\u201d</p><p>Perry\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cI\u2019m just saying he might be skating a little close to the edge of the legal ice. Who knows what he\u2019s been up to during the past eight years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of my business.\u201d Perry went hastily down the last step. \u201cWell, got to be on my way. Lots to do before tomorrow night. See you at the reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d</p><p>She stayed where she was, lounging against the post, until the Volvo disappeared at the end of the drive. When she finally turned around, she saw Rafe and Winston gazing at her through the screen door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be happy to hear that Perry doesn\u2019t believe for one moment that anything went on here last night,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHell of a relief,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cSomeone who wasn\u2019t quite so high-minded as Decatur might have drawn all the wrong conclusions.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still a jerk,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A speculative look gleamed in his eyes. \u201cAre you serious about going to that political reception?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery serious. Luckily I packed a black dress and a pair of heels. There\u2019s just one more thing I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Rafe looked at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the impression that Decatur thinks he\u2019s going to be your date for the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even be bothered to pick me up. I don\u2019t count that as a date.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot someone else in mind?\u201d</p><p>She gave him her brightest smile. \u201cI figure you owe me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cWhat caused the feud?\u201d Octavia asked after a while.</p><p>Mitchell paused in the process of removing dead blooms from the rosebushes. \u201cA woman. What else?\u201d</p><p>Octavia folded her arms on top of the fence and rested her chin on her hands. She watched him nip off another faded flower. \u201cWhat was her name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer name was Claudia Banner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she very beautiful?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell opened his mouth to say yes, but then he hesitated, thinking back through the years to his first impression of Claudia. \u201cShe was fascinating,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her. But I never really thought of her as beautiful. I just knew that I wanted her so badly that nothing else mattered. Unfortunately, my partner, Sullivan, wanted her too. For a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, for a while?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell snorted softly. \u201cSullivan Harte was always too logical and too coolheaded to let himself be led around by his balls for long. He figured out what Claudia was up to long before I did. I refused to believe him. We fought. End of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell tossed a dead bloom into a sack. \u201cSullivan and I set up Harte-Madison right after we got out of the army. We had us some mighty big dreams in those days. The plan was simple. We\u2019d pick up a few cheap parking lots in downtown Portland and Seattle and then sit on \u2019em for as long as it took.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it took for what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor the boom times to come, naturally. We both knew that sooner or later the Northwest cities were going to be important. What with the Pacific Rim trade taking off, property values were bound to skyrocket. We figured that when the time was right, we\u2019d sell the parking lots to developers and make our fortunes. In the meantime, we\u2019d have income off some very low-maintenance properties in the heart of the cities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did Claudia Banner get involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings started happening faster than we expected. We hired Claudia to help us negotiate the first sale. She\u2019d had experience in that kind of thing, you see. Sullivan and I were novices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did the deal for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Mitchell moved on to the next rosebush. \u201cAnd it was a hell of a deal. Sullivan and I were suddenly rolling in dough. Both richer than we\u2019d ever been in our lives. Couldn\u2019t wait to sell the next parking lot. Claudia found us a buyer right off the bat. More money fell down out of the sky. We were golden. Couldn\u2019t miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere in the middle of the sale of the third lot, a big one in downtown Seattle, Claudia pointed out that Harte-Madison could structure the deal in such a way that we\u2019d be able to keep a stake in the future profits of the office tower that was slated to be built on the site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Mitchell dropped another dead rose into his sack. \u201cUh-oh pretty much sums it up. Sullivan and I had financial stars in our eyes. We trusted Claudia. She took us for a ride and then vanished with the company profits on all three parking lots. Harte-Madison got left with a stack of leveraged debt, and the firm was suddenly out of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you and Sullivan were at each other\u2019s throats,\u201d Octavia mused.</p><p>Mitchell looked at her across the fence, squinting faintly against the weak sun. \u201cI was sure he had somehow seduced Claudia into doing what she did. He figured I was working with her. Sullivan and I cornered each other outside Fulton\u2019s Supermarket one day, and the rest, as they say around these parts, is history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love her very much, then?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell shrugged. \u201cShe was my passion. Naturally, I made a fool of myself over her. Making fools out of themselves over females is something Madison men do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she still your passion?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell examined the dead rose he had just pulled off a bush. \u201cI\u2019ll let you in on a little secret. When you find yourself within spitting distance of ninety, you start viewing things from a slightly different perspective. If Claudia Banner walked back into my life today, I\u2019d ask for my money back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He smiled slightly at the dead rose. \u201cThat\u2019s all. I\u2019ve got other passions these days. That\u2019s another thing I\u2019ve learned over the years. If he gives himself a chance, even a Madison can develop a little common sense when it comes to his passions.\u201d</p><p>Octavia was quiet for a while, watching him work. Eventually she stirred. \u201cYou know, if you leave some of the dead blooms on the bush you\u2019ll get rose hips. They make a very healthy tonic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand rose hip tea,\u201d Mitchell said. He snapped off another dead bloom and stuffed it into his sack. \u201cI\u2019ve got some good ten-year-old whiskey I use when I need a tonic.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>At eight-thirty the following evening, Rafe stood with Jed Steadman at the edge of the crowd and watched Hannah dance with Perry Decatur. Decatur, he was pleased to note, did not appear to be enjoying himself.</p><p>The whole scene bordered on amusing. Rafe could almost feel sorry for Thornley and his retinue. The reception was ostensibly in the politician\u2019s honor, but most of the guests were too busy sneaking covert glances at Hannah and Rafe to pay much attention to Thornley. That was due to the fact that most of those present were locals, including the mayor and his wife, all of the members of the town council, and the owners of several Eclipse Bay businesses.</p><p>Rafe recognized a lot of faces. He knew that the majority of these people had been around long enough to be familiar with the legend of the famous Harte-Madison feud, and virtually all of them had been living in Eclipse Bay eight years ago when Hannah had provided him with his alibi for the night of Kaitlin Sadler\u2019s death. In addition, the entire town was no doubt aware of the terms of Isabel Harte\u2019s will. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Rafe and Hannah had walked into the reception together shortly after eight, they had caused any number of heads to swivel and jaws to drop. A ripple of murmurs had spread through the crowd. An amazing number of people had found an excuse to cross the room to greet them and make conversation.</p><p>Definitely not a banner night for Thornley, Rafe thought. How could his staff have known that their man\u2019s forthcoming announcement of his intention to run for the U.S. Senate seat would take second place to the latest development in the Harte-Madison feud?</p><p>Jed munched a cracker slathered in cream cheese and smoked salmon. \u201cThornley might be the next senator from the great state of Oregon, but he\u2019s having a hard time getting anyone\u2019s attention tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly so far as the locals are concerned. The out-of-town crowd hasn\u2019t got a clue about the reason for the buzz.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue, but almost everyone here is from Eclipse Bay.\u201d Jed eyed Perry and Hannah with an assessing gaze. \u201cDecatur certainly doesn\u2019t look thrilled. Probably didn\u2019t expect you to show up with Hannah.\u201d</p><p>Rafe watched Perry and Hannah come to a halt on the dance floor. \u201cI\u2019m not real concerned with Decatur\u2019s feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I hear, he\u2019s got a lot at stake tonight too. Word is he\u2019s trying to position himself to take over the institute next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my problem.\u201d Rafe picked up a feathered toothpick that had an olive, a bit of cheese, and a mushroom impaled on it. He put the tiny skewer in his mouth and removed the edible portions with his teeth.</p><p>Jed shot him a curious look. \u201cSo what\u2019s up with you and Hannah, anyway?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re conducting negotiations.\u201d</p><p>Jed looked amused. \u201cYeah, I heard about that. Your Porsche was spotted at the Harte place night before last. Word is you\u2019re doing your negotiating in bed.\u201d</p><p>Very deliberately, Rafe turned to look at him. He said nothing.</p><p>Jed grimaced and put up a hand, palm out. \u201cSorry. Can\u2019t help the curiosity. I\u2019m a reporter, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rafe said, \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the message. No more questions of a personal nature about you and Hannah Harte. But speaking as an old friend, I\u2019ll just say that you\u2019d better hope that her family doesn\u2019t get wind of the talk that\u2019s going around town.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about the rest of the Hartes. This is between Hannah and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Whatever you say.\u201d Jed reached for another canap\u00e9 and another topic of conversation. \u201cSome big bucks in this crowd tonight. Just saw Tom Lydd and his new bride arrive. I understand the head of the institute is hoping Lydd will endow a research fund.\u201d</p><p>Rafe followed his gaze to the man with the boyish face and the techie glasses on the far side of the room. Tom Lydd was not yet thirty, but he was already worth millions. \u201cVery smart guy. Took his company public at the right time. His security software is some of the best on the market. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s a buyout on the horizon.\u201d</p><p>Jed glanced at him. \u201cYou follow that kind of business news?\u201d</p><p>Rafe shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a hobby.\u201d</p><p>Jed nodded, satisfied. He turned back to his survey of the crowd. \u201cNot a bad turnout for the institute. A rising politician, a sprinkling of big money, and the right people from the political end of the spectrum. Got to admit, this operation has come a long way since it first opened its doors.\u201d</p><p>Rafe glanced at the tall, photogenic man talking to Tom Lydd. \u201cAnd so has Trevor Thornley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again. He\u2019ll do okay in Washington. He\u2019s got all the right instincts, including good timing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always said that timing was everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure as hell is in politics. Thornley is also into long-range planning. Another big asset. In addition, he\u2019s smart enough not to neglect his home base here in Eclipse Bay. Pols that take their local support for granted always get into trouble fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that he married Marilyn Caldwell didn\u2019t hurt him either,\u201d Rafe said dryly.</p><p>Jed grunted. \u201cYou can say that again. Her father\u2019s money has come in real handy. Like I said, the guy knows how to plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sure pays a lot of attention to the institute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith good reason. He was its first important political client, and he\u2019s still the most faithful. The higher he climbs, the more prestige and power this place acquires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the more it backs him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it works.\u201d Jed swirled the wine in his glass. \u201cI remember covering his first public relations events here. I knew even then that he had what it takes to make it big in politics.\u201d</p><p>Rafe thought about the night he had walked Hannah home. The institute had been ablaze with lights that evening. He had seen them from Bayview Drive. Hannah had mentioned that her parents were attending a reception for a politician named Thornley who had just announced that he was running for the state legislature.</p><p>Rafe hadn\u2019t paid much attention. Politics had been of little interest to him in those days. In any event, he had been too busy obsessing on Hannah\u2019s list of criteria for Mr. Right that night.</p><p>The memory made him look around for his date. He spotted her coming toward him through the crowd. The sight of her sparked a thrill of intense awareness deep in his gut. She looked great, he thought. The snug-fitting little black number she was wearing underscored a whole lot of her best assets, including the neatly curved br**sts, slim waist, and full hips. Her hair swung in a sleek, gleaming curve every time she moved her head. Her legs were incredibly sexy in dark stockings and black high heels.</p><p>The most exciting woman in the room, no doubt about it. At least so far as he was concerned.</p><p>He watched her weave her way toward him. She had Decatur in tow, but Perry looked more irritated than ever, so that was okay for now, Rafe concluded. Irritated was good. Irritated meant that Decatur had not liked the fact that Hannah had brought her own date tonight. The jerk had probably counted on taking her home after the reception, maybe even planned to take up where he had left off that night in the front seat of his car eight years ago.</p><p>Not bloody likely.</p><p>Hannah came to a halt in front of Rafe. She looked flushed and glowing, and there was a sparkle in her eye. He was almost positive that Decatur had nothing to do with the look. She was up to something. He had sensed it when he\u2019d picked her up earlier. She had a scheme cooking tonight. He was content to stand back and watch it unfold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can see that,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse me,\u201d Perry muttered. \u201cGot to say hello to some very big people. I\u2019ll catch up with you later, Hannah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you will,\u201d she said very sweetly. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Perry hurried off into the throng.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look real happy,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cWhat did you do? Step on his toes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saving that for later.\u201d</p><p>Jed looked interested. \u201cThat sounds promising. Anything you want to tell the press?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet, Jed.\u201d Hannah smiled. \u201cBut stay tuned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019ve got some time before the excitement starts,\u201d Rafe said, \u201cmay I have the next dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah!\u201d A man\u2019s voice rose above the din of nearby conversation. \u201cHannah Harte! Is that you?\u201d</p><p>In the next instant, a small knot of people unraveled to allow Tom Lydd to pass between them. He had his wife, a wholesome-looking blonde, in tow. Both were smiling at Hannah with genuine delight.</p><p>\u201cWhat a terrific surprise,\u201d the young Mrs. Lydd said. She threw her arms around Hannah and then stepped aside so that Tom could do the same.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know that you\u2019d be here,\u201d Tom crowed. \u201cThis is great. Nice to see a familiar face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted to see you,\u201d Hannah murmured. \u201cAllow me to introduce Rafe Madison and Jed Steadman. Rafe, Jed, meet Tom and Julie Lydd. Fair warning\u2014Jed is the editor of the Eclipse Bay Journal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem. I\u2019ve got no quarrel with the press. Always been good to Lydd-Zone.\u201d Tom pumped the hands of both men with his trademark boyish enthusiasm. \u201cGreat to meet you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny friend of Hannah\u2019s.\u201d Rafe slanted a quick glance at her. She winked at him. That clarified one thing, he thought. The Lydds were part of whatever plan she had concocted.</p><p>\u201cHannah is more than a friend,\u201d Julie Lydd confided. \u201cShe was our wedding consultant. A true magician, as far as we\u2019re concerned. Tom and I had a vision of what we wanted, but we didn\u2019t have the vaguest idea of how to pull it off. Hannah made it all happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything went off like clockwork.\u201d Tom beamed at his wife. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Julie agreed. \u201cWe wanted the whole thing staged on an alien world, you see. The one Tom created for his first big computer game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking waterfalls, lagoons, architectural features, the works,\u201d Tom continued. \u201cDid the whole thing on our private island up in the Sans Juans. Hannah was brilliant. You can imagine the logistical nightmare involved. Very impressive organizational talents. After we got back from the honeymoon, I called her up and tried to hire her. There\u2019s always room for that kind of management skill at Lydd-Zone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told him that if the bottom ever falls out of the wedding business, I\u2019ll take him up on his offer,\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d Tom assured her genially.</p><p>Hannah smiled warmly. \u201cI love doing weddings for couples who are matched by my sister\u2019s agency.\u201d</p><p>Jed cocked a brow. \u201cYour sister\u2019s a matchmaker?\u201d</p><p>Julie Lydd answered, \u201cTom and I met through Private Arrangements. That\u2019s the name of Lillian Harte\u2019s agency. She uses a very sophisticated computer program to make her matches. Not everyone likes that approach, of course. A lot of folks think it takes the romance out of the process. But it appealed to both Tom and me.\u201d</p><p>Rafe looked at Tom. \u201cI hear you\u2019re thinking of endowing a research fund here at the institute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking into it,\u201d Tom agreed. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the think tank concept.\u201d He turned to Hannah. \u201cYou\u2019re from this neck of the woods. What\u2019s your take on the folks running this place?\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s smile brightened to a blinding glare. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you asked, Tom. I do have some opinions on this operation. Why don\u2019t we find a private place to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Tom took his wife\u2019s arm. \u201cI noticed a small conference room just outside in the main hall. Doubt if anyone would mind if we used it.\u201d</p><p>Jed watched the three vanish back into the crowd. He turned to Rafe, his eyes gleaming with interest. \u201cWhat do you think that was all about?\u201d</p><p>Rafe picked up a knife, dipped it into a bowl of what looked like cheese spread, and smeared some on a cracker. \u201cHow the heck should I know?\u201d</p><p>But he had a pretty good idea, he thought. Hannah was making her move. He couldn\u2019t wait to find out what happened next.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jed asked.</p><p>Rafe grimaced. \u201cThe cheese spread is bland. Could have done with some feta and walnuts.\u201d</p><p>At ten-thirty Hannah emerged from the rest room in time to see Trevor Thornley take the podium to make his big announcement. The lights dimmed over the crowd. Onstage, the politician stood in the center of a dramatic spot. His wife, Marilyn, stood a little behind and just to the right, glowing with wifely pride.</p><p>Hannah had a hunch that Marilyn could take a lot of the credit for the fact that her husband was about to launch a campaign for the U.S. Senate. Marilyn had always been ambitious.</p><p>Trevor Thornley raised his hands for silence.</p><p>\u201cI want to thank everyone here tonight, starting with the faculty of this outstanding think tank. The cutting-edge work done here at the institute in the areas of social and public policy has had a profound impact, not only on how the pundits discuss the issues, but, more importantly, on how politicians and voters think about the challenges that face our nation today.</p><p>\u201cThe greatness of this country lies in its people. I have always...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing, Hannah?\u201d Perry\u2019s voice hissed out of the shadows behind her. His hand closed over her arm. His fingers tightened painfully. He spun her around to face him. \u201cI just got through talking to Tom Lydd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a nice man. And so smart.\u201d She smiled into Perry\u2019s fuming eyes. \u201cI like his wife, too, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLydd just told me that he wouldn\u2019t even consider endowing a research fund here at the institute unless Professor Brad McCallister of Chamberlain College received a joint appointment to the faculty.\u201d</p><p>Hannah widened her eyes. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem. I hear that Brad McCallister has already been nominated by the selection committee. He\u2019ll make a terrific addition to your staff.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Perry\u2019s face was suffused with an angry red color. \u201cDamn it, you had no business interfering in the professional affairs of the institute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t interfere.\u201d Hannah smiled. \u201cI merely told Tom that Brad was brilliant and that the selection committee should be applauded for choosing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLydd told me that he wants McCallister to run the department created by the endowment.\u201d Perry started to sputter. \u201cThe whole damn department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent idea.

You knew that Brad was being considered for a joint appointment here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also heard that you were trying to block it because you\u2019re jealous of Brad\u2019s professional abilities. You\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll outshine you once he gets on the institute staff, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s got nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. In that case you shouldn\u2019t have any problem with the selection committee\u2019s choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou planned this. You agreed to come here tonight because you knew the Lydds would be here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe it was you yourself who mentioned that they had been invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s beside the point.\u201d His voice rose. He grabbed her other arm. Rage flashed in his eyes. \u201cYou think you can pull a stunt like this with me just because you\u2019re a Harte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerry, you tried to use me and the Harte name tonight. I let you do it. In exchange, I used the opportunity you dropped into my lap. I\u2019d say we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou little bitch! You got a kick out of playing the tease eight years ago, and you\u2019re still at it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>It occurred to her that Perry had not learned to curb his temper in the past eight years. It flared as quickly and intensely as it had in the old days.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cThis scene is starting to remind me of another discussion we had once.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about that night you staged the big drama in my car and then jumped out when I got tired of your cock-teasing\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her own temper kicked in. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the night you decided that since you couldn\u2019t seduce me into having sex with you, you would try force instead. What were you thinking, anyway? Were you working on the theory that once I discovered what a great lover you were I\u2019d agree to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr did you convince yourself that if I had sex with you, I\u2019d feel that I had to marry you just for the sake of my reputation?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cIf I ever thought you cared a damn about your reputation, you sure straightened me out when you told Chief Yates and anyone else who would listen that you\u2019d spent the night on the beach with Rafe Madison.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s turbocharger switch suddenly tripped and her temper went into overdrive. \u201cLet me tell you something, Perry Decatur. You are very, very lucky that I did not tell my folks or my brother how you really behaved in the front seat of the car that night. All I ever said was that we\u2019d argued. I never told them how you tried to force yourself on me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes bulged. \u201cHow dare you accuse me of that sort of behavior? No one has done more for women\u2019s issues here at the institute than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the political agenda. We both know what you had in mind that night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were on a date.\u201d Perry\u2019s voice was choked with outrage. \u201cYou freaked out when I tried to kiss you. That was all there was to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not quite how I remember it.\u201d She stabbed her finger against his elegantly knotted white silk tie. \u201cYou thought you could coerce me into marrying you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. Hell, I knew that you were na\u00efve and inhibited in those days, but I didn\u2019t think you were so na\u00efve and so inhibited that you couldn\u2019t recognize a grown man\u2019s normal, healthy sex drive when you saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it, but I gotta tell you, Perry, it didn\u2019t look normal or healthy to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was your fault that there was a small misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an icy smile. \u201cYes, it was on the small side, but I wasn\u2019t going to mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a word for women like you. You can\u2019t blame me for trying to take you up on what you were offering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t offer you anything, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cared for you.\u201d His jaw jerked a couple of times as if he were on the verge of being overcome by emotion. \u201cI wanted to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But only because I was a Harte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was true. I wasn\u2019t nearly as na\u00efve in those days as everyone seems to think. Do you really believe that you were the first man who latched on to me because he saw it as a way to marry into Harte Investments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI resent the implications of that statement,\u201d Perry said furiously. \u201cI\u2019m an academic. I live for the world of ideas, not the world of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break, Perry. You\u2019re a hustler. You always have been a hustler. Eight years ago you saw marriage to me as a quick, easy way to get access to the deep pockets of my father\u2019s company. You also figured you\u2019d have a lot of use for the social and business contacts that my family could provide, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents liked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly because they thought you were bright, charming, and ambitious. Really ambitious. My family admires ambition in a person. Sometimes we admire it a little too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with ambition. It\u2019s the American way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you seem to have overlooked is that there\u2019s a line between ambition and hustling. I\u2019ll admit that it can be mighty thin at times, but it\u2019s there if you care to check for it.\u201d She paused deliberately. \u201cSomething tells me that you haven\u2019t looked for it in years, Perry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just as preachy and prissy as ever, aren\u2019t you?\u201d His mouth tightened. \u201cDo you know how incredibly self-righteous and officious you sound when you go into your lecturing mode? No wonder your engagement fell apart. What man in his right mind wants to go to bed every night with a woman who can\u2019t stop lecturing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She caught her breath. Then she glanced very pointedly at the hands he had clasped around her arms. \u201cLet me go, Perry.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her. His fingers squeezed tighter. \u201cI\u2019ve got news for you. The Miss Virtue act doesn\u2019t work here in Eclipse Bay anymore. You screwed your image eight years ago when you provided Rafe Madison with his alibi. And what do you think will happen when word gets out that the two of you are negotiating the details of your aunt\u2019s will over cozy little breakfasts at your folks\u2019 place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, it won\u2019t be as easy to knee you in the crotch tonight as it was the last time, because this skirt is much tighter than the one I had on that night. But I think I can manage it, and I will if you don\u2019t let me go right now.\u201d</p><p>He released her and jumped back as if he\u2019d just touched an electrically charged wire. \u201cBitch!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think this is about where I came in last time,\u201d Rafe said from the shadows behind Perry. \u201cBut the big difference is that Hannah won\u2019t have to walk home tonight. I\u2019ve got my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison.\u201d Perry jerked around to face Rafe and then took another hasty step back. \u201cThis is a private conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the impression that Hannah didn\u2019t want to continue it any longer.\u201d Rafe glided forward with a deceptively lazy movement. His eyes never left Perry\u2019s face. \u201cWas I mistaken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is none of your business.\u201d Perry\u2019s voice squeaked slightly. \u201cIf you touch me, I\u2019ll file charges.\u201d</p><p>Alarmed by the glint of predatory anticipation in Rafe\u2019s eyes, Hannah stepped quickly between the two men. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Rafe. Everything is under control.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but it would be sort of fun to bounce him around a little. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, I\u2019m serious.\u201d It occurred to her that in her career as a wedding consultant she had honed to a fine art the ability to nip embarrassing public scenes in the bud. Now she was standing in the middle of one that she herself had created. \u201cI do not want anyone hurt here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could take him somewhere else.\u201d Rafe looked hopeful. \u201cPretty quiet down at Eclipse Arch this time of night. No one would hear him squawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d Perry backpedaled several more steps. \u201cHow dare you threaten me! Do you have any idea of just who is out there in that reception room? There\u2019s a future U.S. senator out there. Not to mention a lot of other very important people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Hannah said firmly. \u201cWe do not want to cause a disturbance that will only result in embarrassment for all concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind a little embarrassment,\u201d Rafe assured her. \u201cI\u2019m a Madison.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop threatening me,\u201d Perry howled.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t threaten you.\u201d Rafe looked at Hannah. \u201cDid you hear me threaten him, Hannah?\u201d</p><p>She seized his arm. \u201cYou and I are leaving. Now. The main goal of the evening has been accomplished. Perry has just assured me that he will not stand in the way of Brad\u2019s joint appointment at the institute. In fact, he will do everything he can to ensure that it goes through. Isn\u2019t that right, Perry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be intimidated,\u201d Perry said forcefully. \u201cFurthermore, I am not in charge of the selection committee. You have to remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure, we understand.\u201d Rafe winked. \u201cBut just among the three of us, Brad McCallister\u2019s appointment looks like a sure thing, right?\u201d</p><p>Perry cleared his throat and somehow managed to look down his nose even though he was at least three inches shorter than Rafe. \u201cIf Lydd goes through with his plans to endow a research fund here at the institute, and if he feels strongly about McCallister\u2019s appointment, he will, of course, be able to bring a great deal of influence to bear on the matter.\u201d</p><p>Rafe glanced at Hannah. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to bounce him around a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive. We don\u2019t need lawsuits.\u201d She tugged on his arm. It was like trying to hoist the anchor of a container ship by hand.</p> <p>Rafe gave Perry a look of wistful regret. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re right about one thing, Decatur. When she starts in with the lectures and the good advice, she does sort of take all the fun out of things, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Madison.\u201d Hannah gave up tugging, wrapped her hand around his arm, and leaned forward instead.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d Without warning, Rafe suddenly reversed course, squeezing her hand against his side.</p><p>Hannah, already off balance, with her fingers now trapped under his elbow, had to run a few steps to avoid being dragged.</p><p>\u201cRafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He slowed to a normal pace. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m okay.\u201d She shoved her hair out of her eyes and yanked hard on her skirt. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to become a big fan of political receptions. The speeches are boring and the food is bad.\u201d</p><p>For some inexplicable reason she started to laugh.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>With the exception of a few stray chuckles, she had herself under control by the time they got outside. Rafe glanced at her as they walked to the far side of the lot where the Porsche was parked.</p><p>\u201cTold you he was still a jerk.\u201d He opened the passenger door for her.</p><p>\u201cYou were right.\u201d She slanted him a quick glance. \u201cHow long were you lurking there in that hallway outside the rest rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough to hear most of the conversation.\u201d</p><p>She paused, half in and half out of the cockpit. Then she straightened and went up on her toes. Leaning over the top of the car window, she brushed her mouth very quickly against his cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt really was sweet of you to offer to beat Perry up for me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He lifted his fingers absently to the place where her lips had touched his skin. In the weak glare of the parking lot lamp his eyes were shadowed, impossibly enigmatic. \u201cThat\u2019s me, a real sweet guy.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back quickly and sank into the rich leather upholstery. \u201cBut I really didn\u2019t need rescuing.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Course not. You\u2019re a Harte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Perry is just a jerk with a temper who\u2019s always looking for an angle.\u201d</p><p>Rafe folded his arms on the top of the window frame and looked down at her. \u201cGot news for you. It wasn\u2019t you I was trying to rescue back there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stilled. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just figured I\u2019d better break up that little one-sided skirmish before you cast any more nasty aspersions on Decatur\u2019s masculinity.\u201d</p><p>She was not quite sure how to take that. \u201cOh.\u201d She narrowed her eyes, trying to see his face against the pale light. \u201cYou, uh, care about Perry\u2019s fragile male ego?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly. But intimidation is a precious tool. Push a guy like Decatur too hard, and it can backfire on you. He might try to take revenge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHah. There\u2019s nothing he can do to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to you maybe, but he could sure make life hell at the institute for your friend\u2019s husband.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a beat or two as the implications sank in. \u201cYou\u2019re right. If Brad gets the appointment, he\u2019ll have to work with Perry, won\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not directly, but he won\u2019t be able to avoid him altogether. They\u2019ll be colleagues, after all. I\u2019m sure Brad can take care of himself, but why make things any harder than necessary for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d She drummed he fingers on the edge of the seat and gazed morosely through the front windshield. \u201cI got a little carried away back there, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerfectly natural reaction,\u201d he assured her. \u201cVictory can make a person giddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d She frowned. \u201cSo how come it was okay for you to threaten to bounce him around, but it wasn\u2019t okay for me to make rude remarks?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled with an air of long-suffering patience. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a man and I was making a direct threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, I get it.\u201d She nodded wisely. \u201cMacho challenge stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA challenge that Decatur was never forced to answer or back down from because you intervened, thus saving both his bacon and his pride.\u201d</p><p>She thought about that. \u201cYou did that on purpose, didn\u2019t you? You knew I\u2019d put a stop to anything that looked as if it would turn into real violence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty sure, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cInstinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours or mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cYou mean you just assumed that because I\u2019m female I would automatically move to stop a couple of males from getting into a brawl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had nothing to do with the fact that you\u2019re female. Believe me, I\u2019ve met women who love to watch men fight. But I figured that any successful wedding consultant would have developed finely-tuned radar when it comes to scenes. The last thing anyone wants at a wedding is a brawl, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, that\u2019s true, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d be good at intervening in a confrontation,\u201d he concluded a little too innocently.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you did get in a few zingers,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cI heard them. Decatur took some well-placed hits.\u201d</p><p>She thought about Perry\u2019s words. No wonder your engagement fell apart. What man in his right mind wants to go to bed every night with a woman who can\u2019t stop lecturing? The invisible balloon of her triumph began to deflate.</p><p>She exhaled deeply. \u201cPerry got in a few good thumps of his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. You can handle them. You\u2019re tough, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He started to close the door. \u201cHey, you\u2019re a Harte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m a Harte.\u201d She continued to gaze out into the darkness on the other side of the windshield. \u201cAnd what\u2019s more, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off, startled, when an apparition materialized out of the night directly in front of the car. In the cold glare of the parking lot lamp she saw a figure garbed in black pants, black running shoes, and black gloves. The hood of a black sweatshirt was pulled down over a face smeared with daubs of dark paint.</p><p>Rafe glanced over his shoulder, nodded casually. \u201c \u2019Evening, A.Z. Nice night for recon work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard you were back in town, Rafe,\u201d Arizona Snow said. \u201cAlways figured you\u2019d return someday to expose the bastards who tried to frame you for the Sadler girl\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now that you mention it, that wasn\u2019t exactly the reason I came back,\u201d Rafe replied. \u201cYou see, Hannah and I have this little inheritance problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreamscape,\u201d Arizona said briskly in a cigar- and whiskey-roughened voice. \u201cI know all about that, too. Isabel was a good friend of mine. If you ask me, it makes a great cover for you.\u201d She peered into the Porsche. \u201cNice to see you, Hannah. Come back to help Rafe flush out the rats?\u201d</p><p>Hannah smiled slightly. \u201cGood evening, Arizona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, don\u2019t you look fancy tonight.\u201d Arizona squinted. \u201cWhat the devil are you two doin\u2019 hanging around with this crowd at the institute? Part of your investigation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur being back in town has nothing to do with Kaitlin\u2019s death, A.Z. ,\u201d Rafe said gently. \u201cIt was an accident. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBulldooky. Suckers here at the institute offed her for some reason. She probably knew too much about somethin\u2019 going on up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would she have known anything about the institute?\u201d Hannah asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cKaitlin slept around a lot,\u201d Arizona said. She shot a piercing look at Rafe. \u201cReckon you know that.\u201d</p><p>Rafe cleared his throat but did not say anything. Hannah glanced at him, but he deftly managed to avoid her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAlways figured poor Kaitlin slept with the wrong guy,\u201d Arizona continued. \u201cSomeone connected to the institute. Probably talked in his sleep. Or maybe she just saw some papers or something. They figured they had to get rid of her. The killers must have panicked when Chief Yates started investigatin\u2019, so they decided they needed a fall guy and tried to pin it on you, Rafe. Probably picked you on accounta everyone knew you\u2019d been seeing a lot of Kaitlin that summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn interesting theory,\u201d Rafe said neutrally.</p><p>\u201cBut thanks to Hannah here, the big plan fell apart.\u201d Arizona clenched a fist and pumped it into the air. \u201cOnce in a while we throw a wrench into the bastards\u2019 plans. Gives me hope that someday we\u2019ll expose the whole damned pack of weasels.\u201d</p><p>Rafe glanced at the black plastic binder in her hand. \u201cWhat are you doing here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeping my logbooks up to date, of course.\u201d Arizona tapped the binder with one black-gloved finger. \u201cUntil the rest of you wake up and smell the coffee, someone has to keep an eye on what goes on up here at the institute. Someday folks will realize that this so-called think tank is a cover for a secret government operation that operates outside the law. When that day comes, everyone\u2019s going to be real glad to have my logs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hannah leaned slightly out of the car. \u201cDid you put Rafe and me in your log tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I took down the license plate, make, and model of every car in this lot when it arrived, and that includes friends as well as suspects. Got to keep the record accurate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething to be said for accuracy,\u201d Hannah agreed.</p><p>\u201cI also noted the number of people in each vehicle and, where possible, the identities.\u201d Arizona scowled. \u201cGot to admit, I don\u2019t always recognize everyone these days.

When the truth finally comes out, it will be the accumulation of a lot of tiny facts in these logs that will show how the phantom project operated undetected for so long.\u201d</p><p>Hannah wrinkled her nose. \u201cYou don\u2019t really think that Rafe and I are involved in the conspiracy, do you?\u201d</p><p>Arizona snorted. \u201c \u2019Course not. You\u2019re just a couple of na\u00efve, innocent dupes like most everyone else around here. But I gotta put you in my logs because I gotta have a complete record of all comings and goings. If I start skipping a couple of cars here and there, the government lawyers might try to claim that the logs are incomplete or inaccurate. Can\u2019t give \u2019em any room to squirm when the truth comes out.\u201d</p><p>Rafe inclined his head in sober acknowledgment of that logic. \u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou better believe it. I\u2019ve monitored every reception, every meeting, every special event held here at the institute since the day the place opened.\u201d She held her log aloft again. \u201cAll part of the record.\u201d</p><p>Rafe glanced at his watch. \u201cWell, you can log us out at precisely ten-forty-three. We\u2019re on our way home now.\u201d</p><p>Arizona\u2019s head jerked up and down once in acknowledgment. \u201cGot it.\u201d She clicked a black pen and opened her notebook. \u201cYou two drive carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d Rafe started to close the passenger door.</p><p>\u201cSay, Rafe.\u201d Arizona glanced up sharply. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop by the caf\u00e9 when you get a chance? About time we updated that menu you worked out when you used to cook for me. The college crowd seems happy enough, but after all these years I\u2019m getting a little tired of fixing the same stuff day in and day out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll drop by soon,\u201d Rafe said.</p> <p>\u201cAppreciate it.\u201d Arizona aimed the pen at Hannah. \u201cYou come with him. Always did like the notion of you two gettin\u2019 together. Told Isabel so.\u201d</p><p>Hannah braced one hand against the door to keep Rafe from closing it. \u201cMy aunt discussed her intention to leave the house to us with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure.\u201d Arizona\u2019s beefy shoulders rose and fell beneath the black sweatshirt. \u201cMe and Isabel went back a long way. She talked to me about her plans for Dreamscape because she knew that everyone else would think she was crazy for trying to end the feud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not you,\u201d Hannah murmured.</p><p>\u201cNope, not me. I told her to go for it. Always knew the feud had been caused by the sonsabitches who opened the institute. The bastards probably wanted to break up Harte-Madison because they knew the company would try to block their plans to establish this damned think tank.\u201d Arizona sighed. \u201cUnfortunately, their scheme worked all too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, A.Z.\u201d Rafe closed the car door very firmly.</p><p>Hannah watched Arizona disappear back into the shadows. Rafe circled around the tail of the Porsche and got in behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cYou think we\u2019re a couple of na\u00efve, innocent dupes?\u201d Hannah asked.</p> <p>\u201cSure, but what the hell.\u201d Rafe turned the key in the ignition and put the car in gear. \u201cI\u2019d rather be a happy, carefree dupe who gets to go home at ten-forty-three than an ever-vigilant guardian who has to spend nights running around in black sweats recording license plates.\u201d</p><p>Hannah glanced at the rows of parked cars as Rafe drove out of the lot. \u201cStill, it\u2019s hard to believe anyone could get a lot of satisfaction out of writing down license plate numbers. Just think, she\u2019s been doing it for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dedicated to the cause of ultimately exposing the secret government conspiracy operating here at the institute. As hobbies go, it probably beats watching television.\u201d</p><p>Hannah contemplated that as she gazed at the scene spread out below the hillside. There was no fog tonight\u2014at least, there wasn\u2019t any yet. The bay was a sweep of midnight velvet ringed and studded with the lights of the town and the pier.</p><p>She could make out the neon sign that marked the Total Eclipse Bar and Grill. On the opposite side of the street, the town\u2019s single gas station was closed for the night. Near the pier was a row of darkened shops that featured rustic antiques, inexpensive beach souvenirs, and seascapes. The neighboring marina was largely unlit. The boats sheltered there were invisible against the dark expanse of the water.</p><p>\u201cArizona Snow is a nice person in a lot of ways, and she\u2019s definitely interesting,\u201d Hannah said after a while. \u201cBut she\u2019s not what anyone would call normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe older I get,\u201d Rafe said, shifting gears to negotiate the curving road that led down from the institute, \u201cthe more I\u2019m convinced that the only good, working definition of \u2018normal\u2019 is the fact that you\u2019re still walking around outside and not locked up in a padded cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll buy that definition. It\u2019s as good as any other I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You know, for a guy who never made it through his second year of college, I say some smart stuff sometimes.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wryly. \u201cAnd so modest, too.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a quick glance. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the sudden depression here? Losing the glow of victory so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the old saying, all glory is fleeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d He accelerated at the foot of the hill. \u201cYou have lost the sparkle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate when that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Victory over the jerk should buy you more than a moment of exuberance. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got a surefire cure for what ails you.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head on the back of the seat and studied his hard profile from beneath lowered lashes. It felt good to be here with him in the intimate confines of the powerful car. She wondered what her family would say if they knew where she was tonight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For some reason the answer did not matter at that moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the cure?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>A wicked expression, barely visible in the eerie light given off from the instrument panel, flickered across his face. \u201cCome home with me, my sweet, na\u00efve little dupe, and I will show you.\u201d</p><p>She knew the smart answer to that invitation. The only intelligent, sane, reasonable, logical, suitably Harte-like response was to tell him that she had to get home to her dog.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>She finished the last of the key lime pie and put down her fork with a sigh of mingled satisfaction and regret. The pie had been delicious, tangy and smooth on the tongue, with a flavor that conjured up images of the tropics. The slice had been arranged with artistic precision on the plate and trimmed with a paper-thin almond wafer and a slice of lime.</p><p>She looked at Rafe, who was sitting on the other side of the old oak table. He had removed his tie, unbuttoned the collar of his pristine white shirt, and rolled the sleeves up to the elbows. Nothing had changed since that night on the beach, she thought. He wasn\u2019t the handsomest man she had ever met, but he was far and away the sexiest.</p><p>\u201cThe pie was incredible.\u201d She tried to focus on something other than sex. It wasn\u2019t easy when she was near Rafe, she had discovered. And the problem seemed to be growing worse.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I went a little overboard with the lime zest?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou can never have too much zest, I always say.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like sparkle, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, when it comes to cooking, you\u2019ve got a real talent. Why haven\u2019t you ever opened a restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting until the time was right.\u201d</p><p>She put her elbows on the table. \u201cOkay, I can\u2019t stand the suspense any longer. If you aren\u2019t the owner of a five-star restaurant, how did you finance the Porsche and all this free time you seem to have on your hands?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a cryptic smile. \u201cStarting to wonder about all those rumors you\u2019ve heard concerning my career as a gangster?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt never crossed my mind for one second that you might be a gangster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He thrust his legs out in front of him, leaned back in the chair, and crossed his feet at the ankles. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong clothes. Everyone knows gangsters wear shiny suits with big lapels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s East Coast gangsters you\u2019re talking about. Out here on the West Coast, your average wise guy prefers a more laid-back look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Well, that blows that theory. So what have you been doing for the past eight years? And don\u2019t give me that line about working in a hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did work in a hotel. For a while. I\u2019ve also done a little investing.\u201d He paused. \u201cDay trading.\u201d</p><p>Computer stock trading took nerves of steel and a fine sense of timing, she thought. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that\u2019s an easy way to lose your shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>She grinned. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of the market now,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cI took my profits a few months ago and stuck them into nice, boring bonds and my own portfolio of high techs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She held up a hand. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me. It\u2019s disconcerting to hear a Madison talk seriously about sound financial planning. Ruins the image of wild, impulsive behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m bad, you ought to talk to Gabe sometime. He\u2019s obsessed with making money and doing deals.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cA cold-blooded Madison? Hard to imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe has his share of the Madison hot blood. But he\u2019s channeled it into Madison Commercial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it.\u201d Hannah hesitated. \u201cEver cooked for your grandfather?\u201d</p><p>He looked genuinely startled. \u201cNo. Bryce does all the cooking at Mitchell\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you invite Mitchell to dinner here at Dreamscape?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cWhat put that idea into your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It just occurred to me that your interest in cooking parallels his in gardening. Creative outlets that you both approach with passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should invite him to dinner.\u201d</p><p>Rafe contemplated her for a long, brooding moment. \u201cYou just can\u2019t help yourself, can you?\u201d he said at last. \u201cYou can\u2019t resist handing out the advice.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled slowly and sank back into her chair. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I can\u2019t seem to stop. Do you think I should seek professional help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaste of money. You\u2019d probably end up giving advice to the therapist on your own dime.\u201d He got to his feet and stacked the dishes. \u201cGo on into the solarium. I\u2019ll bring the coffee out there.\u201d</p><p>Bemused and feeling oddly flattened, she got up from the table and walked out of the kitchen.</p><p>She wandered into the glass-walled room, not bothering to turn on the lights. Drawn by the darkened view, she went to stand at the windows. Rafe was right. She really ought to stop handing out advice to all and sundry. Nobody ever took it anyway.</p><p>Morosely she gazed out across the expanse of the curving bay toward the lights of the small harbor and the pier. Music stole softly into the dark shadows of the solarium, curling around her with a lover\u2019s touch. It was a slow, sultry number that sounded as if it had been born in a smoky nightclub and had never seen the light of day.</p><p>Rafe came through the doorway with a tray in his hands. Without a word he set the coffee and the mugs down on a table. Then he straightened and walked toward her.</p><p>A chill of intense awareness swept through her.</p><p>So it was dark and there was a torchy tune swirling in the air. So there was a sexy man who could cook like an angel in the immediate vicinity. So what?</p><p>Think of Winston.</p><p>Rafe came to a stop directly behind her. \u201cDid I tell you how good you look in that dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Noncommittal. That was always a safe way to play it.</p><p>He put his hands on her shoulders and turned her slowly around to face him. \u201cYou look fantastic in it.\u201d</p><p>Think of Winston.</p><p>Rafe took her into his arms and began to move, very slowly, to the very slow music.</p><p>He might as well have been making love to her, she thought. The effect was the same. It felt like things were melting down below. Unable to resist the temptation, she put her head cautiously on his shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His arms tightened very deliberately around her. His thumb touched the base of her spine.</p><p>Think of Winston.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cWould you mind if I asked you a purely hypothetical question?\u201d</p><p>He put his mouth against her temple. \u201cI live to answer hypothetical questions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn your considered opinion, do you think that the average man would be hesitant to become involved in a romantic relationship with a woman who was prone to lecture him in an officious, prissy manner?\u201d She swallowed. \u201cEven though she was right most of the time?\u201d</p><p>He said nothing for a moment, dancing in thoughtful silence.</p><p>\u201cThe average man, maybe,\u201d he finally conceded.</p><p>Gloom settled on her, darker than fog. \u201cI was afraid you were going to say that.\u201d</p><p>They danced for another moment or two. Then he brought her to a halt near the window.</p> <p>\u201cMy turn to ask you a hypothetical question,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m average?\u201d</p><p>She raised her head very swiftly from his shoulder. \u201cNo. No, definitely not. You\u2019re a lot of things, Rafe Madison, but you are not average. Not in any way.\u201d</p><p>She could feel him smiling into her hair.</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t see that we have a problem here,\u201d he said.</p><p>He tilted her chin up and kissed her.</p><p>She stopped thinking of Winston.</p> <p>Chapter 12</p><p>She wanted him. He could feel it in the way she held him. The fine trembling in her body told him of her gathering excitement. He could not recall the last time a woman had shivered in his arms like this.</p><p>He realized his own hands were not completely steady.</p><p>Somewhere inside him there was a cloudburst. A hot rain poured down, drenching regions that had been parched and dry for what seemed like forever. Suddenly there was a rain forest where there had been only desert. The raw power, the driving need, and the exquisitely painful anticipation that shafted through him was the pulse of life itself.</p><p>He had promised himself that when this moment came he would take his time and savor the experience. He wasn\u2019t a kid with his girlfriend in the backseat of a car. He was a man who had some experience. He knew the risks of rushing things. But the urgent hunger was an ungovernable force that threatened to overwhelm his will.</p><p>\u201cRafe?\u201d Hannah speared her fingers through his hair and then tightened them around his neck. \u201cI never intended... I mean, I didn\u2019t expect to end up like this tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me it\u2019s too soon?\u201d He kissed her throat. \u201cThat we don\u2019t know each other well enough?\u201d He counted delicate little vertebrae with his fingertips until he reached the hollow of her back. \u201cBecause if you want to stop this, you\u2019d better say something fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>He froze, his palm on the curve of her hip, and raised his head to look down at her. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t want to do this?\u201d</p><p>She smiled slowly. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to stop.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered and pulled her close again. \u201cDon\u2019t scare me like that. My heart won\u2019t take the shock.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh was tiny and fraught with nervous energy. It sent sparkles of light through him. In the next moment the small sound transmuted into a sweet, anxious murmur. Her kisses became extravagant, quick, eager. Delicious.</p><p>He was tight and hard and edgy now. Every muscle straining. He could no longer think clearly. The fragrance of her body was a disturbing, disorienting incense that clouded his brain. He knew that he was swiftly losing control, but he could not seem to work up any real concern about the problem.</p><p>She wanted him.</p><p>That was all that mattered.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs,\u201d he said against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can make it that far.\u201d</p><p>She fumbled with his shirt. Somewhere in the shadows a button bounced and pinged on the tile floor. Her fingers spread across his chest, warm and soft.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try real hard to make it up the stairs,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her response was muffled against his bare skin. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He guided her toward the door. Simultaneously he found the zipper of her dress and lowered it the length of her back. The top half of the garment fell to her waist. He saw that the manufacturer of her silky little black bra had skimped on fabric. The garment did not cover the top half of her br**sts.</p><p>Gathering her against his side, he worked feverishly on the clasp of the bra. At the same time he half carried, half dragged her across the hall. It was an awkward process. What the hell was the matter with him tonight? He usually didn\u2019t have so much trouble doing two things at once.</p><p>The bra finally fell away. He had her as far as the stairs now. He heard a soft clatter and realized that one of her high heels had come off.</p><p>She lost the second one just as he got them both to the third step.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Her hands gripped his shoulder, small nails tattooing his skin. She kissed him wildly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he worked his way up the stairs with Hannah in his arms. It wasn\u2019t easy. She wasn\u2019t helping him. He missed a step when she sank her teeth lightly into his bicep. She nearly lost her balance when he retaliated by kissing one taut nipple. Both of them grabbed the banister to keep from falling.</p><p>Hannah was quicksilver in his grasp. She slipped and slithered around him. He groaned aloud when he felt her hand on the buckle of his belt. Halfway to his goal, he looked up at the landing. It was lost in distant shadows.</p><p>\u201cNot much farther,\u201d he said hoarsely. He was lying to both of them, he thought. The top of the stairs was in another universe.</p><p>\u201cClose enough.\u201d She had his belt undone now. Her fingers were on his zipper.</p><p>\u201cBetter wait until we get upstairs,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d One nylon-clad foot glided up his leg.</p><p>He felt the heat from the inside of her thigh and sucked in his breath. They were never going to make it at this rate. It was time to take unilateral action.</p><p>He picked her up, settled her across his shoulder, and clamped one arm across the back of her legs to hold her there.</p><p>\u201cRafe.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her breathless, sensual laughter. With total determination he took a firm grip on the banister and hauled them both to the top of the stairs. There he turned right and went down the hall to the bedroom he had chosen the day he arrived. It was a big one, with a sweeping view of the bay.</p><p>He went swiftly through the doorway and dumped her onto the quilt that covered the old-fashioned four-poster. She lay there amid the pillows, then reached for him with both arms. He fell on top of her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kissed her throat while he rummaged with one hand in the drawer of the nightstand. He knew the box of condoms was in there somewhere. He had put it there this evening before leaving the house. Optimism had been riding high at that point. Probably because he had had several engaging fantasies in the shower and had emerged semi-erect. A man was always at his most optimistic when he had a hard-on.</p><p>When he couldn\u2019t immediately locate the condoms, alarm set in.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Hannah\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p> <p>Mercifully his fingers closed around the box. A sense of victory soared through him. \u201cYeah, sure. I\u2019m fine. Nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d he whispered. \u201cExcellent, in fact.\u201d</p><p>She slid her hands inside the wings of his unbuttoned shirt. Her palms were silken on his skin. Breathing took serious effort now.</p><p>By the time he was ready, most of their clothing had magically disappeared. He lowered himself between her legs. She raised her knees and tightened her thighs around him.</p> <p>He cupped her with his hand. She was wet and hot and swollen. When he used the pad of his thumb on the small bud, she quivered violently. His own body nearly exploded in response.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she ordered, clutching furiously at him. \u201cNow, please, yes. Do it now.\u201d</p><p>He needed no further urging. If he didn\u2019t do it now, it would not get done at all.</p><p>He fitted himself to her and started to enter her carefully. She was snug and tight and damp. He tried to take it slow, but when she lifted herself against him, he abandoned all attempt at sophistication and restraint.</p><p>There was nothing sophisticated or restrained about how he felt at this moment.</p><p>He thrust deeply into her, losing himself in a world of intense sensation. He heard her soft, exultant cry and felt her body grip him with fierce satisfaction. Her head tipped back. Her lips parted in a soundless scream.</p> <p>She climaxed immediately. He wanted to indulge himself in the pleasure of her release before he surrendered to his own, but he had only a few seconds to enjoy the experience. The small shivers that went through her were more than he could stand. He tried to swallow his own roar of triumph and exultation, but he did not succeed.</p><p>She did not doze, but she was vaguely aware of a sense of detachment from time and reality. It was a pleasant interlude that she knew would not last forever. Nevertheless, she was reluctant to emerge from it.</p><p>Rafe sprawled on his back beside her, big and warm enough to heat the whole bed to a cozy temperature. He had one arm behind his head, the other around her. She opened her eyes partway and studied him in the shadows. He looked as relaxed as a large cat after a successful hunt. She raised her head for a better look. Her glance fell on the green numbers of the radio clock.</p><p>\u201cWinston.\u201d She sat up quickly.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Rafe slitted his eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get home to Winston.\u201d She shoved aside the quilt and scrambled off the bed. \u201cHe\u2019ll be worried.\u201d</p><p>Rafe looked amused. \u201cYou think your dog worries when you\u2019re a little late coming home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so maybe he won\u2019t be worried, exactly.\u201d She spotted her panties on the floor and dove for them. \u201c \u2018Concerned\u2019 might be a better word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019ll certainly need to go outside by now.\u201d She stepped into the panties and looked around for her bra. It was nowhere to be found. \u201cHe\u2019s been cooped up in that house for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it easy.\u201d Rafe thrust aside the quilt and got up from the edge of the bed. \u201cI\u2019m sure Winston is fine. He\u2019s probably sound asleep.\u201d</p><p>He was right, she thought. This panicky sensation nibbling at her insides had nothing to do with Winston. She was experiencing some sort of bizarre reaction to what had just happened here in this room. What in the world was wrong with her?</p><p>\u201cHave you seen my bra?\u201d she asked. She was glad the lights were still off. She could feel the heat in her cheeks.</p><p>He paused in the act of fastening his trousers and reached out to turn on the bedside light. He swept the room with a deliberate look. \u201cNope. Must have left it back there on the stairs.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a suspicious glare, almost certain that he was teasing her. She glanced down and saw the toe of her panty hose sticking out from under the bed. Even from here she could see the massive run in the foot of the stocking. With a sigh she shimmied into her dress and groped wildly for the zipper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d Rafe\u2019s voice was softer now. He walked across the room to stand behind her. His fingers caught hold of the zipper tab and raised it straight to the base of her neck in a single motion.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her voice sounded stiff and prim, even to her own ears.</p><p>\u201cSure. Anytime.\u201d</p><p>She did not dare look at him now. Instead she began to hunt for her shoes.</p><p>Rafe shrugged into his shirt. He did not bother to button it. Folding his arms, he lounged against the bedpost and watched her frantic search.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think your shoes made it upstairs, either,\u201d he offered eventually.</p><p>\u201cGood grief.\u201d She straightened quickly, shoved the hair out of her eyes, and bolted for the door.</p><p>He followed her at a more leisurely pace. She ignored him, horrified by the sight of bits and pieces of her clothing strewn on the stairs and in the hall. What had come over her? She didn\u2019t do things like this. She must have lost it, big time.</p><p>By the time Rafe got downstairs she had retrieved her shoes and her bra and had the door in sight. Clutching her lingerie in one hand, she focused intently on the only thing that mattered at that moment: escape from the scene of her wild, frenzied, totally uncharacteristic passion.</p><p>Rafe\u2019s voice stopped her cold just as she was about to twist the knob.</p><p>\u201cYou want to tell me what\u2019s wrong, Hannah?\u201d</p><p>For a second she could not breathe. She looked down at her trembling fingers. \u201cI think I\u2019m having an anxiety attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can see that. The question is, why?\u201d</p><p>His laconic tone chased away some of the panic. Anger rushed in to fill the empty space. This was all his fault. If he hadn\u2019t fed her that incredible key lime pie, if he hadn\u2019t turned on the music, if he hadn\u2019t danced with her in the darkness...</p><p>If...</p><p>She whirled around, hands behind her on the knob, and glowered at him.</p><p>\u201cPanic attacks happen,\u201d she said grimly. \u201cNot my fault.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He studied her for a long, brooding moment. \u201cSecond thoughts already?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>She drew a deep, steadying breath. A semblance of reason returned. She could not blame any of this on him. She was the one who had gone crazy here. Act like a grown-up.</p><p>She cleared her throat. Her fingers tightened on the doorknob. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m not being real cool, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but that\u2019s not the problem. Nobody ever said you had to be cool.\u201d He did not move, just stood there in the hall, watching her. \u201cBut for the record, I\u2019d really like to know what went wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d She released her death grip on the doorknob and shoved her fingers through her hair. She met his eyes. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right. Rafe, I need to ask you a question, and you have to tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d She swept out a hand to indicate the searing passion that had begun in the solarium and ended in his bedroom. \u201cWhat just happened between us. It didn\u2019t have anything to do with Dreamscape, did it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had your wicked way with me, and now you\u2019re trying to leave as quickly as you can. Some dumb excuse about a dog, I think. I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re not even going to call me in the morning, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Rafe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to think?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, stunned. \u201cDo you really believe that I just... I just\u2014\u201d She broke off because her voice was threatening to get lost in a squeaky soprano. She swallowed and tried again. \u201cYou think that I just seduced you in order to manipulate you into selling your half of this place to me?\u201d</p><p>He let her wait a beat. She felt perspiration between her shoulder blades.</p><p>Then he smiled slightly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>She sagged back against the doorjamb. \u201cI should hope not. Good Lord, I don\u2019t do things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>She looked at him for a long time. Gradually the tension inside her began to seep away. She had gone mad, she thought.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, of course not.\u201d She rubbed her brow. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I freaked. I guess I\u2019m just a little stressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a busy night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d She straightened away from the door, composed herself. \u201cSpeaking of which, I think it\u2019s time you took me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He fished keys out of a pocket. \u201cOn one condition.\u201d</p><p>She jerked back around. \u201cWhat condition?\u201d</p> <p>He walked past her and opened the door. \u201cYou gotta promise to call me in the morning.\u201d</p><p>He was gone, out into the night, before she could think of an appropriate response. She heard the less than civilized growl of the Porsche engine. The lights came on, blinding her.</p><p>A vivid mental image of a hapless deer paralyzed by the beams of an oncoming car galvanized her into action.</p><p>She slammed the front door shut behind herself. Hand held high to shield her eyes from the merciless glare of the lights, she rushed toward the passenger side door.</p><p>Winston greeted her with a yawn and his customary good cheer. He bestowed an equally enthusiastic welcome on Rafe. Then he trotted across the porch, went down the front steps, and disappeared into the privacy of the bushes. It was obvious that he was in no great rush to use the facilities.</p><p>Rafe looked at her, eyes gleaming. \u201cYou\u2019re in luck. He doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s been worrying too much.\u201d</p><p>She felt the heat rise in her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already admitted that my little panic attack back there was an overreaction to stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStress, huh? Sounds like another excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>He caught her chin on the heel of his hand and kissed her very deliberately. He stopped just as she felt the breathlessness setting in again.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he said. His eyes were shadowed and intense in the yellow porch light. \u201cYou\u2019ve got my number at Dreamscape and my cell phone number. Call me if Winston goes into his alert mode again tonight, okay? I can be here in less than ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis alert mode?\u201d She had forgotten all about Winston\u2019s nocturnal prowling. \u201cOh, right. That\u2019s very kind of you, but I really don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re having trouble thinking tonight. You\u2019ve already explained that.\u201d He went down the steps. \u201cJust call me if he does the sentry thing.\u201d</p><p>She held the door open for Winston. Rafe waited until they were both inside the house before he drove away into the darkness.</p><p>Twenty minutes later she emerged from the bathroom clad in her primmest nightgown. It was a Victorian number, pure white, with long sleeves, a ribbon-trimmed neckline, and a hem that fell to her ankles. She glanced once at herself in the mirror and was satisfied with the demure gown. It was definitely not the sort of nightwear favored by women who were in the habit of leaving their undergarments strewn on the staircase while they indulged themselves in a mad, passionate fling with the most exciting man in town.</p><p>Make that the most exciting man she had ever met.</p><p>An aberration. That was what it had been. It had been much too long since she\u2019d had anything resembling a normal sex life. Aberrant behavior was to be expected under such circumstances.</p><p>With a sigh, she switched off the lamp. Winston was already in position at the foot of the bed. He raised his head from his paws when she went to the window that overlooked the bay. She could feel him watching her as she opened the drapes.</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you even a little bit concerned about the fact that I was so late getting home?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He did not dignify that with a response.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d</p><p>She padded through the shadows to the side window and pulled the curtains wide. She was about to turn back to the bed when she glimpsed the sheen of moonlight on metal between two trees.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world?\u201d</p><p>She gripped the window ledge and peered more closely at the glint. A closer look verified her first impression. There was a car parked in a stand of trees near the road. In that position, whoever was in the vehicle had a clear view of the house and the entrance of the long drive.</p><p>She glanced at Winston. He had his muzzle on his paws. Not in alert mode. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She closed the drapes again, switched on the light, and picked up the phone. She punched in one of the numbers she had jotted down on the pad beside the bed.</p><p>Rafe answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out there in the bushes?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing for which I could get arrested.\u201d</p> <p>A small thrill of pleasure rippled through her at the sound of his voice; low, sexy, and just rough enough around the edges to bring back some very recent, very heated memories.</p><p>She turned off the light again. Carrying the phone, she went back to the window and opened the drapes a second time. She gazed out into the darkness, searching for the metallic gleam of the Porsche\u2019s fender.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>Talking to him now on the phone was a lot easier than facing him after that interlude in his bedroom, she discovered. There was a strange intimacy to the experience, but at the same time the distance allowed her to finally relax.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re keeping watch, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked. \u201cWaiting to see if whatever alarmed Winston shows up again.\u201d</p><p>Silence hummed briefly on the other end.</p><p>\u201cJust thought I\u2019d stick around for a few minutes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary. I told you I\u2019d call if Winston starts prowling. Go home, Rafe. We\u2019ll be fine, honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only hang around for a little while. Whatever it is showed up between midnight and two the last couple of times, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost two. I\u2019ll leave soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She clutched the phone more tightly. \u201cRafe, about tonight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize for acting like a complete idiot. Asking you whether or not what happened between us was all about Dreamscape was inexcusable. I knew better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever is going on between you and me, it\u2019s not about the house.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cA lot of people in town will think it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone in Eclipse Bay thinks that I seduced you on the beach eight years ago, too.\u201d The dismissive shrug in his voice was loud and clear. \u201cDo you really care what people think?\u201d</p><p>She contemplated the question for a long moment. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf what happened tonight wasn\u2019t about Dreamscape, what was it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question. When you figure out the answer, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you remind me an awful lot of Winston when it comes to communicating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a guy thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to call me in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone and climbed into bed. She did not even attempt to close her eyes until she heard the muted purr of his car\u2019s engine recede into the distance sometime later. She glanced at the clock. It was two-fifteen.</p><p>At the foot of the bed, Winston was sound asleep.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>The next morning she waited until ten o\u2019clock to call.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to look too eager,\u201d she told Winston as she punched out the number on the kitchen cordless. \u201cGuys sense it if you\u2019re too eager.\u201d</p><p>Winston looked bored. He went to the door and looked back at her with an expectant expression.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already been out twice this morning.\u201d She listened to the phone ring on the other end. \u201cI think you\u2019re getting addicted to the beach.\u201d</p><p>It was true, she thought. Winston\u2019s approval of their new lifestyle was evident. He loved running around in Dead Hand Cove with its myriad smells and odd inhabitants. He clearly delighted in his off-leash freedom.</p><p>Rafe finally answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cThis is Madison.\u201d He sounded impatient, as if his attention was on something vastly more interesting than a phone call.</p><p>She frowned briefly at the instrument in her hand and then held it to her ear again.</p><p>\u201cSorry if I\u2019m interrupting anything important,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cI thought you were expecting my call.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Morning, honey.\u201d Rafe\u2019s voice warmed measurably. \u201cI\u2019m a little busy at the moment. Can I get back to\u2014hang on a second.\u201d He broke off abruptly and spoke to someone else. \u201cTake a good look at the wiring in that panel, will you, Torrance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney?\u201d Hannah pondered the simple endearment. Rafe had never called her honey, not even last night in the middle of making love to her. Of course, he had not made a lot of conversation in bed.</p><p>\u201cHell, there should be insulation in that wall,\u201d Rafe continued in a muffled voice. \u201cYeah, I can see the pipes. That\u2019s why I want insulation in it. Who wants to listen to every flush and shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPipes?\u201d Hannah stopped trying to tease out the little nuances of \u201choney\u201d and focused on the more disturbing word. \u201cRafe, what\u2019s going on there? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting an assessment of the condition of the plumbing and wiring,\u201d he said casually. \u201cThe good news is that Isabel had it all brought up to code a few years ago.\u201d His paused to speak to someone else again. \u201cIs that copper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, who are you talking to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Willis brothers are here,\u201d he said into the phone. \u201cI\u2019m having them go over the place from top to bottom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got Walter and Torrance Willis there?\u201d She shot up from the kitchen chair. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust getting together some preliminary estimates to see how much it will cost to put in the inn and restaurant,\u201d he said with breathtaking innocence.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d She grabbed her keys and broke into a run, heading to the door. \u201cNot without my permission, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both agreed we wanted to open an inn here at Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t even decided how we\u2019re going to deal with the legalities of ownership. Don\u2019t you dare touch a thing until I get there.\u201d</p><p>Winston saw her heading for the door. He started to bounce a little.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m just getting some preliminary figures together,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>\u201cI am coming over there right now. You listen to me, Rafe Madison. I own half of that house. Don\u2019t you dare touch a single thing until I get there. And don\u2019t let the Willis brothers touch anything, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little late to call them off,\u201d Rafe said reflectively. \u201cThey\u2019re already pretty deep into the plumbing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>She tossed the cordless phone down on the hall table and rushed outside to the car. Winston followed. He leaped into the passenger seat and sat back with an air of anticipation.</p><p>\u201cI knew last night was all about Dreamscape,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>She sailed through the front door of the big house a short time later, ready for battle. Winston trotted in right behind her, greeted Rafe briefly, and began a tour of the kitchen.</p><p>Rafe glanced at his watch as Hannah came to a seething halt in front of him. \u201cSix minutes and twenty-two seconds. You made good time.\u201d</p><p>She planted her hands on her hips. \u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d</p><p>Rafe was saved the necessity of responding to the question by the small, neatly made man who chose that moment to wander out into the hall.</p><p>Compact and completely bald, Walter Willis had always reminded Hannah of an android. There was a mechanical precision about his movements that lacked the casual human element. His speech was clipped and crisp. The starched creases in his work clothes never softened. It was as if he had been designed and constructed under controlled, sterile conditions in a high-tech manufacturing plant.</p> <p>\u201cHannah.\u201d Walter wiped his hands on a spotless rag that dangled from his belt. \u201cGood to see you again. Heard you were back in town.\u201d</p><p>Hannah was amazed by her self-mastery. She managed to veil the fuming expression she knew had been blazing in her eyes. She even summoned up what she hoped looked like a genuinely pleasant smile of greeting.</p><p>\u201cHello, Walter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly has.\u201d Walter turned his head and called to his brother over his shoulder. \u201cTorrance, come on out here and say hello to Hannah.\u201d</p><p>Torrance stepped out of the laundry room. His expression brightened instantly. He hoisted a pipe wrench in greeting. \u201cHey, there, Hannah. Welcome back.\u201d</p><p>The Willises were identical twins, but it was easy to tell them apart because, sartorially speaking, they were polar opposites. If Walter had been engineered to precise specifications on a futuristic computerized assembly line, Torrance had been someone\u2019s home garage project.</p> <p>Rather than shaving off what little hair he still possessed as Walter did, Torrance wore his thin, scraggly locks in a ponytail that stuck out through the opening at the back of his cap. The trailing end of a snake tattoo slithered out below one sleeve. His coveralls were stained with what looked like several eons\u2019 worth of grease, grime, and pizza sauce. The only things that were clean and shiny about him were the tools in the wide belt that he wore low on his hips.</p><p>\u201cIsabel always said the two of you would come back for good someday.\u201d Torrance turned to Walter. \u201cDidn\u2019t she say exactly that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sure did,\u201d Walter agreed. \u201cIf she said it once, she must have said it a hundred times. I believe the last time was the day she had us out here to install the washing machine in the laundry room.\u201d</p><p>Torrance nodded. \u201cBelieve it was.\u201d He winked at Hannah and Rafe. \u201cTold us she wanted to leave everything in good working order for you two.\u201d</p><p>Willis shook his head indulgently. \u201cThat Isabel. Always did have a real romantic streak.\u201d</p><p>Hannah narrowed her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you two have some plumbing you should be looking at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlumbing. Whoa. Almost forgot. You heard the lady,\u201d Torrance continued. \u201cReckon we better get back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Walter\u2019s head jerked once in a mechanical nod. \u201cPlumbing. Listen, you two, don\u2019t pay any heed to the talk that\u2019s going around town these days. Bound to be some for a while, given what happened the night the Sadler girl died and all and now this business with Isabel leaving you the house. But it\u2019ll fade quick enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope so,\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>Torrance clapped Rafe on the shoulder. \u201cJust want you both to know that me and my brother here never once thought you\u2019d had anything to do with Kaitlin Sadler\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d Rafe replied.</p><p>Walter pursed his lips. \u201cTorrance and I always suspected that she got killed by some sex maniac from Seattle. Isn\u2019t that right, Torrance?\u201d</p><p>Torrance bobbed his head several times. \u201cYup. That was how we figured it, all right. Not that Chief Yates paid any attention to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYates just wanted to close the case as fast as possible,\u201d Walter said somberly. \u201cHe was getting ready to retire. Last thing he wanted to do was leave behind a nasty unsolved murder. Would have spoiled his record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder.\u201d Hannah met Rafe\u2019s eyes for a few seconds. He gave her an enigmatic look. She turned back to Walter. \u201cAre you serious? Do you really think Kaitlin was murdered by a sex maniac?\u201d</p><p>Walter traded glances with Torrance. \u201cCan\u2019t blame us for wondering, given what we found the day we fixed her washer. Right, Torrance?\u201d</p><p>Torrance\u2019s head went into nodding mode again. \u201cRight. Gotta wonder.\u201d</p><p>Rafe looked at Walter \u201cWhat exactly did you find the day you fixed her washer?\u201d</p><p>To Hannah\u2019s astonishment, Walter blushed a bright shade of red.</p><p>\u201cKinky stuff,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of kinky stuff?\u201d Rafe asked.</p><p>Something in his voice made Hannah glance sharply at him. But she could read nothing in his expression.</p><p>Torrance rolled his eyes. \u201cYou know. Frilly undies.\u201d</p><p>Hannah thought about the little demi-bra she had lost on the stairs last night. When her gaze collided with Rafe\u2019s, she knew he was thinking about it too.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so kinky about a woman wearing frilly underwear?\u201d she demanded</p><p>\u201cWell, the stuff we found wasn\u2019t exactly little,\u201d Torrance said. \u201cBig enough to fit a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely a heck of a lot bigger than Kaitlin,\u201d Walter confided. \u201cShe was real petite, if you recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was also a sexy nightgown that was much too big for her,\u201d Torrance continued. \u201cAnd some really large sparkly high heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget those videotapes,\u201d Walter added.</p><p>Hannah stared at him. \u201cYou found all that stuff inside her washer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly inside the washer.\u201d Torrance hesitated. \u201cWell, see, once we got goin\u2019 on the washer, we realized that her dryer exhaust hose probably hadn\u2019t been cleaned in a long time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDangerous things, exhaust hoses,\u201d Walter put in seriously. \u201cIf they get clogged with lint, they can cause fires. Anyhow, we figured we\u2019d do Kaitlin a favor, so after we finished with the washer, we pulled out the dryer to check the exhaust hose. That was when we found the large-sized undies and the videos and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind the machine?\u201d Rafe asked carefully.</p><p>Torrance nodded violently. \u201cSomeone had cut out a big chunk of drywall and stuffed the videos and the ladies\u2019 things into the space between a couple of studs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew right off the female stuff didn\u2019t belong to you, Rafe,\u201d Walter assured him hastily.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was your big clue?\u201d Rafe asked. \u201cWrong size?\u201d</p><p>Torrance guffawed with laughter. \u201cHeck, everyone knew you\u2019d been seein\u2019 a lot of Kaitlin that summer. But me and Walter never figured you for one of them transistors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTransvestites,\u201d Rafe corrected mildly.</p><p>Torrance nodded. \u201cNever figured you for one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right about my taste in underwear. I\u2019m a pretty traditional kind of guy.\u201d</p> <p>Torrance\u2019s laughter faded. \u201cAnyhow, after Kaitlin died, Walter and I remembered that stuff we found in the wall. That\u2019s what made us think she\u2019d been done in by some out-of-town sex maniac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Seattle,\u201d Walter concluded.</p><p>\u201cWhy Seattle?\u201d Hannah asked.</p><p>Torrance snorted. \u201cNot the sort of thing they do in Portland.\u201d</p><p>Hannah looked at Rafe.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThe man has a point. You know what they say about those folks up in Seattle.\u201d</p> <p>She turned back to Walter and Torrance. \u201cYou said you told Chief Yates about the videos and the lingerie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, figured it was our civic duty,\u201d Torrance said. \u201cBut he told us to keep our mouths shut. Said there was enough gossip goin\u2019 around as it was. Town didn\u2019t need any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, the stuff was gone when we took the chief to Kaitlin\u2019s house to show it to him,\u201d Walter added. \u201cI don\u2019t think he believed us.\u201d</p><p>Rafe frowned. \u201cThe lingerie and videos weren\u2019t there when you went back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Torrance sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s the main reason Walter and me didn\u2019t talk too much about what we\u2019d found. Didn\u2019t have any proof, and Chief Yates said we could get in a lotta trouble if we started spreadin\u2019 false rumors. Right, Walter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Walter said crisply. \u201cWe\u2019re not blabbermouths. But we always thought Kaitlin was murdered by that sex maniac she must have been seein\u2019.\u201d He looked at Rafe. \u201cNo offense, but everyone knew she was fooling around with other men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Rafe did not look at Hannah. \u201cEven I figured it out. Why do you think the guy who was into the lingerie murdered her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d Torrance said.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t like the fact that she had those videos,\u201d Walter said. \u201cCould be they were films of him dressed in the lingerie.\u201d</p><p>Rafe\u2019s gaze went to Hannah. She saw the glint of curiosity in his eyes. She didn\u2019t blame him. She was reluctantly fascinated, herself.</p><p>\u201cYou think this guy from Seattle went back to Kaitlin\u2019s house after he murdered her and stole the lingerie and videos?\u201d Rafe asked.</p><p>\u201cMakes sense, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Walter asked. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want to leave any evidence around that might point back to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly an interesting theory,\u201d Hannah allowed cautiously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all it\u2019ll ever be now,\u201d Walter said. \u201cKaitlin\u2019s been dead and buried for a long time. No one\u2019s going to reopen that old case. Probably for the best.\u201d He turned with military precision. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll have to excuse us, we\u2019ve got work to do. Don\u2019t we, Torrance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Torrance\u2019s head bobbed up and down half a dozen times with great enthusiasm. \u201cTurnin\u2019 this place into an inn with a restaurant attached is gonna be a big project. But you know, it makes a lotta sense. What with the institute and the college and the plans to renovate the old pier and put in more shops, Eclipse Bay is attractin\u2019 a lotta visitors these days. Don\u2019t have many nice places for \u2019em to stay. Just the motel out on the highway. Way it is now, folks have to drive on up the coast to find a classy place.\u201d</p><p>He swung around and lumbered off after his brother.</p><p>Hannah waited until both Willises were out of sight. Then she looked at Rafe.</p><p>\u201cA sex maniac from Seattle?\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI have a hunch that everyone in town has a personal theory of what happened that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrilly lingerie in sizes big enough to fit a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me.\u201d He held up both hands, palms out. \u201cI never saw any of that stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the videos?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNope. No videos. Hannah, I only went out with Kaitlin a few times before it became real obvious that she was just amusing herself with me while she hunted for her real meal ticket. I never got to know her well enough to learn about her little quirks and eccentricities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. You do realize what this means, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He leveled a finger at her. \u201cNothing. It means absolutely nothing. We only have the Willis brothers\u2019 word on what they found in the wall behind her dryer. And no offense to either Torrance or Walter, but they\u2019re not the most sophisticated guys to come down the pike. I doubt if they\u2019ve been any farther than Portland in their entire lives. What looked like kinky clothing and dirty videos to them might be nothing more than a little late-night entertainment to other folks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaitlin wasn\u2019t exactly shy about her own sexual activities. I can\u2019t see her going out of her way to protect the reputations of the men she dated, either. If she went to the trouble of hiding that lingerie and those videos to protect a boyfriend, she must have had big plans for the poor guy.\u201d</p><p>Rafe hesitated. \u201cKaitlin\u2019s supreme goal in life was to marry someone with enough money to help her escape Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, maybe this particular boyfriend had money. Maybe she saw him as a hot prospect for marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy hide the undies and the tapes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows? Maybe he was already married. Maybe she wanted to protect him because she was hoping he\u2019d get a divorce and marry her. Maybe\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cLots of maybes here.\u201d</p><p>She made a face and planted her hands on her hips. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Got a little carried away there for a minute, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagination is a wonderful thing. But in this case it\u2019s wasted. It\u2019s been eight years. We\u2019ll never know for sure what happened to Kaitlin that night. Like Walter said, that\u2019s probably just as well.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly she pulled her thoughts back to the matter at hand. The instant she refocused on her chief problem, her irritation returned.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get something clear here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do anything to Dreamscape until you and I have come to some agreement about how to handle the legal aspects of Isabel\u2019s inheritance.\u201d</p><p>Rafe pondered the view of the hall. \u201cI could open the restaurant in my half of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy. There\u2019s no way you can turn half of this place into a restaurant. How would we divide the kitchen? What about all the people who would use my half of this hall to get to your restaurant? And who gets the solarium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it would make a nice dining room. In the summer I\u2019ll set up tables outside on the veranda, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without my permission, you won\u2019t. Rafe, you just can\u2019t run roughshod over the legal technicalities of this inheritance. We\u2019re talking several hundred thousand dollars worth of mansion here. We have to settle things first. You know that as well as I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d Rafe said a little too casually, \u201cspeaking of settling the minor details, I\u2019ve got a suggestion.\u201d</p><p>Sensing danger, she went very still. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a partnership?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, momentarily speechless.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d she managed at last. \u201cMe? Partners in Dreamscape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it would work?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about last night? Are you just going to pretend it never happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s last night got to do with it?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she could no longer breathe. \u201cEverything. How can you talk about a business partnership after\u2014\u201d She waved a hand, unable to finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Understanding lit his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about us mixing business with pleasure?\u201d</p><p>There was a distant ringing in her ears now. Was that all it had been to him? A pleasant interlude? She struggled to regain her composure.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked in as cold a voice as she could manage.</p><p>\u201cWell, sure,\u201d he said far too readily. \u201cNaturally I\u2019ll have a problem with it because I\u2019m a Madison. Madisons always have problems when they get their financial affairs mixed up with their sexual affairs. But it shouldn\u2019t be a stretch for you. You\u2019re a Harte. You can compartmentalize.\u201d</p><p>He was goading her, she thought. She had to get out of here before she lost it. Hartes did not do that kind of thing. Not in public, at any rate.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cI could probably handle it. But as you just pointed out, you\u2019re a Madison. You\u2019d screw it up for sure.\u201d</p><p>She spun on her heel and walked swiftly outside. Winston, ever faithful, trotted out of the kitchen to follow her. Together they went down the front steps without a backward glance.</p><p>She yanked open the car door. Winston bounded inside and took up his post on the passenger seat. She got in behind the wheel and slammed the door shut.</p><p>The last thing she saw in her rearview mirror was Rafe lounging against the porch railing watching her roar out of the driveway. He had enjoyed seeing her come so close to the edge, she realized. He had deliberately pushed her, just to see what would happen.</p><p>A wave of uncertainty swept through her. All of her grandfather\u2019s warnings about Madisons flashed through her mind. What kind of game was Rafe playing?</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Rafe brought the Porsche to a halt in the drive, switched off the engine, and sat for a while, staring at the front door of Mitchell\u2019s house.</p><p>Asking his grandfather to come to dinner was a crazy idea. If he had any sense he would fire up the engine and drive straight back to Dreamscape. But then he would have to explain to Hannah why he had chickened out.</p><p>The thought of going through another scene with her after the one that had taken place this morning when she had arrived to find the Willis brothers hard at work was not appealing. He had taken a chance, pushed his luck, and, predictably enough, things had exploded in his face. He would be more cautious next time. Who said a Madison couldn\u2019t learn from his mistakes?</p><p>He climbed out from behind the wheel and walked toward the porch steps.</p><p>The front door opened just as he raised his hand to knock. A cadaverously thin figure with a buzz cut and a face that looked as if it had been hewn out of the side of a mountain stared at him.</p><p>Bryce had worked for Mitchell for nearly ten years. No one knew where he had come from. He had started out as a part-time handyman and had gradually carved out a position as full-time majordomo. If Bryce had a last name, it had been lost in the mists of time. As far as Rafe knew, he had no close relatives. Bryce had brought order to the chaos of Mitchell\u2019s household. He was unswervingly loyal to his employer. Beyond that, he was a mystery.</p><p>\u201cHello, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grandfather is out in the garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Rafe nodded in a friendly manner and walked off down the porch. No point exchanging further pleasantries. Bryce was not one for extended conversations.</p><p>Rafe opened the gate and entered the lush wonderland. When he didn\u2019t see Mitchell, he took the narrow gravel path that led toward the greenhouse at the far end of the garden.</p><p>He found his grandfather inside the opaque structure, tending to a tray of plants. Mitchell had a long-spouted watering can in one hand and a small spade in the other.</p><p>Rafe took a breath and stepped into the humid atmosphere of the greenhouse. He recalled Hannah\u2019s comment. Your interest in cooking parallels his in gardening. Creative outlets that you both approach with passion.</p><p>The idea of having something in common with Mitchell was a hard concept to digest.</p><p>\u201cLookin\u2019 good in here,\u201d he said. He told himself Hannah would have been proud of him for trying to start things off on a civil note. Then again, maybe not. She was pretty pissed at him right now. \u201cYou ever think about opening a commercial nursery?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell, no. Last thing I want to do is turn a good hobby into a business. Ruin all the fun.\u201d Mitchell set down the watering can with a thunk and scowled ferociously. \u201cSpeaking of business, what\u2019s this I hear about you opening an inn and a little restaurant out there at Dreamscape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord gets around fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted to keep it a secret, you shouldn\u2019t have called the Willis brothers out to give you an opinion on the condition of the plumbing and wiring in that old place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Rafe examined a row of tiny pots containing small green plants with glossy leaves. \u201cOn the other hand, not much point trying to keep the plan a big dark secret here in Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell gave him a sharp glance from beneath bushy brows. \u201cYou\u2019re serious about opening an inn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Rafe moved on to a tray of feathery ferns. \u201cBeen thinking about it for a year now.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell whistled softly. \u201cWell, shoot and damn. Why the hell didn\u2019t you ever say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot to work things out with Hannah first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. That\u2019s a fact.\u201d</p> <p>Rafe looked up from the ferns. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me that turning Dreamscape into an inn and restaurant is just about the dumbest idea any Madison has ever had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDumb is beside the point. Madisons don\u2019t concern themselves with dumb. They concentrate on what they want.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s eyes crinkled at the corners as he squinted at Rafe. \u201cYou really want this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell studied him for a long moment. Then he nodded once and stripped off a garden glove. \u201cGo for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. If you want it that bad, there\u2019s no point in me trying to talk you out of it. You\u2019re a Madison. Nothing\u2019s going to get in your way. Hell, you\u2019ve got a better chance of pulling off an inn out there at Dreamscape than most folks.\u201d</p> <p>Rafe was thunderstruck. He stared at Mitchell until he finally got his jaw back in place.</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me you think opening an inn and a restaurant is a good idea?\u201d he finally managed.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say that.\u201d Mitchell tossed the glove down on the workbench. \u201cDon\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good idea or not, to tell you the truth. Just said I could see that nothing was going to stop you. You\u2019ve got a good head for business when you choose to use it. You could make this inn-restaurant thing work.\u201d</p><p>Rafe lounged back against a waist-high potting bench, slightly shaken. This was the first time that Mitchell had ever given even halfhearted approval for any idea that did not involve going to work for Madison Commercial.</p><p>\u201cWhere does Hannah Harte fit into this big plan of yours?\u201d Mitchell asked.</p><p>Rafe did not move. He did not even blink. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast I heard, she still owned half of that old house. Has she agreed to let you buy her out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what the hell are you going to do with her?\u201d</p><p>Rafe examined the hibiscus next to him. \u201cI\u2019ve suggested to her that we form a partnership to operate the inn and restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA partnership?\u201d Mitchell\u2019s face worked in astonishment. \u201cWith Hannah Harte? Have you lost every damned marble you\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>So much for getting Mitchell\u2019s unqualified support.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to shout,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cI can hear you just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you listen to me. You\u2019re a Madison. You can\u2019t have a business partnership with a Harte. It\u2019ll never work. Never in a million years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so it might be a little more complicated than the usual business partnership,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot and damn.\u201d Mitchell grabbed a pair of pruning shears. \u201cThe rumors are true, aren\u2019t they? You are foolin\u2019 around with her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have started what some people might call a relationship. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA relationship?\u201d Mitchell went to work on the hibiscus with the shears. \u201cThat mean you\u2019re shacking up together?\u201d</p><p>Rafe realized that he was standing closer to the hibiscus than was comfortable. He moved a couple of steps aside to give Mitchell and his shears plenty of space.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d use that term.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell snipped off a straggling branch and glared. \u201cWell, just what term would you use?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, the situation is a little complicated at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell aimed the shears at Rafe. \u201cPay attention for once in your life. What I got to say is important. That woman put her reputation on the line for you eight years ago. Saved you a lot of grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fool around with her. It\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fooling around with her.\u201d Rafe searched for the right words, but they eluded him. \u201cWhatever is going on, it\u2019s serious.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell frowned at him for a long, considering moment. \u201cIt sure as hell better be serious.\u201d Abruptly, he turned back to his pruning. \u201cWhy\u2019d you come here today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCame over to see if you want to have dinner with Hannah and me tomorrow night.\u201d Rafe hesitated. \u201cFeel free to bring your friend Octavia with you, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOctavia\u2019s gone back to Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvitation still stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Mitchell clipped off another small branch. \u201cHannah Harte can cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She\u2019s never done any cooking around me. I\u2019ll be doing the cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould be interesting,\u201d Mitchell said.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean we can expect you for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there. Be a change of pace from Bryce\u2019s grub.\u201d</p><p>Rafe exhaled slowly. \u201cOkay. Fine.\u201d He straightened and headed for the door. He felt as if he had just weathered a storm. \u201cSee you around six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould be damned interesting,\u201d Mitchell muttered again.</p><p>Waste of time, Rafe thought. But what the hell. Maybe Hannah would cut him some slack. He should get some points out of this. After all, it had been her suggestion to invite Mitchell to dinner.</p><p>He wondered if it was a bad sign that he was trying to please her.</p><p>Rafe paused in the office doorway and studied the scene. There was a computer on the desk. The telephone had several lines. The hardware was nearly buried amid piles of notebooks, photos, and newspapers. The bookcase was crammed with volumes. Several framed front-page editions of the Eclipse Bay Journal hung on the walls. One of them featured a photograph of Trevor Thornley standing with the former owner and editor of the newspaper, Ed Bolton, and his smiling wife, Bev. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI always wondered what a newspaper editor\u2019s office looked like,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>Jed grinned and leaned back in his chair. \u201cThis is what this particular newspaper editor\u2019s office looks like. Have a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Rafe cleared a heap of out-of-town newspapers off a chair and sat down.</p><p>\u201cWant some coffee?\u201d Jed gripped the arms of his chair as if about to push himself up and out of it. \u201cOne thing we\u2019ve got a lot of around here is caffeine. Part of the mystique.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d Rafe glanced at the computer. The screen showed a page of text. He glimpsed the words. \u201cThornley stated that he will run for the Senate on a platform that calls for social and personal responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a one-on-one interview with Trevor Thornley?\u201d Rafe asked.</p><p>\u201cDid it this morning before he left for Portland. I\u2019m writing an editorial for tomorrow\u2019s edition.\u201d</p><p>Rafe settled back into the chair. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like talking to a future U.S. senator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a whole lot different than it was talking to a future member of the state legislature eight years ago. Only he\u2019s much more polished these days. But it\u2019s still tough to get a straight answer out of him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably why he\u2019s come so far, so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Well, like they say, he may be a sonofabitch, but he\u2019s our sonofabitch. I think Eclipse Bay can count on him to remember his roots even when he winds up in Washington, D.C.\u201d Jed propped his elbows on the chair arms and linked his fingers across his small paunch. \u201cWhat brings you here today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdle curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best kind, I always say. That\u2019s what makes good reporters.\u201d Jed chuckled. \u201cWhat are you curious about?\u201d</p><p>Rafe steepled his fingers. The decision to pay a visit to the offices of the Eclipse Bay Journal had seemed a spur-of-the-moment thing. He\u2019d been on his way back to Dreamscape when it struck. But now that he thought about it, he realized that it had been nibbling at the back of his mind all morning, ever since Walter and Torrance Willis had voiced their theories about Kaitlin Sadler having been murdered by a sex maniac from Seattle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a favor to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to take a look at some old editions of your paper.\u201d</p> <p>Jed\u2019s eyes darkened with sudden interest. \u201cHow old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight years.\u201d</p><p>Jed whistled tunelessly. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned. You want to see the coverage of Kaitlin Sadler\u2019s death, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d Jed\u2019s chair squeaked as he sat forward abruptly. He fixed Rafe with an intent look. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I told you, I\u2019m just curious, that\u2019s all. I didn\u2019t pay any attention to the stories that appeared in the paper at the time. I was too busy trying to keep from getting arrested. As soon as I was cleared, all I wanted to do was get out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn understandable reaction.\u201d Jed picked up a pen and absently tapped the edge of the computer keyboard. \u201cSure you\u2019re not looking for something in particular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, this is your old buddy, Jed Steadman, boy reporter and pool pal, remember? If you\u2019ve got a line on what really happened that night, the least you can do is fill me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink it would still be news after all this time?\u201d</p><p>Jed raised his eyebrows. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got anything to indicate that what happened to Kaitlin was something other than an accident, yes, it sure as hell would be news. No one here has forgotten that incident.\u201d He paused. \u201cWe\u2019ve only had one real murder in Eclipse Bay in the past decade, and that was when a couple of tourists got into a quarrel out at the RV park and one of them shot the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a line on Kaitlin\u2019s death,\u201d Rafe said swiftly. \u201cJust a couple of questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d Jed paused ever so briefly. \u201cI hate to remind you, but this is my newspaper now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could try the public library.\u201d</p><p>Jed\u2019s grin came and went. \u201cYes, you could. All right. I\u2019ve stuck with the agreement.\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll dig them out for you. Can\u2019t blame me for trying to find out if you\u2019ve got an angle on that old story, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess not.\u201d Rafe shoved himself up out of the chair and turned to follow Jed through the doorway. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m looking for, if you\u2019ll promise to keep it quiet.\u201d</p><p>Jed raised one hand as he went down the hall. \u201cWord of honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see if whoever covered the story mentioned the fact that Kaitlin Sadler was seeing someone other than me that summer.\u201d</p><p>Jed came to a halt in another doorway and gave Rafe a quizzical frown. \u201cEveryone knew she was seeing other men. Hell, you knew it. It was no big secret that she was running around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to see if the names of any of the other men she dated came up in the course of the investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d Jed\u2019s hand tightened on the edge of the doorjamb. He gave Rafe a knowing look. \u201cYou want to see if there were any other serious suspects besides yourself, don\u2019t you? What is this? You think maybe one of her other boyfriends really did push her off the cliff that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got a single thing to go on here, Jed. I\u2019m curious, that\u2019s all. Are you going to let me see those old papers or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Force of habit. Come on, I\u2019ll get you set up on the machine.\u201d</p><p>A short time later Rafe found himself seated in front of a microfilm reader, scanning eight-year-old editions of the Eclipse Bay Journal. He paused when he came to the front-page headline that had been printed the morning after Kaitlin\u2019s death: LOCAL WOMAN FOUND DEAD AT HIDDEN COVE.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Jed hung over his shoulder, one hand gripping the back of Rafe\u2019s chair. \u201cI didn\u2019t cover the story. I was busy writing up the piece on Thornley\u2019s reception at the institute.\u201d</p><p>Rafe glanced at the byline. \u201cDid you know Ben Orchardson well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knew him well, but I learned a few things from him. He was a halfway decent reporter in his day. Worked for a couple of the big-city dailies for several years. But he had a problem with the bottle. Wound up here at the Journal for a while, but Ed had to let him go after a few months.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs Orchardson still around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? He was sixty-three when he covered the Sadler story. He retired and moved away just before I married Connie. Haven\u2019t heard from him since he left Eclipse Bay. I remember him saying something about heading for Mexico or maybe Costa Rica where he could live like a king on his Social Security check while he wrote the great American novel. Doubt if he ever sobered up long enough to buy a computer and go to work, though.\u201d</p><p>Rafe read through the first story that had appeared, searching for names other than his own. The first one that leaped out was Hannah\u2019s. He paused to study the short paragraph that had covered his alibi.</p><p>Hannah Harte, daughter of longtime Eclipse Bay summer visitors Hamilton and Elaine Harte, stated that she had been with Raphael Madison at the time of Sadler\u2019s death. \u201cWe met on the beach near Eclipse Arch a few minutes after midnight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe talked for a while. Then he walked me home. It was a long walk. We arrived shortly before two.\u201d</p> <p>The words were simple enough, but they had cost Hannah a lot at the time, Rafe reflected. He could imagine what her parents had had to say about the events of that night. But that was Hannah for you. Not a woman to stay silent when she had something to say.</p><p>Jed leaned closer. \u201cSomething I\u2019ve always wondered about... ?\u201d</p><p>The story jumped to an inside page. Rafe advanced the film. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs talking really the only thing you and Hannah Harte did that night on the beach?\u201d</p><p>Rafe leaned back and met Jed\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Jed straightened quickly and took a step back. He cleared his throat. \u201cHey, just a reporter\u2019s natural curiosity, you understand.\u201d</p><p>Rafe turned back to the article and continued reading.</p><p>Yates said that he is still investigating Sadler\u2019s movements on the night of her death. \u201cNo one seems to know where she went or what she did after Madison got out of her car near the Arch. No one has any idea why she was on Hidden Cove Trail at that hour of the night. The trail is closed at sunset. There are no lights...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever happened to Chief Yates?\u201d Rafe asked as he went on to the next story. \u201cIs he still around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you know? He died of a heart attack a couple of years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonder if there\u2019s any way of getting a look at his old file on the case?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe new chief of police is named Sean Valentine. He\u2019s a solid guy. He\u2019ll probably let you look at the old files, but I doubt that you\u2019ll find anything. Orchardson went through them thoroughly at the time. I remember him saying that with you in the clear, there was no other viable suspect. He said he was fairly sure Kaitlin\u2019s death had been an accident or suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t buy suicide,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>Jed shrugged. \u201cNeither do I. But I can see her having a few drinks and losing her balance on that trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what was she doing there on the trail in the first place?\u201d</p><p>Jed considered for a moment. \u201cThink maybe she went there to treat herself to a couple of beers after she ditched you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t have any booze in the car when she dropped me off at the Arch, I can tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could have picked someone up after she left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Rafe studied the article on the screen. \u201cMaybe. But Kaitlin was not a big drinker.\u201d</p> <p>Jed crouched down behind the chair and rested an elbow on the back. He eyed the screen over Rafe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re serious about this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurious, not serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Rafe admitted. He went back to the front page of the story he had been reading. He paused when he saw a night shot of the brightly lit facade of the Eclipse Bay Policy Studies Institute. \u201cI see Thornley\u2019s big event at the think tank that night got squeezed below the fold.\u201d</p><p>Jed made a face. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me. My first big story, and I lost the lead because of the Sadler piece.\u201d</p><p>Rafe followed the reception story to an inside page and found a photo of the crowd that had attended the Thornley reception. \u201cLooks like most of Eclipse Bay was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone in town was invited, but it was understood that if you went you were expected to donate to Thornley\u2019s campaign. That limited the guests to the upwardly mobile among us, the local movers and shakers, and the hustlers who felt they had a stake in getting Thornley elected.\u201d</p><p>Rafe smiled slightly. \u201cNot a lot of guys like me there, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I recall.\u201d Jed grinned. \u201cI was the youngest person there, and the only reason I attended was because I was covering it for the paper.\u201d</p><p>Rafe leaned back in the chair, thinking. \u201cWhat time did the reception end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember precisely. It ran late because Thornley was a little long-winded in those days. And because there was plenty of free booze.\u201d</p><p>The lights had still been on at the institute when he walked Hannah home along Bayview Drive, Rafe thought. \u201cSo, it would probably be safe to say that everyone who attended the Thornley reception that night has a reasonably solid alibi.\u201d</p><p>Jed slanted him a speculative glance. \u201cYes. I could probably dig up the old guest list if you want to look at it. As the only representative of the local media at the event, I\u2019m sure I got a copy. It might be in my files. But Kaitlin didn\u2019t move in those circles, Rafe. Why would anyone from that crowd want to kill her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question.\u201d Rafe thought about the oversized lingerie, the high heels, and the videos that the Willis brothers claimed to have discovered behind Kaitlin\u2019s dryer. No point in mentioning them, he thought. He had nothing hard to go on yet. \u201cYou\u2019re right. There\u2019s nothing here, Jed. Sorry I wasted your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Jed replied. \u201cKeep me in mind if you get any other wild hairs, okay? This is a slow news town. I wouldn\u2019t mind a big expos\u00e9 on the Sadler death, especially if it involves an eight-year cover-up. Pulitzers have been won on less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cIf I get any more brainstorms, you\u2019ll be the first to know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>\u201cIt was one of the more embarrassing moments of my life.\u201d Hannah propped her heels on the ottoman, sank deeper into the brown leather sofa, and sipped glumly on the hot green tea Pamela had given her. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that I was standing there in the front hall of Dreamscape, yelling at him. I know the Willis brothers were listening to every single word. The story will be all over town by now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pamela, ensconced in the big recliner on the other side of the coffee table, curled one leg under herself. She wrapped her hands around her own mug and smiled wryly. \u201cVery un-Harte-like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne could almost call it outrageous. For a Harte, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>A searing vision of her black bra lying on the staircase at Dreamscape flashed before Hannah\u2019s eyes. If Pamela only knew, she thought, just how outrageous she had been in the past twenty-four hours.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you find it so amusing,\u201d Hannah muttered into her tea. \u201cI\u2019d like to remind you that half of Dreamscape belongs to me. I had a right to scream some when I realized what he was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not taking this seriously, are you?\u201d</p><p>Pamela raised one brow in a very knowing fashion. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for the other shoe to drop, as it were.\u201d</p><p>Both shoes had dropped last night before she even got upstairs, Hannah recalled. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re involved in a sticky situation with a Madison,\u201d Pamela said. \u201cSo far, all you\u2019ve done is yell at him in front of witnesses. That may be a big scene for a Harte, but I doubt if it even ruffled Rafe Madison\u2019s hair. The question here is, What happens next?\u201d</p><p>Hannah swallowed more tea and submerged herself deeper into the pool of gloom. \u201cHe\u2019s proposed a partnership in an inn and restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA partnership?\u201d Pamela\u2019s eyes widened behind the lenses of her glasses. \u201cYou and Rafe Madison? Oh, my.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would never work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever in a million years. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine what your family would say about the notion of you and Rafe opening an inn together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer not to think about it.\u201d</p><p>Pamela looked as though she was attempting to suppress a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hannah demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say one thing about you and Rafe Madison,\u201d Pamela murmured. \u201cYou two don\u2019t get together often, but when you do, it\u2019s never dull.\u201d</p><p>The sound of a vehicle in the drive saved Hannah from having to come up with a response to that observation. Two small whirlwinds, both dressed in jeans, T-shirts, and miniature running shoes, blew into the front room. They flew toward the door. A massive beast that went by the wholly inappropriate name of Kitty followed in their wake.</p><p>Kitty was the reason Winston had remained at the cottage that afternoon. Kitty did not care for Winston. Hannah was fairly certain that the feeling was reciprocated. On the one occasion when Winston and Kitty had been introduced, she had caught Winston eyeing Kitty with a peculiar gleam in his eye. It was the same gleam that he got when he chased seagulls on the beach. For her part, Kitty had hissed and growled and generally made it clear that she was not a dog lover.</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s home, Daddy\u2019s home,\u201d the whirlwind named Rose chanted happily as she stretched both hands overhead and tried to seize the doorknob.</p> <p>Mark, Rose\u2019s older brother, grabbed the knob before she could get a grip on it. \u201cI get to show him my new maze before you make him look at your stupid drawing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy drawing isn\u2019t stupid.\u201d Rose looked at Pamela for confirmation of her artistic ability. \u201cIt isn\u2019t stupid, is it, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Pamela assured her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hang it on the refrigerator with the others just as soon as you finish it.\u201d</p><p>Rose whirled back to her brother. \u201cTold you so, you big dummy. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Pamela gave Hannah an amused glance. \u201cI think she takes after me. Not at all reticent about standing up for herself.\u201d</p><p>Hannah grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s so thrilling to see the genes pass down to another generation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver think about producing your own little bundle of Hannah genes?\u201d</p><p>Hannah watched the two children battle over who got to open the door for Brad. A pang of deep longing twisted through her. She gazed at Mark and imagined a little boy with Rafe\u2019s eyes. For the first time she wondered if her growing restlessness this past year had something to do with her ticking biological clock.</p><p>\u201cFunny you should ask,\u201d she said softly. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s one small problem. I need more than just Hannah genes to create the final product.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened, and Brad walked into the hall. He was a fair-haired man with earnestly intelligent eyes framed by wire-rimmed glasses. There was a deceptively quiet, deeply thoughtful way about him that belied a quick, razor-sharp brain. He was fashionably rumpled in what passed for academic chic. His button-down shirt and khaki trousers were both wrinkled. The loud, awkwardly knotted tie, scuffed leather shoes, and bulging book bag accented the young, professorial look.</p><p>He barely had time to wave a hand toward Hannah before the two whirlwinds and Kitty descended on him.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, wait until you see the maze I built.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, Daddy, I want to show you my picture.\u201d</p><p>Brad crouched to greet his children and the family cat. There was genuine pleasure on his face.</p><p>Hannah watched the intimate little family ritual of greeting daddy and was horrified when she detected a hint of dampness on her own lashes. She blinked hurriedly and looked away. What was wrong with her today? At this rate she would soon be an emotional basket case. She had to get a grip on herself. Pamela was watching her with gathering concern.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Pamela pitched her voice below the hubbub taking place in the front hall. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Hannah took a long, reviving swallow of tea. \u201cI\u2019ve been a little tense since the scene with Rafe this morning, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ve got to do something about the problem of Dreamscape, Pam. The situation is a mess. It has to be resolved.\u201d</p><p>It was Brad who responded. He wandered into the living room, Rose and Mark bobbing around his legs. \u201cFrom what I heard this afternoon, Rafe Madison has his own plans for Dreamscape. What\u2019s going on? Are you going to sell him your half of the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t offering to buy it,\u201d Hannah said dryly. \u201cHe\u2019s proposing a partnership.\u201d</p><p>Brad considered that. \u201cMaybe he can\u2019t afford to buy out your half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I can tell, money is not a problem for Rafe,\u201d Hannah said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brad met her eyes. \u201cThen what\u2019s the issue? Pamela has told me something about the history of the Hartes and the Madisons. I got the impression that there was no love lost between the two clans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit that we haven\u2019t socialized much in the past three generations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Rafe Madison want to get involved in a business partnership with you?\u201d Brad asked.</p><p>\u201cBeats me.\u201d Hannah decided it was time to change the subject. \u201cHow\u2019s tricks with you, Brad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I have some good news. I got a call from the director of the institute this morning. He offered me the joint appointment. I start the first of the month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYahoo!\u201d Pamela leaped off the recliner and threw her arms around Brad. \u201cCongratulations! I knew you\u2019d get it.\u201d</p><p>Brad grinned at Hannah over Pamela\u2019s head. \u201cI think I may have had a little help from my friends. Rumor has it that Perry Decatur mysteriously withdrew his objection to the appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat little S.O.B.\u201d Pamela made a face. \u201cI knew he was the one who was holding up the process. He\u2019s jealous as all get-out. He\u2019s afraid you\u2019re going to show him up for the lightweight he is once you\u2019re on the faculty there. Which you will, of course. Wonder what made him back off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Hannah?\u201d</p> <p>Pamela swung around, a hundred questions in her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d Hannah said mildly. \u201cPerry asked me to attend the Thornley reception last night. He wanted to impress everyone at the institute with his contacts. You get the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Brad said. \u201cThe Hartes are one of the most important families in town. Having a representative from the family there last night would have been a coup for Decatur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it happened,\u201d Hannah continued, \u201cI discovered that a former Weddings by Harte client was also scheduled to attend the reception. Perry was angling to get him to endow a research fund at the institute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom Lydd,\u201d Brad said.</p><p>Hannah nodded. \u201cYou are good. Something tells me you\u2019ll go far at the institute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you had a word with Lydd, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I did was mention that I knew the institute\u2019s selection committee had your name under consideration for a joint appointment and that you would make a wonderful addition to the faculty. Tom Lydd took it from there.\u201d</p><p>Brad exhaled deeply. \u201cDecatur must have blown a gasket.\u201d</p><p>Pamela slapped a palm across her own mouth and then exploded with laughter. \u201cA classic Harte tactical maneuver. Your folks would be so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you,\u201d Brad said to Hannah. He looked serious.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d She grinned, feeling somewhat cheered for the first time since the scene at Dreamscape that morning. \u201cPerry Decatur owed me for something that happened eight years ago. It was payback time.\u201d</p><p>Brad shook his head. \u201cYou Hartes sure do have long memories.\u201d</p><p>Hannah wasn\u2019t sure that he meant it as a compliment.</p> <p>She drove back to the cottage later that evening after sharing dinner with the McCallister family. The meal, with all its noise and chaos, had done wonders to improve her mood, she realized.</p><p>Maybe she could finally do some clearheaded thinking tonight. She needed to put things in perspective. Not that it was easy to gain any sort of real perspective on Rafe Madison. But the good news was that she was no longer feeling as unsettled as she had for the better part of the day. She was a Harte. As Pamela had reminded her, she was supposed to be good at strategic planning and tactics. Hartes did not allow themselves to get tangled up in messy emotions when it came to business. That was a Madison characteristic.</p><p>She had to start concentrating on the business aspects of Dreamscape. She could not allow Rafe to muddy the waters again.</p><p>Something told her that would be easier said than done. Madisons were very good at muddying things, she reflected as she pulled into the driveway in front of the darkened house.</p><p>She switched off the engine, climbed out from behind the wheel, and started toward the front door with a vaguely wistful sensation. She didn\u2019t have a loving husband and a couple of lively kids waiting to greet her, but at least she had Winston.</p><p>Faithful, loyal, lovable Winston.</p><p>She put her key in the lock and waited for the muted sounds of doggy welcome. But there was no muffled scratch of toenails on hardwood, no happy whine.</p><p>The first tingle of unease shot through her. Winston was an alert dog. His hearing was almost preternatural. Surely he had caught the sound of the car in the drive.</p><p>Quickly she unlocked the door, opened it, and stepped into the hall.</p><p>\u201cWinston?\u201d</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>\u201cWinston? Where are you? Here, Winston. Look, I\u2019m sorry about Kitty. I admit that I patted her on the head a couple of times, but that was all, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Winston did not come trotting around the corner.</p><p>She switched on a light and walked into the kitchen. Most of the water she had left in one of the twin stainless-steel bowls on the floor was untouched. The expensive chewing bone had been abandoned under the table.</p><p>Unease turned to concern that was only a little shy of panic. Something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWinston?\u201d</p><p>She hurried back into the living room and started up the stairs. Perhaps he had gotten himself trapped in a bedroom or a bathroom when a door had accidentally closed. Frantically she tried to think of reasons why an inside door would suddenly swing shut. A draft? But if Winston was locked in an upstairs room, why wasn\u2019t he barking furiously to let her know where he was?</p><p>By the time she reached the top of the stairs, she was running. A single glance down the hall showed her that all of the doors stood wide open.</p><p>She darted from room to room, checking under beds and inside closets. There was no sign of Winston.</p><p>It occurred to her that he must have somehow gotten out of the house on his own and wandered off. It was a very un-Winston-like thing to do, but for all his canine cleverness he was still a dog and dogs were born explorers.</p><p>She went slowly back downstairs and came to a halt once more in the hall, pondering the mystery of how he might have escaped the house. The front door had been locked when she returned. That left the kitchen door and the mudroom door.</p><p>A quick check in the kitchen revealed that that door, too, was still securely locked. With mounting trepidation she walked back out into the hall and turned right. Automatically she switched on lights as she went toward the rear of the house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The small mudroom was swathed in darkness. She hit the light switch and glanced quickly around the neat clutter. Rain gear, umbrellas, beach shoes, and a stack of old towels filled most of the space. Two brooms and an aged mop stood in the corner.</p><p>She studied the door. It was closed, but it was unlocked. She could not have forgotten to lock up before she left for Pamela\u2019s earlier in the day, she thought. It simply wasn\u2019t possible. She had lived alone in the city too long to neglect such simple precautions.</p><p>Even if she had left it unlocked, how had Winston gotten it open? He was a brilliant dog, but he had paws, not hands. It was pushing credibility much too far to believe that he had somehow managed to twist the doorknob and open the door. A specially trained dog might have accomplished the feat, but Winston had never been taught to do fancy tricks.</p><p>It was hard to believe that she had left this door not only unlocked but ajar. But she must have done just that. It was the only conceivable way that Winston could have gotten out of the house.</p> <p>Despair engulfed her. Winston was somewhere outside in the darkness, possibly lost and terrified. If he reached the road, he might get hit by a car.</p><p>She whirled around, yanked open a cupboard, and grabbed a flashlight. She would need it. Although there was a moon, the fog was thickening rapidly.</p><p>She seized a faded windbreaker from a wall hook, pulled it on, and opened the mudroom door. She stepped out onto the rear porch and switched on the flashlight.</p><p>\u201cWinston.\u201d</p><p>A faint bark sounded in the distance. It was barely audible above the muted rumble of the light surf at the base of the cliffs, but her heart leaped in relief. Winston was in Dead Hand Cove.</p> <p>She plunged down the steps and entered the ghostly tendrils of gathering fog. The beam of the flashlight infused the surrounding mist with an unearthly light. With the ease of long familiarity, she made her way toward the path that led down the rocky cliff to the beach.</p><p>\u201cWinston. Talk to me. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>This time she got a series of hard, sharp, excited barks. They definitely emanated from the cove, but they did not sound as if Winston was moving toward her. She wondered if he had somehow managed to trap himself inside one of the small caves at the base of the cliff.</p><p>At the top of the path she paused to shine the flashlight down on the rocky beach. The beam pierced the mist in places, revealing a wide swath of damp sand. The tide was coming in, but it had a ways to go before the water filled the cove. She could still make out the tips of the five fingers. But sprays of foam were already dampening the rocky monoliths. In another hour or so the water would cover all but the tallest of the stones.</p><p>Winston barked again, louder this time. She was definitely getting closer to him, she realized. But he was not making any headway toward her.</p><p>She started cautiously down the pebble-strewn path that led to the tiny beach. Only the fact that she had used the trail for years and knew it better than she knew the streets of Portland made it possible to navigate it at night with some confidence. The foggy darkness and the slippery rocks made for slow going. Twice she lost her footing and had to grab at a stony outcropping to save herself from a nasty fall.</p> <p>She was breathing hard by the time she reached the rough beach. Immediately she shone the light along the dark voids that marked the caves.</p><p>\u201cWinston!\u201d</p><p>Another series of barks sounded in the mist. Behind her now. But how could that be? Fresh alarm swept through her.</p><p>She turned quickly to face the fingers. Aiming the flashlight toward the thumb, she started cautiously across the damp sand.</p><p>Spray dampened the front of her windbreaker. A wave broke at the entrance to the cove. Cold seawater swirled around her feet. Should have taken time to put on a pair of boots, she thought.</p><p>More loud, demanding barks punctuated the mist. Winston was getting impatient. Perhaps he had bounded up onto a finger before the tide returned and was now reluctant to jump down because he would get wet. But that didn\u2019t make any sense. Winston wasn\u2019t afraid of a few inches of water. She gasped when another swirl of cold foam lapped at her ankles.</p><p>She started toward the nearest finger and aimed the beam of the flashlight at the top. There was no dog there. Methodically she shone the light on the next monolith. The spray had thoroughly dampened her hair and face now. She would take a hot shower when she got back to the house. She definitely did not need a case of hypothermia.</p><p>It was getting harder to see through the ever-thickening fog, but she managed to make out the shape of the second finger. There was something wrong about it.</p> <p>Another string of tense barks echoed in the fog. Definitely coming from the vicinity of the second finger.</p><p>She hurried forward, ignoring the cold water now swirling around her calves. The beam of the flashlight fell on a large square animal cage perched atop the monolith. Winston was inside.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Winston! What happened?\u201d She sloshed toward him through the slowly deepening water. \u201cWho did this to you?\u201d</p><p>She found the door of the cage and yanked it open. Winston exploded into her arms. He was damp and trembling. She staggered backward under the impact, slipped, and barely managed to keep her footing. Winston lapped happily at her face. The flashlight beam arced wildly in the darkness as she clutched at him.</p><p>\u201cAfter this little incident, I\u2019m going to have more gray hair than you do,\u201d she whispered into his wet fur. \u201cWhat on earth happened here?\u201d</p><p>But Winston had no answers for her.</p><p>She carried him quickly toward the beach. \u201cI\u2019m going to call the police. This is a small town. The chief will know which one of the local punks would pull a vicious trick like this. I\u2019m going to press charges. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Winston licked her ear.</p><p>She set him down at the water\u2019s edge. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you home and dried off. I wonder how long you were out there on that rock? I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on whoever did this. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Winston interrupted her with a low, startlingly savage growl. She flashed the light down at him and saw that his whole attention was focused on the darkness that cloaked the cliff path. The tension in him was the only warning she got.</p><p>\u201cWinston, no!\u201d She grabbed his collar just as he leaped forward. \u201cNo. Winston, stay.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed instantly, but she could feel him quivering with predatory urgency. There was someone in the vicinity of the cliff path. Someone Winston did not like.</p><p>Fear crashed through her. She had to assume that whoever was on the trail was the same person who had caught Winston and set him out on the monolith to drown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the same instant it occurred to her that although she could not see the person watching from the shadows, he could certainly see her. The flashlight in her hand made a very effective beacon.</p><p>She turned off the beam and crouched down beside Winston. \u201cHush.\u201d She closed her fingers lightly around his muzzle. She did not think his low growls could be heard above the sound of the incoming tide, but if he started barking again, he would give away their location.</p><p>Winston shuddered under her hands. His attention never wavered from the cliff path.</p><p>One thing was certain, Hannah thought as she waited for her eyes to adjust to the new level of darkness. They could not go up the path. They would run straight into whoever waited there. Nor could they just stay here in the cove like sitting ducks.</p> <p>Keeping her fingers around Winston\u2019s muzzle, she tugged on his collar to guide him.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHeel, or whatever it is dogs are supposed to do at times like this.\u201d</p><p>If Winston was offended by the command, he was gracious enough not to complain. He paced obediently along beside her. She bent low, not daring to take her fingers off his muzzle as they made their way toward the dense darkness of the cliff caves. She relied on the sighs and splashes of the returning seawater to cloak whatever noise she made as she scrambled over the rocks with Winston.</p><p>The biggest danger would come from tide pools that littered the cove. At night, without a flashlight, each one was a potential trap. Things slipped and slithered under her feet, but Winston detoured safely around the edges of the pools.</p><p>The deeper darkness of a cave entrance loomed in her path. The scent of rotting seaweed enveloped her. But for once Winston showed no interest in the fascinating odors that assailed his nostrils. He was alert and focused. She did not dare release her grip on his muzzle.</p> <p>\u201cHush,\u201d she said again. \u201cPlease, hush.\u201d</p><p>He gave a low, almost inaudible whimper and quivered tensely.</p><p>She put out one hand and felt for the wall of the cave. When her palm made contact with the damp rock she started cautiously forward. Winston must have sensed her intention or perhaps he was merely responding to some ancient den-seeking impulse. Whatever the reason, he willingly took the lead as they made their way deeper into the convoluted cavern.</p><p>As soon as they rounded the corner, they lost what little fog-reflected moonlight there was coming through the mouth of the cave. The quality of the darkness took on a deeper, thicker feel. Hannah could see nothing now. She stumbled awkwardly along, blindly following Winston. But after she bumped her head on a rocky outcropping and scraped a knee, she decided to risk the flashlight again.</p><p>She kept the beam pointed straight down toward the rising floor of rock. Winston trotted forward through the sandy rubble that littered the bottom of the cavern. He no longer seemed inclined to bark. Cautiously, she released his muzzle.</p><p>The path led through a series of small, damp chambers. She stumbled over the remains of an old pink-plastic sandal. Probably one that she or her sister had lost when they had come here to play years ago, she thought.</p> <p>The cavern branched off in several directions. Some of the tunnels were too narrow for any human to pass through, although Winston could have made it. She selected a passage she had often used in the past. Her brother, Nick, had marked it with an X painted in red. Here in the endless gloom the paint had faded little over the years.</p><p>Winston strained forward more eagerly now, perhaps sensing the fresh air that wafted in from the far end of the twisted passage. They rounded a bend. There was a difference in the density of the light at the far end of the cavern. She realized she was looking at night and fog now, not at rock wall.</p><p>Hastily she doused the flashlight beam again and allowed Winston to draw her quickly toward the exit. His mood had altered. He was still eager, but he seemed excited and cheerful, no longer the hunter confronting danger.</p><p>\u201cHannah.\u201d</p><p>The shock of hearing her name called loudly just as she and Winston emerged from the cavern sent a jolt through her. The realization that it was Rafe\u2019s voice that echoed in the mist brought a nearly paralyzing sense of relief.</p><p>\u201cOver here, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>Winston whimpered and bounded up the slope that led to the top of the cliff. She rushed after him. They were both running now.</p><p>Hannah did not slow down when she saw Rafe silhouetted against the glare of the flashlight. She kept going at full speed, straight into his arms.</p> <p>Chapter 16</p><p>An hour later Rafe heard her stalk back into the kitchen behind him. He removed the pan of steaming cocoa from the stove and glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>She had washed and dried her hair and tucked it back behind her ears. A thick white toweling robe was belted around her narrow waist. Her face was pink and flushed. He knew that the high color in her cheeks was not from the hot shower she had just taken. She was still fuming.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t entirely recovered from the roller coaster of emotions he\u2019d been through in the past hour either, he realized. Hannah and Winston had been through a bad experience, but the whole event had not been a picnic for him. He\u2019d endured his own private ordeal.</p><p>First there had been the nightmare images he had envisioned when he knocked on the front door of the house and received no answer. Given the fact that Hannah\u2019s car was in the drive, he\u2019d started out with the worst-case scenario\u2014that she was upstairs in her prissy little bedroom with another man. When he\u2019d finally climbed out of the dark pit into which that vision had cast him, he\u2019d summoned up some common sense and logic. Even if Hannah had been engaged in passionate sex upstairs, he reasoned, Winston would have come to the door.</p><p>Winston had not come to the door. Ergo, Winston and Hannah had gone for a walk. Given the fog and the late hour, however, that conclusion had induced other, equally disturbing scenarios. The tide was coming in. It was a damfool time to go walking on the beach.</p><p>When he\u2019d finally spotted them coming toward him from the vicinity of the caves, the relief that had flashed through him had been stunning. Then Hannah had launched herself into his arms, and he\u2019d realized that she was scared and shivering. Her clothes and hair were wet.</p><p>She\u2019d told him the full story on the way back to the house, and he\u2019d been chilled to the bone by the tale. A hundred variations on disaster had assailed him. She could have been swept up in the churning waters of the cove while attempting to rescue Winston. What if whoever she thought had watched her from the path had pursued her and the dog into the caves?</p><p>After the visions had come the questions, the primary one being, What the hell was going on? He\u2019d made the cocoa partly as therapy for himself. Cooking always centered him and allowed him to think more clearly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d done a lot of thinking while he stirred the hot chocolate and waited for Hannah to come back downstairs. He\u2019d even managed to reach a few conclusions. He was calm and cool again, he told himself. He was back in control.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he instructed. \u201cI\u2019ll pour you a cup of this stuff. Winston has already had his treat.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Winston, who was flopped under the table. Rafe had dried him off and fluffed his fur with some of the old towels in the mudroom. He looked none the worse for his ordeal. In typical dog fashion, he appeared to have forgotten the entire experience.</p><p>The same could not be said of Hannah, Rafe thought.</p> <p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe that that twit at the police station actually said they could not spare an officer to investigate what happened to Winston tonight.\u201d She dropped into a chair at the kitchen table. \u201cThe woman acted as if I had phoned in a complaint about some stupid childish prank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry not to take it personally.\u201d Rafe poured the cocoa into a mug and put it on the table. \u201cThis is a small town, remember? There aren\u2019t many officers on the force. The dispatcher explained that they were all busy out at Chamberlain tonight because of the big rally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am taking it personally. Winston would have drowned if I hadn\u2019t found him in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but once you told the dispatcher that you and the dog were okay and that there was no sign of forced entry here at the house, you lost your status as an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d She heaved a sigh and then, frowning slightly, she sniffed. She looked down at the mug of cocoa he had put in front of her. \u201cThat smells good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrink it.\u201d</p><p>Obediently she took a sip. \u201cJust what the doctor ordered. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He sat down across from her. \u201cI went back to the edge of the cliffs and looked for that cage or animal trap or whatever it was. But it\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnocked off the finger by the incoming waves, no doubt.\u201d She took another sip. \u201cMaybe it will get washed ashore or left on the sand when the tide goes out tomorrow. I\u2019ll watch for it. It\u2019s the only evidence I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if you find it, I doubt if it will prove useful. There won\u2019t be any fingerprints left on it by the time the sea gets finished with it.\u201d</p><p>She looked dismayed. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p> <p>Rafe glanced down at Winston. \u201cSomeone must have opened the back door and enticed him into the trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably wouldn\u2019t have been too hard.\u201d Her mouth tightened. \u201cA nice chunk of raw steak would have gotten his attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe real question is, How did the mudroom door get unlocked?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that. It\u2019s no secret that Mom and Dad leave a spare key with a realtor here in town who looks after the place when no one in the family is using it. It\u2019s not too much of a stretch to imagine someone stealing the key or copying it.\u201d</p><p>He thought about it. \u201cMaybe. But it seems like more trouble than the average kid would go to just to play a nasty prank.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with troubled eyes. \u201cYou think this was something more than a vicious stunt?\u201d</p><p>He shoved his hands into the front pockets of his trousers. \u201cIf you put this incident together with the possibility that someone may have been watching your house at night on and off this past week, you\u2019ve got the makings of a stalker scenario.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cThat occurred to me while I was in the shower. But it would have to be someone who had followed me from Portland, and I honestly can\u2019t think of anyone there who is obsessive about me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>She looked genuinely taken aback by the suggestion. Then she shook her head with grave certainty. \u201cNo, definitely not Doug. He\u2019s not the type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure the type is always obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur engagement ended a year ago. Why would he start stalking me now? And why follow me here to Eclipse Bay to do it? He doesn\u2019t know his way around this town. Whoever trapped Winston and stuck him out on that finger knows a lot about this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. Got to be someone from Eclipse Bay. Someone who knew about the fingers and the tides in Dead Hand Cove. Someone who knew how to get a key to this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking, Raf\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking Perry Decatur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerry?\u201d She sat back, startled. \u201cOh, no, that\u2019s ridiculous. Why would he do something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get even for the way you finessed his move to keep Brad McCallister off the faculty at the institute?\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her lower lip for a few seconds and then shook her head again. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s possible. But I don\u2019t think so. Not his style. Perry\u2019s a conniving little twerp, but I don\u2019t see him pulling a stunt like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing, whoever carried that cage out to the finger had to get wet and dirty doing it. Perry isn\u2019t the type to get wet and dirty if he can help it. Plus there was a real risk of getting caught in the act if I came home early. Perry doesn\u2019t take risks if he can avoid them. He prefers to maneuver behind the scenes.\u201d</p><p>Rafe was unconvinced. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He was plenty pissed last night.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled heavily. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel like the kind of trick he would pull. More likely it was a local kid. A budding little sociopath who has graduated from setting fires to torturing animals.\u201d</p><p>Rafe said nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a problem with my logic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just thinking,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can see that. And it makes me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, thinking, makes you nervous? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the last time you did some serious thinking you decided to make us partners in Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to work. You\u2019ll see, partner.\u201d</p><p>She pointedly ignored that. \u201cWhat, exactly, are you thinking about what happened tonight?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated and then decided there was nothing to be gained by keeping silent. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that whatever is going on here might not be about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot about me? That was my dog out there on the finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I meant was it might not be about you alone.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt might be about us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUs? You mean someone doesn\u2019t like the idea that we\u2019re\u2014\u201d She broke off and made another run at it. \u201cSomeone doesn\u2019t like the rumors that are going around about us? But why on earth would anyone care if we\u2019re, uh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping together?\u201d he offered helpfully.</p><p>\u201cOne time,\u201d she said swiftly. \u201cThere was only one time. That does not exactly constitute a flaming affair.\u201d</p><p>For some reason he found that observation both extremely irritating and strangely depressing. \u201cCan\u2019t argue that.\u201d</p> <p>She sipped her cocoa for a moment, then put the mug down. \u201cI just had a thought. Maybe whoever did this is one of your old flames. A jealous lover from your mis-spent past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt it.\u201d</p><p>She was undeterred. \u201cGood grief. If I\u2019m right, we\u2019ve got more suspects than we can count.\u201d</p><p>His incipient depression vanished in the heat of a sudden, fierce anger. He sat forward quickly, flattening his palms on the table. \u201cMy reputation in this town was always a hell of a lot more exciting than the reality.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cNow, Rafe\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust me on this. I was there.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cWell, yes, of course you were, but everyone knows about your reputation in those days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis may come as a stunning surprise to you, but contrary to popular opinion, I don\u2019t have a legion of old flames hiding in the bushes here in Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I used the word \u2018legion.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough. For the record, virtually all of my dates\u2014and there were not as many of them as everyone seems to think\u2014were weekend or summer visitors who came here for the beach, the boardwalk, and a good time. They knew what they were doing and so did I. There was nothing serious with any of them, and I\u2019ve never seen any of them again.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw clenched visibly. \u201cThere was Kaitlin Sadler.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. There was Kaitlin Sadler. She was a year older than me, experienced, and she could take care of herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never implied that you took advantage of her. No one ever said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot of rules for myself in those days, but I had a few and I stuck to them. I never got involved with anyone who was married or too young or too na\u00efve to know the score. Hell, you ought to know that better than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d She gripped the edge of the table. \u201cWhy should I know anything about the history of your love life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I never laid a hand on you eight years ago, that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>For the space of two or three heartbeats she simply stared at him in utter astonishment. Then she pulled herself together with an obvious effort. \u201cOf course you never touched me. I wasn\u2019t your type. You wouldn\u2019t have looked twice at me if we hadn\u2019t been stuck out there at the Arch together that night.\u201d</p><p>A cold, mirthless amusement shafted through him. \u201cYou weren\u2019t my type, and you were squarely in the \u2018don\u2019t touch\u2019 category as far as I was concerned, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I didn\u2019t look twice.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cBecause I was a Harte? Was I some sort of challenge?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that you were a Harte had nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you look twice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know. Pure masochism, probably, because I sure as hell knew that you\u2019d never look twice at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d She shot to her feet. \u201cI had a crush on you. Every girl in Eclipse Bay did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s supposed to thrill me?\u201d He was suddenly on his feet, too, although he had no recollection of getting out of his chair. \u201cTo know that for you I was just the interesting bad boy with the bike and the leather jacket and the dangerous rep? The kind of guy your parents always warned you about? The kind of guy it might be amusing to fool around with but definitely not the kind you would ever marry?\u201d</p><p>A fresh tide of hot color rose in her face. He could have sworn he had embarrassed her. Good. Served her right. But her gaze did not slide away from his.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know what kind of man I\u2019d marry?\u201d she asked evenly.</p><p>\u201cYou told me that night, remember? You were only nineteen and you already had your damned list of requirements for a husband made out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was twenty, not nineteen, and I swear, if you mention that list one more time\u2014\u201d</p><p>He reached for her. He closed his hands around her shoulders and hauled her up against his chest. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I don\u2019t care if I never hear about that damned list of yours again for as long as I live. Furthermore, I\u2019m not real keen on hearing about your new, updated version of it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Rafe, you\u2019re acting a little weird here. Maybe the stress\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>He covered her mouth with his own, letting the fierce tension that was eating him up inside pour into her. She made a soft, muffled sound, and then her arms closed tightly around him and she was kissing him back with all the passion that had infused her anger a few seconds earlier.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d he muttered against her throat. \u201cDo you have any idea of the scare you gave me tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScare?\u201d Her own voice was muffled because she was frantically kissing his jaw. \u201cWhy were you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, because I thought maybe the reason you weren\u2019t answering the door was that you were with some other man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Really?\u201d She went very still. Then she pulled back slightly and looked at him with wide, fascinated eyes. \u201cYou were actually afraid that I might be in bed with another man? Did you think that I might have a few old flames of my own here in Eclipse Bay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not go there.\u201d He refused to be sidetracked again by that possibility. \u201cMy other big fear was that you\u2019d gone for a walk with Winston and fallen on the rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Kaitlin Sadler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking of Kaitlin,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cAll I could think about was you.\u201d He wrapped his fingers around the back of her head. \u201cLord help me, I haven\u2019t been able to concentrate on anything else except you since I got that letter from the lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that.\u201d Fresh outrage erupted. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been concentrating on me, it\u2019s because I\u2019m connected to Dreamscape. You have to deal with me before you can get your hands on my property. That\u2019s why you suddenly started focusing on me.

I really don\u2019t see the problem here, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because you\u2019re thinking like a Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know something?\u201d he said through his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ve had it with you implying that just because I\u2019m a Madison, I can\u2019t handle a sexual relationship and a business relationship simultaneously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had it with you classifying our relationship as sexual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what would you call it?\u201d</p><p>She stilled. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Great. That\u2019s a lot of help.\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin. \u201cI just know that for me there has to be more than sex.\u201d</p><p>That stopped him cold. \u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare tell me that a business partnership will fill in the empty places,\u201d she added icily.</p><p>He was annoyed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say that. That sounds like something a Harte would say, not a Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not allowed to insult your family, you can\u2019t insult mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, right. Take all the fun out of the argument. Damn it, Hannah, I\u2019ve had enough of this. You know that what we\u2019ve got is more than just a sexual thing. I want you. I think you want me. Can\u2019t we just go with that for now?\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on his shoulders as if to steady herself. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening here. But I do know that adding sex to the mix complicates things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the most interesting way,\u201d he muttered against her throat.</p><p>\u201cRafe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive whatever we\u2019ve got going for us a chance, okay?\u201d He drew his finger down the curve of her neck. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>He cradled her chin in his palms. \u201cTell me something.\u201d</p><p>She searched his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you ever stop talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as long as I have something to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wondered.\u201d He kissed her again.</p><p>For a few seconds she hesitated and then, with a tiny sigh, she softened.</p><p>Maybe she no longer had anything to say, he thought. A man could always hope.</p><p>Afraid to risk any more conversation, he kept his mouth on hers as he maneuvered her through the kitchen door. When they went past the light switch, he reached out and flipped it to the off position. Heavy shadows descended. The only light now was a dim, welcoming glow at the top of the stairs. He started toward it with Hannah tucked safely against his side.</p><p>His breathing was heavy and ragged by the time he got both of them to the bedroom at the end of the hall. He did not turn on the lamp, but the light from the corridor was sufficient to allow him to see that the room, with its white wicker furniture, white bedspread, and bleached wooden floors, was just as he had imagined it all those years ago: a pristine retreat for an untouchable princess. He felt like the intruder he was.</p><p>Not that that was going to stop him, he thought.</p><p>Exultation raced through him. Nothing could stop him as long as he knew that Hannah wanted him as badly as he wanted her. The passion between them was mutual. He could work with passion. He was a Madison.</p><p>He stopped beside the bed and untied the belt that bound the robe around her waist. She wore a long-sleeved, high-necked, prim white gown underneath it. Womanly armor, he thought. Did she know the challenge it presented?</p><p>She mumbled something against his mouth as he slipped the robe off her shoulders. He did not catch the precise words, but he had no trouble at all understanding the meaning. She was as swept up in the moment as he was.</p><p>Her arms tightened fiercely around his neck when he started to unfasten the tiny little buttons of the flannel nightgown. She smelled so good. He knew that when he threaded his fingers through the triangle of hair at the apex of her thighs she would be moist. He could hardly wait.</p><p>She unbuttoned his shirt and spread her palms across his chest. \u201cI love the feel of you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He was already hard, but her touch and the sultry desire in her words made him absolutely rigid. Electricity flashed through his senses.</p><p>He released her long enough to sit down on the edge of the white bed and remove his running shoes. When he looked up he saw that she was watching him with hungry attention, as if every move he made fascinated her.</p><p>He rose and lowered the flannel gown to her waist. It slipped low on her hips but it did not fall all the way to the floor. He caressed the tips of her small br**sts. Her ni**les were stiff and full. He closed his eyes briefly against the torrent of need that threatened to drown him.</p><p>She undid his belt, and then she lowered his zipper. When her fingers closed lightly around him he stopped breathing for a few seconds. The sensations tearing through him were so intense that he was sure he could live without oxygen for a while.</p><p>She slid her hands beneath the waistband of his trousers and pushed slowly downward. The pants hit the floor at his feet.</p><p>\u201cRafe.\u201d</p><p>He stepped out of the trousers and quickly sheathed himself in the condom he took from his back pocket. Then he grabbed her around the waist and fell back across the white bedspread with her. She sprawled atop his chest and thighs, the bottom of her gown tangling in his bare legs.</p><p>She rained kisses on his flesh. Her fingers circled his upper arms. He shuddered under the gentle assault. Then he rolled onto her back, leaned over her, and tore the gown off altogether. It vanished into the darkness below the bed.</p><p>He curved his hand around her hip and kissed the gentle swell of her belly. She trembled beneath him and reached for him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>He found the tight, hot place between her legs. And she was wet, just as he had anticipated. He inhaled the secret scent until he could no longer think clearly. Then he separated her thighs and kissed the exquisitely soft skin he found there.</p><p>She shivered again. Her nails dug into his shoulder as she tried to pull him up along the length of her. But he was not yet ready to be lured into the climax.</p><p>He drew a fingertip along the tight nub hidden in the silky thatch of hair and felt her quiver in response. She was clawing at him now.</p><p>He bent his head and touched the tip of his tongue to her full, taut clitoris. She tensed.</p><p>\u201cRafe.\u201d It was a plea and a protest. \u201cWait. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.

I want\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... Oh, no. Oh, yes. Yes!\u201d</p><p>He felt her climax take her. The sensation was so intoxicating he nearly went with her.</p><p>He held himself together until the tremors had begun to subside. Only then did he shift his position to lie on top of her.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p> <p>Languidly she raised her lashes and smiled at him, a dreamy smile that was somehow smug and all-knowing and filled with invitation.</p><p>He plunged into her body, driving himself to the hilt. She closed around him and took him deeper still, straight down into uncharted depths and unknowable waters.</p><p>\u201cCome for me,\u201d she said into his mouth.</p><p>He gave himself up to the tides of a mysterious sea.</p><p>A long time later he roused reluctantly from the cocoon of warmth that enveloped them, levered himself up on his elbow, and looked down at her.</p><p>\u201cI just want to know one thing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She raised her lashes halfway and yawned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping with me because you\u2019ve got some kind of kinky thing about finding out what it\u2019s like to do it with the kind of guy your parents would hate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be extremely immature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHartes do not act out just for the hell of it, nor do we take risks merely for the sake of novelty. We are not immature. We\u2019re the logical, reasonable, rational ones, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He kissed her breast. \u201cSo why are you sleeping with me?\u201d</p><p>She studied him with an enigmatic expression. \u201cYou had all the answers earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier I was trying to talk you into bed.\u201d</p> <p>She punched him lightly on the arm. \u201cWe are not amused, Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I know why I\u2019m sleeping with you. I want to know why you\u2019re sleeping with me.\u201d</p><p>She searched his face. \u201cIs it that important to you?\u201d</p><p>Anger stirred deep inside him, dissolving much of the warm afterglow that had enveloped him. \u201cHell, yes, it\u2019s important. You think I\u2019d be trying to get through a stupid conversation like this if the answer wasn\u2019t important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you one thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not doing this because I still have a teenage-type crush on you or because you\u2019re the guy my parents always warned me about.\u201d</p><p>He rolled onto his back, put one hand behind his head, and gazed moodily up at the dark ceiling. \u201cSo what\u2019s the reason?\u201d</p><p>She rose partway off the bed and leaned over him in the shadows. When she spoke, her voice was low and steady.</p><p>\u201cI am sleeping with you because, among other things, I am a mature, unattached adult who happens to be physically attracted to you and also because\u2014\u201d</p><p>An eagerness that bordered on desperation swept through him. Get a grip, he thought. \u201cAnd also because\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He sensed that she was on the verge of saying something crucial. But in the next heartbeat the intense, important thing disappeared beneath a breezy smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd because my dog likes you, and I trust Winston\u2019s judgment implicitly,\u201d she said demurely.</p><p>So what the hell had he expected her to say? He wondered. \u201cSonofabitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but we do not refer to him in those terms in his presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my experience, Winston is never wrong in these matters.\u201d</p><p>He thought about that for a while. \u201cWinston didn\u2019t like the ex-fianc\u00e9, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinston was civil, but he never warmed up to Doug.\u201d Hannah paused. \u201cThere was an unfortunate incident one evening toward the end of the relationship that more or less summed up his opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of incident?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cWinston mistook Doug\u2019s leg for a fire hydrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinston and I are pals,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d make the same mistake with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems to like you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess that\u2019ll have to do. For now.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head slightly. \u201cI guess so. For now.\u201d</p><p>He lay there unmoving, intensely conscious of the warmth of her hip where it rested against his thigh and the elegantly sensual curve of her shoulder. He could not shake the feeling of destiny that rippled through him. It was the same sensation that had come over him the day he opened the letter from Isabel\u2019s lawyer.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Don\u2019t let the feeling run away with you, he warned himself. Stay on top of it. Stay in control. Don\u2019t think about the future. Stay with the present.</p><p>But the future was so important now.</p><p>He inhaled slowly, centering himself. \u201cI was thinking about the subject that we were discussing before we were so delightfully interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you were holding forth on a theory that whoever tried to murder Winston might have been attempting to express his displeasure over our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it in that tone of voice. It\u2019s a good theory. But I never got a chance to explain the finer points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply that whoever tried to off Winston did so because he was pissed about the fact that you and I are sleeping together. What I was going to suggest was that he or she might be worried about something else altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cEver since we arrived here in Eclipse Bay, there has been talk. It hasn\u2019t all been focused on the speculation that one of us is trying to screw the other out of Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cWhat a delicate way to put it.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her. \u201cThere\u2019s also been gossip about what happened eight years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for pity\u2019s sake. You actually think that some people still care whether or not we had sex on the beach that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The conversations have circled around the subject of Kaitlin Sadler\u2019s death. You heard the Willis brothers. Others are talking, too. I overheard a couple of folks in the vegetable aisle at Fulton\u2019s chatting about how no one was really sure what happened that night. One of them suggested that Yates might have closed the case a little too quickly, for lack of suspects.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hannah\u2019s lips parted as understanding struck. \u201cKaitlin died a long time ago. Who would care if there was fresh talk going around about an old tragedy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone who thinks that I really did murder Kaitlin might care. A lot.\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cDell Sadler. But why would he try to harm my dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as Dell is concerned, you covered for me that night. You\u2019re involved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think he would have tried to harm Winston as a way of taking some revenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Rafe said deliberately, \u201cthat we\u2019d better talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>The faded sign over the gate read SADLER\u2019S AUTO RE- BUILD. Beneath it, in slightly smaller letters, were the words 24-HOUR TOWING. And below that was the phrase SPECIALIZING IN INSURANCE WORK. But the chain-link fence that enclosed the metal carcasses of ruined automobiles and the big dog with the massive head sprawled in front of the trailer sent a slightly different message. This was a junkyard.</p><p>Hannah took one look at the huge dog and decided to leave Winston in the car. \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t let him out,\u201d she said as Rafe opened the door on his side.</p> <p>Rafe eyed the animal lying in the shade of the tattered awning that shielded the trailer door. \u201cHave a little faith. We\u2019re talking brains versus brawn here. My money\u2019s on Winston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not going to put that to the test.\u201d Hannah looked at Winston through the two-inch crack she had left between the window and the top of the car door frame. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything to provoke that beast, understand?\u201d</p><p>Winston whined softly. His rear legs were planted on the seat she had just vacated, his front paws braced against the door. Ears alert, nose quivering, he stared through the window, his whole attention concentrated on the other dog.</p><p>Hannah shuddered at the thought of what might happen if Winston got out of the car. She checked the passenger door to make certain that it was firmly shut and then sent Rafe a warning glance over the low roof of the Porsche.</p><p>\u201cBe sure you close that door firmly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worry too much,\u201d Rafe said. He gave the Porsche door a rather casual push. \u201cWinston\u2019s smart. He can handle that guy.\u201d</p> <p>She watched the big dog heave his bulk to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m a lot smarter than that monster, too. But I wouldn\u2019t want to get into a fight with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Winston stays in the car.\u201d Rafe walked to the gate and leaned on a grimy button.</p><p>A few seconds later the door of the trailer opened. Dell Sadler appeared, silhouetted in the gloom. He gazed at Rafe and Hannah, his face shadowed by the brim of a greasy billed cap. After a while he apparently came to a decision. He started toward the gate. The dog paced stiffly after him, moving with the painfully awkward stride of an animal who was either very old or had been badly injured.</p><p>Dell crossed the yard, weaving his way between piles of tires, crumpled fenders, and assorted mutilated auto parts. When he reached the gate he made no move to open it. He stared balefully at Rafe through the chain links. The dog came to a halt beside him and stared too. Dell did not look down, but he put his hand on the creature\u2019s head in a gesture that was at once calming and absently affectionate. The bond between man and beast was evident.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Happy,\u201d Dell said.</p><p>Quite suddenly Hannah found it difficult to believe that this man had tried to murder Winston last night.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ya want?\u201d Dell asked gruffly.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk to you, Dell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaitlin.\u201d</p><p>Dell\u2019s shoulders stiffened visibly. He hesitated for a long time. Then he reached for the latch. \u201cYou better come inside.\u201d</p><p>The gate swung open. Dell led the way through the piles of dead automobiles.</p><p>The tidy interior of the trailer was a surprise. Hannah glanced surreptitiously around as she sat down on the worn vinyl-covered couch. There was a good reading lamp on the built-in end table. A pile of magazines bearing recent dates was stacked beside it. A new mystery novel by a familiar author lay on the miniature coffee table.</p><p>Dell hovered in the little kitchen. He appeared nervous, uneasy, as if he was not sure how to handle guests. \u201cYou want something to drink? I got some soda and beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoda\u2019s fine,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cWhatever\u2019s handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoda sounds great,\u201d Hannah said gently.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Dell opened the refrigerator and hauled out two cans. He carried them into the living room portion of the trailer and set them on the table in front of Rafe and Hannah.</p><p>Hannah glanced through the screen door of the trailer, studying the dog sprawled outside. \u201cWhat happened to your dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy got run over by some drunk bastard on the highway while we was out on a tow job one night. Messed up his rear legs pretty bad. Vet told me I oughta put him down, but I just couldn\u2019t do that. Cost me a fortune, but what was I gonna do? Me and Happy are partners, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Hannah said. Definitely not a dog killer, she thought. But if Dell Sadler wasn\u2019t the one who had put Winston out on the rocks in Dead Hand Cove, who had? \u201cSomeone tried to kill my dog last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone wanna kill a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think it may have been meant as a warning of some kind,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cShit. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here, isn\u2019t it? You think maybe I tried to hurt your dog on accounta what happened to Kaitlin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt crossed our minds,\u201d Rafe admitted. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one I can think of who might have wanted to avenge Kaitlin\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Dell said again. He sank down onto a threadbare chair and stared at the logo on the can in his hand. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurt no dog. That little pooch of yours didn\u2019t have anything to do with what happened to my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Rafe leaned forward, legs spread. He held the can of soda loosely in his fingers between his knees. Serious but nonthreatening. Man to man. \u201cI\u2019ll come to the point, Dell. I know you think I killed Kaitlin. I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the God\u2019s honest truth. You\u2019ll believe what you want to believe, but in the meantime, I really need to know why you\u2019re so sure I\u2019m guilty.\u201d</p><p>Dell turned the can between his hands. Eventually he looked up. \u201cI always figured it was you because you were the last one with her that night. Everyone said you were pissed that she was playing around.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hannah stirred. \u201cBut why were you always so sure that it was murder in the first place? Why couldn\u2019t it have been an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they found her in Hidden Cove. Said she must have been up on the path in the middle of the night. Doesn\u2019t make sense. Why would she go out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo meet a man?\u201d Hannah suggested gently.</p><p>Dell gave her a derisive look. \u201cShe had her own house. And a car, too. She didn\u2019t have to go to someplace like Hidden Cove to fool around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnless she didn\u2019t want to be seen with whoever she met there,\u201d Rafe said bluntly. \u201cWhich lets me out. She sure didn\u2019t mind having people see her with me.\u201d</p><p>Hannah pursed her lips, thinking. \u201cMaybe she didn\u2019t go out there to meet anyone. Maybe she just went there to meditate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeditate?\u201d Dell looked at her as if she had lost her mind. \u201cKaitlin wasn\u2019t into that kinda weird stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone needs to get away to a quiet place to think about their future once in a while,\u201d Hannah persisted. But she noticed that Rafe was now looking at her strangely too. Obviously neither of these two considered Kaitlin to be the thoughtful, introspective type.</p><p>\u201cNot Kaitlin.\u201d Dell took a swallow from his can of soda and wiped his mouth with the back of a stained sleeve. \u201cShe had her future down cold. Didn\u2019t need to do any meditating on it. Kaitlin always had big plans, y\u2019know?\u201d</p> <p>A tingle of expectation shot through Hannah. She and Rafe exchanged nods. She turned back to Dell.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that Kaitlin didn\u2019t have to do any meditating on her future?\u201d she asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cShe already knew what she was going to do. Called me that night.\u201d Dell studied his soda can intently. \u201cSaid she\u2019d had enough of this town. She was gonna leave first thing in the morning and never come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling us that you spoke with Kaitlin just before she died?\u201d Rafe asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Like I said, she called me. Woke me up. She was still really mad at you, y\u2019know? Said she\u2019d had it with everyone here. All losers, she said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she plan to finance this final exit?\u201d Rafe asked.</p> <p>Dell sucked in a deep breath and took another swallow of soda. He lowered the can slowly and peered into the middle distance. Looking into the past. \u201cShe told me that she was going to use her nuclear option.\u201d</p><p>Rafe did not move. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>Dell hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, to tell you the truth. She never was real clear about it. I got the feeling that she had some cash stashed away. Figured one of her boyfriends had given it to her. Or maybe someone gave her a piece of fancy jewelry she thought she could sell.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s mouth went dry. She said nothing.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight.\u201d Rafe sounded as if he was choosing his words with exquisite care. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that she left me on the beach that night, went home, and called you to tell you that she was going to go nuclear and then leave town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next thing I know,\u201d Dell said dully, \u201cYates is pounding on my door. Come to tell me Kaitlin\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you told him you were pretty sure I\u2019d killed her\u2014is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Dell muttered.</p> <p>\u201cFollow your own logic for a while here,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cHow did I know she was headed for Hidden Cove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figure you went to her place. You killed her there and then dumped her body in Hidden Cove.\u201d</p><p>Rafe groaned. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a theory. I\u2019ll give you that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaitlin wasn\u2019t like me,\u201d Dell pleaded to Hannah. \u201cShe wanted to get out of this town. Be someone. She had dreams, y\u2019see? Lots of \u2019em. Big ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>\u201cBut none of \u2019em ever worked out for her.\u201d Dell gave a sad sigh. \u201cSeemed like everything always went wrong. I was her brother, y\u2019know, but there was never anything I could do to fix things for her.\u201d</p><p>Rafe frowned. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault you couldn\u2019t straighten out her problems, Dell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But it just seemed like I shoulda been able to do something, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cI know. Sometimes you\u2019ve just got to live with the fact that there wasn\u2019t anything you could do.\u201d</p><p>Dell nodded bleakly. \u201cThought I\u2019d put it all behind me. Told myself it was finished. Then you two showed up in town together. Made it clear you planned to hang around awhile. People started talking about what happened that night again.\u201d</p><p>Rafe looked at him. \u201cWhen Yates came around asking questions, did he say whether or not he had searched Kaitlin\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went through the place real thoroughly. Her car, too. I was with him when he did it,\u201d Dell said morosely. \u201cSaid he was looking for a suicide note, but he tore that place apart, y\u2019know? Why would he do that if he was just lookin\u2019 for a note? I mean, if she\u2019d left one, she would have put it in plain sight, don\u2019t you think? Why leave a note if you don\u2019t want it to be found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cShe\u2019d have left it in plain sight.\u201d</p><p>Hannah gripped the edge of her chair very tightly. \u201cDo you recall whether or not Yates pulled out her washer and dryer to check behind them?\u201d</p><p>Dell nodded. \u201cAnd the refrigerator, too. Like I said, he really went through her stuff. But I know she didn\u2019t jump off that cliff. There was no note. I told him she wasn\u2019t the type to commit suicide. Asked him what he was really looking for.\u201d</p><p>Hannah watched him. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid he\u2019d know it if he found it. But he didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d</p><p>They all sat in silence for a time. After a while Dell sighed heavily and drained the last of his soda. \u201cI didn\u2019t try to kill your dog, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t hurt an innocent animal.\u201d</p><p>Dell nodded and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cRafe didn\u2019t kill Kaitlin. I really was with him that night on the beach near the Arch. There was no way he could have followed your sister home, let alone kill her and take her body to Hidden Cove. You have my word on it.\u201d</p><p>Dell did not move for a long time. Then he looked at Rafe. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t you, who was it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood question,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>Back in the car, Winston draped the front half of his body over the back of the seat and nuzzled Hannah\u2019s shoulder. She scratched his ears and glanced at Rafe.</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout that lingerie and the videos the Willis brothers found hidden behind Kaitlin\u2019s dryer?\u201d Rafe steered the Porsche in a tight circle and drove down the dusty, rutted road that led away from Sadler\u2019s Auto Rebuild. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. Maybe those videos were her nuclear option.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlackmail material?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Rafe said again. \u201cAnd maybe Chief Yates suspected something. Maybe that\u2019s why he tore her place apart that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d</p><p>Rafe turned right onto the main road. \u201cWhich means that whoever killed Kaitlin managed to recover the videos and the lingerie.\u201d</p><p>Hannah shivered. \u201cDo you realize what we\u2019re saying here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re saying that Dell Sadler was right all along. Kaitlin didn\u2019t die in an accidental fall. And she sure as hell didn\u2019t jump off the Hidden Cove path. She was murdered by someone she was attempting to blackmail.\u201d</p><p>Hannah took a breath. \u201cWe\u2019re making some huge assumptions here.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAfter what almost happened to you and Winston last night, I\u2019m willing to take some very big leaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re right, someone murdered Kaitlin because she had possession of compromising videos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question is, who in this burg would have committed murder just to keep her quiet about an affair involving some frilly lingerie? Cross-dressing isn\u2019t that big a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Rafe. You want possibilities? How about some desperate assistant professor at Chamberlain who might have been afraid that his chance at tenure was about to go up in smoke because of those videos? Or try a minister at a local church who would lose his congregation if his taste for ladies\u2019 underwear became public knowledge. And then there\u2019s the crowd up at the institute. Arizona Snow has always been convinced that there are some very unsavory characters up there. Maybe she\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>Rafe sank deeper into the leather seat. \u201cYou\u2019re right. A long list of possibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s the Willis brothers\u2019 theory that the killer was someone from out of town. Which gives us an even longer list.\u201d</p><p>Rafe\u2019s dark brows met above his shades in a thoughtful frown. \u201cDon\u2019t think so. Her decision to use her nuclear option, as Dell put it, was apparently an impulse. Her victim had to be someone she could reach on the spur of the moment that night. Not someone who had to be summoned from Portland or Seattle or Salem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d Hannah pondered for a minute. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s try this from another angle. Surely not everyone in Eclipse Bay is into ladies\u2019 lingerie. And not everyone here who is into women\u2019s underwear would commit murder to keep a blackmailer quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we need to do is find out who fits the profile, as the cops say. Someone who is into female undies and who would also be willing to kill to get his hands on the compromising videos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do that we need to talk to someone who knows this town better than you and I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a name in mind?\u201d</p> <p>Rafe\u2019s mouth curved in a humorless smile. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I do. Our dinner guest tonight.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Rafe rinsed the red radicchio leaves under running water and dropped them gently into the colander on top of the arugula and cilantro. Mentally he ran through his plans for the meal. Three carefully chosen ripe avocados sat in a bowl at the far end of the counter. He would cut them in half just before serving, spoon balsamic vinegar into the hollows and sprinkle them with some coarsely grated sea salt. The pasta would be a straightforward dish using olives and tomatoes and goat cheese.</p><p>When he finished rinsing the lettuce for the salad, he went to work on the hummus. He tossed a sizable quantity of cooked garbanzo beans into the food processor and added tahini, lemon juice, and a bit of garlic.</p><p>He snapped on the lid, flipped the switch, and thought about what Dell Sadler had said while he listened to the pleasant sound of garbanzos being pulverized. Kaitlin had intended to use her nuclear option.</p><p>A killer who had thought himself in the clear for the past eight years might have reason to worry now that the old gossip was being dredged up and rehashed all over town. What if someone remembered something important after all this time? What if someone put two and two together in a way that hadn\u2019t been done eight years ago? What if someone had seen something that night and belatedly realized that it was a clue?</p><p>A murderer who had struck once to keep his secret might be willing to strike again.</p><p>A cold feeling closed in on Rafe. The dread that he had been holding at bay all day broke through the dam, and he was suddenly dealing with a nightmarish river. The question he had not raised with Hannah, the one that had been plaguing him for hours, could no longer be avoided.</p><p>That question was horrifyingly simple: What if Winston had not been the main target last night? Maybe the attack on the dog had never been intended as a warning. Maybe the Schnauzer had been set out on the finger as bait to lure Hannah into danger. If she had arrived home as little as half an hour later, rescuing Winston would have put her in great jeopardy. The force of the incoming tide could have swept her feet out from under her, perhaps dashed her against the rocks.</p><p>He thought about how she had taken Winston into the caves because she had sensed someone watching her from the cliff path. What if the killer had been hanging around, watching to see if his plans were going to work out as he\u2019d intended? What if he had waited on the cliff path with the intention of making certain that Hannah and Winston never made it back from the cove alive?</p><p>What if?</p><p>Rafe switched off the food processor and removed the lid. He could not afford to take any more chances, he thought as he scooped out the fragrant hummus. Tonight he would have to take drastic steps. He would never be able to sleep if he didn\u2019t.</p><p>At six-thirty that evening, he picked up the tray of hors d\u2019oeuvres. Winston, who had been supervising the final kitchen preparations with an expression of mingled wistfulness and lust, got to his feet.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, mutt.\u201d Rafe tossed him a slice of pita bread slathered in hummus. \u201cChef\u2019s privilege.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Winston gnawed happily on the tidbit as he hurried after Rafe. Together they crossed the hall toward the sunroom, where Hannah and Mitchell were sharing a glass of wine and the view of evening fog moving in over the bay.</p><p>Rafe glanced at the bowl of hummus and pita toast points arranged on the tray, double-checking the visual appeal of the hors d\u2019oeuvres. The trickle of uneasiness he felt was disconcerting. He was usually confident of his cooking. He knew he had a keen sense of how to blend flavors into intriguing combinations and a flair for presentation. He had planned this meal with great care. He knew everything was perfect. It was the first time he had ever cooked for Mitchell, and he did not want any screwups.</p><p>Mitchell\u2019s low growl stopped him just as he was about to enter the room.</p><p>\u201c. . . Don\u2019t you worry. Rafe will do right by you,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI\u2019ll see to it.\u201d</p> <p>Rafe froze in the doorway. Winston stopped, too, cocking his head with an inquiring look.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck does that mean?\u201d Hannah sounded baffled and more than a little wary. \u201cAre you going to force him to give up his claim on this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever could force that bullheaded boy to do anything he didn\u2019t want to do, and I\u2019m pretty sure he won\u2019t give up Dreamscape. Seems to have his heart set on turning it into an inn and a restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe certainly does.\u201d Hannah\u2019s voice was clipped.</p><p>\u201cWhen a Madison\u2019s got his heart set on something,\u201d Mitchell warned with gruff gentleness, \u201cit isn\u2019t easy persuading him to change course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got the cash to make it happen. Made himself a bundle in the market, you know.\u201d Mitchell sighed. \u201cAlways did have a head for business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d Hannah\u2019s tone was becoming grim.</p><p>\u201cBarring a tsunami or an earthquake or a volcanic eruption that wipes out this section of the coast, I reckon Rafe will see his plans through.\u201d Mitchell paused. \u201cThing is, he\u2019s a lot like me when it comes to going after what he wants.\u201d</p><p>Hannah was quiet for a time. Rafe realized that his hands were clenched around the handles of the hors d\u2019oeuvres tray. He could not seem to move through the doorway. He was waiting for something, but he was not sure what that something was.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you mean when you said you\u2019d see to it that he would do right by me?\u201d Hannah asked eventually.</p> <p>\u201cLord above, woman, don\u2019t play dumb with me. There isn\u2019t any such thing as a dumb Harte, and we both know it. I\u2019m talking about marriage, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage!\u201d Hannah\u2019s voice rose to a shrill squeak. \u201cRafe and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure. What did you think I was talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear me out, now, Hannah. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking about this, and I\u2019m pretty sure I can swing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure? Pretty sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, damn sure. Pardon my language. Not quite the same thing as making him give up Dreamscape, of course. That would be a real case of hitting my head against a brick wall. But this fear of marriage that he\u2019s got, that\u2019s just a case of bad nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNerves,\u201d Hannah repeated in a dazed voice.</p> <p>\u201cRight. He\u2019s convinced that Madison men have a bad time with marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you do have a history of disastrous marriages in your clan,\u201d Hannah muttered. \u201cAnd Rafe has already screwed up once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so he made one little mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese things happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ought to know,\u201d Hannah said much too sweetly. \u201cHow many times have you been married, Mr. Madison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go tagging Rafe with my lousy track record. I admit that for a long time after Claudia Banner took off with the assets of Harte-Madison, I didn\u2019t think real clearly when it came to women. Had a few problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly, from what I understand.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell made a rude sound. \u201cCan\u2019t blame you for your opinion. You\u2019ve been brought up to think the worst of me. I know that Sullivan has fed you a lot of wild stories over the years. What I\u2019m trying to tell you is that Rafe and I are alike in a lot of ways but not in every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that isn\u2019t just like a Harte,\u201d Mitchell said heatedly. \u201cThrow a man\u2019s mistakes back in his face and don\u2019t bother to give him a chance to put things right. You got a lot in common with your granddad, young woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re straying from the point here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, that divorce wasn\u2019t Rafe\u2019s fault. Don\u2019t hold it against him. He learned from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. From what I can gather, he learned that he doesn\u2019t want to get married again,\u201d Hannah said dryly.</p><p>\u201cExactly what I\u2019m trying to tell you,\u201d Mitchell said quickly. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I\u2019ve figured out Rafe\u2019s problem. He\u2019s got some sort of phobia about marriage, see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve concluded that he\u2019s afraid of marriage?\u201d Hannah\u2019s voice was oddly weak.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Mitchell sounded pleased that she had grasped the point so readily. \u201cThe way some folks are scared of spiders or snakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA charming analogy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sort of see how it happened,\u201d Mitchell continued earnestly. \u201cI got to admit I didn\u2019t set a good example for Sinclair, and things trickled on down to Rafe. But I figure I can get him past it. Figure I owe him that much, since it was me who was responsible for this phobia thing in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you intend to do that?\u201d Hannah\u2019s voice was stronger now, infused with morbid curiosity. \u201cGet out your shotgun and march him to the altar?\u201d</p><p>Rafe felt as though he\u2019d been turned into a block of solid marble.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d Mitchell asked ingenuously.</p><p>\u201cGood grief, no. Of course not.\u201d</p><p>Rafe winced. Did she have to sound so positively negative about the idea?</p><p>\u201cIt might take a little push from me,\u201d Mitchell allowed reflectively. \u201cWhen it comes to phobias, sometimes you\u2019ve got to force folks to face up to \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just told me that force didn\u2019t work well with Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking more in terms of applying a little pressure in the right spots.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs it happens,\u201d Hannah said, sweet, sharp steel in every syllable, \u201cI\u2019m in the business of getting people married, and I can tell you that making a marriage work is hard enough when both parties go into it enthusiastically. Any marriage forged by outside pressure would be doomed before the vows even got said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too young to be so pessimistic,\u201d Mitchell complained.</p><p>\u201cMitchell, I\u2019m sure you mean well, but the very last thing I want to do is marry a man who doesn\u2019t want to get married. Are we clear on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t let Rafe\u2019s bad nerves put you off the notion,\u201d Mitchell replied. \u201cIt\u2019s true the Madison men have a lousy track record when it comes to marriage, but the right woman could change all that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you want to change it?\u201d Hannah demanded, thoroughly exasperated now. \u201cWhat is this all about, anyway? Why do you want Rafe and me to get married?\u201d</p><p>Still stuck in the doorway, Rafe waited for the other shoe to drop.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Mitchell snapped, evidently out of patience himself. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to stop people from talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when did you start worrying about local gossip?\u201d Hannah asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s gossip and there\u2019s gossip,\u201d Mitchell declared. \u201cEveryone in town is saying he\u2019s carrying on with you because he wants to get his hands on the other half of this place. That\u2019s a damned lie. Reminds me of the talk that went around town the night Kaitlin Sadler died. All those rumors about how he\u2019d seduced you just to get himself an alibi. Pure garbage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey certainly were,\u201d Hannah said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHell, I know that.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s voice rang with conviction. \u201cRafe had nothing to do with that poor girl\u2019s death. Madison men got problems when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex, but no Madison man has ever laid a hand on a woman in anger. No man in this family would ever assault a female, by God. And no Madison would seduce an innocent girl like you to cover his own tracks, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d</p><p>A loud silence gripped the sunroom.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Hannah said quietly.</p><p>Rafe remembered to take a breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying Rafe might not have argued with Kaitlin Sadler,\u201d Mitchell continued. \u201cHe\u2019s a Madison. He\u2019s got a temper. But if he had been with Kaitlin that night and if there had been some terrible accident, he\u2019d have gone for help and then he\u2019d have told the flat-out truth about what happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that, too,\u201d Hannah said again. Her voice was very even. \u201cI\u2019m a Harte, remember? Lord knows that we\u2019re well aware that Madisons have their faults, but no one in my family has ever accused anyone in your clan of lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Mitchell agreed.</p><p>Rafe glanced down at the tray of hummus and pita bread points he held. Mitchell had believed him all those years ago. The old man disapproved of just about everything he\u2019d ever done in his life, but he had never doubted Rafe\u2019s word about what had happened the night Kaitlin Sadler died.</p><p>Rafe discovered that he could move again. He walked into the sunroom and set the tray down on a table. He noticed that Hannah\u2019s cheeks were flushed. She avoided his eyes. He knew she was wondering how much of the conversation he had overheard.</p><p>\u201cThe hummus looks wonderful,\u201d she said a little too brightly.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Rafe picked up the small glass pitcher of very good, very expensive olive oil that sat on the tray. He poured a liberal stream of the rich, fruity oil over the hummus.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Mitchell studied the hummus with curiosity. \u201cSome kinda bean dip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cSome kind of bean dip.\u201d He set down the pitcher of olive oil. He pulled the bottle of Chardonnay out of the ice bucket and poured himself a glass. \u201cGlad you left some for me. I need it.\u201d</p> <p>Hannah and Mitchell gazed at him as though he were charming a snake. Both were uneasy. Neither wanted to make any sudden moves. He took his time, savoring the perfect balance of oak and fruit and the elegant finish of the wine.</p><p>When he was done, he set the glass down on the table very deliberately and looked at Hannah and Mitchell.</p><p>\u201cI hear that wine is good for the nerves,\u201d he said.</p><p>Two hours later, Mitchell put down his fork with a sigh of satisfaction. Just a few slivers of buttery pastry was all that remained of the kiwi tart.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did you learn to cook?\u201d he asked Rafe. \u201cSure didn\u2019t get it from me. The best I can do is throw a salmon steak on the grill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook some classes,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cBut mostly I just spend a lot of time fooling around in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if this inn of yours doesn\u2019t work out, it won\u2019t be because the food is bad.\u201d</p><p>Rafe caught Hannah\u2019s attention. He knew that they were both aware of what had just happened. Mitchell had bestowed his approval, not only on the food but on the entire inn project. She was probably thinking that she had just lost a lot of ground in her battle to claim his half of the inn. She was right.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about something important, Mitchell.\u201d Rafe settled back in his chair and contemplated his grandfather across the remains of the meal. \u201cLast night someone tried to drown Hannah\u2019s dog.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell blinked in astonishment. Then he looked at Winston, who was dozing peacefully on the rug beneath the table. \u201cWho the hell would do a thing like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Rafe admitted. \u201cBut I intend to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Mitchell demanded.</p><p>Nobody ever accused Mitchell of being slow, Rafe thought. \u201cI don\u2019t know that, either, but we\u2019ve concluded that it might be connected to what happened to Kaitlin Sadler.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell gazed at him for a very long time. \u201cYou\u2019re serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. There\u2019s some stuff I need to tell you before this conversation goes any further.\u201d Rafe gave Mitchell a brief summary of events, including the talk with Dell Sadler.</p><p>When he had finished, Mitchell whistled softly. \u201cYou realize what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it\u2019s possible Kaitlin Sadler really was killed, just as Dell Sadler has always believed. And that the reason she was murdered was because she tried to blackmail someone here in Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot and damn.\u201d Mitchell sounded thoughtful now. \u201cYates was so damn sure it was an accident.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe not quite so certain as he let everyone think,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cIn addition to asking a lot of questions, he did a thorough search of Kaitlin\u2019s house and car that night. He must have had a few suspicions.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell shrugged. \u201cYates was a good cop in his time.\u201d</p><p>Hannah sipped coffee from a small cup. She regarded Mitchell very steadily. \u201cWe need a little help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom me? Now, see here, just what are you two thinking of doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to find out who Kaitlin was blackmailing,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>Mitchell frowned. \u201cYou want my advice? Don\u2019t go poking a stick in a hole. There might be a real nasty varmint inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem,\u201d Rafe said deliberately, \u201cis that the varmint has already crawled out of the hole. I don\u2019t think Winston was the real target last night. I have a hunch that whoever put him out there on that finger may have intended for Hannah to get caught by the incoming tide.\u201d</p><p>Hannah snapped her head around in surprise. \u201cRafe, what are you saying? You never told me you thought that someone had tried to\u2014\u201d She broke off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that someone did try to hurt you last night. Winston may have been just a warning. But I\u2019m not taking any chances.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. We\u2019ll deal with that later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal with what later?\u201d She slammed her coffee cup down onto the saucer. \u201cNow just one damn minute. I want an explanation.\u201d</p><p>Rafe met Mitchell\u2019s gaze and talked over the top of Hannah\u2019s simmering words. \u201cIf I said to you ladies\u2019 underwear in sizes big enough to fit a man, big high heels, Kaitlin Sadler, and some compromising videotapes that were bad enough to serve as blackmail material, what would you say?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell\u2019s face worked. For a moment Rafe thought that he was going to explode with outrage. But abruptly the ire metamorphosed into something else. Curiosity, or reluctant interest, Rafe decided.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking eight years ago, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Mitchell said thoughtfully.</p> <p>Rafe watched him. \u201cOne way or another, you\u2019ve been connected to this town for more than fifty years. Any names come to mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mitchell said immediately. \u201cBut that\u2019s no big surprise. I never paid much attention to other people\u2019s sex lives. The only one that ever interested me was my own.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut there was someone who did keep track of that kind of thing, along with every other damn secret in this town.\u201d</p><p>Hannah groaned. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not going to tell us that person was Arizona Snow. It\u2019s hopeless trying to get anything out of her. She might know some secrets, but she filters them all through her conspiracy theories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t thinking of Arizona,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI was talking about Ed Bolton. Owned the Eclipse Bay Journal for more than forty years until he sold out to Jed Steadman. Ed knew everything about everyone in this town.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment coursed through Rafe. \u201cI heard that Ed Bolton died four or five years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Mitchell said in an oddly neutral voice. \u201cHeart attack. But his widow, Bev, is still around. Lives in Portland now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that Bev Bolton would know the secrets that Ed knew?\u201d Hannah asked.</p><p>Mitchell nodded slowly. \u201cBev and Ed were together for a long time. Fine woman. Good marriage, from all accounts. Yeah, I reckon she\u2019d know what Ed knew.\u201d</p> <p>Somewhere in the back of Rafe\u2019s brain something went click.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know so much about Bev Bolton\u2019s marriage?\u201d he asked Mitchell.</p><p>\u201cBev and I get together once in a while,\u201d Mitchell said very casually. \u201cTalk over old times. You know how it is.\u201d</p><p>Rafe flopped back in his chair. \u201cDamn. How long have you and Bev Bolton been having an affair?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell\u2019s brows bunched and quivered in annoyance. \u201cSee here, my private life is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Sure. Your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBev and I go back a long ways.\u201d Mitchell paused. \u201cA couple of years after Ed died, I asked her to marry me.\u201d</p><p>Rafe was astounded. \u201cNo kidding? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurned me down flat,\u201d Mitchell admitted.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Mitchell went on, \u201cBev and I get together whenever I go to Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Rafe recalled the conversation with Gabe concerning Mitchell\u2019s frequent trips to Portland. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve found a reason to go nearly every week for the past ten months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell business is it of yours? A man\u2019s got a right to his personal life.\u201d</p><p>Rafe started to smile. The smile turned into a grin before he could control it, and then, without warning, he was laughing so hard he feared he might fall off his chair.</p><p>Winston roused himself to thrust his nose inquiringly into Rafe\u2019s hand. Rafe scratched him behind the ears and laughed even harder.</p><p>Hannah and Mitchell frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Hannah asked with a bewildered expression.</p><p>Mitchell glowered. \u201cIf there\u2019s a joke here, you\u2019d better share it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe joke is on Gabe and me,\u201d Rafe said, subduing the laughter to a wide grin. \u201cWe thought all those trips to Portland you\u2019ve been taking for the past year were to get medical treatment. We were afraid you had some terrible, lingering disease you were hiding from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Mitchell blinked, and then his eyes gleamed with secret amusement. \u201cOne of those trips last year was to see a doctor. But it wasn\u2019t because I had come down with anything serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a checkup?\u201d Rafe asked.</p><p>\u201cYou might say that,\u201d Mitchell said with a benign smile. \u201cHappy to tell you that everything is in pretty fair working order, considering the mileage I\u2019ve put on this body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d Rafe realized he felt a lot lighter.</p><p>\u201cUnless you do me in with your cooking,\u201d Mitchell said, \u201cDr. Reed tells me I\u2019m likely to be around to pester the rest of you for quite a while yet. Now, then, as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, I was planning to go to Portland at the end of the week. No reason I can\u2019t drive in with Bryce in the morning instead.\u201d</p><p>Bryce arrived to collect Mitchell shortly after ten that night. Hannah stood on the front porch with Rafe and Winston, her arms folded, and watched the big SUV lumber off down the drive. It turned left onto the road, and the headlights disappeared into the night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She braced herself. She had managed to relax midway through the meal, and later when the conversation had turned to the subject of Kaitlin Sadler\u2019s death, she had almost forgotten the awkward moments she\u2019d experienced earlier in the evening. But now that she was alone again with Rafe, she could feel the uneasiness stealing back over her.</p><p>The unsettling question returned in a rush. Just how much had Rafe overheard of Mitchell\u2019s vow to make his grandson do right by her?</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d call the evening a resounding success,\u201d she said briskly. She turned away and walked back toward the open front door. \u201cMitchell liked your cooking, and he seems genuinely interested in helping us figure out what\u2019s going on around here. Can\u2019t ask for more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d Rafe said, \u201cthere is one more thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want help with the dishes?\u201d She paused in the doorway. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against the railing and studied her in the yellow glow of the porch lights. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll take you up on that. But I wasn\u2019t referring to the dishes. I\u2019ve been doing some thinking.\u201d</p><p>She realized that her heart was beating much too quickly. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have had that cup of strong coffee after dinner. \u201cWhat exactly have you been thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said earlier that I think there\u2019s a possibility that whoever stuck Winston out on the rock last night was after you, not your dog.\u201d</p><p>She felt the world drop away from beneath her feet. \u201cAre you saying that you think someone actually tried to kill me last night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe he just hoped there would be a convenient accident. All I know for sure is that I don\u2019t think we should take any chances.\u201d</p><p>She chilled. \u201cYou\u2019re leaping to a very wild conclusion, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>He straightened away from the railing and crossed the porch to stand in front of her. He gripped her shoulders with both hands. \u201cListen, I didn\u2019t want to scare you like this, but I couldn\u2019t come up with any other way to convince you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvince me of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you can\u2019t stay alone in your folks\u2019 house any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be real rational and logical here. The way I see it, we\u2019ve got two options. You and Winston can move in with me here or else I can pack a bag and settle in at your place. Take your pick. Either one is fine by me, but I think you\u2019d be more comfortable here. There\u2019s more space. Hell, you can have the entire third floor to yourself if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>For a split second she was on the verge of a very primitive sense of panic. It was one thing to spend the occasional night together while they charted their way through uncertain waters in a relationship that might easily founder. It was something else again to actually pack up and move in here with him. She wasn\u2019t sure just what the nature of that difference was, but she knew that it was important. She tried to stall while she sorted out the implications.</p><p>\u201cPeople will talk,\u201d she said. It was weak. She knew it was weak even before she saw his brows lift.</p><p>\u201cPeople are already talking,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI doubt if the gossip will get any more exciting if you move in here. You can always say that you\u2019re just trying to stake your claim to your half of Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>It was a perfectly reasonable, eminently pragmatic suggestion she told herself. And there were more bathrooms and more space here. What if someone really had intended for her to drown last night? And she did own half of this place.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, trying to sound very cool. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to the house and pack my things. But I think we need some ground rules here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you\u2019d say something like that. Let me guess what you mean by ground rules. Separate bedrooms, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be best,\u201d she said very primly. \u201cThis thing is getting very complicated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd sharing a bedroom with me on a routine basis makes it even more complicated?\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cAn occasional night of... of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWild passion?\u201d he offered helpfully.</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cAs I was saying, an occasional night together is one thing. But sharing a bedroom feels more like... like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a commitment?\u201d he supplied with an air of amusement.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she shot back, goaded. \u201cLike a commitment. Which, I might add, neither of us has made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe subject has not arisen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d She could hear the waspish edge in her own voice. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to stay here, it will be on my terms, and that means separate bedrooms.\u201d</p><p>He moved his hand in a suspiciously careless manner. \u201cWhatever you say. I\u2019ll drive you back to your place and give you a hand with the packing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do if you\u2019re going to help me with the dishes.\u201d</p><p>Suspicion flickered briefly. He was being entirely too cooperative, she thought. But when she searched his gaze she saw nothing but mocking amusement.</p><p>Much later that night she awoke quite suddenly, aware that something was wrong. She stared at the ceiling for a while before she realized that she could not feel Winston\u2019s familiar warmth at her feet.</p><p>There was a soft whine in the darkness. Alarm zapped through her. She sat straight up in bed and switched on the light.</p><p>Winston was sitting in front of the bedroom door. He looked impatient to get out.</p><p>\u201cOh, damn.\u201d She shoved aside the covers, grabbed her robe, and hurried toward the door. \u201cWhat is it? Is there someone out there watching us here at Dreamscape? I thought we left that problem behind when we moved out of the cottage.\u201d</p><p>Winston scratched politely at the base of the door. She flung it open for him. He trotted out into the unlit hall. She followed quickly.</p><p>On the second floor landing she paused. \u201cWe should wake Rafe. He\u2019ll want to be involved in this, whatever it is.\u201d</p><p>Winston ignored her. He trotted down the next flight of stairs to the first floor and disappeared. Hannah peered over the railing to look for him and saw a glow coming from the kitchen. Rafe was already awake.</p><p>She hurried downstairs, crossed the hall, and walked into the kitchen. She stopped when she saw Rafe standing in front of the counter with a knife in his hand. He had taken the time to pull on a pair of jeans, but that was all. His sleek shoulders gleamed in the kitchen light. His bare feet looked strong and supple and very sexy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a chunk of leftover feta cheese on the plate that sat on the drainboard. Winston was positioned at Rafe\u2019s feet, looking expectant.</p><p>Hannah came to a halt in the doorway. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Rafe said. He dropped a bit of the cheese into Winston\u2019s waiting jaws. \u201cCame down here to get a bite to eat.\u201d He held up the knife. \u201cWant some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d She was torn between the urge to let him drop a bite of cheese into her mouth and the knowledge that if she had any sense she would hurry back upstairs. As was so often the case when she was caught between two equally opposing forces, she did nothing. \u201cI was afraid that Winston had heard a prowler outside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d Rafe ate some more cheese. \u201cHe must have heard me come downstairs a few minutes ago. How about you? Sleeping okay up there on the third floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sleeping just fine until Winston decided to follow you down here.\u201d</p><p>Rafe studied her with an unreadable expression as he munched cheese. \u201cHey, that\u2019s just great. Lot of people don\u2019t sleep well in a strange environment, you know? Sometimes they just lay there staring at the ceiling and think about things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He sliced off another bit of cheese. \u201cThings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. Things.\u201d The dangerously enigmatic shimmer in his eyes was starting to worry her. It was definitely time to retreat, she decided. She gripped the lapels of her robe and took a step back. \u201cWell, as long as everything is okay down here, I\u2019ll go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever do that, Hannah? Just lie in bed and think about things?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing it a lot lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>He put some cheese on a cracker and then popped the whole morsel into his mouth. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask me what kind of things I think about?\u201d</p> <p>She took another wary step back, not trusting his odd mood. \u201cNone of my business,\u201d she said crisply.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure of that. Tonight, for instance, one of the things I was thinking about was who, besides Bev Bolton, might be able to give us a few insights into the bedroom lives of our friends and neighbors here in Eclipse Bay. I had an idea.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms and propped one shoulder against the doorjamb. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me one of your buddies is the local Peeping Tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would be highly offended at the suggestion. I always had the impression that he sees himself as a lone crusader for freedom, privacy, and the First Amendment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume we are not talking about the head of the public library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Rafe ate more cheese. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to my potential informant tomorrow while Mitchell is in Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably going to regret this, but I want to be there when you talk to this person.\u201d She paused delicately. \u201cWho is it we\u2019re going to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirgil Nash.\u201d</p> <p>She winced. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any way we can talk to him without someone finding out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt it. Still want to come with me?\u201d</p><p>She decided to be philosophical about the situation. \u201cAh, well. It\u2019s not as if I have anything but a few tattered threads left of my reputation here in Eclipse Bay, anyway. What do I care if the whole town finds out that I was seen entering the local p**n dealer\u2019s shop with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d Rafe said with enthusiasm. \u201cVirgil\u2019s Adult Books and Video Arcade is just the kind of place folks would expect me to take a nice girl like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody ever said you didn\u2019t know how to show a lady a good time.\u201d She turned away to seek the safety of the third floor.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about something else besides Virgil Nash,\u201d Rafe continued in a conversational tone. \u201cI also thought a lot about phobias.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went dry. So he had overheard her awkward conversation with Mitchell. An ominous sensation rolled through her. She turned very slowly in the doorway to face him.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou know, my grandfather may be right. Perhaps the best way to get over a phobia is to confront it head-on. Just do it, you know?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m no expert on phobias, but it seems to me that that approach would be likely to trigger severe panic attacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest you do think about it. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah?\u201d</p><p>She looked back unwillingly. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m the one with the phobia, how come you\u2019re the one who looks panicked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Rafe.\u201d She fled toward the stairs.</p><p>Winston did not return to the third-floor bedroom right away. When he finally did come back upstairs, his fur was cool and damp. Hannah realized that Rafe had taken him outside for a late-night walk.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you two talk about out there?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Winston did not reply. He settled into position at the foot of the bed and promptly went to sleep.</p><p>\u201cGuys always stick together.\u201d</p><p>She tried to go back to sleep. It was hard work. For a long time, she just stared at the ceiling and thought about things.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Virgil\u2019s Adult Books and Video Arcade was located less than a hundred feet beyond the official boundary of the town of Eclipse Bay. When he had established his business fifteen years earlier, Virgil had been careful to select a location that was just outside the reach of local reformers, civic activists, and members of the town council who saw running the local p**n store out of town as a sure ticket to reelection.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the old law of real estate,\u201d Virgil had once explained to Rafe. \u201cLocation, location, location.\u201d</p><p>While convenience had been of paramount importance, Virgil had also realized that most of his clientele would also appreciate a measure of privacy while they made their purchases. With the aim of providing customers with that treasured commodity, he had placed the small parking lot behind the shop rather than in front, where familiar vehicles might be noted by neighbors, business acquaintances, and parents who happened to drive past.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m taking my dog into a place like this.\u201d Hannah scowled at the sign over the shop\u2019s rear entrance as she snapped the leash onto Winston\u2019s collar. \u201cI can only hope that he doesn\u2019t realize what sort of business this is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rafe took the keys out of the ignition and unbuckled his seat belt. \u201cIt was your idea to bring Winston along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse to leave him home alone until we find out who tried to murder him.\u201d Hannah glanced swiftly around the nearly empty parking lot. \u201cThank goodness there aren\u2019t too many customers here at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any other customers here,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cThat van in the corner belongs to Virgil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Hard to see how he stays in business. It\u2019s two o\u2019clock in the afternoon and there\u2019s no one here.\u201d</p> <p>Rafe cracked open his door. \u201cVirgil doesn\u2019t get busy until after dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows that.\u201d He got out of the car and closed the door very quickly before she could think of any more questions.</p><p>Hannah opened her own door and climbed out warily. \u201cAll right, Winston, let\u2019s go. But whatever you do, don\u2019t touch anything. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Winston sprang lightly out of the car. And immediately paused to sniff curiously at a small plastic wrapper that lay on the pavement.</p> <p>Hannah glanced down to see what had caught his interest. She gave a half-strangled shriek of dismay. \u201cGood grief, that looks like a used condom. Didn\u2019t you listen to me, Winston? I said, don\u2019t touch anything.\u201d</p><p>Rafe watched her drag Winston away from his investigations. \u201cAre you two going to fool around out here all afternoon?\u201d He opened the rear door of the shop. \u201cWe\u2019ve got business to do.\u201d</p><p>Hannah gave him a ferocious glare. She stalked toward him with Winston in tow. \u201cYou certainly seem to know your way around the premises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpent some extremely educational afternoons here when I was a young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirgil always was a pioneer in the field of sex ed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSex ed, my left pinkie. Virgil sells dirty books and movies. I refuse to dignify his profession by referring to him as an instructor in the field of sex education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d Rafe led the way into the shop. \u201cBut I think you\u2019ll like Virgil once you get to know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt if I\u2019ll be coming back here much in the future,\u201d she said austerely. She followed him into the shop and let the door slam shut with a reverberating bang.</p><p>\u201cOkay, be that way,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>She did not dignify that with a response. Her attention was on Winston, who was busily sniffing around a display of what looked like small bottles of whipped cream. Rafe glanced at the sign above the display. PASSION CREAM. FOUR EROTIC FLAVORS.</p><p>Winston appeared to be particularly fascinated with the Cherry Pie flavor.</p><p>\u201cWinston, leave that alone.\u201d</p><p>Rafe had a feeling that Hannah was going to be saying that a lot while they were in the shop.</p> <p>\u201cRafe.\u201d The elegantly modulated voice emanated from the far side of the shop. \u201cHeard you were back in town. Good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Rafe turned around and greeted the thin, slightly built man seated in the large wing chair near the window. \u201cHello, Virgil. Been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has indeed.\u201d Virgil put down the book he had been reading and stood up. \u201cAnd judging from the latest gossip, I assume that the charming lady at your side is Hannah Harte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah, meet Virgil.\u201d</p><p>Hannah managed a smooth, brittle smile. She did not give Virgil her hand to shake. Instead she managed to make it appear as though she had all she could do to hang on to Winston\u2019s leash and her purse at the same time.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t changed a bit, Virgil,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cI think I recognize that vest.\u201d</p><p>Virgil\u2019s gray eyes twinkled a little behind the lenses of his reading glasses. He glanced down the front of the frayed green sweater vest that he wore over a plaid shirt. \u201cYou may be right. Can\u2019t even recall when I got this. Probably a birthday gift from some dead relative whose name I have apparently forgotten. Where does the time go, eh?\u201d</p><p>There was an oddly ageless quality about Virgil. His background was as cloaked in mystery as Arizona Snow\u2019s. No one knew where he had come from or what he had done before he set up the p**n shop just outside the town limits. With his gaunt frame, neat silver goatee, slightly stooped shoulders, and thick glasses, he had the look of an absentminded professor who had spent too much time indoors with his books.</p><p>The scholarly impression was not far off the mark, Rafe thought. Somewhere along the line Nash had acquired a fine classical education. Virgil\u2019s personal library, a sophisticated collection of history, literature, and philosophy, was extensive. Rafe knew that because he had spent a lot of time in it.</p><p>Virgil was not anyone\u2019s idea of a p**n dealer, but he considered himself a professional in a sadly underappreciated line of work. He had once told Rafe that he had dedicated himself to the business of selling what he liked to call erotica years ago and had never wavered from his career choice.</p><p>Virgil glanced from Rafe to Hannah and back again. His silver brows rose inquiringly. \u201cI am delighted that the two of you found time to pay me a visit. I\u2019ve heard all about your plans for an inn and a restaurant out there at Dreamscape. I think it\u2019s a wonderful idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose plans have not been finalized,\u201d Hannah said brusquely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure everything will work out.\u201d Virgil smiled at Rafe. \u201cHeard you did all right for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t go to jail,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>\u201cHad a hunch you would turn out okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand Rafe spent a lot of time here in the old days,\u201d Hannah offered.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d Virgil said with paternalistic pride. \u201cI sold him his first condom. Taught him how to use it properly, too, before he left the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Rafe winced. \u201cNow, Hannah, it wasn\u2019t like I came in here every week. Besides, none of the guys wanted to risk buying condoms at the local drugstore. The word would have been all over town by nightfall. Here at Virgil\u2019s there was a lot more privacy.\u201d</p><p>Hannah raised her eyes to the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019d rather not hear too many details about your past, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>Virgil chuckled. \u201cLooks like your aunt Isabel was right all along. The two of you were obviously meant for each other.\u201d</p><p>Hannah stared at him. \u201cYou knew Aunt Isabel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed. We had some mutual interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that difficult to believe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Virgil arched a brow. \u201cDid you know that she collected eighteenth-century erotica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d Hannah cleared her throat. \u201cShe never mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed. I helped her build her collection. I have some excellent contacts in the rare book business, you see. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll run into Isabel\u2019s old books and prints when you two start going through her things at Dreamscape. Whatever you do, don\u2019t toss or sell any of those books and things until you check with me. Some of those volumes are worth several thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief,\u201d Hannah said weakly. \u201cI\u2019m suddenly getting a whole new picture of my aunt.\u201d</p> <p>Rafe tried not to laugh. It wasn\u2019t easy. The bewildered, bemused expression on Hannah\u2019s face was priceless.</p><p>Virgil crouched and held his hand out to Winston. \u201cLovely dog.\u201d</p><p>Hannah frowned as Winston trotted forward to sniff politely. When the dog appeared satisfied, she hesitated and then said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She still sounded stiff, but Rafe could tell she was softening. Virgil put his hand in the small of his back and straightened with great care.</p><p>\u201cArthritis,\u201d he explained. \u201cOr the old war wound. I can never tell the difference.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich war?\u201d Hannah asked warily.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter? They\u2019re all the same, aren\u2019t they? At least, they all look the same when you\u2019re standing in the middle of one.\u201d He looked at Rafe. \u201cWhat can I do for you? Something tells me that the two of you are not here to purchase the latest issue of Fetish magazine or to rent Alice Does Wonderland.\u201d</p><p>Rafe leaned back against a counter stocked with rainbow-colored plastic dildos arranged in order of size. He shoved his hands into his front pockets and plunged straight into the tale.</p><p>\u201cThis is about what happened the night Kaitlin Sadler died,\u201d he said. \u201cHannah and I have some reason to think that her death might not have been an accident.\u201d</p><p>Virgil nodded somberly. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Hannah shot him a quick, frowning glance. \u201cYou don\u2019t look surprised, Mr. Nash.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy should I be surprised? I\u2019ve heard the rumors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what rumors have you heard?\u201d Rafe asked.</p><p>Virgil raised his thin shoulders in a small shrug. \u201cEveryone knows that the two of you went to see Dell Sadler yesterday. Given his history with you, Rafe, there could be only one reason why the pair of you would sit down and talk after all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Rafe said, \u201cI\u2019ll cut to the chase. A few things have happened lately that make us think that someone doesn\u2019t want the old investigation reopened.\u201d</p><p>Virgil said nothing. He just waited.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve picked up some indications,\u201d Hannah added, \u201cthat Kaitlin Sadler may have been blackmailing someone in town. If it\u2019s true, it might mean that same someone killed her to silence her.\u201d</p><p>Glittering curiosity flared without warning in Virgil\u2019s gaze. \u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything solid to go on yet,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cBut it looks like the blackmail material might have had something to do with someone\u2019s sex life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt often does.\u201d Virgil paused. \u201cBut in this day and age, it would have to be a particularly interesting sex life to be worth blackmail payments or murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we came to you,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cKnow any men in town who like to wear ladies\u2019 underwear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least half a dozen names come to mind,\u201d Virgil said without missing a beat. \u201cIf that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ll be at this investigation for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cYou know half a dozen men in Eclipse Bay who have a penchant for female underwear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fetish for women\u2019s undergarments is not all that rare or unusual.\u201d Virgil adopted a professional tone as he warmed to his lecture. \u201cIt is generally considered a harmless quirk, as these things go. Indeed, the history of prominent men dressing in lingerie goes back for centuries. There have been kings, generals, presidents, statesmen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of the six men here in Eclipse Bay who like to wear lingerie which one would be seriously horrified if the news got around?\u201d Rafe asked before Virgil could get sidetracked by his professional interest.</p><p>\u201cI imagine that they would all be embarrassed, to varying degrees.\u201d</p><p>Hannah looked at him. \u201cThink any of them would be so humiliated that he would pay blackmail or kill to keep the secret?\u201d</p><p>Virgil stroked his goatee while he pondered that. In the end, he shook his head decisively. \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t see any of them in the role of murderer. But one never knows, does one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix men,\u201d Rafe repeated.</p><p>\u201cThose are just the ones who come to mind immediately because I have had some contact with them over the years,\u201d Virgil said. \u201cThere are no doubt several others who don\u2019t shop at my store.\u201d</p><p>Hannah sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s hopeless. Sounds like we can\u2019t even get a complete list, let alone verify the whereabouts of all the men on it for the night Kaitlin died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to find all of them,\u201d Virgil pointed out. \u201cJust the ones who knew Kaitlin intimately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, that would still be a mighty long list.\u201d Hannah shot Rafe a dark glare.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d Rafe said calmly. \u201cI prefer lingerie on ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he is the only suspect who had an ironclad alibi that night,\u201d Virgil reminded her. \u201cThanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Hannah scowled. \u201cStill, there must be some way to narrow the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor starters, I imagine that you can eliminate any man who wasn\u2019t reasonably affluent at the time,\u201d Virgil said. \u201cAfter all, no point blackmailing someone who can\u2019t afford to pay.\u201d</p><p>Rafe was intrigued. \u201cYou\u2019re right. That might cut the list down a little.\u201d</p><p>Hannah frowned. \u201cIf he was rich enough to pay blackmail, chances are he would have been wealthy enough to be invited to the political reception up at the institute that night. But if he was there, he\u2019s also got a solid alibi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that,\u201d Rafe said slowly. \u201cThe institute was crowded that evening. Everyone who was anyone in Eclipse Bay was there. Someone could have slipped away long enough to murder Kaitlin and then returned to the reception with no one the wiser.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you could possibly ascertain that information,\u201d Virgil said quietly.</p><p>Rafe glanced at Hannah. He knew they were both thinking the same thing.</p><p>\u201cThere just may be a way to do that,\u201d he told Virgil.</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Virgil looked intrigued. \u201cFascinating. You do understand that under normal circumstances I would not even consider providing you with this list. But given what you say may have been an attempt on your life, Ms. Harte, I will try to help. There is just one thing I would like for you both to keep in mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Rafe asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to blackmail,\u201d Virgil said very seriously, \u201cthere are sometimes others besides the victim who have a motive to kill the blackmailer.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s brows snapped together. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as anyone who has a great deal invested in the victim,\u201d Virgil said.</p><p>Rafe looked at him. \u201cHell, do you think maybe we should be looking at all the wives of these guys you know who like to run around in lacy unmentionables?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever forget the old saying about the female of the species being just as deadly as the male. The wife of a prominent, wealthy, or powerful man who could be brought low by blackmail would certainly have reason to get rid of a potential threat to her future income and position.\u201d</p><p>They all pondered that for a moment. Then Virgil turned away and walked to the counter. He picked up a pen and started to write names down on a sheet of yellow paper.</p><p>Hannah moved closer to Rafe and lowered her voice. \u201cAre you thinking what I\u2019m thinking about how to figure out who might have left the reception and returned between midnight and two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA.Z.\u2019s logbooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hannah watched Virgil. \u201cYou know her better than I do. Think she would let us look at them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be able to talk her into it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, Rafe, even if we come up with a good suspect, what can we do with the information? Officially there was no murder, and we don\u2019t have anything that resembles proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work on that part after we get the good suspect.\u201d</p><p>They stood in silence for a while, waiting for Virgil to finish his list. After a time Rafe got restless. He wandered over to a pile of padded leather handcuffs. He picked up one and examined the Velcro fastener.</p><p>Hannah gave him the same sort of look she had given Winston when he tried to investigate the condom wrapper out in the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mitchell settled into the overstuffed easy chair with a familiar sense of contentment. The chair had been new and a little stiff a year ago when he had first started visiting Bev on a regular basis. But he had spent a lot of time in it during the past months, and the leather upholstery had shaped itself to his body. It was comfortable and welcoming. Sort of like Bev herself, he thought.</p><p>But there was a lot more to Bev than warmth and comfort. There was stimulation, both mental and physical. He loved to argue with her. Loved to play cards with her. Loved to go for long walks along the river with her. She made him feel good in ways that no other woman ever had, not even in the wild years following the breakup of Harte-Madison when he\u2019d chased the illusion of passion the way other men had chased wealth or fame, or adrenaline.</p><p>Bev walked into the living room with the coffee tray. He turned away from the view of the river to look at her. A deep pleasure reverberated somewhere inside. There was wisdom and warmth and laughter in her eyes. Her own personal standards were high, always had been. But unlike some folks he knew who had made it this far in life, himself included, she was not inclined to judge others harshly. She accepted people as they were.</p> <p>A fine figure of a woman, he thought, watching her pour the coffee. Bev was a great believer in vitamins and exercise, and the results were obvious. There was a healthy, energetic aura about her. She had not magically escaped the common chronic problems that came with the years. Six months ago he\u2019d noticed the bottle of blood pressure pills in the kitchen cupboard above her sink. There was another bottle of tablets for the relief of arthritis in her bathroom, the same brand his own doctor had prescribed for him. But Bev\u2019s natural optimism and zest for living subtracted years from the calendar.</p><p>She had always had an instinct for style. Today her silver hair was swept back from her forehead in a short, sophisticated bob. She wore a good-looking black-and-white pantsuit that accented her healthy figure. Little silver rings dangled from her ears.</p><p>She smiled and handed him a cup of coffee. \u201cHow are things going over there in Eclipse Bay? Are you and Rafe getting along okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs well as we ever did.\u201d Mitchell sipped the coffee. Just enough sugar and a splash of milk. Bev knew how he liked it. \u201cBetter, maybe. But he\u2019s still one stubborn, muleheaded son of a gun.\u201d</p><p>Bev took her seat and crossed her legs in a graceful, unconsciously feminine movement that sent a whisper of anticipation through him. A few months back, his doctor had written another prescription for him, one that worked hydraulic marvels. He and Bev had gotten a lot of use out of it lately.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a chip off the old block,\u201d Bev said.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell does everyone keep saying that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>He bristled a little. \u201cWell, I\u2019m working on seeing to it that Rafe doesn\u2019t make all the same mistakes I did.\u201d</p><p>Bev chuckled. \u201cA worthy project. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019m gonna need it.\u201d He frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s carrying on with Hannah Harte.\u201d</p><p>Bev\u2019s brows rose in surprise. \u201cCarrying on, as in having an affair with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat too. It\u2019s Isabel\u2019s fault. If she hadn\u2019t left that damn house to both of \u2019em none of this would have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly has happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just told you\u2014they\u2019re sleeping together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, everyone in town knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Bev tilted her head slightly to the side as she contemplated that information. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much if I were you. Isabel was a very, very smart woman. She probably knew what she was doing when she drew up that will.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell grunted. \u201cMaybe yes, maybe no. Either way, it all comes down to the same thing. Rafe\u2019s carrying on with Hannah, and her family hasn\u2019t got a clue. When Sullivan Harte finds out, he\u2019s gonna shit... uh, he\u2019s gonna blow his top.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRafe and Hannah aren\u2019t kids anymore. They\u2019re full-grown adults. They\u2019ll make their own decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Far as I\u2019m concerned, Rafe\u2019s already made his, and he\u2019s by God gonna follow through if I have anything to say about it. Hannah\u2019s a nice young woman, even if she is a Harte. If he thinks he can fool around with her and then walk away, he\u2019s got another thing coming.\u201d</p><p>Bev peered at him with a mixture of amusement and curiosity. \u201cAre you saying you feel Rafe ought to marry Hannah?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell balanced the cup and saucer on the broad leather arm of the big chair. \u201cYep. That\u2019s exactly what I think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince when did you become such a zealous believer in old-fashioned morality?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I started watching the two of \u2019em together. You ought to see the way he looks at her, Bev. Damn near painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks at him the same way. Thing is, they\u2019re scared to death of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you can play Cupid?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFigure it\u2019s my responsibility to straighten things out.\u201d Mitchell looked at the river. \u201cI put my son, Sinclair, through hell when he was a boy. Set a real bad example. Sure enough, he turned right around and did the same thing to Rafe and Gabe. I figure it\u2019s up to me to stop this cycle before it goes on to another generation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to do it by marrying Rafe off to Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can.\u201d Mitchell paused to take another swallow of coffee. \u201cBut before I can see about getting Rafe to the altar, I\u2019ve got to help him and Hannah fix another little problem that\u2019s come up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell looked at her. \u201cRafe has convinced himself that someone may have tried to kill Hannah and her dog a couple of nights ago.\u201d</p><p>Bev\u2019s shock left her mouth hanging open for a few seconds.</p> <p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d she finally managed.</p><p>\u201cOn the surface, it looks like some bastard tried to drown her dog, but Rafe thinks it may have been an attempt to get Hannah, too. He\u2019s sure it\u2019s got some tie back to what happened to Kaitlin Sadler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Bev sputtered. \u201cKaitlin\u2019s death was an accident. Everyone knows that. And if it had been something worse, heaven forbid, why would the killer make a move against Hannah now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver since Rafe and Hannah returned to Eclipse Bay to sort out the business with Dreamscape, there\u2019s been talk. Some of it is about the fact that they\u2019re carrying on together, naturally. But some of it is about the past. Rafe and Hannah have started asking questions themselves, and now, what with the incident involving the mutt, they\u2019re beginning to dig a little deeper.\u201d Mitchell met her gaze. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m afraid they just might uncover some old bones that would probably be better off left buried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Rafe, being Rafe, won\u2019t listen to your advice to leave well enough alone, is that it?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell shrugged. \u201cHe never did listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve decided to help him look into the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about the size of it.\u201d</p> <p>Bev studied him for a long moment. Then she gave him a knowing smile. \u201cYou\u2019re enjoying yourself, aren\u2019t you? I think you like the idea of playing Dr. Watson to Rafe\u2019s Sherlock Holmes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe the first thing Rafe and I have done together since he was a kid.\u201d Mitchell was aware of an oddly wistful feeling. \u201cWe got along pretty good for a few years after he and Gabe came to live with me. But from the day Rafe hit his mid-teens, he and I locked horns. It\u2019s been a little better in the past few years, but it\u2019s like we\u2019re walking on eggshells. Doesn\u2019t take much for either one of us to set the other off. My fault, I reckon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself, Mitch. You did all right by your grandsons. Sinclair wasn\u2019t much of a father to his boys.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell gripped the mug hard. \u201cThat\u2019s because he had me for an example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is that after your son\u2019s death, you stepped in and did what you had to do. You stopped your running around\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bev chuckled. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s just say you cut way down on your running around. You paid attention to the job of raising Rafe and Gabe, and neither one of them has screwed up his life. I\u2019d say you did okay.\u201d</p><p>Bev always had a way of making him feel better about things, Mitchell thought. She had a way of giving him a slightly different perspective.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the reason you\u2019re here.\u201d Bev put her coffee aside and sat forward. \u201cYou say you want to help Rafe find out what really happened to the Sadler woman. But what if there isn\u2019t any conspiracy to uncover? What if Chief Yates was right about her death being an accident?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell shook his head. \u201cI started into this thinking that Rafe and Hannah were going off the deep end. But now I\u2019m not so sure. Bev, you knew everything that Ed knew about the goings-on in Eclipse Bay, and Ed knew a hell of a lot. If I said that there\u2019s a possibility that Kaitlin Sadler might have been having an affair with someone who wanted to keep it a big, dark secret, do any names come to mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaitlin got involved with more than one married man.\u201d Bev made a face. \u201cShe was not very popular with the ladies of Eclipse Bay, I can tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if I throw in some dirty movies and some female underwear in a man\u2019s size? Does that narrow the list a bit?\u201d</p><p>Bev angled her chin. \u201cHmm,\u201d she said thoughtfully.</p><p>Mitchell waited.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Bev said slowly, \u201cthere is one name that does come to mind. Ed once told me about some rumors he\u2019d heard shortly before Kaitlin\u2019s death. Naturally he ignored them. Ed was an old-fashioned kind of journalist. Unlike this modern bunch, he didn\u2019t believe in printing the details of people\u2019s sex lives on the front page of a family newspaper.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell could feel himself getting revved up. This investigating business was fun. He was starting to understand why Rafe was so eager to poke a stick into this particular varmint hole. \u201cCan I have the name of this guy Ed didn\u2019t want to put on the front page?\u201d</p><p>Bev hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ll give it to you, but it won\u2019t do you any good. He has an ironclad alibi for that night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can vouch for his whereabouts that evening, as well as the whereabouts of most of the rest of the good, upstanding citizens of Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot and damn.\u201d Disgust replaced the anticipation Mitchell had been savoring. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you saw him at that reception up at the institute that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d Bev replied. \u201cStill want the name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d A thought struck Mitchell. \u201cYou never can tell. Maybe he ducked out long enough to murder the Sadler woman.

Soon to become Senator Thornley, if all goes according to plan.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell groaned. \u201cWell, shoot and damn.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>\u201cTrevor Thornley? In lingerie and high heels?\u201d Hannah sank back into the depths of the wicker chair. \u201cThere\u2019s an image I could have done without.\u201d</p> <p>Rafe paced back across the solarium. \u201cBut it makes sense. Dell told us that Kaitlin had claimed that she was going to score big. None of the names on Virgil\u2019s list would qualify as big scores. She might have pried a few bucks out of some of them, but not enough to finance a fresh start outside of Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut a politician with a bright future in front of him might have looked very tempting to her,\u201d Hannah said quietly.</p><p>\u201cSure would be embarrassing as all get out if Kaitlin actually had movies of him running around in ladies\u2019 undies,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThing like that would have cost him the election eight years ago. Seeing as how he was the conservative on the ticket and all.\u201d</p><p>Rafe continued his pacing. \u201cMight have been worth murder to Thornley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever did trust him,\u201d Mitchell said.</p><p>Rafe was almost amused. \u201cBig deal. You\u2019ve never trusted any politician in your life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a grand theory, gentlemen.\u201d Hannah picked up her wineglass. \u201cBut let\u2019s not get too carried away here. As Bev pointed out to Mitchell, Thornley is the one person who could not have disappeared from the reception without being missed that night.\u201d</p><p>Rafe came to a halt and rested a hand on the windowsill as he contemplated the steel-colored waters of the bay. \u201cRemember what Virgil told us. In a blackmail case there are others besides the victim who have a motive to kill. Anyone with an investment in the person being blackmailed might be moved to do something drastic to stop the extortionist.\u201d</p><p>Hannah swirled the sauvignon blanc in her glass. \u201cAre you suggesting Thornley\u2019s wife might have murdered Kaitlin?\u201d</p><p>Rafe thought about it. \u201cMarilyn Thornley is as dedicated to her husband\u2019s career as he is. A decade ago she had a reputation for getting what she wanted. Doubt that\u2019s changed much in the last few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ask how you know that,\u201d Hannah grumbled.</p><p>Rafe shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that look. Marilyn never wanted me. She knew I wasn\u2019t headed for big things.\u201d</p><p>Hannah frowned. \u201cSo how do you know that she had a way of getting what she went after?\u201d</p><p>It was Mitchell who answered. \u201cHe knows because for a while Marilyn wanted Gabe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAha.\u201d Hannah pondered that fact. \u201cDid she, uh, get him for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I never came right out and asked him,\u201d Mitchell said laconically. \u201cBut to tell you the truth, if they did have a fling, it wouldn\u2019t have meant much to him. The only thing he cared about in those days was reviving Madison Commercial. Still is, come to that. I swear, if that grandson of mine doesn\u2019t figure out that there\u2019s more to life than doing deals and making money, he\u2019s gonna wind up missing all the stuff that really matters.\u201d</p><p>Rafe shot him a narrow-eyed look. \u201cGabe resurrected Madison Commercial for you, Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me that. I admit I steered him in that direction. But I never meant for him to make the damn company his entire life.\u201d</p><p>Rafe shrugged. \u201cThe company\u2019s his passion. What did you expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all know what happens with a Madison once he\u2019s fixated on his great passion in life,\u201d Hannah murmured into her wine.</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like Gabe doesn\u2019t have time for a wife, but that\u2019s not true,\u201d Mitchell continued. \u201cThe only reason he hasn\u2019t married is because he\u2019s got a problem with women.\u201d</p><p>Hannah was interested. \u201cWhat kind of problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe expects them to work the same way his company works.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s voice dripped with disgust and frustration. \u201cDon\u2019t know where he got the notion that women operate like an accounts receivable department or that you could treat one of \u2019em like a branch of the head office. Certainly not from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting a little off track here,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get back to the problem at hand?\u201d</p><p>Hannah straightened in her chair. \u201cRight. Okay, let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got so far. We think that Trevor Thornley might have been Kaitlin\u2019s blackmail target. But we also know that he couldn\u2019t have killed her that night because he was the star of the institute reception. That leaves us with the extremely weak possibility that someone who didn\u2019t want Thornley compromised might have gone out to meet Kaitlin and silence her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense to me,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWhat do we do next?\u201d</p><p>Rafe turned the glass in his hands. \u201cWe talk to Arizona Snow. See if she\u2019ll let us look at her logbooks for that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just hope she wasn\u2019t home sick with the flu that evening,\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Optimism,\u201d Rafe growled.</p><p>\u201cWell, to be honest, I keep wondering what we can do even if we do come up with a really terrific scenario for the murder of Kaitlin Sadler. It\u2019s not like we can hope to find any proof after all this time. Say that we\u2019re successful. What are our options?\u201d</p><p>Rafe hesitated. It was Mitchell who sat forward, determined and eager.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou blow the whole damn story wide open so there are no more secrets to be kept. You go to Jed Steadman down at the Journal and give him the facts. He always wanted to be a real investigative reporter. This is his big chance, and I\u2019m betting he\u2019ll take it. If he runs with it, you can pretty much guarantee that every paper in the state will start digging into the Sadler woman\u2019s death.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cJed might not find hard proof, but the entire Thornley camp will be on the defensive. Hell, the lingerie rumors alone will be enough to keep them fully occupied. Whoever\u2019s behind this will be too busy proving Thornley\u2019s innocence on both counts to bother with any more attacks on you or Winston.\u201d</p><p>Hannah looked at each man in turn. The same ice-cold intent glittered in both pairs of sea-green Madison eyes. She shook her head. \u201cAnd you two wonder why everyone says you\u2019re so much alike.\u201d</p><p>After dinner Rafe walked out onto the porch with Mitchell. Winston padded along at their heels. Together the three of them gazed at the big SUV lurking in the shadows of the drive, looking for all the world like some modern-day Tyrannosaurus rex waiting for prey. Probably hoping some slow-witted, herbivorous little compact would wander within range, Rafe thought. The silhouette of Bryce\u2019s figure behind the wheel was just barely visible in the gathering shadows. The dinosaur\u2019s brain.</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for dinner,\u201d Mitchell said.</p> <p>\u201cSure. Anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill can\u2019t get over the fact that you can turn out first-rate grub like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ve just been eating too much of Bryce\u2019s cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be. But I\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p><p>Rafe leaned against a post. \u201cI haven\u2019t thanked you for the information you brought back from Portland.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Mitchell tapped the end of his cane on the edge of the step. \u201cSort of interesting, if you want the truth. Haven\u2019t ever done anything along those lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither have I. Lucky for us, you and Bev Bolton are such good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>There was another short silence. Winston yawned.</p><p>\u201cSure hope to hell we know what we\u2019re doing here,\u201d Mitchell said after a while. \u201cIf we\u2019re right, we\u2019re talking about blowing apart the campaign of a hot-shit candidate for the United States Senate. Lawsuits could be the least of our worries when this is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when did a Madison ever let the small stuff get in the way?\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a point there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe important thing is that we put a stop to whatever is going on around here.\u201d Rafe folded his arms. \u201cHannah\u2019s safety comes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t argue that one,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWhat\u2019s a political campaign compared to protecting a lady? Speaking of Hannah\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rafe braced himself. \u201cWere we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sure as hell were. I didn\u2019t want to say anything in front of her, but we both know the two of you can\u2019t stay shacked up here like this indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShacked up?\u201d Rafe managed a politely blank expression. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m familiar with the term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit! You know damn well what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about. When are you going to do the right thing by that girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to do the right thing by Bev Bolton?\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell\u2019s face tightened. Rafe was startled to see a flash of pain in his grandfather\u2019s eyes. The expression vanished swiftly behind glittering outrage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d marry Bev Bolton tomorrow if I thought she\u2019d have me,\u201d Mitchell said ferociously. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a reputation to live down. She doesn\u2019t think I know how to make what she likes to call a commitment.\u201d</p><p>Rafe looked at him, saying nothing.</p><p>Mitchell blinked once or twice. The outrage faded to dawning chagrin. \u201cWell, shoot and damn. You\u2019re in the same leaky boat, aren\u2019t you, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Hannah bought that story you gave her about my bad nerves,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cShe\u2019s got the same problem with me that Bev Bolton has with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour checkered past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But in my case it\u2019s not only my own that I\u2019ve got to live down. I\u2019ve got yours and Dad\u2019s in the way, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot and damn.\u201d Mitchell gazed unhappily at the tip of his cane, then at Rafe. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve got any good ideas on what to do about this problem Madisons seem to have with females?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot and damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cShoot and damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sense asking Gabe. He\u2019s no better with women than we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell glanced at Winston. The Schnauzer cocked his head in polite inquiry.</p><p>\u201cNo point asking him for advice, either,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cHannah had him neutered.\u201d</p><p>The night coalesced swiftly around them, deepening the somber atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cI think there\u2019s some irony here somewhere,\u201d Rafe said eventually. \u201cBut I can\u2019t be sure, because I never finished college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you you\u2019d regret dropping out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Look at me now. Doomed to go through life without knowing about stuff like irony and postmodernism. It\u2019s almost enough to make a man regret a mis-spent youth.\u201d Rafe paused. \u201cBut I\u2019ll probably get over it.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell nodded. \u201cFix yourself a whiskey and soda and take a long walk on the beach. Always worked for me.\u201d He roused himself and went down the steps. \u201cTell you one thing,\u201d he said over his shoulder as he strode toward the waiting SUV.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not have finished college, but you\u2019re a Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, no Madison ever let anything stand in his way once he made up his mind to go after what he wanted. Remember what I said. You can\u2019t shack up with Hannah forever. It\u2019s not right. You\u2019ve got to come up with a fix for this mess. Hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell opened the passenger-side door of the SUV and climbed in. Rafe and Winston watched the monster vehicle lumber off down the drive.</p><p>When the taillights disappeared, Rafe looked down at the dog. \u201cYou know, Winston, one of the reasons you and I get along so well is that you never hand out unsolicited advice.\u201d</p><p>Winston yawned again, rose, and ambled back inside the house.</p><p>Mitchell peered at the road through the windshield. \u201cI think those two need a little kick in the right place to get them moving in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy advice is to stay out of the matter, sir,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cThe conduct of close interpersonal relationships is not your strong point.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t pay you for advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have made that clear many times over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever seems to stop you from interfering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you keep paying me, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmmph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to ask,\u201d Bryce said, \u201cbut do you have a plan to apply this kick you seem to feel your grandson and Miss Harte require?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell drummed his fingers on the dash, thinking furiously. \u201cI\u2019m working on one.\u201d</p><p>Bryce nodded. \u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d</p><p>Rafe was brooding. Hannah could feel the vibes. He had been in a strange mood since he came back into the house after seeing Mitchell off. She had helped him with the dishes. There had been very little conversation. The few words that had been exchanged had been centered on speculation about what they might or might not learn from Arizona Snow.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s so weird,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cLord only knows what those logs of hers will look like, assuming she\u2019ll even let us see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019ll let me have a look at them.\u201d Rafe finished drying a pan and shoved it into a cupboard. \u201cShe and I always got along pretty good in the old days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Hannah glanced at him. \u201cWhy did the two of you hit it off so well, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why she liked me, but I can tell you why I took to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was the only one who never tried to tell me what I should do with my life.\u201d</p> <p>Hannah winced. \u201cOkay, I can see the appeal there. Did she ever tell you anything about her past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver wonder about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Rafe shut the cupboard door. \u201cEveryone in town wonders about her past. Most people figure she\u2019s just one hundred percent bonkers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger,\u201d Hannah said slowly, \u201cI imagined that she was an ex\u2013secret agent who was forced to retire after her mind cracked under the strain of undercover work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s as logical as any of the other theories I\u2019ve heard over the years.\u201d</p><p>When they finished the dishes they wandered out into the darkened solarium. Rafe put two glasses on the table between a pair of wicker loungers and filled each with gently steaming water. He picked up a bottle of orange liqueur and splashed some into two balloon glasses. Then he cradled the bowls of the balloon glasses over the hot water to warm the liqueur.</p><p>When he was finished, he lowered himself into one of the loungers and handed one of the balloon glasses to Hannah.</p> <p>She accepted the pleasantly warm glass and took a sip of the sultry liqueur. Winston stuck his head over the edge of the lounger. She stroked his ears. An air of doggy bliss emanated from him.</p><p>The darkness grew heavier. So did Rafe\u2019s mood. Hannah resisted the urge to break the silence. She was determined that he would be the one to do that. If he wanted to brood, that was his business. It wasn\u2019t like she was his wife or even a close friend, she reminded herself. It wasn\u2019t her job to cheer him up when he was down or jolly him out of a bad temper. Sure, they had made love a few times, but that didn\u2019t mean they were lovers.</p><p>Instead of rallying her, that thought lowered her own spirits.</p><p>Wonderful. Now she was brooding too.</p><p>For a while she thought Rafe might not speak at all. She was telling herself that she was getting accustomed to the silence when he finally started talking. The first words out of his mouth startled her so much that she was the one who was momentarily speechless.</p><p>\u201cEver since the night Kaitlin died,\u201d he said, his voice seeming to come from a distant place, \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered whether or not Mitchell believed that I might have killed her.\u201d</p><p>Hannah opened her mouth and then closed it again. She was so taken back she could not think of an appropriate response. Maybe there wasn\u2019t one.</p><p>\u201cHe never said a word.\u201d Rafe turned the heated glass between his palms. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t mean anything. His first loyalty is to Gabe and me. I\u2019ve always known that. Even when we were going toe-to-toe about everything from my lousy job prospects and the motorcycle to my choice in girlfriends, I knew that he would stand by me no matter what. He might disapprove. He might be disappointed. He might be furious. But he would be on my side in a fight. Just like Gabe.\u201d</p><p>Hannah stared at him. \u201cYou actually thought that all these years Mitchell has been wondering what really happened that night? You weren\u2019t sure he believed your story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never certain.\u201d Rafe\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cAnd I was too damn proud to confront him and ask him straight out.\u201d</p><p>She pondered that for a moment. \u201cMaybe you were afraid of the answer.\u201d</p><p>He looked out at the lights on the far side of the bay. \u201cMaybe. Or maybe I just didn\u2019t want him to be put in the position of having to pretend that he never doubted me. Mitchell and I have had our problems, but we\u2019ve always been straight with each other. Didn\u2019t want that to change.\u201d</p><p>She thought back to what Mitchell had said about Rafe the first night they had invited him to dinner. He\u2019s a Madison. He\u2019s got a temper. But if he had been with Kaitlin that night and if there had been some terrible accident, he\u2019d have gone for help and then he\u2019d have told the flat-out truth about what happened.</p><p>\u201cYour grandfather knows that you had nothing to do with Kaitlin\u2019s death,\u201d she said. \u201cHe never doubted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that now.\u201d</p><p>Hannah exhaled slowly. \u201cWell, if nothing else good comes from this situation, it sounds like you and he are working out some sort of long overdue reconciliation. That\u2019s worth something.\u201d</p><p>Rafe gave her a laconic, sidelong look. \u201cWhy do you care whether or not Mitchell and I patch up our differences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live to bring joy and happiness to those around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cDon\u2019t pin me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He took another swallow of the liqueur.</p><p>She gave him a few seconds. When he did not volunteer anything further in the way of conversation, she tried another tack.</p><p>\u201cI promised myself I wasn\u2019t going to ask what happened between you and Mitchell outside on the porch a while ago, but my curiosity has gotten the better of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo surprise there.\u201d</p><p>She ignored that. \u201cLook, you just told me that you\u2019re no longer worried that Mitchell might be harboring some deep, dark suspicions about what happened on the night of Kaitlin\u2019s death. And the two of you have decided that you\u2019ll work together on our little investigation. Heck, you\u2019re even having your grandfather over for dinner these days. Obviously your relationship is improving rapidly. So what went wrong out there on the porch?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing went wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that baffled, befuddled male stare.

When you went outside you were in a reasonably good mood. You came back in a lousy mood. You can\u2019t blame me for wondering what transpired on the front porch.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment she thought he would not answer. Then he tilted his head against the back of the lounger and closed his eyes. \u201cMitchell made it clear that he didn\u2019t like the fact that you and I are, and here I quote, shacking up together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShacking up?\u201d Hannah sucked in an outraged breath. \u201cHe actually used that term?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculous. No one uses that phrase anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mentioned that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s old-fashioned. Downright archaic. It implies an outdated value system that demeans and insults two rational, intelligent adults who choose to make their own decisions in an extremely private area of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a stupid phrase implying low morals and a complete disregard for societal norms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again\u2014I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt takes absolutely no allowance for alternative lifestyles, freedom of association, and the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Mitchell never was what anyone would call politically correct, even on his good days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Hannah concluded, \u201cit\u2019s not even true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of hard to explain the facts to Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not shacking up.\u201d She batted at the air with one hand while she fumbled for words. \u201cWe\u2019re not even sharing the same floor here at Dreamscape, let alone the same bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I am well aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t even done anything,\u201d she raced on wildly. \u201cNot since I moved into Dreamscape, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat fact has not escaped my notice, either.\u201d He sounded disappointed.</p><p>\u201cI own half this house.\u201d She gripped the arm of the lounger. \u201cIf I want to use part of it, that\u2019s my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re entitled, all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFurthermore, it was your idea for me to move in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take full responsibility,\u201d Rafe said piously.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop being so bloody reasonable about it.\u201d She flopped back in the lounger in disgust. \u201cYou\u2019re a Madison. You\u2019re not supposed to be reasonable.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>\u201cYou want the logbook from the night Kaitlin Sadler died?\u201d Arizona Snow squinted her eyes against the smoke that rose from her cigar. She regarded Hannah and Rafe across the expanse of the wide table that dominated the space she fondly called her war room. \u201cWell, now, isn\u2019t that an amazing coincidence?\u201d</p><p>Hannah tensed. She felt Rafe, sitting beside her, do the same. Winston, apparently sensing the suddenly charged atmosphere, paused in the act of sniffing around the base of a metal file cabinet. They all looked at Arizona.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got our attention, A.Z. ,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the crack about a coincidence? Are you saying that someone else has been here asking for that particular log?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking.\u201d Arizona shoved her hands into one of the half dozen pockets of her khaki cargo pants. She chewed thoughtfully on the fat stogie she had stuck between her thin lips. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t exactly ask politely. The institute sent an agent to break into my place a week or so after Kaitlin\u2019s death. Took only one thing. Give you two guesses what that one thing was.\u201d</p><p>Hannah leaned forward, stunned. \u201cThe log that covered that particular night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Arizona said. She removed one hand from a pocket and slammed the table with the flat of her palm. \u201cI knew right then and there something big had gone on that evening. But the next morning the only thing everyone in town could talk about was Kaitlin Sadler\u2019s so-called accident and the possibility that Rafe, here, might have offed her. Now, don\u2019t that tell you somethin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Rafe studied her warily. \u201cYou still think Kaitlin was killed by someone up at the institute?\u201d</p><p>Arizona gave him a grimly triumphant look. \u201cThe way I figure it, there\u2019s only two possibilities. Either that poor gal was murdered by an agent in order to create a distraction for whatever the hell they were doin\u2019 up there at the institute\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d Hannah prompted cautiously.</p><p>Arizona lowered her voice to a whisper laden with portent and dark implication. \u201cOr like I said the other night, the Sadler girl saw somethin\u2019 she wasn\u2019t supposed to see. Either way, it\u2019s obvious that the institute got rid of her before she could spill the beans, and then they set Rafe up as the fall guy. If it hadn\u2019t been for you, Hannah, he might have gone to prison.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s heart sank. She did not dare to meet Rafe\u2019s eyes. They had both known that it would be difficult to talk to Arizona Snow. But neither of them had allowed for the fact that her logbook for the fateful night might have gone missing.</p><p>\u201cYou got any ideas of who might have taken your log?\u201d Rafe asked.</p><p>\u201cI just told you who took it. One of the institute agents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Rafe flicked a glance at Hannah.</p><p>She smiled encouragingly at Arizona. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you remember any cars that left the institute parking lot that night sometime around midnight and returned before the reception ended?\u201d</p><p>Arizona shook her head regretfully. \u201cBeen eight years now. All I recall is that there was an awful lot of activity up there that night. The parking lot was full most of the evening. Lots of coming and going. There was the media, some out-of-town institute agents, and all the innocent dupes of Eclipse Bay who paid good money to cheer for Thornley.\u201d</p><p>Rafe sat back. \u201cDamn. Told you years ago that you should start entering your data on a computer, A.Z.\u201d</p><p>Arizona gave a snort of disgust. \u201cCan\u2019t trust computers. Any kid can break into them and help himself to anything he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiling your information in hard copy sure didn\u2019t do us much good,\u201d Rafe muttered.</p><p>Arizona raised one massive shoulder in a shrug. She regarded her guests with a crafty gleam in her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hannah turned to Rafe. \u201cGot any more bright ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me think.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cJed Steadman mentioned that he might be able to dig up an institute guest list for that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChecking the whereabouts of everyone on the list for that two-hour window would take days and days of work,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cEven assuming it could be done at all. And we couldn\u2019t ever be sure of the accuracy. Like Arizona said, it\u2019s been eight years. No one\u2019s going to recall many details.\u201d</p><p>Rafe studied the large topographic map of Eclipse Bay and the surrounding vicinity that was laminated to the surface of the war room table. \u201cJed might be able to help us out there, too. He covered the reception. He might still have his notes.\u201d</p> <p>Hannah thought about that approach and shook her head. \u201cHe might have some old notes regarding the most newsworthy people in attendance. But he certainly wouldn\u2019t have kept tabs on everyone in the crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re right, we\u2019re looking for someone who may have been newsworthy, or at the very least, attached to the Thornley campaign.\u201d Rafe rose from his chair. \u201cIt\u2019s just barely possible Jed will be able to help us. Worth a try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like we have anything else to go on.\u201d Hannah started to rise. \u201cWithout Arizona\u2019s log for that night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say there wasn\u2019t a log for that night,\u201d Arizona drawled.</p><p>Halfway to her feet, Hannah paused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Rafe planted both hands on the laminated map and leaned across the table. \u201cA.Z. ? You told us that log was missing from your file.\u201d</p><p>A deep, hoarse chuckle rumbled through Arizona. \u201cThe original was stolen, like I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOriginal?\u201d Rafe waited.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t just fall off the turnip truck,\u201d Arizona said with cool satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this business a long time. First thing I do when I get back from a recon job is make a copy of my log.\u201d</p><p>Rafe started to grin. \u201cI should have guessed.\u201d</p><p>Hannah felt a small flicker of hope. \u201cWhere\u2019s the copy of your missing log, Arizona?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHidden in the bunker along with all the other copies.\u201d Arizona glanced at the massive multifunctional steel watch on her wrist. \u201cTake a couple of hours to drive to the site, dig out the log, and get back to town. What d\u2019ya say we meet up out at Dreamscape at 1100 hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d Rafe straightened. \u201cThanks, A.Z. I really appreciate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Any time.\u201d Arizona gripped the arms of her desk chair and shoved herself to her feet. \u201cJust glad to see some folks from around here finally start paying attention to what\u2019s going on up there at the institute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInnocent dupes of the world, arise,\u201d Hannah murmured. \u201cYou have nothing to lose but your innocence.\u201d</p><p>Rafe took her arm and headed toward the door. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep you informed of everything we discover, A.Z.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d Arizona hesitated, concern furrowing her forehead. \u201cAnd you two take care, hear? You\u2019re tangling with the institute crowd now. That means you\u2019re dealing with some ruthless types. Someone up there ordered the Sadler\u2019s girl\u2019s death to cover up something. Whoever did it might be willing to kill again.\u201d</p><p>A chill went through Hannah. She cleared her throat. \u201cWell, on that cheerful note\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d Arizona interrupted rather casually, \u201chow long are you two gonna shack up together out there at Dreamscape?\u201d</p> <p>Anger surged, temporarily submerging the little thrill of dread Hannah had felt a few seconds ago. She jerked to a halt, spun around, and glared at Arizona.</p><p>\u201cWe are not shacking up.\u201d</p><p>Rafe tightened his grip on her arm. \u201cHannah, this isn\u2019t the time to go into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heck it isn\u2019t.\u201d Hannah grabbed the edge of the door as Rafe tried to haul her forcibly out into the hall. \u201cI want to set the record straight before we leave. Listen, Arizona, Rafe and I are sharing Dreamscape until we negotiate a way out of the mess Isabel left us in. We are not shacking up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorta hard to tell the difference,\u201d Arizona answered through a cloud of smoke.</p><p>\u201cNot from where I stand,\u201d Hannah retorted. \u201cWe\u2019re sleeping on separate floors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds uncomfortable,\u201d Arizona said.</p><p>Hannah was a bundle of simmering outrage. Rafe could feel her vibrating on the seat beside him. Winston had draped himself over the back of the seat and licked her ear repeatedly in an effort to console her, but she refused to be restored to a more reasonable mood.</p><p>Rafe tried distraction first.</p><p>\u201cA.Z.\u2019s got a strange view of the world, but she doesn\u2019t make things up out of thin air,\u201d he said. \u201cShe thinks that logbook was stolen. I\u2019m inclined to believe her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been eight years. She probably misplaced it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot A.Z. She\u2019s one well-organized conspiracy theorist. Trust me.\u201d He downshifted as he drove past the pier. \u201cMakes you wonder, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say it does. It was bad enough when people suspected that we were having an affair. But now the whole town apparently thinks that we\u2019re living together openly out there at Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, not really. Hannah, I\u2019m trying to hold a rational conversation here. We were discussing the missing logbook, if you will recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt bothers me. I realize that you Madisons are accustomed to being gossiped about here in Eclipse Bay. But we Hartes try to avoid being the subject of idle rumors and speculation.\u201d</p><p>She was tight and wired, Rafe realized. Her arms were crossed beneath her br**sts. Her face was pinched with irritation.</p><p>\u201cPeople have been talking about us since the day we arrived,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to bother you so much at first. Why are you going ballistic now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting tired of it.\u201d She looked out at the bay. \u201cI thought everything would be settled by now. It all seemed so simple back at the beginning. I would buy out your share of Dreamscape and start work on my inn. But things just keep getting more complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy \u2018things,\u2019 \u201d he said carefully, \u201cI assume you are talking about our relationship, not the possibility that we may have awakened a sleeping murderer?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I am talking about our relationship.\u201d</p><p>He gripped the wheel and braced himself. \u201cOkay. You want to discuss that instead of the missing logbook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He drew a deep breath. He should be feeling relieved, he thought. But for some reason, he was vaguely disappointed.</p> <p>\u201cWell, that simplifies matters,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the logbook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother? There\u2019s nothing we can do until Arizona finds her copy.\u201d</p><p>He flexed his hands on the wheel. \u201cWhatever you say. I need gas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? Get some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p> <p>He drove past the library and the small park next to it, then turned the corner into the town\u2019s main shopping area. Chamberlain College and the institute had had an impact here. For years the post office, together with the hardware, drugstore, and grocery store had formed the core of Eclipse Bay\u2019s tiny business district. But lately a smattering of new shops, including a bookstore and a restaurant, had appeared to cater to students and faculty.</p><p>He pulled into the Eclipse Bay Gas and Go, stopped at the first pump, and switched off the engine. He realized that his own temper was starting to fray.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d stop that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop fuming. You\u2019re starting to make Winston and me tense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m angry. I\u2019ve got a right to be angry. I intend to stay angry for as long as it suits me.\u201d</p> <p>That did it. He turned halfway around and flung his arm over the back of the seat. \u201cWhat the hell is going on here, anyway? I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re letting a simple crack about us shacking up together upset you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShacking up?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make allowances for the older generation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re starting to say it, too. For the last time, we are not \u2018shacking up.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, take it easy.\u201d Rafe watched a vaguely familiar figure garbed in grease-stained coveralls emerge from the garage and amble toward the car. \u201cSon of a gun. Is that Sandy Hickson?\u201d</p><p>The question got Hannah\u2019s attention for a moment. She peered through the windshield. \u201cYes, I think so.\u201d</p><p>Rafe popped the door. \u201cHe sure hasn\u2019t changed much, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hannah\u2019s mouth thinned. \u201cHe still looks like the kind of guy who checks out rest room walls for the names of potential dates.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA man has to use whatever resources are available.\u201d Rafe climbed out from behind the wheel and closed the door. He braced one hand against the roof of the Porsche and leaned down to look at Hannah through the open window. \u201cBetter stop glaring at me like that. Sandy might come to the conclusion that we\u2019ve having a lovers\u2019 spat. If you think the gossip is unpleasant now, just imagine what it will be like if word gets out that we\u2019re fighting.\u201d</p><p>Hannah chose to ignore him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>Rafe straightened and nodded at Sandy. \u201cSandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard you were back in town. How\u2019s it hangin\u2019?\u201d Sandy leaned down to speak through the open window. \u201cHi there, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Sandy.\u201d</p><p>Sandy gave Rafe a keenly interested glance. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need gas.\u201d Rafe pushed himself away from the car. \u201cWhat have you been up to, Sandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoin\u2019 okay.\u201d Sandy beamed proudly. He hoisted a rubber-bladed scraper out of a bucket of dirty water and went to work on the front window of the Porsche. \u201cBought the station from old man Carpenter a couple years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding?\u201d Rafe noticed the sign that pointed customers toward the rest rooms. He thought about what Hannah had said a moment earlier. \u201cThat\u2019s gotta be convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, Congratulations. I\u2019ll bet you do pretty good during the summer months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d Sandy winked. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re doin\u2019 all right for yourself, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting by.\u201d A dark cloud of premonition settled on Rafe. Maybe stopping for gas had not been such a swell idea.</p><p>But it was too late to change course. Sandy\u2019s grin was only a decimal point away from a leer. He dropped the wiper back into the bucket and moved closer to Rafe. He lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper.</p><p>\u201cHeard you and Hannah were having yourselves some good times together out there at Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that, Sandy Hickson,\u201d Hannah shouted through the open window. \u201cIt\u2019s not true. Furthermore, if you repeat that one more time I will wrap one of those gas hoses around your throat. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Sandy blinked and took a quick, startled step away from the fender. \u201cHey, Hannah, I didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019, honest. Just passin\u2019 the time of day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull,\u201d she said. \u201cJust because you own your very own rest rooms now and have access to an unlimited source of phone numbers, don\u2019t think that everyone else gets involved in the same kind of limited, one-dimensional relationships you apparently prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure.\u201d Sandy threw Rafe a desperate look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finished here,\u201d Rafe said quickly. \u201cWhat do I owe you, Sandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, eleven-fifty,\u201d Sandy said.</p><p>A classic finned Cadillac pulled into the neighboring aisle. A petite woman with a helmet of steel-gray curls got out. \u201cIs that you, Rafe Madison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, Mrs. Seaton.\u201d Rafe grabbed his wallet. Speed was of the essence.</p><p>Edith Seaton examined him from head to toe with an expression of frank feminine admiration. \u201cMy, my, you did fill out nicely, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Rafe could feel the sudden heat in his face. He had a nasty feeling that he was turning a dull red. There wasn\u2019t much that could make him blush, but Mrs. Seaton had managed the trick.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again, Mrs. Seaton.\u201d Damn. He didn\u2019t have fifty cents in change. He concentrated on plucking a ten and two ones from his wallet. \u201cI see you\u2019ve still got the antique shop on the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Wouldn\u2019t know what to do with myself if I didn\u2019t have the shop.\u201d Mrs. Seaton glanced into the car. \u201cIs that you, Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mrs. Seaton.\u201d Hannah\u2019s voice sounded strained and slightly muffled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThought so. Heard all about you and Rafe inheriting Dreamscape. I talked to Isabel shortly before she made her transition, you know. She was very excited about the whole notion of leaving that place to the two of you.\u201d Mrs. Seaton winked. \u201cShe was always such a romantic at heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Hannah said. Her voice dripped icicles.</p><p>The crowd was growing rapidly. Across the street the door of the Total Eclipse Bar and Grill opened, and two of the patrons emerged. They stood for a few seconds beneath the neon letters that spelled out the bar\u2019s slogan, Where the sun don\u2019t shine. Then, curiosity obviously aroused, they jaywalked toward the gas station to see what was happening.</p><p>A familiar green Volvo rolled up to a pump. The window on the driver\u2019s side was down. Perry Decatur, dressed in a slouchy jacket and dark glasses, sat behind the wheel. His head swiveled toward the car.</p> <p>The audience continued to swell. It was definitely time to leave. He tossed the gas money at Sandy. \u201cHere you go. Keep the change. See you later.\u201d He reached for the door handle.</p><p>But escape eluded him. A battered white pickup pulled up to the pump just ahead of the Porsche, and a burly man dressed in denim jeans held up by a belt fastened below his belly got out. He adjusted the billed cap that covered his thinning hair.</p><p>\u201cRafe Madison.\u201d The big man\u2019s eyes crinkled with genuine pleasure. \u201cLong time no see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Pete.\u201d</p><p>Pete Levare hitched up his jeans and screwed his features into a good-natured expression of avid curiosity. \u201cHeard you and the Harte girl each got a chunk of Dreamscape. What the hey\u2019s going on out there, anyway? Is it true the two of you are\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He never got to finish the sentence. The passenger door of Rafe\u2019s car flew open.</p><p>\u201cThat does it.\u201d Hannah erupted, Mount St. Helens fashion, from the Porsche\u2019s cockpit. Sensing an exciting new game, Winston leaped to follow her.</p><p>Together dog and woman whipped around the front of the car and started toward the hapless Pete. A sense of impending disaster settled on Rafe. It was like watching a film in which events are spinning out of control. All he could do was stand there and wonder how bad it would get.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Pete held up both hands, palms out, and backpedaled furiously toward the safety of his pickup. \u201cCalm down, Hannah. What did I say? What did I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you said, it\u2019s what you were about to say,\u201d Hannah yelled as she charged toward him. \u201cYou think Rafe and I are shacking up together, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShacking up? No, no, I never said that. Did I say that, Rafe?\u201d Pete cast a helpless, beseeching glance at Rafe.</p> <p>Rafe ignored him. He was too busy admiring the sight of Hannah in a full-blown temper. Invisible waves of energy shimmered in the air around her. The stylish acid-green scarf she wore around her throat snapped in the breeze. Who would have thought a Harte would demonstrate so much passion in public?</p><p>Winston pranced at her heels, his little legs moving so rapidly that all that could be seen in the vicinity of his paws was a silvery blur.</p><p>It was a thrilling sight, but one that he knew would have some repercussions.</p><p>Rafe cleared his throat. \u201cUh, Hannah\u2014\u201d</p><p>She paid him no heed. He groaned, folded his arms, and lounged against the car door. He\u2019d tried. Later, when she was pissed at him for having caused this scene, he would remind her of that singular fact. Whatever was about to happen here was definitely not his fault.</p><p>\u201cPay attention, Pete.\u201d Hannah came to a halt in front of the big man and planted her hands on her hips. \u201cRafe and I are not\u2014repeat, not\u2014shacking up together at Dreamscape. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, you bet,\u201d Pete said quickly. \u201cRight. Not shacking up.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Seaton looked fascinated. \u201cI heard the two of you are planning to get married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hannah whirled around to stare at her. \u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the post office this morning,\u201d Mrs. Seaton said brightly. \u201cRan into Mitchell collecting his mail. He said he thought you and Rafe made a wonderful couple. Said you\u2019d probably have something to announce any day. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Hannah\u2019s voice rose. \u201cThere will be no announcements.\u201d</p><p>Rafe kept his mouth shut.</p><p>Everyone looked expectant.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Mrs. Seaton asked.</p><p>\u201cI am absolutely positive,\u201d Hannah ground out between set teeth. \u201cRafe and I have never discussed marriage.\u201d</p><p>From out of nowhere a lightning bolt of anger sizzled through Rafe. He stirred against the side of the car. \u201cStrictly speaking, that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Hannah swiveled to pin him with a dangerous look. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying that subject has come up between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it has,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll agree that we haven\u2019t come to any definitive conclusions yet, but you can\u2019t say that we haven\u2019t talked about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare get cute on me here, Rafe Madison.\u201d She took a step toward him. \u201cYou have never once asked me to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what Mitchell said about my phobia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that stupid excuse about having a phobia. You\u2019re the one who said the best way to deal with a phobia was to confront it head-on. I haven\u2019t noticed you trying that approach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He felt his stomach clench. \u201cI\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>For a second or two he didn\u2019t think he would get an answer. He heard Mrs. Seaton catch her breath. The others gazed with rapt attention. Even Perry Decatur was staring, transfixed by the scene.</p><p>Hannah pulled herself together with a visible effort. She glanced hurriedly around, as though finally coming to her senses. Rafe saw the gathering dismay and anger in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat was not a real proposal.\u201d There was a strange edge to her voice now. \u201cThat was a joke. At my expense. I don\u2019t appreciate it, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo joke,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThe proposal was real to me.\u201d He held her complete attention. \u201cDo I get an answer?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her face frozen. And then, to his horror, he saw the glint of moisture in her eyes. Her lips parted, trembled ever so slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d He knew instinctively that if she burst into tears in front of all these people she would never forgive him.</p><p>He pushed away from the car door and wrapped one arm around her waist. \u201cSorry, folks. We\u2019ve got an appointment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He got her around the hood of the car and into the passenger seat before anyone had quite realized what was happening.</p><p>\u201cWinston,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>Winston scrambled nimbly into the car. Rafe closed the door behind him, circled back around the front of the Porsche, and got behind the wheel. He twisted the key in the ignition, wrapped one hand around the gearshift, and pulled out of the station onto Bay Street before the crowd could react.</p><p>When he checked the rearview mirror, he saw a row of excited faces. He knew only too well that the news about his gas station proposal would be all over town by five o\u2019clock that evening.</p> <p>He glanced uneasily at Hannah. She was blinking rapidly and dabbing at her eyes with a hankie, but she appeared to have the potential flood of tears under control. Winston rested his muzzle on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Rafe said eventually.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d</p><p>He tried to look on the positive side. At least she hadn\u2019t said no.</p><p>Chapter 22</p> <p>The letdown was far worse than the anger or the tears. It bordered on outright depression, Hannah thought. She retreated to the upstairs veranda as soon as she was inside the house. Rafe did not try to stop her.</p><p>Half an hour later, stretched out in a wicker lounger, with Winston hovering loyally beside her, she tried to sort out her mangled emotions and jumbled thoughts. She gazed at the restless surface of the bay and told herself that she had overreacted. She had, in fact, come unglued in a way that was most unusual for her.</p><p>Obviously she had been under more stress lately than she had realized.</p><p>She had every right to be furious with Rafe for that scene at the Eclipse Bay Gas and Go, she decided. But why had she let events get to her like that? She had been screaming at Pete Levare. She had nearly burst into tears in front of all those people.</p><p>What was the matter with her?</p><p>The answer was out there, but she knew she did not want to deal with it. She almost welcomed the sound of Rafe\u2019s footsteps behind her. Anything was better than looking at the hard facts of her situation.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She took some satisfaction from the fact that he sounded worried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pissed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know.\u201d He handed her a glass of iced tea. After a second\u2019s hesitation she took it from him. He seemed relieved. He lowered himself onto a wicker chair and rested his elbows on his knees. \u201cIt was my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already established that.\u201d She examined the glass in her hand. The tea was not ordinary black tea over ice. It was a luscious green-gold in color. There was a sprig of mint draped artistically over the rim and tiny little mint leaves frozen inside each ice cube. A crisp straw poked over the edge of the glass. An impossibly thin slice of lemon floated in the crystal-clear depths. \u201cThere\u2019s no little paper umbrella,\u201d she said.</p><p>He examined the glass critically and then shook his head once, decisively. \u201cAn umbrella would have been over the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that scene at the gas station.\u201d She sipped the tea through the straw. It was perfect. Cold, strong, and invigorating. \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAsk me to marry you in that dumb, tacky way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to reopen that conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want an answer.\u201d</p><p>He looked out at the silver surface of the bay. \u201cAll right. I wanted to marry you the day you got out of the car here at Dreamscape, but I knew you wouldn\u2019t take a chance on me. At least, not right away.\u201d</p><p>Tea sloshed over the side of her glass. She sputtered wildly, \u201cYou what . . . ?\u201d</p><p>He did not respond to her interruption. Instead he plowed ahead with a sort of dogged determination. She got the feeling that having launched himself on this venture, he was bound to see it through to the conclusion, even if that conclusion was ill-fated.</p><p>\u201cDuring the past few days I thought maybe we were getting closer. Making progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving sex, you mean.\u201d</p><p>He nodded agreeably. \u201cThat, too. But I didn\u2019t want to push it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d She scowled. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly because I figured you\u2019d get nervous and back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? You\u2019re the one who claims to have a deep-seated fear of having inherited a genetic tendency to screw up relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had every right to play my cards close to the chest. I wasn\u2019t sure what I was dealing with. After all, you told me you\u2019d drawn up a new list of qualifications for a husband. Hell, you wouldn\u2019t even tell me what was on the revised version.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her head against the back of the lounger. \u201cThat stupid list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That stupid list. Worrying about it has been a real source of stress for me, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>Her hand stilled on Winston\u2019s head. \u201cIt has?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat damned list has driven me nuts. At any rate, this afternoon at the gas station when you started to tell everyone that the subject of marriage had never even come up between us, I guess I got a little irritated. Hell, I lost my temper.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd whatever common sense I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>She slowly lowered the glass. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head back to look at her. \u201cDead serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been thinking about marriage since I first got here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore that, if you want the truth.\u201d He looked down at his loosely clasped hands for a moment. When he raised his head again his eyes were bleak. \u201cMaybe since I got the news about Dreamscape from Isabel\u2019s lawyer and realized that you were still single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat put the notion of marriage into your head? Did you have some crazy idea that it would be the simplest way to deal with our inheritance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. Marriage is not a simple way of handling anything. I know that better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d Her voice was rising again. She\u2019d have to watch that. She was a Harte, after all.</p><p>Rafe\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain. It just seemed right somehow. When I got the letter from the lawyer things started to fall into place. For the first time in my life I knew exactly what I wanted. It was as if I\u2019d been groping my way through a fog bank for years and suddenly the fog evaporated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, precisely, do you want?\u201d</p><p>He spread his hands. \u201cNothing too bizarre. You. The inn and the restaurant. A future.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She waited for him to add undying love and mutual devotion to the list. But he didn\u2019t. \u201cI see. Some people would say that a marriage between a Harte and a Madison would definitely qualify as bizarre.\u201d</p><p>He watched her intently. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s on this new list of yours, but I\u2019ve done some changing during the past eight years. I still don\u2019t meet all the requirements you gave me when you were nineteen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was twenty that night, not nineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. The thing is, I do meet at least some of those specifications, and I\u2019m willing to work on the rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>He leaned forward, intense and earnest. \u201cYou\u2019re a Harte. You ought to see the logic in us getting married. Hey, we\u2019d be going into this deal with our eyes wide open. We know a hell of a lot more about each other than most people know about their potential spouses. We\u2019ve got some history together. Three generations of it. We\u2019d have Dreamscape to work on together. Sharing a business enterprise is a very bonding experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He was warming to his theme now. \u201cFor my part, I can guarantee that this wouldn\u2019t be another typical Madison marriage.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her tea, reluctantly fascinated. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just told you.\u201d He spread his hands in a gesture of exasperation. \u201cIt won\u2019t be based on some wild, romantic fantasy of endless lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lust at all?\u201d she asked around the straw.</p><p>His jaw locked. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t find you attractive. You know I do. We\u2019re sexually compatible. That\u2019s important in a marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexual compatibility is nice,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cRight. Real important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what you\u2019re proposing here is a marriage of convenience.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m proposing,\u201d he said, his voice tightening, \u201cis a marriage based on the sort of things that are supposed to appeal to a Harte, the kind of crap that was on that original list of yours: Mutual goals. Shared interests, et cetera, et cetera.\u201d</p><p>The edge in his voice made her look at him quickly, but his face was an unreadable mask.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She jiggled the straw among the ice cubes. \u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>He drew a breath. \u201cOkay, \u2018crap\u2019 was not a great word. Look, what I\u2019m trying to say here is that I think we\u2019ve got a shot at making a marriage work. Hannah, you told me once that I didn\u2019t have to repeat the same mistakes my father and my grandfather made. I haven\u2019t been one hundred percent successful, but I have managed to avoid some of the larger disasters. And I did meet the goal I set for myself eight years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t end up in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that count for something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s taken me a while to find out what I want in life, but I\u2019ve got it straight now. I need to know if you can stretch your new list of requirements in a husband to accommodate me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDepends.\u201d She steeled herself. \u201cYou see, the new edition of my list is extremely short, at least compared to the old one. Only one requirement is on it.\u201d</p><p>He watched her the way Winston watched seagulls. Hope and determination burned in his eyes, but so did the knowledge of potential defeat.</p><p>The roar of a sturdy truck engine rumbled in the drive on the opposite side of the house. Winston removed his head from under Hannah\u2019s hand and hurried off around the corner to investigate. Rafe frowned, clearly annoyed by the interruption. Then he realized who it was and surged to his feet.</p><p>\u201cThat will be A.Z. ,\u201d he said. He started after Winston.</p><p>Hannah glared at his back. \u201cSo much for declaring undying love and devotion.\u201d But she said it very softly so that he would not hear her because it was entirely possible that he did not have either to declare.</p><p>Who would have guessed that a Madison would have ever settled for a marriage based on mutual interests and shared goals?</p><p>Who would have guessed that a Harte would have hungered for a little wild passion and romantic love?</p><p>The noise of the truck engine ceased abruptly. Hannah got up from the lounger and followed Rafe and Winston around the corner.</p><p>\u201cThis here\u2019s the log for that night.\u201d Arizona opened the black leather-bound volume on the kitchen table and swiveled it around so that Rafe and Hannah could look at the entries. \u201cThat first Thornley reception was a big event. Lots of folks there, including some from Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a record of a car that left the parking lot and returned between midnight and two.\u201d Rafe slid the log closer to get a better look at the tiny, meticulously made notations. \u201cI assume you stayed until the reception ended, A.Z. ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil the last car pulled out of the lot,\u201d she assured him. \u201cNo point keeping a half-assed record, I say.\u201d</p><p>Hannah flipped pages. \u201cThere are a lot of entries here. It\u2019s going to take a while to go through them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time.\u201d Arizona shoved herself to her feet. \u201cReckon I\u2019ll go out into the sunroom and relax while you two conduct your little investigation. Mind if I pour myself some more of your coffee, Rafe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself.\u201d He reached for a pen and the lined tablet he had set out on the table.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Arizona reached for the pot. \u201cBeen a while since I sat in Isabel\u2019s sunroom. Miss those visits. Isabel always had something interesting to say.\u201d</p><p>The sad, faintly wistful note in Arizona\u2019s voice caught Hannah off guard. She looked up quickly.</p><p>Arizona headed for the kitchen door, chunky mug in hand. \u201cI could talk to her, you know? She understood when I told her about the goings-on up at the institute. Didn\u2019t laugh the way some folks do.\u201d</p><p>Arizona ambled out into the hall and disappeared in the direction of the solarium. Hannah gazed after her for a moment, aware of a glimmer of curiosity.</p><p>\u201cI wonder just how close Arizona and Aunt Isabel actually were,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAs far as I know, neither of them ever married. They were friends for a long time. You don\u2019t suppose\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of our business.\u201d Rafe wrote down a license plate number. \u201cThis will go faster if you take the notes while I read the entries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She took the pen from him and positioned the yellow tablet. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>It was a discouraging process. Arizona\u2019s log was more than a simple list of license plates, names, and times. It was complicated by extensive notations. Rafe read some of them aloud. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>. . .

Hannah was privately on the verge of conceding defeat when Rafe paused at a license plate number.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked up quickly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been concentrating on plates and vehicles connected with the Thornley campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>Rafe sat back slowly and shoved his hands into his back pockets. He studied the open logbook. \u201cNone of them left and returned during that two-hour window. Maybe we\u2019ve been coming at this from the wrong angle.\u201d</p><p>Hannah did not like the dark excitement in his voice. \u201cYou think maybe whoever left to meet Kaitlin borrowed someone else\u2019s car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Rafe hesitated. \u201cBut there\u2019s another possibility. From what we can figure out, Kaitlin was acting on impulse that night. She had made up her mind to leave town in the morning. She needed cash in a hurry. We\u2019ve been going on the assumption that she tried to sell the blackmail tapes to someone from Thornley\u2019s camp. But there was another potential market for those tapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat market is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe media.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure.\u201d Hannah tossed aside the pen. \u201cBut why would anyone in the media murder her after agreeing to buy the incriminating tapes? The last thing a journalist would want to do is get rid of his source. He\u2019d want backup for his story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if,\u201d Rafe said slowly, \u201che planned to use the tapes to blackmail Thornley himself.\u201d</p><p>Hannah drew a breath and let it out carefully. \u201cThe news of Thornley\u2019s interest in lingerie never appeared in the media. You think that\u2019s because some journalist who attended the reception that night kept the tapes and has been using them to blackmail Thornley all these years?\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Rafe took one hand out of his back pocket and rotated the logbook so that she could see the entry he had marked.</p><p>\u201cNot some journalist,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cOne Kaitlin knew well enough to call in a hurry that night. One she had reason to believe might be interested in handling a sleazy story about Thornley. An old acquaintance she thought she could trust.\u201d</p><p>Hannah looked down at the name written next to a license number. Stunned, she glanced quickly at the notes she had been making. The vehicle had left the reception shortly after midnight. It had returned at one-forty-seven A.M.</p><p>\u201cA journalist,\u201d Rafe went on very quietly, \u201cwho might have known that Arizona Snow had a habit of hiding in the shadows to make notes about events at the institute. One who might have decided that even though no one in town ever paid any attention to A.Z.\u2019s conspiracy theories, it would probably be a good idea to steal the log for that evening.\u201d</p> <p>A chill of disbelief numbed Hannah. \u201cYou think Kaitlin tried to sell the tapes to Jed Steadman?\u201d</p><p>An hour later Hannah paused halfway across the sunroom to glare at Mitchell, Rafe, and Arizona. All three of them glowered back at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck are we supposed to do now?\u201d she demanded. \u201cThe big idea was to take the evidence to Jed Steadman and let him run with the story. Now it looks like he\u2019s the chief suspect.\u201d</p><p>Arizona shook her head and made a tut-tut sound. \u201cShould have guessed the local media were involved in covering up institute actions. Explains a hell of a lot, if you ask me. No wonder they\u2019ve been able to maintain a cloak of secrecy over their activities up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re right, this has nothing to do with the institute,\u201d Hannah said with a patience she did not feel. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple case of blackmail and murder. It looks like Kaitlin called Jed that night. He went to meet her on the path above Hidden Cove. Maybe she offered to cut him in on the blackmail deal. Or maybe she simply wanted to sell the tapes to him outright. Either way, he saw a golden opportunity to cash in on the compromising videos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he figured he\u2019d better get rid of Kaitlin,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cProbably didn\u2019t trust her to keep her mouth shut. Or maybe he didn\u2019t want to split the potential profits two ways.\u201d</p><p>Rafe massaged the back of his neck. \u201cThe bottom line here is that we don\u2019t have any hard evidence for any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got my logs,\u201d Arizona reminded him.</p><p>\u201cNo offense, A.Z. , but we need more than that to take this to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve still got the option of turning the story over to the media,\u201d Hannah reminded him. \u201cNot the Eclipse Bay Journal, obviously. But maybe one of the Portland papers will be interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not.\u201d Rafe tapped his finger on the arm of the wicker chair. \u201cI was counting on Jed going with the story and doing the basic legwork because it was a hometown scandal. He had the best reason to get excited about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get fired up about it, all right,\u201d Mitchell said morosely. \u201cProbably sue us.\u201d</p><p>Hannah looked out over the bay. \u201cI wish we had a little more to go on here. Rafe is right. We don\u2019t have any hard evidence.\u201d</p><p>There was a short, stark silence behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou know who you\u2019re looking at now,\u201d Mitchell said eventually. \u201cIf nothing else, you ought to be able to use what you\u2019ve got to scare the hell out of Jed Steadman. Make sure he knows that if he makes one false move, a lot of folks will be watching. That should keep him in line.\u201d</p><p>Arizona grunted. \u201cWhy not call up the Thornley crowd and tell them we know who\u2019s been blackmailing their candidate all these years? That would stir things up a mite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure Jed has been blackmailing Thornley,\u201d Rafe said thoughtfully.</p><p>Everyone looked at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sat forward and folded his arms on his knees. \u201cWhen you get right down to it, there\u2019s no evidence that Steadman has been living above his income. If he\u2019s getting cash out of Thornley, where has the money been going?\u201d</p><p>Another silence greeted that observation.</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot and damn,\u201d Mitchell muttered. \u201cWhy would he commit murder for the tapes and then sit on them for eight years?\u201d</p><p>A cunning light appeared in Arizona\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhy waste time prying a few bucks out of a small-time state pol when you can hold your ammunition and use it on a genuine U.S. senator?\u201d</p> <p>Hannah heard a collective intake of breath.</p><p>\u201cYou know something, A.Z. ?\u201d Rafe\u2019s smile held no humor. \u201cFor a professional conspiracy theorist, you sometimes make a lot of sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a point, all right.\u201d Mitchell whistled softly in admiration. \u201cEveryone knew from the start that Thornley would probably go all the way to Washington.\u201d He glanced at Rafe. \u201cYou know Steadman better than anyone. Think he\u2019s into that kind of long-range planning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Rafe said thoughtfully. \u201cHe always likes to talk about the importance of timing and planning.\u201d</p><p>Hannah clasped her hands behind her back. \u201cIf Jed has been sitting on those tapes all this time, he must be getting a little antsy now that the big payoff is almost within reach. No wonder he freaked when Rafe and I returned to Eclipse Bay and people started to talk about the past.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe question is, What do we do with all this guesswork?\u201d Mitchell asked of the room at large.</p><p>Rafe looked out over the bay. \u201cWe get a little more information, if we can.\u201d</p><p>Hannah swung around in alarm. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a town council meeting tonight. They\u2019re going to be discussing the pier renovations. Jed will cover the session. It will probably run late.\u201d</p><p>Understanding hit her. She took an urgent step toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to search his house, aren\u2019t you? Rafe, you can\u2019t take that risk. What if a patrol car goes past his place while you\u2019re inside and you\u2019re spotted? If you get caught you\u2019ll be arrested for breaking and entering. You could end up in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that would be ironic,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cBe the fulfillment of a long-standing prophecy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is not amusing.\u201d She whirled around to face Mitchell. \u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want him to take this kind of risk. He\u2019s your grandson. Help me out here.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell stroked his chin. His expression of wolfish anticipation was uncomfortably familiar. \u201cWell, I sure wouldn\u2019t want him to take such a dumb risk on his own. Reckon I\u2019d better go with him to keep him out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Hannah looked from his face to Rafe\u2019s and back again. She groaned. \u201cWell, shoot and damn. This is a fine time for the two of you to decide to bond.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell studied the big house from beneath the branches of a dripping tree. Jed Steadman\u2019s home stood dark and silent in the fog-drenched gloom. \u201cYou thought about what we\u2019re going to do if we set off an alarm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt if there is one,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cNot many people here in Eclipse Bay are worried about crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re right about Steadman, he isn\u2019t exactly a typical resident of our fair town. You and Hannah have made him nervous lately. He might have put in an alarm. All I want to know is if you\u2019ve got a backup plan in case we run into one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d do something dicey like this without figuring all the angles first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me what we\u2019re supposed to do if we trigger an alarm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe run like hell.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell nodded. \u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want out before we go inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. Haven\u2019t had this much fun in years.\u201d</p><p>Rafe smiled slightly to himself. \u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d</p><p>Getting inside was easy. Maybe a little too easy, Rafe thought as he slid the unlocked bedroom window open. He eased one leg over the sill and paused for a few seconds, listening to the silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Mitchell demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Rafe got the other leg over the sill and stood inside the bedroom.</p><p>He was conscious of an eerie stillness in the house. A lonely quality permeated the darkness around him. He was only too well acquainted with this bleak, melancholy sensation. He had been aware of the emptiness collecting in his house in San Diego for a long time before he had made the decision to move to Eclipse Bay. Maybe this was how any man\u2019s home felt when there was no woman in it to soften the edges and warm the shadows.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Mitchell whispered after he climbed through he window.</p><p>\u201cYou take this room. Look for a wall safe. I\u2019ll go see if I can find a study or a home office. Got your gloves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but we\u2019re not exactly experts at this kind of thing. What if he realizes later that someone went through his belongings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him something more to worry about,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t turn up those tapes, giving him a good scare may be the only tactic we\u2019ve got to use against him.\u201d</p><p>He left Mitchell in the bedroom and went swiftly down the hall. He stopped in the doorway of another bedroom and clicked on his penlight. The room was beyond spartan in its bareness. It looked as if no one had ever slept in it. He opened a closet door. A mound of old camping equipment was piled inside.</p><p>He closed the door and went on down the hall to the next room. A quick glance revealed that Jed used it as an entertainment center. A massive television set took up a large section of one wall. Several thousand dollars\u2019 worth of speakers and other electronic equipment were positioned around a large recliner cushioned in black leather.</p><p>A wastebasket sat next to the recliner. Rafe glanced inside and saw a small heap of trash. A little square of yellow paper and a bit of foil clung to the side of the basket.</p><p>Rafe aimed the penlight closer to the candy wrapper. It looked identical to the one he had discovered beneath the tree at the end of the Harte cottage drive. It wasn\u2019t conclusive proof that it had been Jed who had kept watch on the house that night, but the evidence was mounting.</p><p>\u201cRafe.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s voice echoed softly from the other bedroom. It was husky with urgency. \u201cYou better take a look at this.\u201d</p><p>Rafe swung around and hurried back down the hall. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He rounded the corner and aimed the penlight at Mitchell, who was standing in front of a chest of drawers. \u201cFind something?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I didn\u2019t find.\u201d Mitchell waved a hand at three open drawers. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in here. Cleaned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a look for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Rafe went to the closet and yanked it open. Three shirts hung limply in the far corner. A pair of worn slippers sat on the floor. The rest of the space was empty. The door of a small safe built into the closet wall hung open. There was nothing inside,</p> <p>\u201cLooks like he packed up and left.\u201d Mitchell hooked his thumbs on his belt. \u201cMaybe he figured out we\u2019re on to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could he have known?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell shrugged. \u201cSmall town. He might have seen Arizona\u2019s truck parked at Dreamscape this afternoon. Wouldn\u2019t take much for him to put two and two together. He\u2019s got to know you\u2019re one of the few people who takes her seriously. Maybe he figured out that she was helping you look into the Sadler girl\u2019s death. Wouldn\u2019t be a real big leap for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rafe thought about it. \u201cNot if he was already paranoid about that possibility. Maybe he planned for the possibility that someone would come around asking questions someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing\u2019s for certain.\u201d Mitchell turned toward the open wall safe. \u201cIf Steadman has cleared out for good, you can bet he didn\u2019t leave those tapes behind for us to find.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 23</p><p>Rafe was brooding again. Hannah tolerated it as long as she could stand it, but by ten o\u2019clock that evening she was starting to climb the walls. She tracked her quarry down in the solarium, where he was sitting in the shadows. He had one hand on Winston\u2019s neck, rubbing the dog absently behind the ears.</p><p>\u201cI vote we all take Winston for his evening walk on the beach,\u201d Hannah said from the doorway.</p><p>At the sound of his name included in the same sentence as the word \u201cwalk,\u201d Winston moved smartly out from under Rafe\u2019s hand and bounced toward the door.</p><p>Rafe\u2019s hand paused in midair over the place where Winston\u2019s ears had been a second earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s dark, in case you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>Hannah lounged in the doorway, arms folded. \u201cThere\u2019s no fog. The moon is out. All we need is a flashlight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the back of his head. \u201cJust a little past ten. The first time you and I walked on the beach it was after midnight.\u201d</p><p>There was a short, stark silence. Without another word, Rafe levered himself up out of the lounger.</p><p>They went out of the big house through the French doors that opened onto the lower veranda. Rafe clicked on the flashlight, but Winston ignored the beam. He bounded ahead, zipping down the steps and heading toward the shadowy beach path with the ease of a creature who relies on a variety of senses to get around.</p><p>Rafe and Hannah followed in the dog\u2019s wake.</p><p>The evening was cool but not cold. The bay was a dark mirror beneath the icy white moon. A swath of silver streaked the surface of the deceptively still water. In the distance the lights of the pier and the streets of the small downtown section of Eclipse Bay glittered. Hannah could see the glow of Chamberlain College and the institute on the hillside.</p><p>Everything about the night brought back memories of her first walk on the beach with Rafe. She wondered if he was remembering that same evening and if so, what he thought about it.</p><p>When they reached the sand they followed Winston toward the rocky pools uncovered by the low tide.</p> <p>\u201cThis is about Jed Steadman, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Hannah asked after a while. \u201cI know it must have been hard for you to discover that he may have been the one who murdered Kaitlin. He was your friend, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJed was just a guy I knew a long time ago,\u201d Rafe said distantly. \u201cSomeone I could shoot a game of pool with on a dull night.\u201d</p><p>She peered at him. \u201cI thought you two were quite close in the old days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly thought about him in the past eight years, let alone picked up the phone to call him. And he sure as hell never bothered to get in touch with me. We weren\u2019t buddies. Just a couple of guys who did some stuff together on long summer weekends because we had one big thing in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the big thing? Kaitlin Sadler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The big thing was that neither of us had a father anywhere in the picture.\u201d</p><p>Hannah shoved her hands into the pockets of her sweater jacket. \u201cI can see where that would have been a bond of sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI envied him a little, if you want to know the truth. I always figured he was the lucky one. He seemed like he knew what he was doing. Had a plan for his future. Knew where he was going. The kind of guy who wouldn\u2019t screw up.\u201d</p><p>Halfway down the beach, Winston paused to investigate a hunk of driftwood. Rafe aimed the flashlight at him and then let the light slide away toward the foam at the water\u2019s edge.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong about Jed, you know,\u201d Rafe said after a while.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t the lucky one. I was. I had Mitchell after my parents were killed. Gabe and I both had him. I went off track for a while, but at least I knew there was a track, thanks to him.\u201d</p><p>Hannah nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there was ever anyone there for Jed. His father drank a lot, and one day he just disappeared. His mother remarried two or three times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not go too far into let\u2019s-feel-sorry-for-poor-Jed-who-came-from-a-dysfunctional-family territory. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s all true, but I can\u2019t believe that he didn\u2019t know a few of the rules. The night he murdered Kaitlin Sadler in order to get his hands on those blackmail tapes he broke those rules. I\u2019m sure he was well aware of what he was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Hannah, that\u2019s one of the things I like about you.\u201d For the first time that evening there was a trace of wry amusement in Rafe\u2019s words. \u201cI can always count on you to cut right to the heart of the matter.\u201d</p><p>Hannah sighed. \u201cAll right, if you\u2019re not brooding because of Jed, do you mind telling me why you\u2019ve been in such a foul mood all evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the positive feedback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I don\u2019t want to argue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re so good at it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tightened her hands inside the pockets of her sweater jacket. \u201cLet\u2019s start over. Tell me what you\u2019ve been thinking about this evening.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a couple of heartbeats. She had the impression that he was gathering himself for a big jump.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to sign over my half of Dreamscape to you,\u201d he said.</p><p>For a few seconds she thought she had misunderstood. She reran his simple statement twice through her brain before she finally decided she had gotten it right the first time.</p> <p>She came to a sudden halt on the beach and swung around to face him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d He stopped and looked at her. \u201cDreamscape is Harte property. It\u2019s always been Harte property. I know your aunt had some romantic notions, but the truth is, I don\u2019t have any real claim on the place. It\u2019s yours. I\u2019m not going to fight you for it.\u201d</p><p>Panic seized her. She jerked her hands out of her pockets and grabbed fistfuls of his black pullover. \u201cI thought we had a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never got a chance to respond.\u201d She stood on tiptoe and leaned closer. \u201cArizona Snow arrived with her logbook in the middle of our business discussion, if you will recall. Then came our big deductions concerning Kaitlin Sadler\u2019s death.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHannah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was followed by you and your grandfather deciding to engage in a bit of breaking and entering. The next thing we know, Jed Steadman has left town and you\u2019re brooding. All in all, it\u2019s been a somewhat hectic day. I haven\u2019t had a chance to get back to you on your business offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known for a long time now that my claim on Dreamscape was the only thing I could use to hold you. I don\u2019t want to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me if I got this wrong, but I was under the impression that you saw me and Dreamscape as a sort of package deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can build my restaurant somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dream of a restaurant is your passion. Dreamscape is the best possible location for it, and you know it. You can\u2019t give it up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot news for you, Hannah. The restaurant is important, but it\u2019s not my greatest passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you and the restaurant in a business deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who made the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was getting desperate.\u201d</p><p>Hope soared within her. Grimly she tamped it down, forcing herself to keep things in perspective. \u201cBut now you\u2019ve changed your mind? You don\u2019t want me anymore?\u201d</p><p>He closed his free hand around one of her fists. \u201cI want you, Hannah, but it\u2019s no good unless you want me. Tonight I realized that taking Dreamscape out of the equation is the only way to find out how you really feel about me.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t keep the lid on the tide of hope any longer. It surged through her. \u201cYou want to know how I feel? I\u2019ll tell you how I feel. I love you, Rafe Madison. I want to stay here in Eclipse Bay with you. I want to open a five-star inn and restaurant at Dreamscape with you. I want to have babies and a future with you.\u201d</p> <p>For an instant he did not move. Then he abruptly wrapped one arm around her and pulled her hard against his chest. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>She snuggled against him. The heat and strength of his body enfolded her. He was her future.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said into her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re my passion, not the restaurant. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do now.\u201d Relief and joy washed through her. Once a Madison was committed to his passion, nothing else was allowed to get in the way.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your new list?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cDo I qualify?\u201d</p><p>She smiled against his throat. \u201cThere was only one item on it. I wanted to marry someone I could love with all my heart. Someone who loved me the same way in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I meet all the qualifications.\u201d He tightened his hold on her. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it work. You and me. Dreamscape. The future. We\u2019ll make it all work. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your dreams and my brains, how can we miss?\u201d</p><p>He raised her chin on the edge of his hand. \u201cThat night on the beach I told myself I could never have you, but I knew even then that I would never be able to forget you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told myself the same thing about you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled against her lips. \u201cYou and your damned list were always there, somewhere in the back of my mind. You want to know the truth? Part of me wanted you to be happy. But another part hoped like hell that you would never find a man who met all those specifications for a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your big career objective to stay out of jail were always in the back of my mind. The thought of so much potential going to waste was extremely annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like we\u2019ve been a constant source of irritation for each other all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of a better basis for a marriage.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNeither can I.\u201d</p><p>The beam of the flashlight splashed across the sand when his mouth came down on hers. Hannah reveled in the kiss. A singing happiness exploded inside her.</p><p>Winston\u2019s sharp, harsh bark broke the spell.</p><p>Rafe reluctantly raised his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think your dog approves of us making out on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll just have to get used to it.\u201d</p><p>Winston left the piece of driftwood he had been worrying and dashed toward them. He barked again, louder and more urgently this time. Not a request for attention or an invitation to romp.</p><p>A surge of alarm shot through Hannah. \u201cI think something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Winston did not stop when he reached the place where Hannah and Rafe stood. He sped on down the beach toward the path that led back to Dreamscape. He was barking furiously now.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Rafe swung around to follow the dog with the flashlight beam. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>He broke into a run.</p><p>Hannah looked toward the mansion. Shock seized her. The background rumble of the restless bay behind her blotted out any sound that might have drifted down the cliffs from Dreamscape. But she did not need to hear the crackle and hiss of the fire. She could see the flames leaping into the night quite clearly.</p><p>Should have taken the cell phone with me, Rafe thought as he raced toward the house. But the possibility that the fire could still be handled with the garden hose was too tempting to allow for a detour into the house to call 911. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He leaped the steps and ran the length of the veranda. Winston was a short distance ahead of him. The dog was in full charge mode. He was no longer sounding the alarm with short, warning barks. The porch lights glinted on bared teeth and flattened ears.</p><p>He had been right about Winston the first time he saw him, Rafe thought. Definitely not a froufrou pooch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call the fire department,\u201d Hannah shouted.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He did not look back as he rounded the corner of the veranda.</p> <p>Winston\u2019s growl was the only warning he got before he glimpsed the figure silhouetted by the flames. The man was attempting to flee, but the dog had closed his jaws around a pant leg.</p><p>Rafe saw Winston\u2019s victim raise the gasoline can in his hands and prepare to smash it down hard on the Schnauzer\u2019s skull.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn dog,\u201d Jed yelled.</p><p>Rafe slammed into him. The can sailed out onto the grass, away from the flames. Jed went down hard on the wooden boards. He opened dazed, angry eyes. Hatred and rage flared hotter than the crackling fire.</p><p>Winston tried to get a better grip on Jed\u2019s leg.</p> <p>\u201cLet go, Winston.\u201d</p><p>The dog released the trouser cuff and looked at Rafe.</p><p>\u201cYou sonofabitch,\u201d Jed roared. \u201cI had it all planned. Waited all this time. But you had to come back and ruin everything.\u201d</p><p>He heaved himself upward, hands stretched out for Rafe\u2019s throat.</p><p>Rafe saw the madness in his eyes and moved back out of reach. \u201cIt\u2019s over, Jed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you have to come back here and screw up everything? Why, goddamn you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d Rafe said again.</p><p>In the distance sirens wailed. Winston pranced in agitation and started to bark again. Hannah rounded the corner, the fire extinguisher from the kitchen cupboard in her hands.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d She halted at the scene in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI had it made until you came back.\u201d Jed\u2019s face crumpled in fury. \u201cEverything was in place. After all these years, everything was in place. And then you came back.\u201d</p><p>He launched himself wildly across the short space that separated him from Rafe.</p><p>Rafe sidestepped the charge and stuck out one foot. Jed tripped over it and fetched up against the wall of the mansion. He clung there a few seconds and then slid slowly to a sitting position.</p><p>When he opened his eyes this time, the rage was gone. In its wake was a bleak awareness of abject failure.</p><p>\u201cI had it all planned,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>Chapter 24</p><p>\u201cWinston was the hero of the hour.\u201d Hannah looked proudly at her dog, who was gnawing on a chewing bone. \u201cThanks to him, the fire damage was minimal. The Willis brothers assured us they could have things in great shape in a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d allow more like a couple of months, if I were you,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cConstruction work never gets done on time, especially when the Willis brothers are handling things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just as well,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cWe wanted to make some major modifications to that wing, anyway. We can incorporate them into the repairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d Mitchell leaned back in his chair and cast an assessing glance the length of the veranda. \u201cGot your work cut out for you here. But I think, in the end, you\u2019ll have yourselves a nice little inn and restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive stars,\u201d Rafe said. His voice was soft with certainty.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t doubt it for a minute.\u201d Mitchell chuckled. \u201cAlways knew you could do anything you set out to do. Just a matter of applying yourself.\u201d</p><p>Hannah grinned. \u201cGee, what a coincidence. I once told him the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Rafe stacked his heels on the railing and took a swallow from the beer bottle in his hand. \u201cHow could I miss with both of you telling me what to do with my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook you long enough to live up to expectations, but you finally made it.\u201d Mitchell cradled his beer in one fist and squinted into the dying light. \u201cAny more news on Jed Steadman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that everything went down pretty much as we figured.\u201d Rafe looked out over the bay. \u201cExcept, of course, that Jed is claiming through his lawyer that Kaitlin\u2019s death was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe result of a quarrel over the tapes,\u201d Hannah explained.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Mitchell muttered. \u201cReckon it\u2019s a given he\u2019ll end up facing only a manslaughter charge. But what happened to the tapes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJed claims they went over the cliff with Kaitlin and were swept out to sea. Says he never even viewed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d Mitchell grimaced. \u201cAnd if you believe that, I\u2019ve got some waterfront property in Arizona I can sell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone actually believes his story,\u201d Hannah said slowly. \u201cBut if those tapes don\u2019t surface, no one will be able to prove otherwise. The Thornley camp is taking the line that the incident had nothing to do with their man. But there\u2019s a rumor going around that Trevor Thornley met Kaitlin when she worked for his first campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonder how many copies there are of those tapes,\u201d Mitchell mused.</p><p>\u201cNot our problem,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cThornley\u2019s the one who has to worry about opening a tabloid someday and finding a picture of himself modeling lingerie inside. We\u2019ve got other things to occupy us.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell cocked a brow. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as planning a wedding,\u201d Hannah said smoothly.</p><p>For a split second Mitchell looked stunned. In the next instant delight exploded across his weathered features. He gave a whoop that made Winston drop his chewing bone, get up from the floor, and pad over to his chair to see what all the excitement was about.</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot and damn,\u201d Mitchell said when he finally got his exuberance under control. \u201cI knew you two would get around to doing the right thing. You just needed a little kick in the you-know-where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know how we could have managed without your help,\u201d Rafe said dryly. \u201cTelling everyone at the post office that Hannah and I were planning to get married was certainly an inspiration for us. Wasn\u2019t it, Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely inspirational,\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>Mitchell was clearly having trouble containing his delight. \u201cLeast I could do. Wait\u2019ll Sullivan and the rest of those uptight, upright Hartes hear about this. Your family is going to have a combined hissy fit, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>Hannah winced. \u201cI expect there will be some fireworks when Rafe and I tell them the good news.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGonna light up the sky,\u201d Mitchell agreed cheerfully. \u201cSure would like to be there when you spring it on \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Rafe muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be anywhere in the vicinity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of family reaction,\u201d Hannah said firmly, \u201cI\u2019ll be planning this wedding. I\u2019ve had a certain amount of experience in the field, but I must admit this particular event presents some unique challenges.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell chortled. \u201cWorried about a brawl in the church?\u201d</p><p>Hannah gave him a repressive look. \u201cI expect some cooperation, restraint, and civilized behavior from everyone. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d Mitchell contrived to appear deeply offended. \u201cWe Madisons aren\u2019t going to cause a ruckus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Rafe agreed. \u201cIf there\u2019s trouble it won\u2019t start on the Madison side.\u201d</p><p>Hannah gave both men a steely look. \u201cIt better not finish there, either.\u201d</p> <p>The wedding was held two months later, in the Eclipse Bay Community Church. Everyone in town was invited, and virtually everyone came. In spite of several ghoulish predictions of carnage, the ceremony went off without a hitch.</p><p>Halfway through the reception, which was held at Dreamscape, Mitchell could no longer restrain himself. He sought out Sullivan in order to gloat.</p><p>He found his old partner and rival on the veranda. Sullivan stood alone near the railing, a glass of champagne in one hand, a cane in the other.</p><p>Well, shoot and damn, Mitchell thought. He\u2019s lost as much hair as I have. Seemed like he was taller back in the old days, too. Guess we\u2019ve both shrunk.</p><p>Looking at Sullivan was a little like looking into an old mirror. What had he expected? That they would stay young and dynamic forever? At least I\u2019m not the only one here with a cane.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sullivan.\u201d He came to a halt a few paces away. \u201cWhat do you think of your new grandson-in-law?\u201d</p> <p>Sullivan turned slowly around to face him. Mitchell relaxed a little. His ex-partner might be showing some wear and tear, but a savvy gleam still burned brightly in his eyes. This was the same man who had fought at his side in a long ago military action that no one except those who had been involved in it even remembered. This was the same man who had saved his life in that miserable jungle and whose life he had saved in return.</p><p>This was the same man he had teamed up with to risk everything in a financial gamble that had made them both rich for a while. The same man whose teeth he had tried to knock out in front of Fulton\u2019s Supermarket.</p><p>He met Sullivan\u2019s eyes and knew that they were both aware of the truth. The bonds that joined them would never dissolve.</p><p>Sullivan glanced down the length of the veranda to where Rafe stood with Hannah. \u201cHe\u2019ll do. Always said he had potential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell never heard you say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked much for a long time, Mitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Sure haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did okay by Rafe and Gabe.\u201d</p> <p>Startled, Mitchell glanced quickly at him and then turned just as swiftly away. \u201cCan\u2019t take all the credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can take some of it.\u201d</p><p>They stood together for a while, watching the crowd. Mitchell noticed that Sullivan made no effort to walk away.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019re going to be seeing a lot of each other again,\u201d Mitchell offered finally. \u201cI hear you Hartes are big on family gatherings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sullivan looked at him. \u201cWe\u2019re very big on that kind of thing. How do you feel about your new granddaughter-in-law?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell smiled. \u201cShe\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis better work out, Mitch. I swear to God, if Rafe doesn\u2019t treat her right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it.\u201d Mitchell watched Rafe slide a protective arm around Hannah\u2019s waist. \u201cShe\u2019s his passion. You know how it is with Madisons and their passions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sullivan sounded satisfied. \u201cI know how it is with Madisons and their passions. Nothing gets in the way.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>One month later...</p><p>The phone rang, shattering the moment. Rafe paused in the act of leaning over to kiss Hannah. She looked up at him from the pillow.</p><p>\u201cThe phone,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI knew I should have switched off the ringer before we went to bed tonight.\u201d</p><p>The instrument warbled insistently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better answer it. Might be your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to ignore it.\u201d Reluctantly he picked up the phone. \u201cThis better be important,\u201d he said to whoever was on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cAm I interrupting anything?\u201d Gabe asked politely.</p><p>\u201cYes. Our one-month wedding anniversary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only nine o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs old married folks go to bed early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cActually that brings me to what I wanted to talk about.\u201d</p><p>Rafe groaned and flopped back on his pillow. \u201cI really do not want to talk about your thwarted love life tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got a love life to thwart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother date go south?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig time.\u201d</p><p>Rafe glanced at Hannah, who raised one brow. \u201cTold you this idea of using a businesslike approach to finding a wife wasn\u2019t going to work very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know I\u2019m on the right track. I just need to fine-tune the strategy. I realized tonight that what I have to do is approach this the same way I would approach a merger or an acquisition. I need to hire a professional consultant.\u201d</p><p>A premonition of disaster shot through Rafe. \u201cI hope you aren\u2019t going to tell me what I think you\u2019re going to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call Hannah\u2019s sister first thing in the morning and sign up with her matchmaking agency. I understand she\u2019s fully computerized.\u201d</p><p>Rafe shut his eyes. \u201cThis is a bad dream. I know it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke with Lillian briefly at the wedding. She said she\u2019s got a very high success rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe, I don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Rafe hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It just feels sort of dicey for some reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have I got to lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, well\u2014\u201d Rafe felt a tug on his wrist. \u201cI\u2019m going to hang up now, Gabe. I want to go back to celebrating my one-month anniversary.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive Hannah my best.
