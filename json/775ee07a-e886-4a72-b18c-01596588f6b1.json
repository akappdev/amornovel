His limbs were twisted at odd angles, making him look like an image created by a mad artist.</p><p>\u201cMarcus!\u201d Olivia Gordon cried his name as she dismounted and swiftly scampered down the rocks to his side. Like an idiot, she hunkered down by him, touching him, speaking, praying that somehow he was still alive as he lay there.</p> <p>But, of course, he wasn\u2019t. She studied his face\u2014weathered, worn, beautiful with character\u2014and silent tears slid down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cMarcus,\u201d she whispered, closing his eyes. Maybe it was the wrong thing to do\u2014maybe the medical examiner needed to see him exactly as he\u2019d been found. But she wasn\u2019t leaving him now and she couldn\u2019t bear to see his eyes open. He\u2019d been staring up at the heavens, she thought. Staring up at the sky above him.</p><p>Ironically, the sky was exceptionally beautiful tonight. It was one of those twilights when the moon rose before the sun set completely, and as the sun continued its fall, sinking lower and lower into the horizon, a soft, opaque glow seemed to settle over the landscape. The hills here, just outside Nashville, Tennessee, appeared to be part of some kind of fairy-tale kingdom. Their rich shades of autumn\u2014the gold, orange and crimson leaves on the trees\u2014highlighted the emerald-green grasses. A slight coolness touched the air, making it clear and comfortable to breathe.</p><p>The sky and the landscape were what Marcus had seen as he died, Olivia reminded herself. It was why Marcus had loved this area so much, this place where he\u2019d been born. Maybe there was something fitting in that, something poetic.</p><p>And yet... No question, Marcus had loved this countryside. He\u2019d known it intimately. For that very reason, it seemed impossible that he\u2019d fallen into this rocky ravine when he\u2019d followed these same paths, on foot or on horseback, almost every day of his life.</p> <p>Olivia heard Shiloh paw the ground. She looked up at her horse; he was obviously sensing her emotions, the change in her energy.</p><p>\u201cEasy, boy, easy,\u201d Olivia said softly. \u201cWe have to wait here.\u201d Fresh tears stung her eyes and cascaded down her cheeks. She wanted to rise up and throw her arms around Shiloh\u2019s neck, feel the warmth of this living creature.</p><p>That, she knew, would be life-affirming.</p><p>Like all the animals at the Horse Farm\u2014the therapy center Marcus Danby had founded and where Olivia worked\u2014Shiloh was a rescue horse. Near starvation, he\u2019d been found in the Florida Redlands. Animal activists from the state had arranged his transport to the Nashville area and there was something about him that had made him special to Olivia from the first time she\u2019d seen him. He\u2019d been a pile of bones, wild and terrified of people; he\u2019d tried, more than once, to run her into a building to get her off his back. While the focus of the Horse Farm was teaching people to trust again\u2014through their relationships with animals\u2014Shiloh was, to Olivia, one of her best success stories.</p><p>Marcus had always told her that what she\u2019d done with Shiloh was impressive, but what she managed with people was equally beautiful.</p><p>\u201cOh, Marcus, what did you do?\u201d she whispered. He\u2019d probably been missing long before any of them realized he was gone, because Marcus kept no set hours, didn\u2019t see patients and came and went as he chose. He\u2019d founded the Horse Farm; it was his passion and his life. But while he loved to make sudden appearances and engage with patients, he did so in his own time and on his own terms. He\u2019d been a wreck of a man himself\u2014bipolar, an addict, homeless and an ex-con\u2014when he\u2019d found a horse on the small farm he\u2019d, for some reason, been left through a family inheritance. Like Shiloh, the animal had been starved and beaten by a cruel master and was terrified. In earning the horse\u2019s trust and love, Marcus had learned to care about himself. He\u2019d told Olivia once that he\u2019d been so afraid something horrible would happen to the horse without him, he\u2019d become determined to live.</p> <p>In saving that horse, Marcus had saved himself. It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t grown up around animals; he had. His father had raised some of the finest racing horses in Tennessee. Maybe because he\u2019d had money as a child, Marcus had known that happiness had nothing to do with wealth. When he inherited the family land, he had no interest in racehorses. He cared about people\u2014damaged people. He\u2019d been miraculously fixed by a horse and he went on to find out how to help others in the same way.</p><p>Olivia adored Marcus.</p><p>Had adored him, she told herself. No, she did adore him. All that he\u2019d been and all that he\u2019d taught her would stay with her forever.</p><p>He\u2019d lived in a small house on the property, about a quarter mile from the stables, and the staff at the Horse Farm only knew he was gone because Sammy, his golden retriever\u2014another rescue animal\u2014had come to the stables, wet, tail between his legs, anxious. He\u2019d been limping because he\u2019d managed to gash his left leg quite badly.</p><p>Aaron Bentley, managing director of the Horse Farm, had tried to believe that Marcus had driven somewhere and Sammy had hurt himself trying to catch up with him.</p><p>But Marcus hadn\u2019t driven anywhere\u2014not on his own, anyway. His old Ford pickup was still in the driveway. And Olivia knew Marcus would\u2019ve died before allowing any harm to come to his beloved Sammy.</p><p>So they\u2019d all become extremely worried. Aaron had called in the local authorities and they\u2019d set up a search; Olivia had the backwoods acreage, while others had been assigned the pond area, the pastures and the adjoining farms, businesses and residences.</p><p>They had now been out searching for hours in their designated areas. She and Aaron, plus the other two therapists from the Horse Farm\u2014Mason Garlano and Mariah Naughton. As well, the stable bosses, Drew Dicksen and Sydney Roux, had joined the search. And so had Deputy Sheriff Vine and his partner, Jimmy Callahan. Only Sandra Cheever\u2014known as Mama Cheever\u2014the house manager for the offices, had remained behind. There were miles of pastureland and forest out there\u2014enough to keep them riding and searching for many more hours. But dusk seemed to be coming on fast.</p> <p>Twilight. Twilight in these hills.</p><p>A dangerous time up here\u2014if you didn\u2019t know your way.</p><p>But Marcus hadn\u2019t fallen in the twilight. He\u2019d had his accident, if accident it was, in the brightness of day....</p><p>He was cold now, stone cold. Olivia didn\u2019t have many skills in forensics, but she was certain that he\u2019d been here for some time. He hadn\u2019t fallen in the dusk\u2014a time when a tourist might become disoriented among the rolling hills, forested slopes and rocky dips.</p><p>This time of day frightened many people here. Kids told scary tales over campfires about the Civil War soldiers who continued to haunt the rugged terrain. Marcus had loved the legends; he\u2019d once told her with a wink that the soldiers were his friends. In fact, he\u2019d confided that Brigadier General Rufus Cunningham had been a big help when he\u2019d decided to clean up\u2014but he\u2019d hoped his conversations with the long-dead man might cease once he was off the rum and heroin.</p><p>She was down in a ravine with a dead man who\u2019d been a mentor to her, and it was getting dark. This wasn\u2019t the time to mourn him. Only a few minutes had ticked by since she\u2019d found him. There was no point in wishing him alive. Death was unmistakable.</p><p>She dug into her pocket for her cell phone, praying it would work. Satellite communication here wasn\u2019t always the best.</p><p>But she called Aaron and he answered on the second ring. She got the words out, hard as they were, and told him she\u2019d found Marcus, explaining that he appeared to have fallen.</p><p>\u201cCPR. Do artificial respiration,\u201d Aaron said urgently.</p><p>Olivia looked at Marcus. She had truly loved the man.</p><p>He was dead. He was cold; he was gone.</p><p>There was no way she was attempting artificial respiration.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead, Aaron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be sure!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaron, I\u2019m sure. I am not trying artificial respiration. Get the officers to this location. Please.\u201d</p><p>She hung up. And then she waited.</p><p>Full darkness was coming, and coming soon. She felt that she had to keep her hand on Marcus\u2019s shoulder, that she had to be there with him. She hated that he\u2019d been alone when he died.</p><p>She hated that she was alone now and that the last mauve of twilight was turning to gray and would soon become black.</p><p>She always rode with a flashlight, but it was at the top of the ravine in the bag she\u2019d attached to her saddle.</p><p>She looked up as Shiloh whinnied. The horse pranced nervously.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you leave me, boy!\u201d she called to him. \u201cIt\u2019s all right\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off in midsentence.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t actually grown up here\u2014not right here, about twenty miles west of Nashville off I-40\u2014but she\u2019d grown up in the city. She\u2019d often come out to her uncle\u2019s small ranch during her lifetime. She knew the legends of the area.</p><p>Many times, on foggy nights, she\u2019d imagined that she\u2019d seen them and seen him. In the mists that covered the hills, she\u2019d seen the Rebel soldiers, cast from Nashville in 1862, trying to fight their way back, retreating in the darkness of night. She\u2019d imagined the bloodstained battlefields; she\u2019d heard the cries of wounded and dying soldiers.</p><p>She\u2019d imagined seeing Brigadier General Rufus Cunningham, tall and straight and ever sorrowful at the death toll of the war as he watched his threadbare and beaten men ride by.</p><p>But she\u2019d never seen him so damned clearly.</p><p>There, just above her, his white warhorse, Loki, stood feet from her own nervous Shiloh. The general stared down at her with sorrow and concern. He looked around as if he\u2019d appointed himself her guardian.</p><p>For a moment, she almost felt there was something malignant nearby, some evil that crept toward her in the night.... Was that why the general was there? To protect her?</p><p>Then she felt as if a cold wind settled near her. She felt something...like a touch on her shoulder.</p><p>She turned.</p><p>There was Marcus Danby. Watching her.</p><p>She blinked; she looked down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marcus was dead on the ground before her.</p><p>Ghosts.</p><p>Her family was known for eccentricity, for seeing things, for knowing when it was going to rain, for a sense of foreboding when there was danger.</p> <p>Her family!</p><p>Not her!</p><p>And she was looking up at a Civil War general and turning to see that the dead man before her was touching her shoulder from behind....</p><p>She\u2019d never thought of herself as a coward.</p><p>But she was!</p> <p>\u201cLiv,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cLiv...I\u2019m dead. Help me. I didn\u2019t slide back into drugs\u2014I didn\u2019t! And it wasn\u2019t an accident. I was killed, Liv. It was murder. Help me!\u201d</p><p>A strangled-sounding scream escaped her lips; she heard that much.</p><p>Then she keeled over on top of Marcus Danby\u2019s body in a dead faint.</p><p>1</p><p>The meeting Dustin Blake had been asked to attend was being held at the General Bixby Tavern, just off the I-95 South exit in northern Virginia.</p><p>Dustin knew it well. He\u2019d often stopped there when he was a kid and his parents had taken him to D.C.\u2014a place they\u2019d both loved. Being historians, they would have lived at the Smithsonian if they could. At the time, he\u2019d thought that the tavern\u2019s owners had hired an actor to portray General Bixby. Bixby had been kind to him and full of information.</p> <p>Dustin remembered being humiliated and hurt, as only a kid could be, when he\u2019d discovered that there was no actor and his parents were concerned about his invention of imaginary friends. Then, of course, he\u2019d disturbed them both by knowing things only the general\u2014or a much older person, and an expert on the Civil War\u2014would know.</p><p>That had led to a number of sessions with a psychiatrist.</p><p>Dustin had then made the sage decision to agree that General Bixby was an imaginary friend. That had brought about deep thought on the part of his parents\u2014and it had also brought about his sister. His extremely academic parents had worried that an only child might be given to such flights of fancy because he was lonely. So they\u2019d set forth to add to their family.</p><p>That was all right. He loved his sister.</p><p>He pulled off the interstate and took an exit that led nowhere except Old Tavern Road. Soon he pulled his black SUV into the lot at the tavern and parked. For a moment, he sat and stared at the building.</p><p>What was now the General Bixby Tavern had actually been built during the American Revolution and been called the Wayfarer\u2019s Inn. During the Civil War, it had been renamed for the gallant Union general\u2014the kind \u201cimaginary friend\u201d who had, while he was alive, braved heavy artillery to save both Union and Confederate soldiers. This was when a fire had broken out in the nearby forest. While many a leader might have sat atop his horse far from the carnage, Bixby had ridden right into the inferno. Wounded after dragging at least twenty injured men from the disaster, he\u2019d been brought to the tavern where he\u2019d died, pleading that the nation settle its differences and find peace.</p><p>He really was a fine old gentleman. Dustin knew that well.</p><p>He exited the car and headed up the old wooden steps to the broad porch that wrapped around the tavern. This many years later, the tavern was still basically in the wilderness\u2014the closest town being Fredericksburg. Winter was approaching and there was a little coolness in the air, heightened by the thickness of the woods around them. Only its historic importance, and the plethora of \u201cghost hunters,\u201d kept it from falling into ruin.</p> <p>When Dustin stepped inside the dim tavern, he blinked at the change of light. He wondered instantly if the meeting had been planned so he\u2019d have a few seconds of disorientation\u2014a time during which he might be observed and not observe in return.</p><p>As his eyes adjusted, he saw General Bixby seated at the bar. The general nodded gravely at Dustin, indicating a group across the room.</p><p>Dustin nodded in return, then moved toward the others. He saw David Caswell stand; he\u2019d been sitting at a corner booth. Caswell wasn\u2019t alone. There were two other men with him. One was dark-haired with Native American ancestry apparent in a strong face. The other was light-skinned and light-haired. When they, too, stood to meet him, he saw that they were both tall and fit. And both were wearing casual suits. Not the usual feds\u2014if that was what they were.</p><p>\u201cDustin!\u201d David Caswell said. The pleasure of his greeting seemed sincere.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you,\u201d Dustin greeted David, shaking his hand. He glanced at the other two men and waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to meet Jackson Crow and Malachi Gordon,\u201d David turned. \u201cJackson, Malachi, Special Agent Dustin Blake. When I first started with the police force in Savannah, Dustin and I were partners. He\u2019s the best\u2014and rare in his abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>The men took their seats again. They studied him, and he returned their stare.</p><p>So the dark-haired man was the famous\u2014or infamous\u2014Jackson Crow.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like being with the feds, Mr. Blake?\u201d Crow asked him.</p><p>\u201cHow do I like it? Just fine,\u201d Dustin said. And it was fine. He wasn\u2019t sure what he felt about being there today, however. There\u2019d been a time when he\u2019d wanted nothing more than to be assigned to one of Crow\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d units. Now...he wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>In all honesty\u2014and he didn\u2019t know if it was simply self-assurance or something less commendable\u2014he\u2019d expected to receive a good assignment when he\u2019d graduated from the academy. Whatever that might be. And he\u2019d gotten a good assignment. He worked with a group of four consultants sent on diverse cases when violent crime crossed state lines.</p><p>\u201cYou enjoy working with your team?\u201d Crow asked. Was it just a polite question?</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. My coworkers are good, savvy, personable and experienced. I work with one guy, Grant Shelby, who\u2019s six foot seven, nearly three hundred pounds of lean, mean muscle, with almost computer-powered intelligence. He\u2019s pretty good to have around in a hostile situation. And Cindy Greenstreet had the highest test scores in the past decade. I also work with Jerry Gunter\u2014you might have heard the name. He used to be a mixed-martial-arts champ before entering the academy. He\u2019s pretty good to have around in a pinch, as well. If you\u2019ve called me here, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read up on me, so you know that when I joined the bureau, I didn\u2019t start out as a kid but came in with a lot of experience, both in combat and law enforcement.\u201d</p><p>Crow nodded and Dustin realized that he\u2019d known all this. Dustin\u2019s FBI unit was smart and tough\u2014they\u2019d been put together to get in and get the job done.</p><p>\u201cGood assignment,\u201d Crow said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d As he\u2019d told them, Dustin hadn\u2019t come into the academy as a fresh-faced twenty-something grad. Before he\u2019d gone to college, he\u2019d participated as a witness in a case involving a duo of oddly matched serial killers. From there, he\u2019d gone into the military, and after the marines he\u2019d gone into police work. He hadn\u2019t exactly entered the department immediately; there\u2019d been a year when he\u2019d been in total denial about himself and his \u201cunusual\u201d abilities\u2014and about the heinous things men seemed willing to do to their fellows. He\u2019d more or less walked into the wilderness. Actually, it hadn\u2019t been that dramatic. He\u2019d taken a job as a forest ranger in the Everglades\u2014except that he\u2019d been led to bodies in giant oilcans and he\u2019d realized it was time to move his efforts in the best possible direction. There were certain things a man couldn\u2019t escape\u2014and his own nature was one of them.</p><p>So he\u2019d decided to apply to the academy.</p><p>\u201cYou know all about me,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cWhy are we meeting?\u201d</p><p>David looked at Jackson Crow and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about the Krewes?\u201d This time, it was Malachi Gordon who spoke. Dustin knew his name; he was a recent graduate of the academy. He\u2019d come into the bureau after working a case in Savannah.</p><p>Dustin leaned back. \u201cI\u2019ve read about what happened in Savannah,\u201d he told Malachi. \u201cYou know I worked with David so, of course, the beautiful city of Savannah is near and dear to my heart. In fact, I was somewhat surprised that my unit wasn\u2019t assigned to that case, but apparently, things were already being taken care of. And, to the best of my knowledge, that case has been cleared, the paperwork wrapped up and the feds are long gone from Savannah. Having worked there, I thought I might be of some help, but...\u201d</p><p>He paused and grinned sheepishly at David. \u201cIt seems like you all did just fine without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you would\u2019ve been an asset,\u201d Malachi murmured.</p><p>Dustin looked curiously at the other man. \u201cThanks, but as I said\u2014seems like you had it covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was then\u2014and we did have it covered. However, although the Krewes are growing, there are never enough of us, and we\u2019re always looking for the right people,\u201d Crow told him. \u201cWould you be interested in seeing how you work out with one of our units?\u201d</p><p>Dustin smiled. That was straightforward. \u201cI initially asked about applying to one of your units. They told me there was no application process. You formed your own units.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Crow said. \u201cAnd I wish I\u2019d known about you earlier. David was talking to Malachi about you, and then Malachi talked to me. So, yes, I looked you up and pulled strings to get all the information I could on you. Thus far, each recruit has worked out. We\u2019re...careful in the people we approach. We have to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you all have special talents, I take it?\u201d Dustin asked. \u201cAnd, of course, because all the other agents like to call the units ghost hunters and rib you all about it. But really, they\u2019re all envious of your record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetective Caswell has told us that working with you was like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike working with me,\u201d Malachi Gordon cut in. \u201cDavid and I were together in New Orleans,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cAre you a candidate, Mr. Blake?\u201d Crow asked him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dustin lowered his head, hiding a smile. He looked back at Crow. \u201cWell, let me put it this way\u2014if you haven\u2019t met him yet, I\u2019d be glad to introduce you to General Bixby. He\u2019s sitting at the bar right now, next to the man in the jeans and Alice Cooper T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>That brought a grin to Crow\u2019s face. Dustin hadn\u2019t been sure the man was really capable of a smile.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t met formally, no, but we\u2019ve been aware of his presence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I was being tested or not.\u201d Dustin leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table as he looked at Jackson Crow, then Dustin and finally the third man, Malachi Gordon.</p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>It was Gordon who answered him. \u201cYou\u2019re from Nashville,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dustin thought quickly. He was privy to law-enforcement reports daily. He hadn\u2019t heard anything about a kidnapping or murder in the city of Nashville.</p><p>\u201cI am from Nashville,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been gone for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou go back often enough, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He did, except that he hadn\u2019t been there in a while. His academic parents were living in London. His little sister, Rayna, had grown up to be a country music singer. But she\u2019d been on tour for the past year. He\u2019d caught up with her\u2014and his folks\u2014for a few days in London earlier in the summer.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I haven\u2019t been back in about a year,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not too long,\u201d David said. \u201cHave you ever heard of a man named Marcus Danby?\u201d Malachi Gordon asked him.</p><p>\u201cMarcus Danby.\u201d Dustin repeated slowly. The name was familiar. \u201cOf course. Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cHe founded a therapy center. He brings in clients\u2014patients\u2014to work with horses. Or dogs, sometimes. He was the black sheep of a very elite family, wound up addicted to everything known to man. He did time, but he was the last living member of his family and inherited property. He also changed his ways. The Horse Farm is extremely well-respected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanby is dead,\u201d Gordon said abruptly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. How did he die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFell into a ravine,\u201d Gordon told him. \u201cHe was buried two days ago but the autopsy report was just released. He had drugs in his system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pity. The man must\u2019ve been clean for at least twenty years,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cWhat does this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people close to him don\u2019t believe what they\u2019re hearing. We\u2019d like you to investigate,\u201d Jackson Crow broke in.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe it was a fall\u2014or you don\u2019t believe he was on drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d Malachi replied.</p><p>\u201cAre the police suspicious?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Crow shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t really understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Blake, we often find ourselves slipping in when local law enforcement doesn\u2019t see an immediate problem,\u201d Crow said.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Malachi Gordon told him, \u201cWe\u2019d like you to go in as a patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a patient. You want me to go in as a patient and investigate an accident brought on by substance abuse when no one believes it might have been anything other than it appeared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have more than a suspicion that he was murdered,\u201d Malachi said bluntly.</p><p>Dustin stared at him. \u201cHow? Why? I\u2019m in the bureau. I know how it works. We\u2019re usually called in when there\u2019s a suspicion that a serial killer is at large or when a killer is crossing state lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Blake,\u201d Jackson Crow began. \u201cWe move in on cases when we\u2019re afraid the truth may never be known because of unusual circumstances. We don\u2019t go barging in as a unit. We send one or two people and they assess the situation for us.\u201d</p><p>Dustin was surprised and, he had to admit, disappointed. This didn\u2019t sound like a case that was worthy of the Krewe.</p><p>The units had handled many truly unique cases. The sad demise of a man, even a black sheep who\u2019d changed his own life and created a lifesaving enterprise\u2014just didn\u2019t sound like the kind of puzzle that desperately needed to be solved.</p><p>He shook his head, baffled. \u201cI need more than you\u2019re giving me. Yes, I\u2019m interested in working with a unit. As you\u2019re well aware, a man can grow weary of finding excuses for knowing what he shouldn\u2019t because he\u2019s managed to have a conversation with someone who\u2019s dead. And can I go in easily? Yes. The Horse Farm is about twenty miles outside the city, but I\u2019d have to go in as myself because I do have friends in the area. But, God knows, that could be easy. Enough people in law enforcement crack\u2014that\u2019s a plausible reason. But I don\u2019t understand how this even came to your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin called me, Blake,\u201d Malachi Gordon said. \u201cShe works at the Horse Farm and she\u2019s convinced that Marcus Danby was murdered.\u201d</p><p>Great. Someone\u2019s relative was upset.</p><p>Still...</p><p>It was an invitation to get a foot in the door with Jackson Crow and one of his Krewe units.</p><p>But if he was stepping in just because someone\u2019s relative couldn\u2019t accept the harsh fact that even the strongest person sometimes failed...</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t bode so well.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked Malachi. \u201cWhy is your cousin convinced that Marcus Danby met with foul play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Special Agent Blake, Marcus Danby told her that he was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get this horse-assisted therapy,\u201d Joey Walters told Olivia as they walked around inside the pasture. \u201cUnless,\u201d he said, flashing her a belligerent glance, \u201cit\u2019s because our\u2014\u201d He hesitated a minute. She knew the word folks had been on his tongue. But he didn\u2019t have folks anymore. \u201c\u2014our guardians think we\u2019re as stupid as horses and that they\u2019ll somehow fix us? The dumb leading the dumber?\u201d</p><p>Olivia lowered her head, smiling, before she looked back at Joey. \u201cWhatever makes you think horses are stupid?\u201d she asked. She was glad to be working. They\u2019d all taken a few days off for Marcus\u2019s funeral, but now they were back.</p><p>And she was especially glad to be working because her mind kept racing in denial regarding the autopsy reports.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not smart\u2014they\u2019ll eat themselves to death if you let them,\u201d Joey muttered.</p><p>\u201cHorses have no hidden agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have their boundaries, just as we have ours. And for your information, Mr. Walters, horse therapy works well for those who tend to intellectualize everything. You can\u2019t bully a horse. A horse can learn to trust you, but he or she requires you to be trustworthy, as well.\u201d</p><p>As if to emphasize her words, Trickster, the twenty-year-old mare she was using with Joey that afternoon, nudged him in the back.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Joey said. But he turned and looked at Trickster. The mare snorted and shook her head, looking back at Joey.</p><p>It was a simple exchange\u2014very simple. But Olivia saw something in Joey\u2019s expression and the smile that touched his face. He might be telling her it was all a bunch of bull, but he already cared about Trickster and it was only their second time out.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t paying attention to her,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cYou brought her out here and then paid no attention to her. She wants to be noticed. She wants you to remember that you came to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, you brought her out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you brushed her and talked to her and started walking with her. She wants your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou taught me that we learn about our boundaries through horses, as well. Most of the time, a horse will want to be in control. Isn\u2019t that what you said? Not to let the horse push you around. She just shoved me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething else to learn, Joey,\u201d Olivia told him. \u201cTrickster does care about you. She nudged you to get some affection back. You can maintain control\u2014and give her affection. Life is like that, Joey. You can love people\u2014but you can maintain your own thoughts and opinions, as well.\u201d</p><p>Joey\u2019s smile deepened. He stroked the horse\u2019s cream-colored neck, and Trickster clearly enjoyed his touch.</p><p>But then Joey stepped away. \u201cI\u2019ll get attached to her\u2014and then have to leave her, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be alone again, like after my parents died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents would never have left you on purpose, Joey. And Trickster won\u2019t leave. You\u2019ll move on, but you can always come back and see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody leaves,\u201d he said sharply.</p><p>Joey had been sent to the Horse Farm because his parents were both killed in an automobile accident. At first, he\u2019d been quiet, grieving, uncommunicative, his uncle had told them. Then he\u2019d begun acting out. An athlete, he\u2019d never been into drinking or drugs.</p><p>That had changed.</p><p>After his uncle had picked him up at a police station in Sarasota, their hometown, he\u2019d begun to look for help. Joey was enrolled at Parsonage House about ten miles from the Horse Farm. The facility offered horse therapy to their \u201cstudents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoey, I\u2019m sorry about your parents. It was tragic and unjust. But like I said, you have to realize that they didn\u2019t desert you, they loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Life isn\u2019t fair,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWe learn to cope with it the best we can.\u201d She paused and walked over to stroke Trickster\u2019s forelock. \u201cLook at Trickster, for example. She was a racehorse once upon a time, Joey. She was destined for greatness. Then a jockey whipped her into frenzy and she broke a leg\u2014and she was worthless to the man who owned her. Instead of being grateful for the races she\u2019d won and the money she\u2019d made for him, his owner planned on having her euthanized. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her voice broke, which surprised her. She believed she\u2019d accepted that Marcus was dead. She hadn\u2019t \u201cseen\u201d him since his death, and she and the rest of the employees at the Horse Farm were moving forward with the work Marcus had deemed so important. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut?\u201d Joey asked, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cBut Marcus heard about Trickster, and he bought her\u2014offering her owner more money than the glue factory. He brought her out here, cared for her, and now she\u2019s beautiful, as you can see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were going to make glue out of her?\u201d Joey demanded, horrified.</p> <p>\u201cWhat matters is that she\u2019s here now. And she knows we love her. It took a while, because she was just thrown out in a pasture and allowed to starve, living in constant pain, before Marcus rescued her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Marcus didn\u2019t stay with her,\u201d Joey pointed out.</p><p>\u201cMarcus died, Joey. But he left her in the care of people who would continue to love her.\u201d</p><p>Joey took a deep breath and ripped out a strand of grass to chew on. He looked across the landscape and said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have made life so miserable for my uncle, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was only miserable because he loves you. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s miserable anymore because he knows you really do want to live a productive life. You just need to come to terms with what happened.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. At sixteen, he was a tall boy, a good-looking kid in great physical condition. He turned to her with one of his rakish smiles. \u201cYou like me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I like you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>His grin broadened. \u201cI like you, too. But how I know you like me is that you\u2019ve forgotten the time.\u201d</p><p>Olivia glanced quickly at her watch. His hour was up; it had been for the past ten minutes. He\u2019d been a tough case to crack and she\u2019d felt deeply for him. \u201cDon\u2019t get ideas, kid,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m your therapist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re cute, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Now let\u2019s head back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can come and see Trickster when I\u2019m older. Old enough to be a lot cooler in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoey! Cut it out. You\u2019re just saying that to get a reaction out of me and you\u2019re not going to. I\u2019m your therapist. And you\u2019re never going to be older than I am and we\u2019re never going to date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That life-not-being-fair thing is harsh!\u201d he said. But he was still grinning. Then his grin faded. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about Marcus, you know. There\u2019s a rumor that he went back on drugs. That they found heroin in his system when they did the autopsy.\u201d</p><p>Olivia felt her back stiffen. \u201cMarcus wasn\u2019t doing drugs,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s a lie?\u201d</p><p>She winced. It wasn\u2019t a lie. But it was something that, so far, wasn\u2019t common knowledge, even though the medical examiner had informed the staff at the Horse Farm. She\u2019d assumed that unless an investigative reporter actually looked into Marcus\u2019s death, no one would know it was true. And yet, rumors were obviously running rampant.</p><p>\u201cI heard there were drugs in his system,\u201d Joey said again.</p><p>\u201cI knew Marcus, Joey. If there were drugs in his system, they weren\u2019t there because he voluntarily took them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think he was tricked?\u201d Joey asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. The plot thickens!\u201d Joey said excitedly. \u201cWhat if...wow. What if someone did drug him because they wanted him to die? Or what if he was pushed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoey, you\u2019re talking about someone who meant a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, Liv, really.\u201d Joey spoke with sincerity and she believed him. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...well, we don\u2019t have radios or TVs or the internet where I\u2019m living right now. I\u2019m embarrassed. I heard about this, and it was more interesting to think about that than...well, my own recovery, I guess,\u201d he finished lamely.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not angry with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary, though, huh? I mean, this place is here for therapy. Supposedly, working with animals saved Marcus Danby\u2019s life. If he wound up going back on drugs...well, it doesn\u2019t say much for therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Olivia agreed.</p><p>She looked toward the pastures at the Horse Farm. She hadn\u2019t seen Marcus again\u2014or rather, hadn\u2019t seen his ghost. Had she imagined that she\u2019d seen him? Did they\u2014she and her cousin, Malachi\u2014share a real gift? Or did they just imagine things, see them in their minds?</p><p>Uncertain, and unhappy with the official explanation, she\u2019d called Malachi. But the results of the autopsy had just arrived that morning. She needed to call him again. He\u2019d promised her he\u2019d try to arrange an investigation, but explained that he had to tread carefully; he couldn\u2019t come in officially unless invited. And because people knew he was her cousin, his arrival might give the appearance that the feds were intruding\u2014or that she and the Horse Farm were receiving special treatment. But he\u2019d said he\u2019d figure something out.</p><p>Apparently, there was a government agent coming in as a client. A \u201cburnout,\u201d someone had called him. Was he Malachi\u2019s answer to her request?</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d Joey said.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d She tried to smile, realizing she\u2019d been deep in thought and that he\u2019d been watching her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry. I think this place is wonderful,\u201d Joey told her earnestly.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Joey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou all might have saved my life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt works if you work it. You\u2019re worth it, so work it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded. She really did like the kid. Especially when he realized, as he occasionally did, that he was a kid.</p><p>\u201cTell Trickster we\u2019re going in,\u201d Olivia instructed him.</p><p>Joey turned and stroked the horse\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou are beautiful, Trickster,\u201d he whispered, then gazed up at Olivia. \u201cDo I get to ride?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNext session,\u201d she said. \u201cAs you reminded me, we\u2019re already over our hour. But next time, we\u2019ll definitely ride.\u201d</p><p>They returned to the Horse Farm. She watched as Joey brushed Trickster, brought her to her stall and fed her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the heart to go and wave goodbye to the others who were leaving.</p><p>In fact, she didn\u2019t even go back to the office. Aaron and the rest of the staff would be worrying, trying to figure out how to handle it if the news got out about Marcus\u2019s autopsy. It was probably too late if a kid like Joey had already heard. Next step would be deciding how they were going to spin the information about his death.</p><p>When Joey left with his group, she quickly checked on the horses. She was the only one in the stables and assumed everyone else had either gone into the office for further anxious discussions\u2014or hurried home. She headed straight to her car and left, driving the 4.5 miles to the little ranch house she\u2019d visited so many times as a child. She\u2019d purchased the place from her uncle once she\u2019d accepted the job at the Horse Farm.</p><p>Her home was old, dating from the 1830s. She loved the house, always had. A huge fireplace took up most of the parlor, the ladies\u2019 sitting room had been turned into a handsome kitchen with shiny new appliances and off the hallway was a computer/game/what-have-you room. There were two bedrooms upstairs, along with a sitting room, modern additions when they were built on in the late 1850s. They were all comfortable and charming. Her uncle told her that the house had always been in their family; a cousin, son, daughter, niece or nephew had taken it over every time. He\u2019d given her a great price and held the mortgage himself. She\u2019d paid it off last year on her twenty-sixth birthday.</p><p>As she stood at the door, she heard Sammy whining.</p><p>The dog could have stayed at the Horse Farm; God knew, there were enough rescue pets there! But Sammy had belonged to Marcus, and his leg was just beginning to heal. No one had objected when Olivia had said she was bringing him home.</p><p>She opened the door and there he was, tail wagging as he greeted her. Olivia didn\u2019t have to bend far to greet him in return. Sammy was a big old dog who appeared to be a mix of many breeds. He had the coat of a golden retriever, the head of rottweiler and paws that might have belonged to a wolf. He had one blue eye and one half blue, half brown\u2014it was a freckle on the eye, she\u2019d been told.</p><p>He gazed up at her expectantly and sat back on his haunches. His hope and simple trust just about broke her heart. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming back, Sammy. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Sammy barked in response. She wondered just what dogs did and didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Olivia threw her keys on the buffet at the entrance and walked to the kitchen to give Sammy a treat. As he gobbled up the \u201ctasty niblet of beef and pork,\u201d she promised him that she\u2019d be back downstairs in a minute. He couldn\u2019t go running out into the yard because he was still recovering from the gash on his hind leg.</p><p>She dashed upstairs, stripping as she went. She breezed through her bedroom to the bath and stepped into the shower, adjusting the water temperature until it was as hot as it could get. She stood there, feeling it rush over her, for a long time.</p><p>She wished she could turn off her mind.</p><p>Leaning against the tile, she wondered about Marcus. \u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d she whispered aloud.</p><p>It was easy to believe that an addict had fallen back into drugs. It happened. Some relapsed and returned to therapy or recovered through their own determination and resolve.</p><p>But not Marcus! Marcus couldn\u2019t have relapsed.</p><p>She began to feel saturated by the heat and decided she was about to wrinkle for life. Turning the faucet off, she stepped out of the shower and reached for a towel, drying herself before slipping into her terry robe. Hurrying downstairs, she went back to the kitchen, ready to make a cup of tea. Rounding the stairs, she noticed that Sammy was quiet, just sitting there, staring at the front door.</p><p>\u201cAt last!\u201d</p><p>Stunned and terrified, her heart pounding, she whirled toward the door. Her hand flew to her throat as she desperately wondered what weapon she might grab to defend herself.</p><p>But no one had come to attack her.</p><p>The speaker was Marcus Danby.</p><p>Or the ghost of Marcus Danby.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, woman! What were you doing up there? I mean, just how clean can someone be?\u201d Marcus demanded. He moved toward her as he spoke. \u201cOh, come on! You saw me before. You see me quite well right now, just like you\u2019ve always been able to see General Cunningham and Loki. You think I didn\u2019t know? Of course I do! You\u2019re like a ghost magnet, my dear girl. Close your mouth\u2014your lower jaw\u2019s going to fall off. Please, Olivia,\u201d he said in a gentler voice. \u201cI need your help. The Horse Farm needs your help.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>2</p><p>Stepping off the plane and entering Nashville International Airport, Dustin heard the twangs and strains of a country music song. The sound made him smile. God, he loved Nashville. The city was unique in its mix of the up-and-coming and pride in its history. Music reigned supreme but without self-consciousness; it was ever-present like the air one breathed. People tended to be cordial. And, hell, what was not to like about an airport that had a coffee stand and the welcoming sound of good music the minute he arrived?</p><p>He paused for a minute, listening, feeling the buzz of activity around him. In the past decade he\u2019d lived in a number of different places but there was nothing like Nashville and nothing like coming home.</p> <p>He picked up the paperwork for his rental car, then walked out of the airport and over to the multistoried garage to pick up the SUV he\u2019d rented. A few minutes later, he was following the signs for I-40. Soon he was headed off the highway to a Tennessee state road, passing ranches, acreages with herds of grazing cows and pastures where horses kicked up their heels and ran or nibbled at the blue-green grass.</p><p>A little while later, he was on the dirt path that led to Willis House\u2014the \u201cretreat\u201d where he had reservations. Willis House catered to those attending therapy at the Horse Farm and other nearby facilities. It wasn\u2019t a specialized facility, but advertisements for the inn stated that it was a \u201cclean\u201d environment in the \u201cexquisite and serene\u201d Tennessee hills. People didn\u2019t just come here because it was a \u201cclean-living facility,\u201d though. They also chose it because the area was so beautiful, or because they were visiting family or friends who were in therapy nearby.</p><p>The gravel drive was huge; there was certainly no problem with parking out here. He slid between a big truck and a small one and noted that the other cars in the lot included a nice new Jag, a Volvo, a BMW and a sad-looking twenty-year-old van.</p><p>Willis House was...a house. There was a broad porch with rockers, and he noted an old-timer sitting in one of them, staring as he approached.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Dustin said. The man wore denim overalls and a plaid flannel shirt. His face showed deep grooves of a life gone past.</p> <p>The man nodded to him. \u201cYou the cop?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAgent, now,\u201d Dustin replied. He shifted his bag onto his shoulder and came forward to shake the old man\u2019s hand. \u201cDustin Blake, sir. How do you do?\u201d</p><p>The man took his hand in a surprisingly strong grip. \u201cJeremy Myers\u2014but they call me Coot. Welcome. You don\u2019t look like someone who needs much help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all need help,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>That brought a slight smile to Coot\u2019s lips. \u201cBurned out on the job? Or did you go wacko and beat up on some piece of scum that deserved it? Young man, that\u2019s the thing today. No respect. Kids spit in teachers\u2019 faces and the poor teachers can\u2019t do a thing\u2014less\u2019n it gets called child abuse. So, you did your job too well?\u201d</p><p>Dustin grinned. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo need to explain to me. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to talk. Hell, all people \u2019round here want you to do is talk. Don\u2019t let me keep you, though. That bag must be heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Coot,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cJust open the door and go on in. The main house is open until sunset, and after that you\u2019ll need your key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Dustin went in. It might have been any bed-and-breakfast in any rural section of the South. The entry led to a bright, cheerful parlor with the check-in desk being a bar, behind which was an equally bright and cheerful kitchen. He walked up and the young woman at the desk smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Agent Blake,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Ellie Villiers. And you\u2019re wondering how I knew who you are. Well, we don\u2019t take in that many guests and we don\u2019t take anyone without a reservation,\u201d she explained. She was on a wheeled chair and she swung down to the end of the bar, where she plucked a set of keys off the wall. \u201cWe have you in the Andrew Jackson suite.\u201d She was a gamine of a young woman, tiny with short dark hair and a perky manner. She gave him a warm smile as she rolled back to him and leaned close. \u201cIt\u2019s not much of a suite, really. It\u2019s just a big room\u2014a ballroom in the old days. But it has the only private bath in the house and a door to the back porch. We\u2019re careful who we give it to. Not that we have strict rules or regulations, but we do cater to those fighting their own demons, whether they come from a booze bottle, a pill bottle, stress, what have you.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cYou sound pretty cool. I heard that the bosses at the bureau think you need some downtime, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking about me, huh?\u201d he teased.</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cThis is rural Tennessee, Agent Blake. All we\u2019ve got to do around here is talk. Oh, that\u2019s not really true. There\u2019s a gorgeous stream and cliffs and historic trails. You\u2019ll love it out here. But wait\u2014you\u2019re from Nashville, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorn in the heart of the city,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWell, then you kind of know the area? I mean, you must have driven out of the city now and then. Of course, some people just get on the highway and keep going. They miss out on all this beauty, and so close to the city, too. Sad, although I guess that\u2019s just the way life is.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her philosophy. \u201cSad, but true. And my first name is Dustin, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, thanks, Dustin. So the one key opens the main door in front. We try to remember to lock it at sunset. The other is to your room, which is just down the hall and to the left. There\u2019s a continental breakfast every morning from six to nine. It\u2019s right behind me in the dining room. If you need anything, give me a holler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, and thank you, Ellie.\u201d He started to turn away, but then paused. \u201cHey, are there any hack ranches around here?\u201d</p><p>She seemed surprised by the question. \u201cWhy would you want to go to a hack ranch when you\u2019re going to the Horse Farm? They don\u2019t do trail rides, but you\u2019ll be working with horses, so\u2014 None of my business! Sorry, the question just surprised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to come to this area when I was a kid. My folks are historians, so we did the Civil War trails around here, national parks, all that. In fact, we often did them on horseback, and I love to ride. I was just wondering...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a place\u2014Hooper Ridge Stables. Just go back on that road and down a ways. You\u2019ll see a sign. There\u2019s not much else out here besides private property, the old chapel that\u2019s just outside the national park and...and a few therapy centers and lots and lots of cows. But it\u2019s too late tonight because they don\u2019t rent after five. When you want it, though, it\u2019s there. Still, once you\u2019re been to the Horse Farm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought most of their animals were rescues,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cOh, they are rescues. And if they\u2019re old or hurt, they don\u2019t do much, just get fawned over by the staff and the patients. Clients. Whatever. But when they\u2019re healthy, well, at the Horse Farm they become really healthy and they\u2019re beautifully trained.\u201d She swung the chair closer to the counter. \u201cIn fact, the owner\u2014Marcus Danby\u2014used to go by the local farms, and the owners all knew that if they had a broken-down horse or they brought in a wild one or a kicker, they could sell it to Marcus. Saved a lot of the poor bastards that way. I wonder what\u2019ll happen now that he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d he leave it to? Did Marcus have any family?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes became very wide and she shook her head. \u201cNo. The only reason Marcus inherited the property was the fact that he was the very last member of his family. I mean, when he was a kid\u2014way before I was born\u2014he was a total black sheep. Then he straightened out, and I don\u2019t know if he made peace with his people, but...he was the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who inherits his property?\u201d Dustin asked again.</p><p>Ellie shrugged dramatically. \u201cI guess Aaron. Aaron\u2019s managed the place for him for a long time. He\u2019s a good guy. But who knows if he\u2019ll be as good as Marcus. Although...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have gotten any closer to him, not with the counter between them. But she tried.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor out that he died with drugs in his system,\u201d she said, dropping her voice. \u201cMarcus, I mean, not Aaron. Can you imagine that? Founding a therapy center and then biting the dust because after decades you suddenly decide to shoot up again?\u201d she asked, sounding incredulous. Gossip, he realized, was delicious to Ellie. But then, she probably searched for any excitement out here. He lowered his head and smiled. They weren\u2019t at the ends of the earth. Nashville was only twenty miles away. But he knew that people from the country usually stayed in the country.</p><p>\u201cNo matter how the man died, he apparently did a lot of good before his death,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHe did. He helped so many people....\u201d</p><p>Dustin picked up his keys and finally turned to leave. \u201cThanks, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! If you\u2019re hungry, the caf\u00e9 down the road is open until nine or ten, depending on whether they have people in there. The food\u2019s actually really great. The best corn bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the cheese grits are to die for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother important factor,\u201d he agreed. \u201cThanks for the suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleasure. Make yourself at home. Old Miss Patterson is in one of the bedrooms upstairs and Carolyn Martin\u2019s up there, too, along with Coot\u2014you met him outside?\u201d Dustin nodded. \u201cHe likes to come for the winter. He lives in the hills but he\u2019s a smart old bastard\u2014knows he\u2019s too old to plow snow and manage up there once the cold hits. Oh, I forgot to mention. The living area here is for everyone and there\u2019s a room back of the dining area with games and stuff.\u201d</p><p>With a nod of thanks, he headed over to his room. Setting his bag down, he took out his computer and Wi-Fi connector. There was a lot he wanted to look up, background he hadn\u2019t gotten to yet. But neither had he stopped in the city to eat; it might not be a bad idea to check out the local diner and the clientele\u2014especially since he was hungry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>First, though, he called Olivia Gordon, Malachi\u2019s cousin, to explain who he really was and what he was doing there. She evidently knew that an agent was coming in; she couldn\u2019t have missed that fact, since he was scheduled to start at the Horse Farm the following day.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. He\u2019d try her again in the morning\u2014or maybe he\u2019d just show up. Either way, he didn\u2019t want to leave a message. Messages were recorded, and in his life, recordings could come back to bite you. But he also assumed that Malachi\u2019s cousin was an intelligent young woman. She knew he was coming, so she\u2019d figure it out.</p><p>Examining his room, he discovered that he probably did have the best. His bathroom was nice and large with way more closet space than he needed, and his key worked on the back door, as well. It led to the rear porch area; if he ever needed to, he could exit without being seen.</p> <p>He left his room, carefully locking the door behind him. He did it out of instinct, not because he suspected anyone wanted to go through his belongings. But you never knew.</p><p>He waved to Ellie as he left, and also waved at Coot, still rocking on the front porch, as he walked out to his car.</p><p>The caf\u00e9 was even closer than he\u2019d realized from Ellie\u2019s directions; it was just down the road. It was a true diner, converted from a pair of old connected freight cars. The tables were small but neat and clean, and his waitress, a heavyset woman named Delilah, was warm and friendly. The place was empty when he entered, but as she took his order\u2014the daily special of pot roast, with a side of grits, okra and a serving of corn bread\u2014the door opened and four young men walked in, followed by an older man. The boys were joking; the older man looked weary.</p><p>\u201cThe boys from Parsonage House,\u201d Delilah murmured to him, nodding.</p><p>\u201cParsonage House?\u201d he asked politely.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a center for wayward boys. At least that\u2019s what we used to call them. Addicts\u2014and other kids who\u2019ve gotten into some minor trouble. None of them are hardened criminals. The Parsonage runs a program for them, and they offer all kinds of therapy. Including horse therapy.\u201d She paused, wagging her head. \u201cWe have a famous facility for that, you know.\u201d When he murmured that he\u2019d heard of it, she continued. \u201cThe Parsonage has a good success rate\u2014although some people around here aren\u2019t so fond of having it in the neighborhood. But me, I like the boys. They come in every few nights, after their N.A. meeting at the old chapel,\u201d Delilah told him. \u201cSome of them\u2014well, quite a few of them, actually\u2014make it. Some of them, though, they come back, and they come back\u2014and then we hear they\u2019re up at the state prison or they\u2019ve wrapped themselves around a tree off the highway. Drew, over there, he works for the Horse Farm. This is a sideline for him. Guess he likes the company of people now and then, seeing how most of the time he\u2019s with critters.\u201d</p><p>She walked away to fill his order. He picked up a copy of the free local paper, which was only six pages\u2014mostly ads, a few columns of local news. The restaurant was small, and even if he wasn\u2019t interested in what was going on around him, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to avoid eavesdropping.</p><p>Two of the boys were cutting up, stealing another boy\u2019s baseball cap and tossing it back and forth.</p><p>\u201cStop. Give it back. We\u2019re in a restaurant,\u201d the older man said. He didn\u2019t yell, but he spoke sternly and they listened to him.</p><p>One of them complained teasingly, \u201cHey, Joey had a good day. He was out with Olivia Gordon for half the afternoon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you had your horse therapy session, too,\u201d the older man said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah\u2014but I had Aaron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaron\u2019s great with the horses\u2014and with you kids,\u201d the older man said.</p><p>\u201cJoey\u2019s happy he didn\u2019t get Aaron, right, Joey?\u201d one of the boys joked.</p><p>Dustin could just see Joey. The kid was blushing.</p><p>\u201cJoey\u2019s got a crush on his therapist!\u201d another one teased.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a crush on her\u2014you guys have a crush on her!\u201d Joey protested. \u201cAnd it\u2019s dumb. She thinks we\u2019re all kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are all kids,\u201d the older man said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Drew,\u201d one of the boys said. \u201cDid you ever try to date her?\u201d</p> <p>The older man laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve known Olivia Gordon since she was a kid, and no, Sean, we never dated. She was a Nashville girl, and we met when she came out here to visit her uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? City girls didn\u2019t date country bumpkins?\u201d Joey asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Olivia was never like that,\u201d the man, Drew, said. He was smiling; it was evident that he liked Olivia Gordon, too. \u201cShe\u2019s always been nice to everyone, and she\u2019s very serious about her work. So don\u2019t go making life miserable for her, huh? She\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what?\u201d Joey demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just different,\u201d Drew said. \u201cSpecial. And a really fine therapist, so you all behave like gentlemen when you\u2019re around her, y\u2019hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d one of the boys who\u2019d teased Joey said. \u201cThis whole thing, though... It\u2019s all a little hypocritical, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s talking about old Danby going back on the juice,\u201d another boy said.</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s nothing but a rumor,\u201d Drew said firmly. \u201cCertainly at this point. I\u2019m not even sure how it got started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if the rumor\u2019s real?\u201d Joey asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Drew said. \u201cI knew and worked with Marcus for years. But if he did go back to drugs, well... Hell, that\u2019s not what you want for yourselves. Found dead in a ditch. Anyway, he shouldn\u2019t be remembered for his relapse, if there was one. He should be remembered for everything he did right\u2014for people and animals!\u201d</p><p>Delilah stepped between Dustin\u2019s booth and that of the group. The boys ordered, and when they spoke again, they were subdued. In another few minutes, Delilah brought out Dustin\u2019s order. \u201cEnjoy!\u201d she said. She rolled her eyes toward the boys and Drew at the end of the dining car and hurried back around the counter.</p><p>The food was good, the corn bread as excellent as Ellie had told him it would be. But when he was done eating, Dustin stood and walked over to the group\u2019s table. \u201cHello,\u201d he said. \u201cMy name is Dustin Blake. My apologies, but I heard you speaking about the Horse Farm. My first day there is tomorrow. It sounds like you all think highly of the place.\u201d</p><p>Drew started to rise in greeting but Dustin urged him to keep his seat.</p><p>\u201cThe Horse Farm is a great facility,\u201d Drew responded. \u201cI\u2019m Andrew Dicksen, although I\u2019m known as Drew. I\u2019m one of the stable managers there, and these are a few young men who are working things out up there, too. Joey Walters, Matt Dougal, Sean Modine and Nick Stevens. I take them to their meetings a few nights a week and then we have a bite here\u2014and maybe we\u2019ll see a movie. If they\u2019re polite, that is!\u201d</p><p>The boys shook hands very politely, grinning all the while. They wanted to go to the movie, he was pretty sure. But they were quiet and respectful and they obviously paid heed to Andrew, even without bribery.</p><p>I hope these guys are the ones who make it, Dustin thought.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d Joey said. \u201cThe Horse Farm, I mean. It\u2019s the best of all the things we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really cool when you get to actually ride horses,\u201d Sean added.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool even when you don\u2019t\u2014especially if you get Liv.\u201d Nick made a strangled sound; Dustin realized that Joey had kicked him under the table.</p><p>\u201cI hope I get to hang around long enough to get back there,\u201d Matt said. He was a lanky kid with long hair. He\u2019d spoken last and almost to himself.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you go back?\u201d Dustin asked him.</p><p>Matt flushed uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cYes, why?\u201d Drew echoed. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>Matt looked as if he wished he\u2019d kept his words to himself. \u201cUm, my dad may drag me back home and send me somewhere in Minnesota,\u201d he admitted unhappily. \u201cHe, um, said that if the people running the place couldn\u2019t stay clean, what chance is there for kids like us?\u201d</p><p>This was followed by a brief silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cI heard about the tragic loss of the Horse Farm\u2019s founder.\u201d</p><p>Drew Dicksen nodded. \u201cHe was a good guy. A damned good man,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWhatever anyone says.\u201d He raised his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful place. I hope things work out. I believe they will,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyway, Mr. Blake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an agent. Agent Blake. FBI!\u201d Sean said excitedly. He grimaced as he looked at Dustin. \u201cSorry. I heard Aaron adding your name to the roster. So, we were all talking about you. I mean, it\u2019s pretty exciting. We\u2019re at a place where the feds send their guys!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Dustin murmured. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, did you shoot somebody?\u201d Sean asked. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>Dustin shook his head. \u201cNothing like that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo, why\u2019d they send you?\u201d Nick persisted.</p><p>\u201cThey figure we all need a break now and then. We see too much,\u201d Dustin explained</p><p>\u201cWow, cool. Who have you hunted down?\u201d Matt asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to not think about it for a while,\u201d Dustin told him.</p><p>The door swung open, and a woman of about thirty-five stepped into the coffee shop. She was in jeans and a blue denim shirt\u2014attractive without being beautiful. She smiled at him and then at those sitting at the table. \u201cHi.\u201d She walked straight to Dustin and offered him a hearty handshake. \u201cYou must be Agent Blake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Nice to meet you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMariah Naughton, and the pleasure is mine. Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I must seem so rude. I work at the Horse Farm\u2014I\u2019m one of the therapists. We were notified that you were coming in tonight and that you\u2019d be at the Horse Farm tomorrow morning. I believe Aaron has you going out with a small group first.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs it with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered, \u201csad to say it\u2019s not me. You\u2019ll be going out with Olivia Gordon. Aaron likes to start people out with Liv\u2014and in small groups. She\u2019s our most popular therapist. You\u2019ll see why. Hey, Drew, boys, how are you all doing?\u201d</p><p>Sean laughed softly. \u201cYou\u2019re great, too, Mariah.\u201d</p> <p>Mariah grinned good-naturedly at that. \u201cI\u2019m just not twenty-something and gorgeous, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just fine,\u201d Matt said fervently. \u201cWe all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Matt.\u201d Mariah laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s true that Liv has an exceptional gift with animals, so it\u2019s good for people to learn with her first. Now me, I\u2019m the historian! My family\u2019s been here forever. We\u2019ve lived here since the first frontiersman headed out to this part of Tennessee. In fact, I do tours every second Friday night and I lead these guys and a bunch of others on camping trips. We go out on horseback. I hope you\u2019ll be joining us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will. I\u2019m a history buff, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Mariah asked. \u201cThen you should spend some time with Drew, as well. He\u2019s part of a reenactors\u2019 group,\u201d she said proudly. \u201cThey\u2019ve even done reenactments for movies. They\u2019re really good.\u201d</p> <p>Drew shrugged, looking slightly embarrassed. \u201cI enjoy it. I particularly like the research end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew is great at making history fun,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cMariah does haunted history,\u201d Matt put in. \u201cShe\u2019s got lots of ghost stories to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all sounds good,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you like the idea,\u201d Drew remarked. \u201cBut just to prepare you for tomorrow... With any kind of therapy, you have to be open to it. Although, honestly, half the time people aren\u2019t. And those people don\u2019t do well with the horses. Can\u2019t blame a horse for his reactions and he\u2019s probably not out to get you, right?\u201d he asked, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the horses are way better than sitting there in psych group waiting for someone to talk.\u201d Sean brightened. \u201cI like throwing things at the rock, though. That\u2019s fun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe make paper bombs and throw them at a big rock,\u201d Mariah explained. \u201cHelps let out steam. Throw away anger, resentment, pain...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day. Nice to meet you all and thanks for the information.\u201d Waving, he left the diner. He knew they\u2019d be talking about him the second the door closed behind him.</p><p>Returning to the bed-and-breakfast, he realized he was more curious than ever about what was going on\u2014and he realized, too, that he\u2019d have to be very careful.</p><p>A hell of a lot of talking went on in this area.</p><p>Olivia sat on the couch in her parlor, an untouched cup of tea in her hands, while Marcus Danby was in the chair across from her. He looked as if he were alive. He wasn\u2019t, of course, but he was there\u2014almost in the flesh. He appeared to move, to walk, to talk, to be her friend as he\u2019d been in life.</p><p>Except, of course, that he was upset. With her?</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be so frozen, she told herself. She\u2019d seen ghosts before, met ghosts before! For God\u2019s sake, her cousin, Malachi, lived with a great old fellow, a Revolutionary War ghost.</p><p>And she\u2019d seen the general on the Tennessee hills many times. Some in this area called it a gift, some called it a curse, and some thought those who claimed to have it were flat-out crazy. Therefore, most people learned at an early age to pretend that what was...wasn\u2019t. And when you knew that ghosts could make you appear crazy or even feel like you were crazy, you learned how to cope.</p> <p>Malachi had kept her sane when they were kids. He\u2019d convinced her that it had to be a secret they shared. And, of course, she sometimes had to be wary of the ghosts themselves. They stayed behind for a reason. It was best to know that reason before making friends.</p><p>She remembered one time when they were older, when he\u2019d come out to her college graduation. He\u2019d talked to her once they had some time alone, and she\u2019d smiled because only Malachi had been able to make her laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d she\u2019d told him with mock-seriousness. \u201cThe way to handle ghosts is by not acknowledging the dead. You keep walking as if you\u2019re in a hurry. You step over bodies along the way\u2014ah, I\u2019ve got it. Pretend you\u2019re a stereotypical New Yorker. You march forward with an agenda at all times, walking briskly, and for the love of God, you never make eye contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, some of my best friends are New Yorkers!\u201d Malachi said, laughing.</p><p>Malachi had always had a sense of humor\u2014and he\u2019d always been tough. He\u2019d gone into police work, and now he was with the FBI. She\u2019d called him hysterically after the authorities had come to claim Marcus\u2019s body, and he\u2019d been so helpful. He\u2019d made her understand that the federal government had to be invited in when there wasn\u2019t a major crime that involved perpetrators crossing state lines, a kidnapping or circumstances in which local authorities had requested assistance.</p><p>Never once, however, had he suggested that she was making things up to save the Horse Farm, or that she was overwrought. He\u2019d promised her that he would find a way to help her. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m the right one to come out there at this point. Too many people are aware that I\u2019m your cousin, and it\u2019ll immediately appear as if you\u2019re asking for outside help,\u201d he\u2019d told her. \u201cGood way to piss off the local cops.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t care about appearances. She wished Malachi had come.</p><p>The most bizarre thing was that Marcus Danby\u2014or the ghost of Marcus Danby\u2014was speaking much more easily than she seemed capable of doing at the moment.</p><p>Olivia managed to take a sip of her tea. She stilled her shattered nerves, took a deep breath and spoke to him. \u201cMarcus, there was an autopsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Ugh!\u201d Marcus said, grimacing, a shiver racing visibly through his body. \u201cYes, no one\u2019s fault\u2014accidental death and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd drugs were found in your system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it, Liv. I swore, so many years ago, that I\u2019d never touch drugs again as long as I lived. I wasn\u2019t tempted. I didn\u2019t hit what they call a trigger situation. I was a happy man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, here was my day. I got up, had my coffee. Came by the Horse Farm. I love this time of year\u2014not cold yet, not hot like summer. Sammy was playful. I was going to go for a ride and then I decided on a walk so I could take him along. Suddenly, not far from the ravine, Sammy starts wagging his tail, then barking like crazy. He raced off toward the grove of trees west of the ravine and he didn\u2019t come back. So I called out to him and followed him, and the next thing I knew I was on the ground. I didn\u2019t feel pain. I was just...on the ground.\u201d He paused as if taking a deep breath.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have been taking a breath. He wasn\u2019t alive. Olivia took another sip of her tea. She\u2019d be heading into her kitchen for the brandy in a minute.</p><p>\u201cYou were on the ground,\u201d she said, encouraging him to continue.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I was hit in the head, if... I just don\u2019t know. At first, there was nothing. And then...then I was on a high like you wouldn\u2019t believe, and I knew I was in trouble. I got up and started walking and then...I felt a shove at my back and I fell and you know the rest of it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you believe that someone intentionally drugged you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Not to mention the part about killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told the police you would never have intentionally relapsed, Marcus. I\u2019ve sworn it, I\u2019ve defended you, I...I called my cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalachi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an FBI agent, Marcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s coming out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no. But he\u2019s working on something. After I talked to Malachi and he promised to get someone here, I found out that we have a federal agent showing up as a client tomorrow. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s the help Malachi\u2019s sending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Malachi come himself? Why doesn\u2019t he tell you things directly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with the government. Those guys are all paranoid, I think,\u201d Olivia muttered. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s complicated, Marcus. People in this area know that we\u2019re cousins. Some of them know Malachi. Like you. Sorry, I mean, you knew him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just step on the toes of the local police. So Malachi\u2019s managed to get a big shot to believe that something\u2019s wrong here, and they\u2019re sending someone out. Under the guise of a client.\u201d</p><p>Marcus remained somber but he nodded and looked at her with hope in his eyes. \u201cThanks, Liv. You have to solve this. The Horse Farm is a one-of-a-kind place. We work with addicts, with autistic and Down syndrome kids, with burned-out adults, the severely depressed.... But you know all that. And you know that it was always my way to make amends and to help others live quality lives and...you love the Horse Farm, too,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can, Marcus,\u201d she promised. She closed her eyes for a minute.</p><p>When she opened them, Marcus was gone.</p><p>Great. In death, Marcus\u2014always the most polite of men\u2014had suddenly decided to be rude.</p><p>3</p><p>Dustin arrived at the Horse Farm. There was a massive sign on the narrow paved road that led to a long dirt drive, a sign announcing that he\u2019d reached the Horse Farm.</p><p>It was an impressive place. Acres of rolling fields surrounded it, gorgeous hills crested in the background and rich forests stood beyond the pastures and meadows. When he got there, he saw that to the right of the drive were the massive stables, painted a cheerful bright red. To the left was the office and rec building; it, too, was large, but built ranch-style with only one story. Parking in the dusty drive out front, he headed for the office. Opening the door, he found old western furniture, walls covered with prints, paintings and newspaper clippings of horses, and overstuffed leather sofas. He saw a games room with people playing Ping-Pong and heard the whack, whack, whack of the ball going back and forth. A young woman breezed by him with a quick \u201cHello!\u201d and hurried on to the back. \u201cI\u2019m challenging the winner!\u201d she called. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A woman in her mid-or late thirties stepped aside to allow the young blonde to move past, to the games room. She shook her head but smiled tolerantly.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mama Cheever!\u201d the younger woman said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Liz. Go save your spot.\u201d There was something both matronly and businesslike about her. She wore western-style boots, jeans and a colorful cotton shirt. She\u2019d seen Dustin arrive and was coming toward him. Her hair was pulled back in a severe bun. Maybe that was it. She had a long, sharp-featured face that rather resembled a giraffe\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cAgent Blake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSandra, Sandra Cheever. Or Mama Cheever, as you heard, which I still don\u2019t get. I don\u2019t cuddle patients, don\u2019t tuck them in\u2014I don\u2019t even brew tea, for God\u2019s sake. But I do handle the paperwork and the scheduling around here. We have everything we need except your signature for the files. These days\u2014especially working with animals\u2014we have to get waivers. But your office took care of everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. What do I do? Where do I start? I\u2019m ready to sign.\u201d</p><p>Hands on her hips, she cast her head at an angle to study him.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to hear your enthusiasm,\u201d she told him. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d be hostile to the situation\u2014that it was a \u2018come here or lose your job\u2019 scenario.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Nashville, but you know that. You probably know everything about me,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cAnd I love horses. This sounded better than any other offer I\u2019ve had, so yep. I\u2019m enthusiastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Then I\u2019ll just bring you in to see Aaron. He\u2019s our managing director.\u201d</p><p>She lifted a hand to point at a door with a placard that read Aaron Bentley.</p><p>\u201cJust tap and go on in,\u201d Sandra said, grimacing as they heard a loud squeal from the back. \u201cI\u2019m going to go supervise. They\u2019re good kids. When they\u2019re here, anyway. But...they can get a bit crazy.\u201d</p><p>Sandra hurried to the back. Dustin watched her go as he tapped on the door.</p> <p>\u201cCome in, it\u2019s open!\u201d</p><p>Dustin stepped into the office. It was old-fashioned, to say the least. While the desk bore a laptop computer and a printer, an old blotter still sat on it, too, along with a memo tray piled high with papers. The room had two big leather-covered chairs in front of the desk and a worn couch to the rear. Windows looked out over one of the pastures.</p><p>The man standing behind the desk was about six feet tall, bearded and balding. His beard was neatly clipped; he seemed far better organized in his personal appearance than he did in his office management skills. Thin gold-rimmed glasses sat on his nose. He smiled seeing Dustin and walked around the desk, offering his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Agent Blake. I\u2019m sorry. One of us should have been out there to greet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a nice woman named Sandra did greet me. And yes, I am. But please call me Dustin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go by first names here, so that\u2019s great. I\u2019m Aaron. Aaron Bentley. We\u2019re glad to have you here, Dustin. We\u2019ve broken ground with many different groups, you know. About ten years ago, we started working with veterans\u2014the physically wounded, and those who have wounded minds. We help children with disabilities, addicts of all ages, you name it\u2014horse therapy can work wonders. But you\u2019re our first law enforcement official. Let\u2019s sit down for a moment.\u201d</p><p>Aaron returned to the swivel chair behind his desk, while Dustin sank into one of the old leather armchairs. It was comfortable. As messy as the office might look, that apparent chaos actually contributed to a sense of ease.</p><p>\u201cI spoke with your supervisor, a Mr. Jackson Crow,\u201d Aaron said, folding his hands in front of him. He didn\u2019t glance at papers or fiddle with anything on his desk. He gave his absolute attention to Dustin. \u201cHe said you were having nightmares and that he believes you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBurned out?\u201d Dustin suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo. Experiencing one of those spells where you\u2019re having trouble weighing the good you\u2019re able to provide against the horrors you have to see. I admit, when I first got the call, I suspected you\u2019d been involved in some dreadful situation where innocents had been killed. But he tells me you\u2019re one of his best agents and that he wants you to take some time off. He also said you don\u2019t do well with traditional psychiatrists or therapy and that he hopes this will work for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, did he tell you that?\u201d Dustin murmured. He\u2019d had a general idea of what Jackson Crow had planned on saying; he didn\u2019t know how close to home it might be.</p><p>\u201cI smoked once, Aaron. Years ago. Cigarettes, I mean. I went to a hypnotist to stop. Thinking about water and staring at a bull\u2019s-eye on the wall did nothing for me. I merely wanted to kill the hypnotist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t like that, but...we do have group and individual therapy. We also do camping trips to the little brook a couple miles from here. You don\u2019t have to think about the water\u2014you can walk right into it if you choose. Frankly, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll be what you\u2019re looking for, but we\u2019re anxious to see if we can help men and women in your situation. If nothing else, a little R &amp; R is always good for someone who is constantly under life-or-death tension.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to be here. You know I live in northern Virginia\u2014D.C. area, really\u2014and I love it. But Nashville and these hills\u2014well, this is home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, good!\u201d Aaron seemed genuinely pleased. \u201cNow I should tell you that we\u2019re in the middle of a real shake-up. We\u2019ve just lost our founder\u2014Marcus Danby. It\u2019s a tough time for all of us. So...your people knew he was dead when they called. The fact that you wanted to go ahead, anyway, is a testament to Marcus. At any rate,\u201d he said briskly, \u201cI put you in with a small group this morning. I understand you met one of the kids, Joey, last night. Young man, acting out. Terrible loss in his family. Anyway, I won\u2019t tell you any more. Come on out. I believe that Liv\u2019s at the stables and the troops are gathering.\u201d</p><p>As they went out the front door, another man was coming in. Aaron paused to introduce the two of them. \u201cDustin, meet Mason Garlano. You met Drew and Mariah Naughton last night, so once you\u2019ve spent your first session with Liv, you\u2019ll know all of us except for Sydney Roux. He takes care of the horses and the stables with Drew.\u201d</p><p>Mason Garlano had sleek, curly dark hair and dark eyes. He was in his twenties, with a slightly exotic flair and unmistakable charm. He quickly shook Dustin\u2019s hand. \u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re here\u2014and hope you enjoy your visits.\u201d</p><p>Dustin thanked him and followed Aaron to the stables.</p><p>At first sight, Olivia Gordon was little short of spectacular. He understood immediately why the adolescents he\u2019d met the night before were so crazy about her.</p><p>She resembled her cousin, Malachi, except that everything that made Malachi Gordon appear rough and rugged came out as pure beauty in Olivia. They had the same sable hair, a color that was rich and shiny. Hers was long, waving down her back.</p><p>Jeans and a blue denim shirt had never been worn so well.</p><p>When she turned to look at him, he saw that her eyes were a crystalline blue. They seemed to have a million different facets, all of them subtle shades of blue and green.</p><p>Her eyes widened when she met him. \u201cSo, uh, welcome. You\u2019re the FBI man?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYep.\u201d Did that mean she understood why he was there? He assumed so. \u201cA pleasure to meet you. I believe I\u2019m with your group now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded, glancing at Aaron. \u201cI hear you work in the D.C. area\u2014or you\u2019re based there, anyway. Do you know my cousin? Malachi Gordon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. You two have quite a resemblance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re double-cousins. Our mothers were sisters and our fathers were brothers,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Well, that must explain it.\u201d</p><p>They gazed at each other, but were interrupted by a small body that raced past him\u2014and threw his arms around Liv.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she gasped, and then laughed, hugging the intruder. \u201cBrent, turn around now. I want you to meet a new member of our group. This is Dustin. Dustin, please meet Brent.\u201d</p><p>Brent had Down syndrome. He studied Dustin unabashedly and smiled, thrusting out his hand. \u201cPleased to meet you, Dustin.\u201d He enunciated his words carefully.</p><p>\u201cBrent, pleased to meet you, too, buddy,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here!\u201d A woman came trotting out to the paddock.</p><p>\u201cHey, Patty,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cAm I late?\u201d the woman asked. She looked at Olivia but then stared at Dustin. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not late,\u201d Olivia said. She introduced Dustin. The woman kept staring at him.</p><p>\u201cJoey should be here any minute,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She made her way to the stables. \u201cHi, Patty,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Patty smiled at him. \u201cHi, there, Brent.\u201d She looked at Dustin again. \u201cSo, you\u2019re really with the FBI ?\u201d</p><p>Dustin nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat have they got you in here for?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure how to explain it,\u201d Dustin told her. She was still smiling as she studied him. He slanted his head. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in court-ordered therapy because of some...problems I had. I\u2019m glad. I need my life back. I have a little girl and I want custody of her. At least shared custody. Her dad\u2019s half the reason I\u2019m here\u2014nope! I\u2019m the reason I\u2019m here. But now I get to say I was in with an FBI agent, and that makes it...I don\u2019t know. It makes it better somehow. I mean, people who do important things, people like you, can have problems just like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, uh, good,\u201d Dustin said, a little helplessly.</p><p>\u201cEspecially after what happened to Marcus,\u201d she added.</p><p>He didn\u2019t get a chance to say any more. Joey was there. Dustin was glad to see that he seemed to have a special place in his heart for Brent and made a point of greeting him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia Gordon reappeared, leading a massive bay gelding with a glossy coat. He had to be about seventeen hands high.</p><p>\u201cThis is Cheyenne. He was bought as a three-year-old for a young rider. He was too much for her and the father sold him to a hack ranch. He was never handled properly and started throwing riders. One of the stable hands thought that whipping him would work and Cheyenne threw him into a field. He was then put in a paddock and basically ignored until\u2014\u201d she paused for just a second \u201c\u2014until Marcus Danby came upon him. We\u2019ve had him about three months now and we\u2019re working with him today because we\u2019re working on boundaries. So, first, one by one, get to know him.\u201d</p><p>Dustin had to admit he wasn\u2019t sure how getting to know a horse was going to be therapeutic for an adolescent boy, a Down syndrome child and a woman in court-ordered rehab. Or how a difficult horse could help anyone with \u201cboundaries.\u201d Or why the three of them seemed like a good combo.</p> <p>But as their time together progressed, he realized that what Olivia was telling them was true. They each worked with the animal, leading him, stopping with him, leading him again. She taught them to respect the horse\u2014but to maintain control. They were given a distance to cover; they weren\u2019t to stop because Cheyenne tried to bully them into walking over to the grass. Neither were they to jerk on his reins or in any way harm the horse.</p><p>It was interesting\u2014even for Dustin\u2014because the horse was a powerhouse of muscle. They were encouraged to speak to one another. And they were all encouraged to give the horse encouragement, to applaud his compliance. When Olivia ended the session, she released the gelding and he immediately bolted for the field. Cheyenne ran about for a few minutes. And then he ran back to them. He nudged Brent, and Brent laughed delightedly and returned the animal\u2019s affection.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get him to do that?\u201d Patty asked Olivia.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. He chose to come back,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll take Cheyenne to the stables now. Grooming time.\u201d</p><p>It was an intriguing exercise. Olivia supplied brushes and they decided among themselves who\u2019d do the mane and tail and how they\u2019d share this one-person task.</p> <p>Then their two-hour session was over. Olivia told Brent to say hello to his mom for her, said goodbye to Patty and informed Joey that they\u2019d be ready for his ride in half an hour. She turned to Dustin. He was struck again by the beauty of this slender woman who seemed to have so much confidence, such easy control.</p><p>She was obviously waiting for the others to walk away so she could speak to him privately. But they were talking and laughing among themselves.</p><p>He moved closer to her. \u201cI\u2019m here because of Malachi,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She glanced quickly around. \u201cSomeone could have called me and told me that yes, it was being handled.\u201d</p><p>Her taut response gave him a start. He lowered his voice. \u201cYou could answer your phone,\u201d he told her. \u201cAlthough one would\u2019ve thought that if you\u2019d called an agent for help and another agent showed up, you\u2019d put two and two together. Then again, if you answered your phone, you might have spoken with both of us.\u201d</p><p>She looked away. \u201cYesterday wasn\u2019t a good day for us. We got the autopsy report in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know that, Ms. Gordon. Because the day before, I was about to head out on a serious case\u2014kidnapping and murder in the Northwest. Instead, I\u2019m here\u2014where an addict might or might not have gone back to his old ways.\u201d</p><p>She flashed a glance at him, her eyes shimmering with hostility. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I would think the murder of any human being was important and worth investigating. If we\u2019re not gruesome enough for you, I do apologize. But you are here to investigate. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She paused, moving a step closer. She might work with horses in a stable, but she wore some kind of subtle perfume that made her smell like the whisper of flowers in the breeze.</p><p>\u201cI have two individual sessions this afternoon. You\u2019re not one of them. Everyone starts off with a session like you just went through, to see if they feel this will be of benefit to them. That will allow you to fit in here, which is the point. So, now you can investigate. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her, somewhat irritated that she\u2019d gotten under his skin. All his life he\u2019d walked a straight line. He felt he had sympathy for those left behind after a death, although he wasn\u2019t and never had been a counselor in any way. But he didn\u2019t let emotion invade his work. In his position, he couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d wind up...</p><p>In therapy, he thought dryly.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat will you do this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>He angled his head thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m going to play Ping-Pong. What time do you get off, Ms. Gordon?\u201d</p> <p>When Olivia finished with her last session, she discovered that Dustin Blake was still at the facility. He was playing doubles; he and Joey were partnered against Sean and Matt.</p><p>Officially, the Horse Farm was there for equine therapy. But any \u201cguest\u201d\u2014as they officially called their patients or clients\u2014was welcome on the grounds during open hours, which usually ended at six. They\u2019d long ago noticed that their guests were comfortable at the Horse Farm and, because of that, many stayed long hours reading in the back room or playing games.</p><p>Olivia wondered if perhaps he\u2019d been waiting for her. But she paused by the reception area, pouring herself a cup of coffee and watching him. She\u2019d managed to call Malachi on her cell during her last ride, and he\u2019d managed to call her back. Yes, if she\u2019d answered her phone, she would have learned that Blake was the agent who\u2019d been sent.</p><p>He was a curious choice, she thought. He was hardly nondescript. The man stood at about six foot four. He had the kind of lean, hard muscle that might be seen on a basketball player. His every movement hinted at agility. His face was chiseled, his jaw square, and he had flashing dark eyes that seemed to view the world around him with a certain amount of skepticism. No one could miss him. Hardly the type to slip in and out of anywhere unnoticed.</p><p>But then, he\u2019d come here as what he was\u2014or mostly as what he was. Aaron was practically giddy that the bureau had chosen their facility as a place for the man to unwind, chill out or vanquish his demons. Nowhere in the paperwork had it been suggested that he was addicted to alcohol or other substances, but you didn\u2019t have to be an addict or suffering from a physical or congenital disadvantage to benefit from the Horse Farm. Marcus Danby had believed that the best therapy brought various kinds of people together. For instance, a stressed-out business exec could learn that patience and tolerance for an autistic or otherwise handicapped child was something that should come naturally. Equally, a young man like Brent could show true acceptance and affection to a drug addict or alcoholic who discovered that friends\u2014real friends, or the ones who\u2019d enabled their addictions\u2014were afraid to be there for them anymore.</p><p>But while they\u2019d had handsome high school and college football heroes, a number of pro athletes, musicians and some of the people who pulled major strings on Wall Street, they\u2019d never had anyone quite like Dustin Blake.</p><p>He was the topic du jour.</p><p>Drew Dicksen stepped in from outside. He walked directly over to her and the table with the ever-present coffee service.</p><p>\u201cHey, how are you doing, kid?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>He seemed to look at her with concern all the time now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing all right. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Fine, thanks. So, you met the new guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Drew leaned against the wall, pensively watching the back room. \u201cI wonder why he\u2019s really here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d she said, startled. Did people know?</p><p>He smiled and lowered his voice. \u201cI mean, what did he do? The kids talk about it constantly. They think maybe he cornered a serial killer\u2014and shot him down rather than arresting him. Or he freaked in the middle of a tense situation. They keep making up scenarios\u2014and they\u2019re making me wonder, too.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s hard not to join in with their fantasies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that he freaked out, or that he\u2019s violent. If he was, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be here,\u201d Olivia said pragmatically.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sure got a rapport with kids,\u201d Drew said.</p><p>\u201cThe kids adore you, too. More than that, they respect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the ones we get are good kids,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not jealous. My real job is basically pooper-scooper. And he\u2019s an FBI guy\u2014where\u2019s the comparison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew! You and Sydney save animals, animals found in the worst possible conditions sometimes. You care for them, and you keep everything in this place running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that in front of Aaron!\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cMe, I don\u2019t want to be an FBI man. I\u2019m not at all fond of the concept of people shooting at me. Can\u2019t help but be curious, though. So how did he do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. He worked well with others and seems to know horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is from Tennessee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew, not everyone from Tennessee rides horses,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding?\u201d</p><p>Olivia rolled her eyes.</p><p>They heard a loud shrill of delight. \u201cWe won!\u201d Joey cried happily.</p><p>\u201cRematch tomorrow!\u201d Sean shouted back at him.</p><p>Sandra Cheever suddenly appeared, marching over to the boys. \u201cTomorrow being the key word. Out, young \u2019uns. We have to lock up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw...\u201d</p><p>The kids began filing out for the night. They all said their goodbyes to Olivia and Drew. Joey paused by the door. There was a sign-up sheet for the history/ghost tour and camping trip Mariah was planning to lead on Friday night.</p><p>Joey paused, turning around. Olivia thought he was talking to her at first when he asked, \u201cAre you going?\u201d</p><p>Then she realized that Dustin Blake was standing right behind her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is it exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMariah Naughton. Remember, she was talking about it at the diner last night? We take the horses and ride out to sites that aren\u2019t part of the National Battlefield Parks. I mean, they can\u2019t own everything, and there was Civil War action all around here. She talks about Tennessee battles, the ghosts that remain, and then we go set up camp by the stream. It\u2019s really cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, nothing here is really cool, man,\u201d Sean said, sticking his head back in and placing his hands on Joey\u2019s shoulders. \u201cBut it\u2019s the coolest thing we get while we\u2019re in purgatory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I do remember. Sounds great,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>Olivia glanced at him, trying not to frown. Ping-Pong and camping? That was how an agent worked?</p><p>Joey scribbled on the sheet and turned back to Dustin. \u201cI put your name down, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Aaron had come out of his office. Sandra\u2014herding the boys out the door\u2014was now behind Dustin.</p> <p>\u201cGuess I need to get out of here, too,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ve heard about this place for years. It\u2019s fantastic. Good day for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to have you, Agent\u2014Dustin,\u201d Aaron said.</p><p>As he walked out, Aaron turned to them. \u201cDrew, can you get Sydney? And, Sandra, can you find Mariah and Mason? We need a little meeting.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, they were all seated on the couches and chairs in the entry room. Once everyone had settled in, Aaron said, \u201cWe have to decide how to handle this situation. First, just to let you know, Sandra and I have rescheduled all our sessions for tomorrow\u2014the lawyer\u2019s coming in the morning.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI guess you\u2019re all aware that Marcus was the end of his line. I believe, since he and I discussed it many times, that the facility was left to me, but no one can be certain of anything until his attorney reads his final will and testament. I know, as well, that he left something from his life for every one of you. There are also clauses that protect the property and the livestock in the event of my death. So...that\u2019s one thing. The other is...we have to decide on spin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpin?\u201d Mariah asked.</p><p>Aaron exhaled. \u201cWell, the information about the autopsy is out. Naturally, in today\u2019s age of instant information and social media, it was inevitable, and some people are going to make a big deal of it. We all know the autopsy revealed he was on drugs. The blood tests made that clear. I saw Marcus that morning\u2014he was fine. In fact, he was in a great mood. What happened to make him relapse after all those years...I don\u2019t know. The thing is, it puts us in a bad light. What good does any of this therapy do if the man who founded the Horse Farm died while on drugs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t take drugs willingly,\u201d Olivia said firmly.</p><p>They were all silent, looking at her. She knew that pitying stare. They all believed she just couldn\u2019t accept it.</p><p>To her surprise, Sydney Roux, Drew\u2019s partner in looking after the stables, spoke up, too. He stood to do so; Sydney was an old Tennessean. His grandparents and their grandparents had grown up in the nearby hills. He was a gentleman to the nth degree. He fingered the baseball cap he\u2019d removed when he entered the office as he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, either. I remember I was in my room above the stables one evening when he came by. I\u2019d been drinking a beer and I tried to hide it. He told me, \u2018Sydney, I\u2019m an addict. You\u2019re not. Don\u2019t go thinking you can\u2019t have that brew because I stopped by. I\u2019m long past my trigger days.\u2019 And I believe that\u2014just like Olivia believes it. Something happened. Someone tricked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only,\u201d Sandra murmured.</p><p>\u201cHow could we ever find out? How could we prove such a thing?\u201d Mariah asked. \u201cWe had cops out here. They searched with us that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t find anything!\u201d Olivia said, sitting up straight.</p><p>Aaron looked at her. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see? They didn\u2019t find anything. They didn\u2019t find heroin, crack or anything else on him\u2014and they didn\u2019t find a needle in his possession. Where were the drugs or the paraphernalia he would have needed?\u201d</p> <p>Sandra came and sat on the edge of the sofa by her. \u201cOh, Liv, the acreage here seems to go on forever and we\u2019re surrounded by forests. He could\u2019ve left stuff anywhere on the property and we might never find it. A hundred years from now, when they\u2019re digging the place up to build condos, they might come across a broken needle or something and wonder what the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else could have put it in him,\u201d Olivia said stubbornly.</p><p>Sandra looked helplessly at Aaron.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened and I probably never will. And it doesn\u2019t matter. Marcus was one of the greatest men I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cThe point is how do we handle this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith honesty,\u201d Mariah said. \u201cWhat other way is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe downplay it,\u201d Mason insisted. \u201cWe tell the truth. We\u2019re honest. But we say that it never happened before\u2014and that is the truth. We say that Marcus had thirty years of clean living, and many people\u2014and animals\u2014benefited because of him. And that we\u2019re continuing on in that fine tradition of faith and belief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMason,\u201d Mariah said. \u201cThat was wonderful! If you get tired of being a therapist, you can go into public relations.\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cIt really was a good statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Aaron agreed. \u201cAll right, then. We just lie low. When asked, we say that we don\u2019t know what was going on in his mind at the end but that we loved him and he did a world of good. We\u2019ll say that we\u2019ll never forget him or what he gave to others. However, don\u2019t bring up the subject unless you\u2019re asked. So, everyone, have a good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Olivia said, rising. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve talked about here is important. We also need to find out what happened.\u201d She looked around at all of them. \u201cDo you honestly think Marcus just had a stash out in the woods? That he had it there for a long time\u2014just in case the day came when he suddenly broke after decades of clean living? We need to pursue the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Mariah asked. \u201cWe\u2019d need an army to comb the property and the woods. There are just seven of us. The police have other things to do, and we\u2019re not asking clients\u2014some of them addicts\u2014to look for drug paraphernalia!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s his house,\u201d Olivia said, turning to Aaron. \u201cIf his house was searched, we\u2019d at least know he wasn\u2019t using there\u2014or considering it.\u201d</p><p>Aaron left out a soft sigh. \u201cI believe that, as of tomorrow, the house will be mine. You can search to your heart\u2019s content, Liv. And if any of us thinks of a forest hidey-hole, we can search that, too. Liv, I don\u2019t know what else to do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in his house,\u201d Sydney said. He worked the cap furiously in his hands. \u201cI went to get his suit for the funeral home. I didn\u2019t search the place, but it\u2019s not big, and I sure as hell didn\u2019t see anything that would indicate Marcus had lost it. Of course, that was before they released the autopsy report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe tomorrow night you and I can go back,\u201d Olivia suggested.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cOh, Olivia, honey, I know how much you loved Marcus. But what can we possibly prove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he didn\u2019t fall back on drugs, Sandra! It could mean everything for the Horse Farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou search his house tomorrow night if you want,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cOlivia, you can do anything that\u2019ll make you feel better, and when you need our help, just say so.\u201d</p><p>She had the feeling that what he really meant was emotional help; still, it seemed that Aaron was on her side, and that mattered.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cSo the attorney is coming here at ten,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>They all moved. Some of them would get into conversations about Marcus\u2014or about Dustin, Olivia knew.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to get into a conversation.</p><p>She drove home. Sammy greeted her and she stroked the dog\u2019s back and spoke to him for a minute before she looked around downstairs.</p><p>\u201cMarcus?\u201d she called.</p><p>There was no answer. She went up to her room and changed into comfortable sweats, then came back downstairs.</p><p>Marcus was there, in the kitchen. \u201cWish I could\u2019ve put the teakettle on for you,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThat would have been nice.\u201d She put the kettle on and leaned against the stove. \u201cMaybe in time,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIn time!\u201d he protested, then smiled at her. \u201cThat\u2019s almost Biblical. A time to reap, a time to sow\u2014and a time to walk into the light. I want to walk into that light, Liv. I\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s beautiful. I should go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Marcus.\u201d She wanted to give him a hug\u2014but she couldn\u2019t hug a ghost. \u201cMarcus, if the light is there...and it\u2019s what you want, then you should go into it. We\u2019ll get along here, I promise. I\u2019ll do everything I can. Malachi sent an agent out to investigate.\u201d She paused. Yeah, and he likes to play Ping-Pong and go camping!</p><p>\u201cMarcus, have faith. In me, I mean. You can go to the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I can\u2019t. Not yet. Not until I\u2019m proven innocent. People do fall back into drugs. But the thing is\u2014I didn\u2019t. So I just can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why not!\u201d he said, aggrieved. \u201cYou figure out the meaning of life and death\u2014I sure as hell don\u2019t know it!\u201d</p><p>Before she could respond, Sammy suddenly stood up and barked. Right after that, there was a knock on her door.</p><p>Olivia stared at Marcus, wondering why she should feel so alarmed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you answer that?\u201d Marcus asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cFine. You stay put.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She squinted through the peephole. The man at her door was Dustin Blake.</p><p>Surprised, she opened the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re really not supposed to fraternize,\u201d she said. \u201cNot when I\u2019m your therapist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really my therapist,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not really in therapy. May I come in, please? I need to understand a lot more about what\u2019s going on around here. One of our computer whizzes back in D.C. got me a copy of the autopsy report. There was heroin in Marcus Danby\u2019s system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I understand that. We may be in the backwoods of Tennessee, but we do have a county morgue and intelligent, well-educated medical examiners. I didn\u2019t doubt the report. But the drug was administered to Marcus somehow. That\u2019s the point.\u201d</p><p>He stood just outside her door, stoic and patient. She recognized that he was kicking into true professional mode. \u201cMs. Gordon, I would be most unlikely to fault the capabilities of agencies in Tennessee, since I\u2019m from the state myself and continue to love and admire my homeland. What I\u2019m trying to tell you is that the facts of the situation are going to make it very hard. I\u2019m trying to have a real discussion with you and find out everything you can possibly tell me.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door wide. \u201cPlease come in. You actually don\u2019t need to hear it from me. Would you like some tea, Agent Blake?\u201d</p><p>She heard him close the door as he stepped in. Sammy gave a loud woof, then wagged his tail energetically and ran to the newcomer. Dustin Blake leaned down to scratch the dog\u2019s head. \u201cHey, fellow, you\u2019re a handsome lad. Poor thing, how\u2019s the leg doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s healing nicely, thank you,\u201d Olivia said. She led him into the kitchen; if Malachi had sent this man, if he was part of a Krewe, he must have some sense that the dead could, and sometimes did, speak.</p><p>\u201cYou should hear it from Marcus himself,\u201d she said, coming around the counter.</p><p>But Marcus was gone.</p><p>Once more, he\u2019d cut out on her without so much as a wave\u2014now, when she needed him most.</p><p>4</p><p>Olivia Gordon had appeared irritated\u2014and smug. As if she\u2019d been about to prove to an upstart that her every word was true.</p> <p>But she was obviously perplexed as they walked into the kitchen. Surprised by something, and off balance.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>She had the ability to collect herself quickly. \u201cNothing. Would you like tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, sure.\u201d</p><p>She went through the motions, moving a little too precisely, setting the mugs down a little too hard.</p><p>\u201cBlack or green?\u201d she asked. \u201cMilk? Sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack or green, and just plain, thank you,\u201d he said. She knew, of course, that he was watching her. \u201cI was going to hear what happened from Marcus?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>She looked at him as if she wasn\u2019t sure what to say. He wasn\u2019t her cousin, but he\u2019d come because of her cousin.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you. I\u2019ve wanted to join up with one of Jackson Crow\u2019s units since I heard about them. It\u2019s a hard world to walk around in when you\u2019re the only one who sees and hears things that others don\u2019t. When you talk to the dead.\u201d</p><p>Still looking up at him, she flushed.</p><p>\u201cHe was here,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was in the kitchen, telling me how much he wanted to go to the light, but that he couldn\u2019t. And he was sorry, he said, that he doesn\u2019t have all the answers, but he just can\u2019t go into the light. Not until he and the Horse Farm are vindicated.\u201d</p><p>She reached for a tea bag. She was still agitated and the tea bag went flying across the kitchen floor.</p><p>He set his hand on hers. \u201cRelax. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was right here,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve come to help. Why did he just vanish? Why did he vanish on me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t trust me. And maybe, despite the fact that he seems to have learned how to haunt you, he may not have the force or the energy to stay around for too long\u2014or at least not in a form in which you can see him. Like he said, he doesn\u2019t have all the answers. We certainly don\u2019t have them, either. There isn\u2019t really any book of the dead. I\u2019ve come across spirits who haven\u2019t learned to communicate, and I\u2019ve come across those who might be any friend chatting with you before a fire. We don\u2019t know why. Then, there are some who are quick to appear before many people\u2014and there are those who only appear after centuries and only because they believe they\u2019ve found the person with whom they need to communicate.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, wide-eyed. He stepped back. \u201cAre we okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said thickly. \u201cWant to hand me another tea bag?\u201d</p><p>He did. She finished preparing the two cups of tea, picked up both of them and walked out to her parlor. She placed the cups on a coffee table and sat on the sofa, curling her legs beneath her. He sat across from her on one of the old carved wooden chairs. The place was nice, he thought. It was historic, but it had been treated lovingly and had aged well. It seemed to offer the best of the old and the new.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need from me?\u201d she asked. Before he could answer, she asked, \u201cHow did you get here? Do you have a car out front? We\u2019re really not supposed to hang out with guests.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward. \u201cNo car out there\u2014I walked. I\u2019m at Willis House and I have the room with the separate entrance. People saw me go into my room, but they didn\u2019t see me leave. Even if they find out I\u2019m not there, they won\u2019t know where I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou walked? Willis House is several miles from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Pretty country for walking. The temperature is great.\u201d</p><p>She reached for her cup and took a sip of tea.</p><p>\u201cAnd no one saw me\u2014unless, of course, they were hiding in your bushes. But if someone was messing around outside your house, I think Sammy would\u2019ve known. I heard him bark before I came up the walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaron told me today that he and the others would help me in any way they could,\u201d she said.</p><p>Dustin felt his brow furrowing and made an effort to ease it. \u201cThey know you\u2019re convinced that Marcus was murdered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t exactly announce that he was murdered. But I did deny that he\u2019d gone back on drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to Aaron\u2014or to everyone?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him warily. \u201cWell, to everyone. We had a meeting at the end of the day. Marcus\u2019s lawyer is going to be at the Horse Farm tomorrow morning to discuss the will. We\u2019re all mentioned in it, apparently. From what we know, the Horse Farm itself goes to Aaron Bentley, but I believe Marcus had safeguards written in. I don\u2019t understand the legal ramifications of any of it. As far as we\u2019re aware at this point, we go on exactly as we\u2019ve been doing. We\u2019re nonprofit, so it isn\u2019t as if anyone stands to get rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cEveryone has access to public records, Olivia. We have access to a little more than that.\u201d He was quiet for a minute and then said, \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to understand why someone would have done this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m in denial? Panicking?\u201d Her tone was as stiff as her body.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that you were in denial or panicking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s first thought, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst thought, maybe. But calling Malachi was the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Malachi?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve met Malachi. No, I haven\u2019t worked with him. This is my first assignment with the Krewe of Hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She jumped up, sloshing tea, and then set her mug on the coffee table as she stared at him. \u201cWhat? Oh, I don\u2019t mean to be insulting, it\u2019s just that...I call for help, and my cousin sends a newbie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hardly a newbie, Olivia,\u201d he told her, trying not to lose his temper. She was looking at him as if he\u2019d barely managed to graduate from high school. \u201cI\u2019ve been with the bureau. I\u2019ve been a marine. I\u2019ve been a cop. I think I\u2019m up to the task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I said I was sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to offend you, but this isn\u2019t... Well, you can see how much good it\u2019s done to go to the police, to anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you that I believe you when you tell me you\u2019re speaking to a dead man!\u201d He was letting his voice grow too hard. She didn\u2019t mean to offend. She wasn\u2019t trying to do so.</p><p>But it seemed that she didn\u2019t need to try.</p><p>She opened her mouth and closed it again, struggling for poise. He kept his own mouth shut, waiting. He was a professional, for God\u2019s sake. He would act like one.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said at last. \u201cCards on the table. I wasn\u2019t thrilled to have my first Krewe assignment be a situation in which we\u2019re not even officially invited and in which everyone I meet seems to think I\u2019m a lawman run amok. Half of them assume I shot up a pool of suspects and the others figure I went crazy. Still, that\u2019s part of the job. I said I believe you, and you need to do me the same courtesy. But you have to trust in me and keep me informed. And please don\u2019t worry so much about my credentials. According to Jackson Crow, I\u2019ve been on his radar for a while now, and when this came up, it seemed the right time for him to call on me. I\u2019m from Nashville. I know the city and I know this area. Malachi couldn\u2019t come himself\u2014not with any real validity, or any real chance of blending in with the locals, if you will. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She slowly sank back onto the couch.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said flatly. She still didn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>He shook his head and leaned forward. \u201cThere are laws, and this country has a constitution, Olivia. You\u2019re fighting for a friend. You hoped that Malachi could get the government barging in and demanding that it all be solved. It doesn\u2019t work that way. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI said yes. My capacity for comprehension is actually pretty good.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if she was trying to lighten up or if she was speaking seriously.</p><p>He leaned back again. \u201cOkay, so tell me what happened with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day Marcus was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d had a few sessions and I\u2019d just finished up with the last one when I heard a commotion going on. We knew something was wrong when Sammy came running to the Horse Farm, badly hurt. Marcus loved Sammy. And the dog was devoted to him. If Sammy was there, something had to be wrong with Marcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t let Sammy lead you back to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy then, the dog was exhausted. He\u2019d lost too much blood. Physically, it would\u2019ve been impossible for him to search. We did call the police, and two officers came out to help us look.\u201d She was quiet for a minute, pensive, remembering. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019ve never blacked out in my life before, but...after I found Marcus, I blacked out. When I came to, Aaron was at my side, the police were already making notes and...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then Marcus\u2019s body was taken away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you black out?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re from this area, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Nashville. But naturally, growing up, I came out to the country plenty of times. Every school kid\u2019s done some of the battlefield tours. I\u2019ve been hiking, camping, skiing...you name it.\u201d She was still quiet.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the general,\u201d he said.</p><p>She sat straighter. \u201cYou know, then\u2014you know about General Rufus Cunningham?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows about him.\u201d He grinned. \u201cOkay, not everyone, but most people who\u2019ve lived around here. My grandfather belonged to a Civil War roundtable. You know\u2014groups of men who may or may not do reenactments, but who are fascinated by the history of the Civil War. They love to argue strategy. Which side did the right thing when, what could have changed the tide of battle. I\u2019ve been to a few. They\u2019re especially interesting here in Tennessee, because this state was so divided. Tennessee seceded from the Union, but the Union held Nashville early in the war, beginning in 1862. Pitched battles went on around Nashville, but the Confederates never regained the city. When they\u2019re all arguing policy and strategy at the roundtables, they occasionally agree on one thing. Like the fact that General Rufus Cunningham was one hell of an interesting and commendable man. He was out to win back the city, but he was also a humanitarian. When he was in charge, the wounded were helped, no matter what the color of their uniform. He\u2019d take personal and physical risk when necessary.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt always seemed to me that his death was a terrible tragedy.\u201d She paused again. \u201cHave you ever seen him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d She asked the question very carefully.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI was about sixteen. We were at the old Brentwood Campground. I\u2019ve heard the acreage has been bought by a large corporation and is due for a major building operation, but back then it was a campground. It\u2019s only a few miles from here and borders the same stream that runs through Horse Farm acreage. I woke up in the middle of the night during that camping trip. I was restless. Didn\u2019t want to wake the other kid in my tent so I went outside. The general was standing by the stream, just staring at it, almost like he was keeping watch. He had a foot up on a rock. He was leaning on his knee with one arm and he held his horse\u2019s reins in the other hand. He looked at me. I looked back at him. He tipped his hat, and I waved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he disappear? Fade into the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he stayed there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI waved again and went back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t frightened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Are you still frightened when you see the dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I haven\u2019t seen that many just wandering around. I\u2019ve seen General Cunningham a few times. But half the world\u2019s seen General Cunningham, or at least a lot of people believe they\u2019ve seen him, so... And I know my cousin\u2019s ghost. Zachary Albright. He\u2019s been around since the American Revolution, but he\u2019s... I don\u2019t know. That was easy. Malachi was there and Malachi and I are the only two in the family, as far as we know, who...talk to the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would need to be afraid of General Cunningham. He hated the war, hated pain and suffering. I think he stays around to try and prevent it,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Maybe. And I\u2019m not frightened of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...you were frightened of Marcus Danby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the way it all happened,\u201d Olivia explained. \u201cFirst, I found Marcus down in the ravine. Then, I saw General Cunningham up on his horse. Next thing I knew, I was with the body of Marcus Danby when the spirit of Marcus Danby tapped me on the shoulder. Frightened? Stunned? Both. But I\u2019m not afraid of Marcus. He\u2019s so...real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in a way, he is real. He\u2019s just not flesh-and-blood real,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cStrange dilemma, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked, and then gestured with one hand. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m not prone to hysteria or passing out, but when I was holding Marcus, and Marcus was behind me at the same time, I passed out cold. Just like I told you. When I came to, there was no sign of Marcus\u2019s spirit or the general\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then Marcus visited you here?\u201d he asked. \u201cTwice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. This was the second time. But as soon as I walked to the door to let you in, he disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know what happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me that Sammy ran ahead of him in the woods, barking. He went to find the dog\u2014and after that, he doesn\u2019t know. So, whoever did this was waiting for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr happened to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have heroin available to inject into someone if you\u2019re not expecting to see that person,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cUnless you were in the woods doing heroin and didn\u2019t want to be found by Marcus Danby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy hurt the dog?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Sammy attacked the person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSammy doesn\u2019t attack.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cGlad to hear it. Or maybe not so glad. Olivia, if someone did intend to kill Marcus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey more than intended it. They accomplished it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not making any of this up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never suggested you were. What I\u2019m saying is that you might have put yourself in danger.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to puzzle her. \u201cMe? I have no power over anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost murderers don\u2019t want to get caught. Whoever killed Marcus has an agenda, which probably doesn\u2019t include prison. That means his killer doesn\u2019t want an investigation. This person wants Marcus\u2019s death accepted as an accident. Your house is out here\u2014with pasture and forest around it. Do you have an alarm system?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have locks on all the doors and windows,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an alarm system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think someone would really break into my house to kill me?\u201d she asked incredulously. \u201cThat would hardly be an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll kinds of accidents can happen in a home,\u201d he replied. \u201cA fall down the stairs...a hair dryer being dropped in a tub or the sink. A slip on the floor. Trust me, \u2018accidents\u2019 can happen. Do you have a gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I have a Revolutionary-era Brown Bess in a display box upstairs. And an 1853 Enfield rifle that my uncle found on this property. I\u2019m afraid I have no ammunition for either of them\u2014nor have I ever fired a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be able to protect yourself. I\u2019ll see that you have mace or pepper spray, at least,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI have Sammy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said Sammy\u2019s not an attack dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019ll bark his head off,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll give me plenty of warning.\u201d</p><p>Dustin wasn\u2019t sure that a dog barking was going to be enough. There was property around all the houses here. Lots of woods, lots of distance. No matter how good emergency services might be, it took time to get to the scene of a crime.</p><p>It only took seconds to kill.</p><p>But for the time being, he let it go and stood up. She stood, as well. \u201cI guess I should go back, just in case anyone\u2019s watching the activity around here. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow night to make sure you\u2019re armed to defend yourself. I\u2019m going to text you my phone number. Get it into your home phone on speed dial and your cell phone\u2019s list of contacts.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He was glad she wasn\u2019t fighting him.</p><p>\u201cIs Malachi going to be able to come at all?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s still up in the air,\u201d he told her. So much for her faith in him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move for a moment, just looking at her. The woman was breathtaking and still, somehow, while she must have considerable strength of will given her work with people and animals, she had a touch of naivet\u00e9, too. She was slim and athletic, but well built. Her eyes were that haunting crystalline blue, touched with green. They compelled him to want to watch her; they also seemed to have a touch of vulnerability. Someone had died and, in her mind, he\u2019d been definitely and irrefutably murdered. And Dustin didn\u2019t doubt that she\u2019d spoken with a ghost. She saw things others couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Yet she didn\u2019t see her own danger.</p><p>He suddenly felt as if they weren\u2019t alone. It was a sensation he knew fairly well; he was being watched. Marcus Danby, he thought.</p><p>Marcus was nearby but wasn\u2019t planning to show himself at the moment.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t seem to be aware; she wasn\u2019t accustomed to waiting for that feeling that was like catching a glimpse of something out of the corner of one\u2019s eye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can go out the back,\u201d she was saying. \u201cIf you cut through the forest it\u2019s dark, but there\u2019s a decent moon out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. That\u2019s the way I came. My nocturnal vision\u2019s pretty good, and then there\u2019s this modern thing called a flashlight. I always have one with me,\u201d he told her, offering a smile.</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile in return. Instead, she looked at him gravely. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not the person anyone\u2019s going to be after,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh? Really? They all know you\u2019re an agent. What if the killer\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll be snooping around and then he wants you out of the picture?\u201d</p><p>Maybe she wasn\u2019t so naive.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m also a big guy who works out, has had training\u2014and carries a big gun,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does make me safer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. All right, I\u2019ll go along with that,\u201d she conceded.</p> <p>\u201cBy tomorrow night I\u2019ll see that you at least have some mace. Friday night, we\u2019ll both do the camping trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamping and Ping-Pong,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Ping-Pong is a great way to get to know the people who hang out at the Horse Farm. And camping will give me a glimpse of a lot more. If we\u2019re going to find out who did this to Marcus Danby, we need to find out why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cThat makes sense. Come on, I\u2019ll walk you out back.\u201d</p><p>Olivia led him through the kitchen, the dining room, something that now seemed to be a family room and, finally, out the back door. She was polite and agreeable.</p><p>\u201cMake sure everything\u2019s locked down tight,\u201d he told her. \u201cIf someone\u2019s determined to get in, they\u2019ll figure out a way. But it\u2019s best to make it as hard for them as possible. That gives you more time to call the cops or come up with an escape route yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will lock everything,\u201d she promised.</p><p>He had the feeling that the minute he was gone, she\u2019d be on the phone calling Malachi and asking him if the agent he\u2019d sent was really capable of getting anything done.</p><p>Olivia had never been afraid in her own house before. Now it was inhabited by a ghost who appeared out of nowhere whenever he chose. And on top of that, she was worried that someone might try to break in while she was asleep.</p><p>It was still early. She returned to the kitchen, ready to forage through the refrigerator for something to eat. Instead, she walked around downstairs and then upstairs, closing and locking windows. When she was done, she checked the front door again, followed by the back door\u2014even though she\u2019d just locked it behind Dustin Blake.</p><p>There was nothing else to lock.</p><p>She returned to the kitchen once more only to freeze, startled.</p><p>Marcus was back.</p><p>\u201cThank you very much. You made me look like an idiot,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI had to see who it was and make a judgment call,\u201d Marcus told her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m pretty sure he knew I was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve walked around the Horse Farm. I even waved my hands and tried to blow cold breath at people. They can\u2019t see me. But this guy\u2014I think he may be the real deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? He didn\u2019t tell me he saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say he saw me. I said he knew I was around. I didn\u2019t intend to be seen. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Olivia demanded, annoyed with him.</p><p>\u201cI had to be sure he\u2019s the one,\u201d Marcus said.</p><p>\u201cThe one what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho could really help. I mean, if they\u2019d just sent you a facts guy, we\u2019d be in trouble. But I think he does believe you, and I know he can see and feel and sense what\u2019s there\u2014and what\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have introduced yourself at the end, Marcus. And how will all these abilities actually make a difference? You weren\u2019t killed by a ghost\u2014were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone flesh-and-blood killed me. But...now I\u2019m sorry I asked for help. I want the killer caught and the truth exposed, but I hadn\u2019t\u2014well, I hadn\u2019t recognized the danger I was putting you in.\u201d</p><p>Now Marcus was telling her she should be afraid, too!</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Marcus continued, \u201cyou have the agent here. He\u2019ll investigate, and you just need to keep quiet from now on. If they say I fell back into drugs, let them say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it too late?\u201d she asked him. \u201cThey\u2019re already saying it. And move, please. You\u2019re blocking the refrigerator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really block it,\u201d he said, but he moved aside.</p><p>She reached in and brought out a head of lettuce, shaking it at him. \u201cAnd quit appearing and disappearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019d, um, give you a hand if I could. Since I can\u2019t...I\u2019m going to go prowl around the Horse Farm and see what I can learn.\u201d</p><p>Olivia set the lettuce on the cutting board and looked at him. She\u2019d been about to warn him to be careful. She managed to refrain.</p><p>\u201cMarcus, why do you think someone wanted you dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. I wasn\u2019t blackmailing anyone. I wasn\u2019t sleeping with anyone\u2019s wife. I wasn\u2019t dealing drugs and I hadn\u2019t robbed any banks. I\u2019ll be damned if I know, Liv.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Horse Farm is nonprofit, and while the management remains in the hands of Aaron Bentley, there\u2019s nothing to be gained by my death. Oh, well, there are specific bequests in the will, but nothing anyone would kill for. Anyway, I\u2019m off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming back?\u201d she asked him. \u201cI\u2019m so jumpy I actually wouldn\u2019t mind having you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep everything locked up, like the fed told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will you be back?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll be back. I intend to watch out for you through the night.\u201d</p><p>Sammy whined and Marcus leaned down to pat his head. Olivia thought the dog couldn\u2019t possibly feel his hand.</p><p>And yet it was as if he did.</p><p>Then, just like Dustin Blake, he left through the back.</p><p>Except that Marcus didn\u2019t have to open the door.</p><p>Dustin walked back to Willis House and entered his room by the private door. He put through a call to Malachi and told him he\u2019d been to see Olivia and they\u2019d talked about Marcus Danby. \u201cDo you have anything more on the situation, or on Danby?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing that would explain why anyone wanted the man dead. The property is really only worth anything with a functioning business, and the business only functions if the Horse Farm is successful. The land is valuable to an extent, but there are acreages of similar land if someone was looking to buy, and some of it\u2019s for sale. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s crawling out of the man\u2019s past\u2014the Horse Farm isn\u2019t a rehab facility, it\u2019s a therapy center. On paper, there\u2019s nothing our people have been able to find. How is Olivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s called you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since you\u2019ve been there,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>That was a surprise.</p><p>\u201cShe was asking about you coming out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to handle this delicately. If local law enforcement believes we\u2019re trying to home in on their territory, it could get dicey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, as far as I know, law enforcement considers his death an open-and-shut case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your cousin has spoken to a ghost and that the ghost knows he was murdered,\u201d Dustin said flatly.</p><p>\u201cTread carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd keep an eye on Liv for me, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>They rang off. Dustin figured that since he hadn\u2019t eaten, he might as well go to the diner again. He just might pick up something more than dinner there.</p><p>The house was silent as he headed out. The other residents were either gone or in bed. He locked the door behind him, and as he did, he realized Coot was sitting in his usual rocker on the porch.</p><p>\u201cHey, there, Coot,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHowdy. Nice night.\u201d Dustin heard the sound of Coot\u2019s rocker moving back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d go to the caf\u00e9 for a bite to eat. Do you want to join me?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>He thought the old-timer would say no. To his surprise the rocker creaked and Coot stood up and walked over to him. \u201cSure. Be happy to go along. Thanks for the invite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d enjoy the company,\u201d Dustin said, guessing there was more to be learned from the old man.</p><p>\u201cWe gonna drive?\u201d</p><p>Dustin nodded. It seemed like a simpler and safer alternative, with a possible killer skulking in the nearby woods.</p><p>Coot knew which car was his and waited patiently at the passenger door for Dustin to open it.</p><p>The drive was short. Coot didn\u2019t talk; he merely gazed out the window at the darkened landscape.</p><p>Delilah, who was waiting tables again, welcomed them both warmly. Her coffee was fresh, good and strong, and in a few minutes they ordered\u2014the daily special, chicken potpie\u2014and sat facing each other. The caf\u00e9\u2019s only occupants when they came in were a family foursome that appeared to be parents and a girl of twelve or so and a boy of maybe ten.</p><p>Delilah, of course, knew all about them. They were the Richardson family and they were driving to Nashville from Colorado; their daughter had won tickets to see the newest sensation on the Nashville charts.</p><p>Coot sipped his coffee and stared at Dustin while they waited for their meals.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019re in any trouble to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you law guys hated it when they want you to see shrinks or go through therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was ready for a respite. That\u2019s about it,\u201d Dustin responded.</p><p>Coot shrugged and lowered his head, trying to hide a smile. Then he glanced up. \u201cI know who you are,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Dustin smiled. \u201cDustin Blake. That\u2019s my name, sir. Special agent\u2014that\u2019s what I do for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about a boy they called Dustin about twenty years ago. I was a reporter in my day. In Nashville, I used to hang out with the cops\u2014I handled the police beat. I\u2019m pretty sure that boy was you. You would\u2019ve been a kid, a few years older than the two at that table over there, when this all happened, but I remember your name. Hell, even the media has some decency. They didn\u2019t let out your name, and maybe I just heard your first name among friends. Anyway, you picked up some knowledge on the street\u2014or in some other way\u2014that helped them find a killer. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>Dustin\u2019s coffee cup was halfway to his lips. He paused. It was so long ago. No one ever connected him with the Opry-Buff, as the killer had been labeled, or the police shootout that had taken him out.</p> <p>\u201cI am right,\u201d Coot said, nodding sagely. \u201cSo what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying the Horse Farm. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. So, you seen the general?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, everyone claims he sits on that warhorse of his up in the hills, ever watching out. But not many really see him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019ve seen him. I\u2019ve had him tip his hat to me. When the mists are lying low over the pastures and fields, some folks see him \u2019cause they want to. They see him in the cloud patterns, too, on a summer\u2019s day. But there are those who really see him. Like young Olivia.\u201d</p><p>Olivia, he thought, had to be in her mid-to late twenties. To Coot that was young.</p><p>\u201cAnd, I reckon,\u201d Coot went on, \u201cyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows what we see and don\u2019t see?\u201d Dustin said evasively.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about Olivia, you know. She\u2019s one special person. The girl could\u2019ve done just about anything, gone just about anywhere. But she\u2019s done some mighty good things instead. Sometimes she\u2019s got kids with autism so bad the parents are at wits\u2019 end, and she can calm \u2019em down for a few hours and get \u2019em grooming the horses, laughing in the field. She\u2019s great with the youth-in-rebellion types, too. I don\u2019t want anything happening to her.\u201d</p> <p>Dustin felt a coldness in his gut. This old man\u2014this old observer\u2014was worried.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks someone killed Marcus Danby,\u201d Coot said.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s upset. She doesn\u2019t want to believe he went back to his old ways.\u201d</p><p>Coot snorted. \u201cYou really figure that\u2019s what he did? I didn\u2019t take you for a fool, Special Agent Blake!\u201d</p><p>Dustin was careful when he spoke. \u201cSo you think someone drugged Marcus Danby and threw him in the ravine?\u201d</p><p>Coot narrowed his eyes. \u201cThrew him, or gave him a shove. Yeah. I knew Marcus. A guy like that doesn\u2019t go twenty-odd years, then take a walk in the woods one day and decide he\u2019s gotta have a fix. Think about it, boy. It doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen addicts go in and out of recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing\u2014absolutely nothing\u2014to make Marcus do that. It would be like me waking up and saying to myself, \u2018Hey, nice day, think I\u2019ll put a Smith &amp; Wesson in my mouth and pull the trigger.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone else seems to have accepted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey only see what\u2019s there. They aren\u2019t looking for more. Sometimes people have to look beyond the obvious to get the real picture. Hell, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who would have killed Marcus\u2014and why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, there\u2019s a dilemma,\u201d Coot agreed. \u201cAaron gets the place, or rather, the management of it and the pay that comes with being boss, even when you\u2019re nonprofit. That means things aren\u2019t going to change much, since Aaron\u2019s been in charge a long time. Marcus never liked being in charge. He liked to be more like a...a shaman walking down from the mountain to impart his words of wisdom and go off on another nature walk. But someone had to be in charge and do the day-to-day work, and that someone was Aaron Bentley. Then, of course, there\u2019s Mama Cheever, as they call her. Sandra Cheever. Why she\u2019s Mama Cheever, I don\u2019t know. Nothing maternal about that woman. More of a drill sergeant type. Schedules are everything to her. She yells at the kids and gets obsessed about upkeep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she want to kill Marcus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was sloppy? Well, he was. Came in and left his coffee cup wherever, tracked mud into the offices... Ruined her schedules a lot. He\u2019d make an appearance and a whole class might run late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that would cause her to kill him?\u201d Dustin asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cNo... Just sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the students? The clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018guests,\u2019 you mean?\u201d Coot said dryly. \u201cNo. The students come and go. None of \u2019em that I know of ever had a grudge against the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas any kid\u2014or adult, for that matter\u2014ever been kicked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not a one. If there\u2019s problems with a therapist, they just shift people around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know so much about the place?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>He grinned. \u201c\u2019Cause Marcus was my friend. I\u2019m an old horse-lover from way back. Found a few animals I got him to take. Animals that needed rescuing. There\u2019s a big old Lab-shepherd mix you\u2019ll see around the stables. I found him on the road and Marcus took him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d Dustin told him.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I can see you mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dustin pursued. \u201cIf not a student, who?\u201d</p><p>Coot shook his head. Delilah was bringing their food. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard that old saying?\u201d he muttered. \u201c\u2018Tell a woman, tele-gram\u2019? Well, it was written for Delilah.\u201d</p><p>Delilah arrived at their table, and Coot smiled up at her. \u201cThank you, Delilah! Looks wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy!\u201d</p><p>She stood there a minute, but they both made a pretense of being fascinated with their chicken potpie.</p><p>\u201cMore coffee, gentlemen?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Dustin told her.</p><p>She refilled their coffee. Then the family of four apparently needed some directions, and Delilah was distracted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say look at those closest to him,\u201d Coot said in a low voice. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you law types do in situations like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually, yes.\u201d</p><p>Coot nodded. \u201cSo at the Horse Farm you\u2019ve got two more therapists. You\u2019ve got Mason Garlano. The guy\u2019s great with animals, but too much of a narcissist to be as good with people. I think he\u2019s waiting to be in the right ice cream parlor at the right time and have some Hollywood type \u2018discover\u2019 him. He gets some modeling jobs on the side. Mariah Naughton is nice enough. A bit of an edge to her sometimes, as if she believed there\u2019d be more in the world for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019d have anything against Marcus, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Then you\u2019re down to the stable managers. Drew Dicksen and Sydney Roux. They\u2019re both decent types, far as I can tell. They run a tight ship there, not easy with the number of animals Marcus was always bringing in. His door was open to any abandoned creature, and I should know, since I brought him a bunch. He\u2019d try to find homes for the cats and dogs, but most of \u2019em wound up staying at the farm. That meant lots of animals to feed. Lots of housekeeping. Lots of\u2014literally\u2014shit to shovel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo even if you resented him because of the workload or whatever, don\u2019t you think you\u2019d find another line of work before killing a man?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. There\u2019s the dilemma. Which one would have an agenda? Damned if I know.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later they finished their meals. Coot was insistent that they split the check; he wasn\u2019t taking taxpayer money by letting Dustin pay, he said, but neither was he going to pay more taxes by buying Dustin\u2019s meal.</p><p>They rose to leave, setting their money on the table.</p><p>About to walk out, Dustin thanked Delilah, who was busy wiping tables, preparing to close for the night. He could honestly tell her the chicken potpie was excellent.</p><p>The house was quiet when they returned. But Coot didn\u2019t have any more to say. He started up the stairs to his own room.</p><p>\u201cNice to talk with you, young fellow,\u201d he told Dustin.</p><p>\u201cNice to talk with you, too, sir,\u201d Dustin said politely.</p><p>In his own room, he went on his computer to look into everyone\u2019s backgrounds.</p><p>Mariah, Marcus and Sydney Roux were all from the area and had families that had been around these parts for over a hundred years. Mariah had already told him as much, at least where she was concerned.</p><p>Aaron Bentley was originally from Arkansas, Andrew Dicksen from Biloxi, Mississippi, Sandra Cheever from White Plains, New York, and Mason Garlano was from Austin, Texas.</p><p>He wondered if any of that would be significant. Probably not, he assumed\u2014but you never knew.</p><p>Olivia had actually fallen asleep when the dog suddenly went crazy. She was dimly aware of a little woof by her side, then the patter of his nails as he raced down the stairs. At the front door, he started a frenzy of barking.</p><p>Nervously she jumped out of bed. She looked around the room and realized that Dustin Blake was right\u2014she was virtually defenseless. She thought about the knives in her kitchen and decided they wouldn\u2019t do her much good. If there really was an assailant, he\u2019d just turn her own knife on her. She wasn\u2019t a weakling by any means, but neither did she know about combat.</p><p>Her heart thudding, she threw on a robe, then snatched her phone off the bedside table.</p><p>The screen told her it was 4:31 a.m.</p><p>As she started down the stairs, the barking seemed to come from the back of the house.</p><p>She reminded herself that the place was completely locked down.</p><p>But...if the person at her door had a gun, he could easily shoot out the locks. If so, wouldn\u2019t he already have done that? It wasn\u2019t as though she had neighbors who\u2019d hear. She hesitated for a split second and then, instead of hitting 9-1-1, she called Dustin Blake\u2019s number. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wasn\u2019t sure what she thought of him yet.</p><p>But at least he wouldn\u2019t think she was an alarmist.</p><p>He answered on the second ring.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone outside,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSammy\u2019s going crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way. Stay back from the windows. Don\u2019t let yourself be seen. Don\u2019t open a door until you hear my voice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She hung up, wondering how long it would take him to get there. She stood at the top of the landing and saw the knob on the front door turn. Someone outside was obviously trying it.</p><p>Sammy\u2019s barking escalated and he threw himself at the heavy wooden door.</p> <p>The doorknob stopped moving. Barely daring to breathe, she stared down at her cell and watched painfully as time seemed to stand still. Then she dropped the phone in her pocket and hurried to the kitchen, where she shoved the knives below the counter to make them harder to find and, without turning on a light, scrabbled around until she came up with her weapon of choice.</p><p>The waffle maker. The handle was just long enough for her to get a good grip and the body was hard. It would make a great weapon for a surprise attack-and-run should she need it.</p><p>5</p><p>Dustin\u2019s phone had rung at exactly 4:32 a.m.</p><p>It took him until 4:34 a.m. to throw on some clothes, his holster and gun, jacket and shoes and to sling his backpack over his shoulder. He was out the back door in ten seconds, in his car in another twenty and speeding down the road. Thankfully, walking distance to her place from Willis House was less than fifteen minutes at a brisk pace and driving there\u2014even with the winding Tennessee country road\u2014was about six minutes.</p><p>His eyes were on the house as he pulled into her driveway. But there was just one car there and no sign of anyone. Jerking to a halt, he leaped out of the car, still surveying his surroundings, and raced to the front door. He could hear the dog barking inside. \u201cOlivia, it\u2019s Dustin.\u201d</p> <p>The door flew open. \u201cSammy, it\u2019s all good. It\u2019s Dustin, a friend.\u201d</p><p>She had evidently been waiting for him; she was wrapped in a long velvet robe. Her hair was mussed but she was as striking as a lingerie ad.</p><p>Her features were tense; her whole body was tense. She gripped the handle of a good-size waffle maker.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBut someone was here, Dustin. I saw the front door being tried. The knob was moving. And Sammy...well, Sammy knows when someone\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re certain no one got in.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSammy would know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here. I\u2019m going to take a look around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no, no. I\u2019m not staying alone,\u201d she said. \u201cSammy and I are coming with you.\u201d</p><p>She might be frightened, but there was determination in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet the keys. If we\u2019re both going out, we\u2019ll lock the front,\u201d he said.</p><p>She picked up the keys sitting on the buffet near the front door and frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, pointing at his backpack.</p><p>\u201cSupplies,\u201d he said.</p><p>She arched her brows.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>She followed him out. A look at the front door yielded nothing, of course. Digging into the backpack, he came out with his fingerprinting kit, quickly dusted the door and searched for prints.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cSmudges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere should\u2019ve been prints. Your prints and other prints, all on top of one another. I think someone had gloves on and made a point of smudging the surface, as well.\u201d</p><p>Resealing the container of fingerprint powder, he searched the porch. There\u2019d been no dust on it and no snow, and there wasn\u2019t the faintest sign of a footprint. As he walked slowly down the porch steps, he continued to search, playing his flashlight over the dark grass and nearby shrubs.</p><p>He wondered if his movements were being observed.</p><p>He paused when he reached the ground.</p><p>Olivia Gordon plowed into his back, she was so close behind him. She still held the waffle iron in a death grip.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>And it was. He\u2019d rather liked the feel of her\u2014vividly warm, sweet-smelling, seductively shaped\u2014crushed momentarily against him.</p><p>Suddenly aware of what he was doing\u2014and feeling\u2014he stepped forward. An expanse of clear rolling ground lay to the front, rear and sides of her house. The front yard stretched out to the road, and there was forest on either side of the cleared land. He could see trails, some more established than others, leading through the trees. He made a mental picture of the area; he already knew the way to Willis House through the woods. If he moved to the rear, he could take the trail that led over the hills to the pastureland and then on to more trees, more rolling hills and the Horse Farm. The stream that went through the area for several miles could probably be reached through the rear of the property, as well. Anyone who\u2019d been here could have gone anywhere, in any direction. Her nearest neighbor was down the hill a few acres away; trees separated them.</p><p>He\u2019d need an army to find someone out there.</p><p>He walked around the house with Olivia at his heels. Sammy trailed along, wagging his tail. The dog was a perfect monitor, and his actions certainly didn\u2019t signal that anyone else was present. Whoever had been there was definitely gone.</p><p>There was no indication that anyone had tried to break window locks, although he could well imagine the route someone might have taken to do so.</p><p>When he\u2019d completed a circuit around the house, Dustin inspected the ground as best he could in the dark, with only his flashlight to provide illumination. He headed toward the trail that wound through the trees and led to Willis House, but there was no sign that someone had come through. It might not have meant much in any case, since there was national parkland that wove in and out around them. People could easily wander off government land and onto private property without ever knowing it.</p><p>At last, he stopped and turned to look at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s no way for me to find anything now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cThank you for coming so quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I do, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>She turned and walked back to the house. He followed her thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have coffee,\u201d she said. Then she stopped and looked back at him. \u201cWell, I guess that was presumptuous. I\u2019m going to make coffee. It\u2019s past five and I don\u2019t see any reason to go back to sleep. But, of course, you might want to. Anyway, Sammy and I are fine now. Really.\u201d</p><p>He could tell that she wasn\u2019t fine; she was afraid. But she was going to try hard not to show it.</p><p>\u201cCoffee would be great, and you\u2019re right. It\u2019s morning. It\u2019ll be light soon. No sense going back to bed.\u201d</p><p>She unlocked the door and walked inside, flipping on lights. She paused for a minute, as if trying to sense something.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t here, is he?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cMarcus, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bastard said he was coming back. To watch over me. He didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn all seriousness\u2014although I suppose he could warn you if there\u2019s trouble\u2014I\u2019m not sure what he could do. You made the right call. The pun\u2019s accidental, but it\u2019s still true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better than 9-1-1?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, but moved on into the kitchen. There were old attractively refurbished stable stools in front of the counter. Dustin sat on one of them, watching as she returned the waffle iron to a lower cabinet and set about making coffee.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she mused. \u201cWhy would someone come to my house like that? It would be hard to break in during the middle of the night and make it look as if I had a terrible accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen someone with the right agenda wants in, they\u2019ll get in,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cBut no one tried to break a window or shoot up a door. My guess is that this was just a trial run, a way of testing the waters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo someone\u2019s out to get me\u2014because of what I\u2019ve been saying?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Sammy whined and settled at his feet. Dustin leaned down for a moment to pat the dog. When he looked up, she was at the counter, waiting for him to face her, waiting for his reply.</p><p>\u201cI would guess that\u2019s it, yes,\u201d he told her. \u201cHere\u2019s the good thing. Whoever\u2019s doing this hasn\u2019t gotten to a point where they\u2019re desperate. This person is just...researching the situation right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell everyone you\u2019re getting an alarm system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet an alarm system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, no one else believes that Marcus met with foul play. Well, other people might suspect it, but the police found nothing that would lend to more of an investigation than the one that\u2019s been done. You can\u2019t blame them. They found you with a man who was already dead. Thankfully, he\u2019d been dead for hours, or you might\u2019ve ended up as a suspect. But they found a man who\u2019d been an addict dead with heroin in his system. There was no one around and no sign that anyone had been. There were no obvious marks on his body, other than those attributed to the fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were also no needles or drug paraphernalia,\u201d she reminded him sharply.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but no addict keeps his stash where it can easily be discovered.\u201d</p><p>The coffee gurgled its last and she poured them both cups.</p><p>\u201cThe attorney\u2019s coming to the Horse Farm today to explain the will and dole out the individual bequests Marcus left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go, listen, watch other people. And as soon as possible, call an alarm system company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think that\u2019s kind of paranoid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParanoid is better than\u2014\u201d He broke off. He\u2019d been about to say dead. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard the old adage a thousand times. Better safe than sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled at that. She\u2019d known what he\u2019d been about to say. \u201cWould you hang around down here for a few minutes while I go up and get ready for the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d drunk half her coffee. Leaving it, she turned around and dashed up the stairs.</p> <p>He was going to be sorry to see the beautiful robe go, he thought.</p><p>Restlessly, he walked the ground floor of the house, checking windows as he went. The place was sealed tight. He sat in the parlor, thinking about the psychology of what had happened. Whoever had done this wasn\u2019t a serial killer with a penchant for a certain physical type; this was a person or persons with an agenda.</p><p>Dustin knew he should be looking for someone who was after something that wasn\u2019t obvious. Or maybe Marcus\u2019s killer had been seeking revenge for some reason. But if revenge was the only agenda, why come after anyone else?</p><p>No, fear of discovery had to be the motive for targeting Olivia Gordon. What did she know that she didn\u2019t even realize she knew?</p><p>And how far was the killer willing to go to safeguard a secret?</p> <p>Olivia came down the stairs, Sammy at her heels. It was barely seven and beginning to get light outside.</p><p>He rose. \u201cI have an idea. Go to the caf\u00e9 in your car. I\u2019ll get my own car and follow you. You are allowed to dine with \u2018guests\u2019 if you happen to arrive at a restaurant at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we always run into people at the caf\u00e9 and there\u2019s never been any kind of policy against sharing a meal. After all, we do the camping trips, Mariah runs her ghost tours... I\u2019m sure that \u2018running into you\u2019 will be fine.\u201d</p><p>She seemed grateful for the suggestion.</p><p>He collected his backpack; she picked up a shoulder bag.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Olivia, I know I already mentioned this, but it\u2019s important. You need to make it known that you\u2019re hiring an alarm company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat reason would I give for suddenly doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say you heard noises\u2014and that you\u2019re far away from anyone else. You\u2019re just feeling nervous, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>They headed out.</p><p>At the door, Sammy whined. \u201cYou need to protect the homefront,\u201d Olivia told him, then locked the door, checking it a couple of times.</p><p>She got in her car; he waited until she was safe inside, backing out onto the drive. Then he followed. As they approached the caf\u00e9, he slowed his car. He wanted her to be there for a few minutes before he joined her.</p><p>And yet, he wondered if whoever had attempted entry at her house had been there all the while, hidden somewhere in the trees.</p><p>Watching him watch Olivia.</p> <p>Olivia was the first customer to arrive at the caf\u00e9 that morning. Behind the counter, still setting up, Delilah looked at her with surprise. \u201cLiv, honey! What are you doing here so early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t sleep, so I got up and I didn\u2019t feel like my own company,\u201d Olivia explained.</p><p>Delilah nodded as if she understood. \u201cI hear ya, honey. I know you people at the Horse Farm have to meet up with Marcus\u2019s attorney this morning. That\u2019s going to be hard for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, Delilah,\u201d Olivia said. And she was, although she felt angry with Marcus. Not the anger that typically came with grief, in which a person was angry about being abandoned by a loved one; she would have recognized such an emotion. No, she was angry with Marcus\u2019s spirit\u2014a spirit who showed up to shock her and then disappeared just when he was needed. A ghost who didn\u2019t bother to return when he\u2019d promised he would.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just gotten this new-fangled machine in here.\u201d Delilah pointed at a shiny silver contraption. \u201cMakes a perfect espresso every time, according to the box. You want to try one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I\u2019d love a cup of regular coffee\u2014with a shot of espresso,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cHey, great idea. Maybe I should try one of those myself. I\u2019ve been working long hours lately. My waitress\u2014you remember that sweet young thing, Genie?\u2014she took off for Nashville last week. Decided she was going to get a job in the city. Can\u2019t say as I blame her. I mean, folks out here like country and the city is close enough...but a young girl? She needed more. So, anyway, to make a long story short, I\u2019ve been filling in mornings and nights. But I own the place and Steve back there has been my cook for the past twenty years. Reckon we\u2019ll make it till we get some help.\u201d Delilah grinned wickedly. Steve was her husband as well as her chief cook and bottle washer.</p><p>\u201cIf I hear of anyone looking for work, I\u2019ll send them your way,\u201d Olivia said. She pulled out her smartphone and started looking for area alarm companies.</p><p>\u201cWhat ya doin\u2019, honey? Can I help?\u201d Delilah asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to get an alarm system installed,\u201d Olivia replied.</p><p>\u201cOut here? We never have trouble out here. Of course, I\u2019ve got my man and a shotgun if anyone\u2019s going to give me trouble!\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t have a man or a shotgun.\u201d</p><p>Delilah wagged a finger at her. \u201cYou should get yourself a man, Liv. Pretty little thing like you. Just \u2019cause that ornery Bill Preston decided to up and head on out of your life... And that was more than a year ago!\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighed. She\u2019d been in an almost-live-in relationship with a music promoter. After a trip to Austin, he\u2019d discovered some great opportunities there. It had come time for her to weigh the importance of the relationship. She hadn\u2019t been in love. Not enough to leave.</p><p>\u201cBill\u2019s a good guy\u2014we were just going different places, Delilah.\u201d</p><p>Delilah tsked at her, then selected a little pod for her new machine; her frown became a smile of pleasure when her espresso machine instantly began to steam up and pour out dark brown liquid. She prepared the coffee, added the espresso and set it before Olivia. \u201cI should name this concoction after you!\u201d she said proudly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think it really needs a name,\u201d Olivia told her. \u201cThe chain coffee shops have it already, I\u2019m afraid. They just call it coffee with a shot of espresso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s it going to be a \u2018Liv\u2019!\u201d Delilah insisted.</p><p>The door opened and Dustin made his entrance. \u201cMorning, Delilah,\u201d he said. \u201cGood morning, Olivia.\u201d He walked up to take a seat at the counter beside her.</p><p>\u201cMy, my, you folks are up early today,\u201d Delilah remarked. \u201cNice to see you, Agent Blake. Sorry\u2014Dustin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a \u2018Liv\u2019?\u201d Delilah offered.</p><p>\u201cA Liv?\u201d he asked with a question in his eyes as he smiled over at her.</p><p>The man had a good smile, Olivia thought. At the moment, it revealed charm and a touch of amusement. He really was a perfect man\u2014lean, hard-muscled and fit. His skin was slightly bronzed, his eyes a striking deep green and his shock of neatly clipped hair defined the concept of auburn.</p><p>She hoped he couldn\u2019t read her thoughts. She felt her cheeks flush and spoke quickly to cover her embarrassment. \u201cI happen to be the first person Delilah\u2019s ever served a coffee with an espresso thrown in. She\u2019s going to call it a \u2018Liv\u2019 from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said gravely, turning to Delilah. \u201cSounds wonderful. Looks wonderful. How does it taste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s excellent,\u201d Olivia assured him.</p><p>\u201cGuess when you\u2019re up and at \u2019em this early, makes good sense,\u201d Delilah said. \u201cSo, did you find an alarm company, hon? I can\u2019t really help\u2014we never needed an alarm around here, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found one.\u201d Olivia stood up. \u201cExcuse me while I give them a call.\u201d She walked down to the end of the little diner. The office was open and she arranged for a technician to come out on Saturday. That was the earliest someone would be available.</p><p>It would have to do, she told herself. Two days. She returned to her chair.</p><p>\u201cAny luck, honey?\u201d Delilah asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m all set up.\u201d</p><p>Delilah turned to Dustin. \u201cI said I couldn\u2019t advise her. I\u2019ve got a shotgun\u2014and a man.\u201d She nodded knowingly, then gestured at Olivia. \u201cCan you imagine? This sweet young thing was with a fella who lit out for Austin!\u201d</p><p>Olivia could feel Dustin\u2019s eyes on her.</p><p>She groaned. \u201cDelilah, he\u2019s making a great living in Austin and I\u2019m happy for him. I\u2019m perfectly fine on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people are fine, you know,\u201d Dustin said. There was amusement in his voice. But he seemed to sense her discomfort and changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to have a \u2018Liv,\u2019 too,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd some of your pancakes, please.\u201d</p><p>Olivia decided on an omelet.</p><p>Whistling, Delilah conveyed their orders to Steve and set to work on Dustin\u2019s coffee. After glancing at Olivia and obviously trying not to grin, Dustin chatted casually, asking her how they went about choosing the right horses to work with people.</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously, when Marcus brought in a rescue animal with bad kicking habits, or one that nipped, we kept working the horse ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd could you retrain all of them so they could work with others?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMost of the time, rescues have been neglected but they can work well with people and enjoy human interaction. Every once in a while, though, we\u2019ve gotten a horse that was so abused it could never be assigned to anyone who wasn\u2019t experienced with horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shrugged. \u201cAnd then one of the staff would just keep working with the horse or sometimes use it for group trail rides. Occasionally, if a horse had been so abused that Marcus could never feel comfortable allowing anyone to ride it, the horse was just retired and allowed to stay in the paddocks for the duration of its natural life.\u201d She looked straight ahead for a moment. \u201cMarcus made the Horse Farm a no-kill shelter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he said quietly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door opened, and Olivia twisted her head to see who had arrived.</p><p>It was Deputy Sheriff Frank Vine. He\u2019d been on duty the day Marcus had disappeared. For a cop, Frank was an exceptionally gentle man. Fifty-something, with hair that was almost pure white and a laid-back manner, Frank could be tough, but he listened, weighing every situation carefully.</p><p>He\u2019d even listened to her when she\u2019d found Marcus. He\u2019d soothed her and told her sadly that people didn\u2019t always live up to their own expectations or those of others. It didn\u2019t make them bad people. They just hadn\u2019t had the strength they\u2019d needed.</p> <p>\u201cMorning, Frank,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, good morning. And how are you doing, young lady?\u201d he asked, sliding onto the stool to her left. He beamed at Delilah and then leaned back, unabashedly studying Dustin. \u201cHello, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank Vine, Dustin Blake.\u201d Olivia made quick introductions. Dustin stood for a moment to shake Frank\u2019s hand. Delilah came over with a cup and the coffeepot. \u201cMorning, Deputy Frank,\u201d she said. \u201cDustin here is one of your own. A federal officer of the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Frank looked at Dustin again. \u201cAre you out here for any special reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019m attending the Horse Farm,\u201d Dustin said.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Frank nodded but obviously remained curious.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m originally from Nashville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d That seemed to make sense to Frank. \u201cOur own Music City.\u201d His pride in Nashville was evident.</p><p>\u201cNo better place,\u201d Dustin agreed.</p><p>Frank nodded happily; Dustin had made a friend.</p><p>\u201cI hear the Horse Farm had to do a lot of rescheduling this morning, because the lawyer\u2019s coming to discuss the terms of Marcus Danby\u2019s will,\u201d Frank said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a formality, but I guess it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Olivia put in.</p><p>\u201cDeputy,\u201d Dustin began. \u201cI\u2019m curious. I believe the medical examiner concluded that Marcus Danby\u2019s death was accidental. The result of a fall, possibly brought on by a mind-altering substance. Heroin. Where did Marcus inject?\u201d</p><p>Frank\u2019s face turned a mottled red. \u201cThe usual,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cVein in the arm?\u201d Dustin asked. \u201cI guess at his point in his life\u2014when he fell back into drugs\u2014he wouldn\u2019t have collapsed veins, and the needle mark would\u2019ve been easy for the medical pathologist to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Frank said. He looked over at Dustin. \u201cHe was a mighty fine man and the Horse Farm is a mighty fine place. We don\u2019t judge Marcus harshly, and we ask you not to do so, either. You\u2019re here for healing, I imagine, son, so let the healing begin. Now, Liv,\u201d Frank said, turning to her. \u201cToday will make things all legal. Aaron takes over, and that\u2019s fitting. Aaron\u2019s been Marcus\u2019s right-hand man for over a decade now. But...I need you to do me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Frank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a big old yellow dog on the property. Marcus came back with him after a trip to Memphis. He was at some animal shelter over there and was running out of days,\u201d Frank said.</p><p>\u201cHomer. He\u2019s some kind of Lab mix\u2014probably about three or four years old. He\u2019s a great dog.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to have him. Think you could make that happen for me? Marcus might\u2019ve left him to you in his will. He liked the big old mutt almost as much as his Sammy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank, you know animals come to the farm not because we need more animals, but so they can survive. Whether Homer was left to me or Aaron or anyone else, I\u2019m sure we\u2019d all be delighted for you to have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. The kids are all grown up now with kids of their own, and since last fall... Well, I figured that dog kind of took a hankering to me and I kind of took a hankering to him,\u201d Frank said.</p><p>Frank\u2019s wife had passed away the year before from cancer. Olivia patted his hand. \u201cHomer would be privileged to live with you, Frank.\u201d</p><p>Frank nodded. Delilah brought plates of food for Dustin and Olivia and took Frank\u2019s order. Twenty minutes later, Frank had finished his corned beef hash and grits and headed off to work. Olivia looked at her watch and asked Delilah for her check. She glanced at Dustin, who\u2019d grown thoughtful when Frank left.</p><p>While Delilah tallied their bills, Dustin said, \u201cSo that\u2019s the officer who won\u2019t believe you about Marcus? Seems like you two get on well enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of them. We have two sheriff\u2019s deputies who handle this area\u2014Frank, and Jimmy Callahan. They\u2019re both decent guys. But...they feel sorry for those of us who wear rose-tinted glasses, as Jimmy phrased it. They\u2019re very kind when they try to make me understand what they see as the sad truth.\u201d</p><p>Delilah was on her way toward them, and Dustin fell silent. \u201cSee you in class, Agent Blake,\u201d Olivia said, rising to take her bill and put money on the counter. \u201cDelilah, thank you. Delicious as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, honey. See you soon,\u201d Delilah said.</p><p>The sun was bright now. Special agent Dustin Blake was still at the counter in the diner behind her as Olivia walked to her car, wondering if she\u2019d simply imagined that someone had tried to gain entry to her house.</p><p>She drove the short distance to the Horse Farm. Pulling into the parking area in front of the office, she saw that Drew and Sydney had been up early, too; the horses were out in the pasture. A quick count assured her they were all there. Shebaan, an aging Tennessee Walker. Trickster, often used in therapy sessions. Beloved Battle-ax, an old Percheron mix who was as big as a house and gentle as the Easter bunny. Zeus, a Paint. Carina, a gentle palomino. Martin, an Arabian mix. Chapparal, a one-time champion barrel-racer. Pixie and Nixie, rescued mixes from the swamps of Georgia. Gargantua, some kind of Clydesdale mix Marcus had owned forever. Beryl, a sweet bay, and her own personal favorite, Shiloh.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys. Morning!\u201d she called to the horses.</p><p>She entered the office. Drew and Sydney were there, talking with Aaron, who held one of the Horse Farm cats on his lap. Sandra Cheever was seated on the arm of the sofa, and Mason Garlano stood by the window, smoothing back his hair. She saw that the window was providing him with a reflection.</p><p>\u201cWho are we missing?\u201d Aaron asked, waving her in.</p><p>\u201cJust Mariah,\u201d Sandra announced. \u201cShe gave me a call a minute ago. She\u2019s on her way.\u201d She glanced at Olivia. \u201cLiv, you\u2019re looking a little...tired. You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks. I didn\u2019t get much sleep, though. Had some kind of animal sniffing around the house last night.\u201d</p><p>Mason turned to her with a grin. \u201cSome kind of animal? Olivia, you practically live in the woods. Or the country, anyway. There are lots of animals around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But it made me decide to get an alarm system installed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s never a bad idea,\u201d Aaron said.</p><p>\u201cNot really necessary around here, in my opinion,\u201d Sandra said. She smiled. \u201cBut whatever. If creeping animals are giving you...well, the creeps!...you should get an alarm system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Mason agreed. He gave Olivia his best sexy smile. \u201cPretty girl in the woods. You never know when a wolf will show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any wolves around here,\u201d Aaron said.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, they also come on two feet, don\u2019t they?\u201d Mason teased. He grinned at Olivia. She grinned back. He\u2019d tried to get something going with her when he\u2019d first started working there. She liked him\u2014as a friend. She knew that while he could be an effective therapist, he was also self-involved. He knew it, too. But his ego didn\u2019t get in the way of his sense of humor, and they both saw the absurdity in many situations.</p><p>\u201cThey definitely come on two feet!\u201d Sandra said, shaking her head. \u201cMason, would you bring me some more coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Where\u2019s the attorney?\u201d Mason asked, walking over to the coffee service to oblige her. \u201cHe\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s him driving in now,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cSo, everyone, get your coffee and get settled.\u201d</p><p>The attorney came in. Olivia had met him once before, just in passing. Aaron introduced him as Kevin Fairchild. He was a slim man, balding and out of place at the Horse Farm in a black business suit, white tailored shirt, striped tie and silver tiepin. But he was friendly, smiled easily and didn\u2019t seem to care if he got dust or animal hair on his suit.</p><p>Mariah followed him in a moment later, sweeping her hair into a ponytail as she walked. She slid next to Olivia on the sofa and rolled her eyes. \u201cCan you believe it? I overslept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all here, so we\u2019ll get started,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cMr. Fairchild, if you will? I have a feeling you\u2019ll have to explain everything in layman\u2019s terms. For me, certainly. I tried to fill out my own living will once and it confused the hell out of me!\u201d</p><p>They all smiled and laughed, a little nervously, Olivia thought, although there was no reason for anyone to be nervous. Marcus\u2019s will should hold no surprises.</p><p>\u201cWell, ladies and gentlemen, let\u2019s begin. I\u2019ll explain the legalese as I go along and feel free to ask me questions.\u201d</p><p>Fairchild started to read, and Olivia\u2019s mind wandered as he went through legal phrase after legal phrase. It was more or less what she\u2019d expected, although she\u2019d never been to the \u201creading\u201d of a will before. She found herself looking around at all her coworkers, trying to grasp the fact that one of them might have killed Marcus\u2014and might want to kill her.</p><p>Aaron leaned against the counter, looking perplexed as he listened. Drew Dicksen appeared to be deep in thought. Sydney Roux dangled his key chain and stared out the window; from where he stood, he could see their horses in the field. Homer, the big yellow dog Deputy Frank Vine had asked her about, was running after a bird.</p><p>Mariah seemed to be dozing off.</p><p>Mason was worrying a fingernail.</p><p>Sandra Cheever was trying to look as if she was paying attention, but her eyes kept glazing over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia started as she suddenly heard her name. Fairchild was silent, as were the others; they all studied her curiously.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cAaron gets the place, but not really. And after him, Olivia gets it, and if she doesn\u2019t run it into the ground, she names her own successor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence,\u201d Olivia murmured to Sandra, except that she was surprised herself and realized Sandra hadn\u2019t meant to be offensive. She flashed her an apologetic smile.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Aaron said.</p><p>\u201cBetter not!\u201d Olivia told him.</p><p>\u201cThe Horse Farm is in a trust,\u201d Fairchild explained. \u201cAaron maintains the senior position and makes all the decisions. In the event of something happening to Aaron, Olivia will take over as senior operating official. Sometime in the next year, they\u2019re to name the others who\u2019ll follow in their places, and so on, down the line. It\u2019s very straightforward. Marcus had this will written so he could ensure that the Horse Farm would continue. The nonprofit will not be dissolved, and someone will always be there to see that it goes on doing the work he intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would happen in the event of a natural catastrophe, like a flood?\u201d Mason asked. \u201cWe did have that major one a few years back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, if something catastrophic were to happen or if the Horse Farm fell into such severe financial hardship that it couldn\u2019t be maintained and your salaries couldn\u2019t be paid, the property would revert to the actual estate. The land would go up for sale, and any profits would be distributed to a number of other charities. Do you all understand?\u201d Fairchild asked, looking around at them.</p> <p>They all nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow let me go on with the individual items he\u2019s left you.\u201d</p><p>Olivia listened but his words blurred. Marcus had left them things that were special to him. A saddle and a desk to Drew, collectible books to Mariah, a sterling tea set to Sandra and other personal property to others. She heard her name again and looked up.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Once more, they were all staring at her. \u201cAnother house,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe left you his house and the immediate property around it,\u201d Aaron told her with a smile. \u201cYou can now search it to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tear it to pieces, if you choose,\u201d Fairchild said. \u201cThe house is yours, free and clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house,\u201d she murmured. It should have gone to Aaron. But Aaron didn\u2019t seem disturbed, didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>Was it an act?</p><p>You bastard, Marcus! Why didn\u2019t you warn me?</p><p>\u201cAnd, of course, Shiloh,\u201d Fairchild added. \u201cHe felt that you and the horse shared something unique. You\u2019re free to keep Shiloh at the facility or build a barn at the house you\u2019ve just inherited or on your own property. There\u2019s a lot of fine print here\u2014but that\u2019s what it means.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, grateful for his explanation. She wasn\u2019t sure she needed another house\u2014but she did love the horse!</p><p>\u201cWhat about Homer?\u201d she asked. \u201cYellow Dog as we sometimes call him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy Vine asked if he could have him,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>Fairchild looked at his papers. \u201cRescue animals will continue to come and go from the facility as determined by those in charge. No animal will be put to death or set into the hands of those who would euthanize said animal or abuse it. Adoptions will be given due consideration by the entire staff and should continue with majority approval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say Deputy Vine gets Homer.\u201d Aaron surveyed the room as he spoke. \u201cAgreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. One less mouth to feed at night\u2014until one of us drags in another,\u201d Drew said.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Sydney chimed in.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah!\u201d Mariah said.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, that\u2019s it,\u201d Fairchild told them. \u201cMy office is available to you. Anyone feeling any confusion is more than welcome to call me for clarification.\u201d He paused a little awkwardly. \u201cMarcus was my client. I didn\u2019t know him that well. But he held each of you in high regard, I do know that. Naturally, none of us suspected he\u2019d be leaving us quite so soon, but...you should be aware how valued and appreciated you all were in his eyes.\u201d He looked at each of them in turn and then at Aaron. \u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d departed, Drew and Sydney stood, leaving to attend to their duties. Mason got to his feet, too, and was out the door before the women had even managed to rise.</p><p>When the door closed behind him, they were all silent. \u201cWell,\u201d Aaron said brusquely, \u201cthat\u2019s it. We start up again right after lunch, so if you want a break, take it now. Thank you all for being here on time, and...\u201d He sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThe will\u2019s been read, the die is cast, Marcus is gone. We carry on.\u201d</p><p>Looking over at Aaron, who stood near his office door, Olivia shivered.</p><p>Aaron frowned at her. \u201cOlivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I just got a strange feeling. Someone walking on my grave, or whatever that saying is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Aaron said gently. \u201cWe all have to get back to normal. We have a legacy to live up to, but Marcus is gone.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Except that Marcus wasn\u2019t gone at all. He was leaning against the doorway of Aaron\u2019s office, arms crossed, grinning as he watched the proceedings.</p><p>He smiled at her and then seemed to fade into the wall.</p><p>Was he just letting her know he was around, watching?</p><p>Ever hopeful that he\u2019d see or hear something that would help catch his killer?</p><p>6</p><p>\u201cThe one-eyed Persian is Oscar. The old ginger boy sound asleep in the hayloft in Trickster\u2019s stall is Orange Cat. You\u2019ll see about a dozen of them running around, going into and out of the office,\u201d Drew told Dustin. \u201cMarcus was a sucker for just about anything that had a heartbeat, so you\u2019ll see cats, dogs and a few other pets an owner brought home and then tossed. Horses, needless to say. If you see a cat you like or a pup, just talk to Aaron. We\u2019re continuing with the policy of bring \u2019em in\u2014and if you find a good home, let \u2019em go.\u201d</p><p>Dustin had just admired one of the massive cats keeping \u201crat guard\u201d in the stables. Now he knew the feline\u2019s name was Orange Cat. Not imaginative, but certainly fitting.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful policy,\u201d he said. Drew didn\u2019t seem to mind that Dustin was there and had been for about forty-five minutes. He\u2019d helped bring some of the horses in from pasture and brushed them down. Mariah had an individual therapy session coming up and Mason was taking out a new group.</p><p>He\u2019d been scheduled for a ride with Olivia\u2014but not alone. Apparently, because of the time lost that morning, Joey Walters was going to be with them. Which was fine; he liked Joey.</p><p>After breakfast at the caf\u00e9, Dustin had spent a few hours on his computer and done some fact-checking with the office back in Virginia. He\u2019d read bios on everyone here over and over again. Nothing stood out. No history of mental illness, much less homicidal tendencies. Before coming to the Horse Farm, Sandra Cheever had worked for a medical office, arranging schedules and dealing with patients for a group of psychiatrists; she\u2019d left only because Aaron had lured her away. She\u2019d never received even a parking ticket. Mason Garlano had been working at a physical rehab center until he followed his girlfriend to Nashville. They had since broken up, but the girlfriend was alive and well and working as a sound technician for a studio in Nashville. Andrew Dicksen had moved to the Nashville area from Biloxi, Mississippi, with his family when he\u2019d been ten. He\u2019d done the rodeo circuit until his thirtieth birthday when a fall from a bull had damaged his collarbone; he\u2019d known Marcus, and Marcus had offered him the job. Aaron Bentley had been a college student studying toward a business degree and working at a hack ranch when he\u2019d met Marcus, who\u2019d hired him. That had been twenty years ago. Both Sydney Roux and Mariah Naughton were from the area, and had lived there all their lives. Sydney had been arrested once in college for protesting a military action. Not one of them had a history of violence, theft, drug abuse or any other ill-doing that might have raised a pale pink flag, never mind a red one.</p><p>And still, Dustin was convinced that Marcus had been murdered and by someone close, someone who knew him well. That meant\u2014as he\u2019d assumed earlier\u2014that there had to have been a motive, a secret agenda, since no fight had broken out. He hadn\u2019t been killed in a fit of anger. His murder had been carefully calculated to look like an accidental death.</p><p>Official records were helpful, but they didn\u2019t say much that was personal about anyone. Dustin was grateful for social media; he looked up every form of internet page or link he could for each of his suspects. Apparently, Drew had yet to enter the media age. He had a Facebook page but never posted. Mariah, on the other hand, loved her page\u2014and used it, of course, to promote the ghost tours she did twice a month. Sandra Cheever used hers to communicate with family in New York. Mason kept up with friends in Texas\u2014and made social arrangements with his friends in Nashville. Sydney Roux posted a lot of pictures of the animals at the Horse Farm. He took good pictures and made it clear that the puppies and kittens who wound up there were available for adoption to good homes. Aaron only had a professional page that led back directly to the Horse Farm.</p><p>He found himself looking up Olivia\u2019s Facebook page, as well; she, too, liked to post pictures of the adoptable animals at the Horse Farm but she also mentioned social events and proudly posted beautiful pictures that showed off the grace and beauty of Tennessee.</p><p>He could spend his life on the computer, but it was nothing compared to actually spending time with people, face-to-face. He\u2019d discovered he liked Drew; he really hoped the man wasn\u2019t hiding some kind of dark secret. One thing the academy had taught him was that you could never be too careful\u2014it was dangerous to trust a friendly face. Some of the nation\u2019s most heinous serial killers had actually been charming when not slicing or strangling their victims. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you ever meet Marcus?\u201d Andrew asked him, hoisting a saddle onto Shiloh.</p><p>\u201cNo, I never did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re from the area?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom the city, originally,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cNashville\u2019s the best city in the world, but I love these rolling hills out here,\u201d Drew told him. He shrugged. \u201cI guess even though it\u2019s small in comparison to New York, Atlanta or Chicago, Nashville\u2019s actually pretty big. Folks could wander around for years and never meet one another. Out here, we do.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd regardless of how long I\u2019ve lived in the state, I\u2019ll never be a real homeboy to people who are from here\u2014like Mariah or Sydney. They can trace their families back for generations. But Olivia used to come out here all the time with her parents, and I know she and Mariah never met.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cA lot of life is an accident of timing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to go through life not knowing everyone\u2014even in a small town, let alone a big city,\u201d he added wryly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true enough.\u201d Drew grinned. \u201cListen, thanks for the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem. I love horses,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cAnd cats\u2014and dogs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlenty around here,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cIn fact, you really would be a good candidate to take home a pup or a kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I was. I\u2019m never in one place long enough to be a good owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a field agent. That means going out in the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, takes a good man to know when he can\u2019t have an animal, too. That\u2019s the problem, people picking up cute kittens or pups and not realizing the little critters are going to get big. So they dump them. Or the dog messes in the house. Or they get the pet and then have kids and forget they have the pet. But all the animals lucky enough to come here, well, they\u2019ll still be taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo surprises in the will, huh?\u201d Dustin asked.</p> <p>Drew shook his head, adjusting the saddle on Shiloh. \u201cNot really. Oh, yeah, there was one. Marcus left his home and the property it\u2019s on to Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a surprise, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought it would go to Aaron. Aaron loves this place and manages it really well. It would\u2019ve been easy for him to live there, and go back and forth to the Horse Farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, couldn\u2019t he just live here if he chose? You and Sydney do, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...we\u2019re not management types. We keep our places pretty nice, but hey...this is a stable, and it smells like a stable. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your living arrangements are fine,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cSo where does Aaron live now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he rents a house down the road. He should\u2019ve bought a house when the buying was good. Guess he figured maybe he didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Drew said with another shrug. \u201cI doubt it\u2019s a problem. The Horse Farm being nonprofit doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t get a nice salary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you guys?\u201d Dustin asked.</p> <p>Andrew laughed. \u201cI like my life just fine. I have a comfortable place to lay my head at night. I love my work. I enjoy working with kids. I wake up every morning to fresh air and beautiful country. No rush hour. Yeah, I\u2019m pretty happy with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to hear,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>He saw that Olivia was coming out of the office. He\u2019d gotten a brief text from her, saying that she planned to stay at the office where there\u2019d be several people around until her afternoon sessions.</p><p>But now she was headed his way. \u201cHi, Dustin. And thanks, Andrew.\u201d She patted Shiloh\u2019s neck. \u201cI could have saddled him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get restless with nothing to do,\u201d Andrew told her. \u201cSo, things have changed a bit. Are you going to keep Shiloh here? Or do you plan on building a barn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here most of the time, and you and Sydney are always here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m happier having him stabled where someone\u2019s on duty 24/7.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d Andrew looked at Dustin. \u201cYou never know with a horse. I had some friends who lost two of their horses a few years back. No one was home. Somehow a pasture gate was left open. The horses got onto the road and were hit by a semi and they had to be put down. You just never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Joey yet?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cOn his way right now,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>Joey had been let out of a van that had the words Parsonage House written in script on the side. Two other boys stepped out\u2014Matt and Sean, Dustin saw. They headed into the office, while Joey walked toward them, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWe get to ride today, right?\u201d he asked Olivia. \u201cOh, hello, Dustin, Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still riding today,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cJoey, I have you on Trickster, and Andrew, I see you\u2019ve gotten Chapparal saddled. He\u2019ll be perfect for Dustin, unless he was saddled for someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all yours. In fact, Dustin brought him in. He\u2019s been here helping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Olivia nodded. \u201cWell, then, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, they were mounted and striking out beyond the pastures. The hills rose and fell until they reached a stretch of relatively flat land. Olivia said, \u201cOkay, Joey, we\u2019ll run them for a minute here, but we\u2019re not racing. Remember that everything we\u2019ve learned about trust and boundaries works when you\u2019re riding, too. Don\u2019t let Trickster take you. You\u2019re taking her.\u201d</p><p>Joey nodded, flushing with pleasure. Olivia glanced at him and Dustin nodded; she was going to head out first. He\u2019d bring up the rear.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a wild ride. It was a pleasant canter and then a brief gallop across the flat land. Olivia reined in first, waiting for the other two. Joey slipped sideways when Trickster reverted to a trot, but he gripped the horn of his western saddle for a moment, regaining his balance. He beamed at Olivia.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing okay,\u201d he said.</p><p>Olivia smiled at him but her smile faded. Dustin saw that she was gazing past Joey\u2014back up to the hill that rose between them and the Horse Farm.</p><p>He followed her line of vision. The sun was high; it seemed to cast shadows on the mound.</p><p>But Dustin saw someone there.</p><p>There, but not really there.</p><p>The image of a tall rider sitting proudly on a great steed gradually appeared. He wore a plumed hat and the gray-caped dress-coat of a Confederate general. Dustin thought he lifted a hand, almost as if in warning. Then the sun blazed brightly, coming from behind a white cloud, and the general was gone.</p><p>\u201cHey, Liv, you\u2019re coming on the camping trip tomorrow night, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Joey said, unaware.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d Olivia brought her attention back to the boy.</p><p>\u201cThe camping trip. You\u2019re coming, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes. I suppose so,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re coming, too,\u201d Joey looked at Dustin. \u201cYou said you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sounds like fun. I used to go on camping trips around here years ago,\u201d Dustin told him.</p><p>\u201cMariah\u2019s going to tell ghost stories,\u201d Joey said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good at talking about history, too,\u201d Olivia added a little sharply.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you can only have a ghost if you have the history of someone who lived,\u201d Joey said reasonably.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, but...history is important, Joey,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cThere was a famous philosopher named George Santayana who explained why it\u2019s so important to understand history. His words are often quoted. \u2018Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u2019 We need to learn from all the things that came before. It\u2019s a good thing that we remember the American Civil War\u2014especially when we see politics get heated today. Tennessee was the last state to secede from the Union, and the people were split on their beliefs throughout the war. East Tennessee actually tried to secede from Tennessee when it left the Union, but troops were sent in. The state was truly divided. The east was for the North, the west for the South\u2014and the middle of the state cast the deciding ballot. It was horribly sad and tragic here. Only the state of Virginia saw more battles. The Battle of Shiloh was, at the time, the bloodiest in the nation\u2019s history. But we learned from the war, Joey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn many ways,\u201d Dustin murmured.</p><p>Joey turned to face him, \u201cYeah, I know,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cMy dad told me they still study Civil War strategy. Like today, you wouldn\u2019t fight the same\u2014we have automatic weapons and bombs and drones and stuff. But the military today can still learn from the strategies they used back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe also learned about compromise and holding a country together,\u201d Dustin said, hoping he didn\u2019t sound too much as though he was lecturing. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be harsh now when we look at the past. Sometimes you have to wonder what the hell were they thinking, and you have to try to understand the context and the reasons\u2014and the mistakes. That\u2019s history, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why we get ghosts!\u201d Joey threw in cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cBut ghosts are good, too,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cFor instance, General Rufus Cunningham is a famous ghost around here, and he tells us a lot about humanity. He was a leader, but he didn\u2019t consider any of his men expendable. And he valued human life even when that life belonged to the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and he died. \u2018No good deed goes unpunished,\u2019\u201d Joey blurted out, grinning.</p><p>Olivia groaned. \u201cOh, I give up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKidding, just kidding!\u201d Joey said. \u201cI love the stories about the general. Are we going to ride? Or are we going to just sit here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take the forest trail to the curve, come back around and let them run again for a few minutes. It\u2019s beautiful riding through the trees,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>She led the way. Trickster tried to stop for grass, but Olivia reminded Joey that the horse shouldn\u2019t be calling the shots; he could give Trickster an apple back at the stables. Joey regained control, grinning at her proudly as he did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia rode on, and the others followed. She reined in at a copse, and they paused behind her. A doe and her young fawn were nibbling on short grasses near the edge, barely visible beneath the canopy of the trees.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Joey whispered.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go around. Maybe they won\u2019t bolt,\u201d Olivia said.</p> <p>They skirted the high pines, giving the doe and her fawn a wide berth. The doe looked up and stared at them. For a moment, her instinct and fear were visible. But she didn\u2019t move. She studied them, then went back to her nibbling. They guided their horses around her.</p><p>Dustin didn\u2019t see exactly what happened next. He heard something\u2014a whizzing sound in the air.</p><p>Shiloh let out a snort of terror and reared up. Olivia calmed him quickly, and turned to look at Dustin and Joey.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Joey said. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. The world\u2019s biggest bee, maybe.\u201d Olivia was in control, but Dustin saw that she was shaken. He heard rustling. It seemed to come from behind them.</p><p>He turned Chapparal. The horse could whirl around on a dime\u2014good thing for him at the moment. The trail was narrow here, but led back to the trees. The doe and her fawn were no longer there; they\u2019d obviously been spooked. He kept moving, inspecting the trail on the other side. He didn\u2019t see anything, but when he dismounted, he discovered that the ground had been disturbed and a number of low-hanging branches were broken. He continued to follow the trail, leaving Olivia and Joey behind. He heard Joey call out and paused, wanting to take his investigation all the way to the road\u2014but afraid to leave the two of them alone in the forest where something had, apparently, flown through the air with the speed of a bullet.</p><p>Had it been a bullet?</p><p>And had Olivia been a target?</p><p>Frustrated, he rode back to where Olivia and Joey waited for him.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p> <p>\u201cWeird!\u201d Joey said. \u201cA small bird. That\u2019s what it looked like from here. A dive-bombing bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw it?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, not exactly. I just heard something.... And I thought I saw something whiz by close to Liv and Shiloh\u2014a really fast bird, like I said\u2014but I don\u2019t know for sure. Maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to head back,\u201d Olivia broke in. \u201cI have another session this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot riding?\u201d Dustin realized his tone was sharper than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cNo, just in the pasture. A group session.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get to stay until five,\u201d Joey said. \u201cDouble with me against Sean and Matt at Ping-Pong?\u201d he asked Dustin.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll hang around,\u201d Dustin said, looking at Olivia. She showed no reaction, and he couldn\u2019t decide whether he was disappointed or relieved.</p> <p>As they rode back, Dustin kept watch on everything around them, still uneasy about the flying object that had whizzed by them all.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been the world\u2019s biggest bee.</p><p>Or a dive-bombing bird.</p><p>But neither, he thought, had it been a bullet. So what the hell...?</p><p>True to her word, she allowed Joey and the horses their time to run. Then they returned to the stables. As good \u201cguests,\u201d he and Joey took care of their mounts. Joey was happy to give Trickster the promised apple. Dustin enjoyed watching him with the horse as he assured Trickster that it was much better to have an apple at the end of a ride than munch on lousy grass during it.</p><p>He was still at the stables when Olivia went out with her next group; he wanted to keep an eye on her. But since she was surrounded by several people, he determined that she was going to be all right.</p><p>If something was going to \u201chappen\u201d to her it wouldn\u2019t be here\u2014in front of others.</p><p>Joey was waiting impatiently for him to play Ping-Pong. He decided he might as well oblige now.</p><p>Matt and Sean were there, too, eager to take them on. Dustin played the game, paying heed to what was going on around him, as well. Sandra Cheever swept by, telling them all, in her usual curt tones, to play fair, and marched into Aaron\u2019s office.</p><p>He thought he heard the two of them arguing.</p><p>When he and Joey took the game by a single point, he went to get coffee, trying to listen to what was being said in Aaron\u2019s office.</p><p>Sandra was speaking heatedly. Aaron was arguing with her in a soft, restrained voice.</p><p>\u201cBoy, and they\u2019re supposed to be teaching us to get along!\u201d Matt said sarcastically, coming up beside him.</p><p>Dustin grimaced. \u201cHave they been at it all afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Matt frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think they were here. In fact, I know they weren\u2019t. Aaron showed up about an hour ago and said hello to all of us. That was odd, \u2019cause usually there\u2019s someone in the office all the time\u2014when it\u2019s open, I mean. Hey, rematch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, just give me a minute,\u201d Dustin told him. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in the games room.\u201d</p><p>Matt nodded and sauntered off, and Dustin moved closer to the door. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s just wrong!\u201d Sandra Cheever was saying.</p><p>\u201cLook, it is what it is,\u201d he heard Aaron reply.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to take steps.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t get a chance to hear any more. Mariah Naughton came breezing in. \u201cHey, there, Secret Agent Man. I\u2019m thrilled you guys are coming on the camping trip. Liv sometimes comes along, and I love it when she does. I guarantee that you\u2019ll have a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you tell great ghost stories.\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand. \u201cOh, well, the area\u2019s full of them. I don\u2019t tell anything new. You know all about the general, I take it, since you\u2019re from around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certainly familiar with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNashville has great ghost stories, too!\u201d she said enthusiastically.</p><p>He nodded in response and she grinned. \u201cWell, I hope we\u2019re giving you the rest and relaxation you were looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. I\u2019m falling in love with horses all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s great, but...you have to fall in love with yourself again, too. That\u2019s part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way to finding out what I need,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>The door to the office flew open. Sandra Cheever burst out, looking somewhat flustered. Seeing the two of them, she regained her composure quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re finished with your sessions for the day?\u201d she asked Mariah.</p><p>\u201cYes, all done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good.\u201d Sandra turned to Dustin. \u201cAs soon as Olivia comes in, we\u2019ll close the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mason?\u201d Mariah asked.</p><p>\u201cHe had some business in Nashville this afternoon.\u201d Sandra shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go home! This has been a long day and I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>She turned abruptly and left them. A minute later, Olivia came in. Before she could speak, Aaron hurried out of his office. \u201cHey, Liv. I\u2019ve got the keys to Marcus\u2019s house, if you want them. You don\u2019t have to take them today, but I was thinking you might want to get those locks changed. Who knows how many keys Marcus might\u2019ve had made to give to friends\u2014or strangers!\u2014who needed a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Aaron. I will take them. I\u2014I...think I\u2019ll go by and just take a look at the place,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>While she was with Aaron, Dustin sent a text to the office in Virginia, asking for Marcus\u2019s address and directions to his house. He didn\u2019t want to head out with Olivia.</p><p>But he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let her go to that house alone. The Ping-Pong rematch would have to wait.</p><p>Marcus Danby\u2019s small ranch house really had no historic significance. It was little more than an extended log cabin with only one floor.</p><p>The front door opened into a small hallway; immediately to the right was the kitchen and beyond that a spacious living-dining area. Marcus had furnished it with quilted throws and handcrafted furniture. There was Native American art on the walls and various sculptures; he\u2019d loved dream catchers and there were a number of them scattered about.</p><p>Olivia stepped into the living room, switched on a light and looked around. \u201cMarcus?\u201d she said aloud.</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>A fine layer of dust was beginning to form on the furniture and objects. Other than that, it was just as Marcus had left it. Or so it appeared. Olivia glanced at the hall that led to the three small bedrooms. One he\u2019d kept as a guest room, one was an office and one was his own.</p><p>She walked into the living room and sat on one of the sofas. A quilt\u2014hand-stitched by the grandmother of one of their guests who\u2019d proven to be a success story\u2014was draped over a sofa. The sofa had also been handcrafted by another former guest who\u2019d started a furniture-making business. Marcus had always helped out, not just with his talks and the Horse Farm, but also by supporting those who were trying to make a new life for themselves.</p><p>She looked at the coffee table, carved from the trunk of an old tree. There were a number of colored pages on it\u2014drawings done by some of the boys who\u2019d stayed at Parsonage House.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re being a jerk as a ghost, but you were one hell of a good guy, Marcus,\u201d she said. She studied the drawings. She knew the boys were sometimes asked to draw what they saw as the demons of their pasts, and sometimes they were asked to draw what they saw as their futures.</p><p>She picked up one that Joey had done. It was actually a good drawing. He\u2019d portrayed a gaping black hole with demon eyes and razor-sharp teeth reaching into a sunlit room where he sat at a desk. Emptiness. Joey feared the emptiness of his life, she thought.</p><p>Hearing a sound behind her, Olivia started, jumping to her feet and whirling around in one motion.</p><p>It was Dustin. He still wore his casual tweed jacket over a denim shirt and the jeans he\u2019d been wearing earlier.</p><p>Somehow, she\u2019d known that he\u2019d come. He would come because Malachi had sent him here and because protecting her was part of his job description. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was glad he was there. He seemed to fill a room\u2014an area, even in the midst of a forest or pasture\u2014with confidence, with strength, like an invulnerable bastion.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d he asked her, clearly irritated.</p><p>So much for being glad to see him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m looking around Marcus\u2019s house,\u201d she said. \u201cMy house,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even lock the door!\u201d he admonished.</p><p>She flushed. She hadn\u2019t thought to lock the door; she wasn\u2019t accustomed to being worried about her every move.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were coming,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know who else might be coming,\u201d he said, still aggravated. He started walking into the house.</p> <p>To her amusement, he suddenly tripped. A corner of the rug stretched out on the hardwood floor had curled back.</p><p>Straightening, he swore softly.</p><p>\u201cHe has no right to be rude to you!\u201d Olivia heard.</p><p>Turning around, she saw that the ghost of Marcus Danby had decided to join them.</p><p>\u201cRude!\u201d Dustin snapped. \u201cWhat the hell? I\u2019m trying to keep her from getting killed, and you don\u2019t seem to be helping a whole lot!\u201d</p><p>Olivia turned again to look at Dustin, who was staring at Marcus.</p> <p>\u201cYou see him,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cOf course I see him. And hear him. And, Mr. Danby, under the circumstances, it\u2019s about time you stuck around to meet me,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cI need to know everything about you and everything you did on the day you were killed. Your memory might be the only thing that can keep Olivia alive.\u201d</p><p>Marcus, startled\u2014and offended\u2014made his ghostly way across the room to stand in front of Dustin. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re FBI. You have to find the truth of this. I\u2019m not the one putting Olivia in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou put her in danger the minute you dragged her into this!\u201d Dustin snapped.</p><p>\u201cHey, someone killed me! It\u2019s not just Olivia\u2019s life that\u2019s at stake. The Horse Farm itself is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019d get her killed, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could hear me. I had to tell someone the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she began.</p> <p>But neither seemed to hear her.</p><p>\u201cYou need to be worried about her safety before anything else,\u201d Dustin was saying.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have to find my killer,\u201d Marcus countered. \u201cThat\u2019ll keep her out of danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you obviously have the information we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re the one with all the advantages. You\u2019re the one\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s...alive.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>Marcus\u2019s final statement apparently won the argument. Within minutes, he and Olivia were seated on the sofa, while Dustin was in a wing-back chair across the coffee table from them.</p><p>Olivia and Dustin had coffee\u2014black. Marcus had told them the coffee was fine, but since he\u2019d been dead for a while now, the milk probably wasn\u2019t so good. Olivia should throw it out.</p><p>Marcus went over the day of his death with Dustin; Dustin asked for details but Marcus really couldn\u2019t tell them anything they didn\u2019t already know. Dustin pressed him, anyway.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you heard the dog from the woods and you went to find him. That\u2019s the last you remember?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I just said that,\u201d Marcus replied in an exasperated tone.</p><p>\u201cWhich woods? Where were you exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly.... There\u2019s a riding trail\u2014the only real trail. You\u2019ll see little paths here and there, but if you were on horseback, you\u2019d have to take the trail. That\u2019s where I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it was daylight, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Although it was a little overcast. The canopy of the pines and the other trees can create this green darkness that\u2019s almost surreal. When we have fog, it\u2019s like being in a fantasyland,\u201d Marcus said.</p><p>Dustin ignored his lyrical description. \u201cHow far had you gone in?\u201d he asked briskly.</p><p>\u201cA hundred yards or so? I\u2019d reached the copse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you feel a pain in your head? A prick in your arm? Anything that would explain how you lost consciousness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo... Yes! Maybe. I thought I\u2019d been stung by a bee...or gotten a spider bite. Something like that. Something you don\u2019t even pay attention to,\u201d Marcus said.</p><p>\u201cThe medical examiner has released the information that there were drugs in your system. We have to figure out how they got there,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing in this house, I can assure you of that,\u201d Marcus responded indignantly.</p><p>Dustin looked at Olivia. \u201cAnd tomorrow, at work, you should say that you searched all over the house and you didn\u2019t find anything\u2014but that you\u2019re resigned to the fact that Marcus must have suffered a relapse and hidden his stash in the forest somewhere,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Marcus demanded indignantly.</p><p>\u201cSomeone tried to get into Olivia\u2019s home last night, Marcus,\u201d Dustin told him.</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh, no!\u201d Marcus said, giving Olivia an anguished look.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were coming back,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I meant to, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made some discoveries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cI never knew Aaron and Sandra were sleeping together,\u201d Marcus said.</p><p>\u201cYou were spying on them?\u201d Olivia shook her head in disgust.</p><p>\u201cNot the way you think. I...went to the Horse Farm and Aaron was still there. I went\u2014\u201d He paused. There was an air of sadness about him that seemed palpable. \u201cI went out to see the horses. Big Orange Cat was hanging around in Zeus\u2019s stall, and I swear that animal could feel me there, feel me pet him. That\u2019s a great cat, Agent\u2014if you\u2019re thinking of adopting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great mouser, too, Marcus. Good in the stables,\u201d Olivia pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s special. Ah, hell, they\u2019re all special.\u201d Marcus sighed.</p><p>\u201cMarcus,\u201d Dustin said, steering him back. \u201cWhen you were at the stables last night, did you see Sydney or Drew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but they were in their apartments,\u201d Marcus answered.</p><p>\u201cBoth apartments are upstairs. Sydney\u2019s is above the stable office and Drew\u2019s is over the tack room,\u201d Olivia clarified for Dustin\u2019s benefit.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know they were in their rooms? Did you go up?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cI could hear Drew playing an old Beatles album. Sydney was watching that reality show about people who own wildly expensive collectibles and don\u2019t even know it,\u201d Marcus said.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t actually see either of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because when I was in the stables, I heard noise over at the main office, so I went there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you see Aaron and Sandra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m not sure where Sandra came from. She might have stayed there after closing. Maybe she was just doing paperwork in the peace and quiet and fell asleep on one of the sofas. I\u2019ve seen Sandra stay over to do paperwork and reports occasionally. Aaron drove in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra said she was going straight home,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>Marcus shrugged in response.</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d Olivia asked him.</p><p>He looked at her curiously. \u201cTime...\u201d he repeated slowly.</p><p>\u201cYes, what time was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know. It\u2019s really not much of a concept to me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that explain why you didn\u2019t come back to my house last night?\u201d</p><p>Marcus seemed stricken by the reminder. \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really can\u2019t help her, Marcus,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon? I can warn her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but, you\u2019re right. The responsibility falls to me. As you pointed out, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s living.\u201d</p><p>Olivia wanted to pat Marcus\u2019s leg and remembered that she couldn\u2019t. \u201cA warning is always helpful, Marcus. And I would\u2019ve appreciated one last night,\u201d she muttered under her breath.</p><p>Dustin leaned forward. \u201cMarcus, when you walked into the woods, do you remember hearing anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI walked in because the dog was yelping\u2014crying. I knew Sammy was hurt,\u201d Marcus explained. \u201cDid I hear anything else? Yes, actually. Something like a...flying sound. A buzzing? Sort of like a mosquito next to your ear. But then I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then you lost consciousness,\u201d Dustin finished.</p><p>Marcus nodded in a dazed way. \u201cYou\u2019re really not safe, are you, Liv? I have put you in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my responsibility now,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Olivia exploded. \u201cI\u2019m not anyone\u2019s responsibility. I\u2019m an adult. We\u2019re all here to discover the truth behind Marcus\u2019s death, not to treat me like...like an infant.\u201d</p><p>Both men stared at her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get killed?\u201d Marcus asked fiercely.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, let\u2019s see. He\u2019s a trained FBI agent and you\u2019re not. I say you need to let him take responsibility,\u201d Marcus told her.</p><p>She threw up her hands. \u201cCan we not make it sound so...pathetic?\u201d</p><p>They both looked at her again and then at each other. Dustin resumed his questioning. \u201cOkay, Marcus, this is important. You believe\u2014but you\u2019re not certain\u2014that Sydney and Drew were in their rooms last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know where Sandra Cheever was, but Aaron drove back to the Horse Farm. And you believe they\u2019re having an affair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Discreet, of course. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would explain today,\u201d Dustin murmured. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about today?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cI think they were arguing. This was before Sandra left\u2014she said she was going straight home, by the way\u2014then you came in. I didn\u2019t have a chance to find out what the argument was about, though. My, uh, eavesdropping was interrupted by Mariah, who started talking about the camping trip tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Marcus nodded. \u201cThe camping trip. If you\u2019re together, then Liv will be safe. But what about tonight? Someone could come looking for her here\u2014or at her own house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought about that. I figured we\u2019d go into Nashville. There\u2019s a small chain motel on the outskirts. Actually,\u201d he said, glancing at Olivia, \u201cI was going to suggest a break. We could go in for dinner and get a couple of rooms at the motel. Olivia can leave her car at her place in case anyone\u2019s watching. It\u2019s more plausible that I might be in the city, since people know I have a sister who lives there. She\u2019s not in town at the moment, but no one knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Marcus said approvingly.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Olivia decided she had to put a stop to the way they were assuming control\u2014or at least get them to acknowledge her rights in this situation. \u201cI truly appreciate all the responsibility you two feel you need to take, but I\u2019d prefer to be involved in these decisions,\u201d Olivia told them.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Olivia, I would like us to have dinner in Nashville. Would that be all right? And in the interests of keeping you alive\u2014without me sleeping in your living room, which will certainly elicit an eternal round of gossip\u2014would you like to stay in that lovely little motel off I-40?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that sounds lovely, thank you,\u201d she said primly. \u201cI just need to be kept in the loop, okay?\u201d</p> <p>Loop? The two of them were talking to a ghost.</p><p>Yet, even as she spoke, she saw that Marcus seemed to be fading.</p><p>\u201cBe safe, kiddies,\u201d Marcus said, his voice growing as faint as his image. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to stay around that long.... Still getting the hang of this....\u201d</p><p>He was gone. They were talking to an empty space on the sofa.</p><p>For a moment, Olivia felt awkward. She was so intensely aware of being there alone with Dustin. There was something about him, a quality that made him the focus in any room. And it was attractive and seductive.</p><p>She cleared her throat, trying to concentrate. \u201cYou\u2019re really afraid for me to stay by myself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need a few things. Just pack an overnight bag. We\u2019ll go to your house, so you can deal with the dog and collect your things. I\u2019ll follow you and keep watch from a safe distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Don\u2019t you need to pack a bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have extra clothes in the rental car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to dinner?\u201d she asked. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be doing...something to solve this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow I intend to search the woods until I find what flew by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that someone\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think someone\u2019s afraid of you. I think you\u2019re in danger. You have to make sure you\u2019re always with a group of people\u2014or with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it day by day,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll let Malachi and Jackson know that we have to get some members of the Krewe units out here. In fact, I\u2019ll call Malachi while I wait for you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSo where are we going for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA place my sister loves. F. Scott\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said your sister\u2019s not in Nashville right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. She\u2019s in London on tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTour? What does she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a country music singer.\u201d</p><p>Olivia stared at him, bemused. \u201cReally? That\u2019s fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be prejudiced, but she\u2019s pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRayna Blake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! Rayna Blake\u2019s your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her as the opening act for the Band Perry. She\u2019s extremely talented.\u201d</p><p>She kept smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Country music star, federal agent. Your parents must be very interesting people!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they are,\u201d he assured her. \u201cHistorians. Very interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad she\u2019s not here doing a concert. I\u2019m sure you could get really good tickets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d have to go to London for that\u2014which is where my parents happen to be. And...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo London.\u201d Olivia laughed. \u201cWay too complicated. Just Nashville,\u201d she said. \u201cWanna do a ghost tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in a group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Why not?\u201d</p><p>He stood and she did the same. She felt strange, awkward, yet somehow exhilarated and even a little frightened. That fear wasn\u2019t about the threat of death or attack, but the thought of an evening with him.... She quickly turned and headed for the door. None of this was real, she told herself.</p><p>Only, Marcus\u2019s death had been real.</p><p>Dustin parked down on the road while Olivia drove up to her house. Although she lived in an area where every home had acreage around it\u2014whether that was owned by the household, pasture belonging to nearby farmers or land owned by the park service\u2014the front of her house was clearly visible from the road. No large bushes provided hiding.</p><p>The hiding places lay to the sides and the rear, where forests flourished.</p><p>In this section of the countryside, \u201cneighbors\u201d were far away.</p><p>He watched, trying not to smile as she came out. He\u2019d given her a small bag of dirt to scatter on the front porch. He wanted to know if anyone tried to drop in on her that night.</p><p>She was actually pretty good at being unobtrusive as she spread the dirt around. He didn\u2019t think anyone was watching the house at that time. He kept a careful eye on the front; he doubted that anyone hiding in the woods would be able to see exactly what she was doing.</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe they were dealing with a master criminal, although he was equally certain the killer wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><p>She hurried down the dirt-and-stone drive to the street where he was parked and slid into the car. She carried a large backpack rather than a suitcase, and he found himself pleased that she\u2019d evidently realized a backpack might go anywhere while a suitcase would advertise the fact that she was going away.</p><p>\u201cIs this the right thing to do?\u201d she asked anxiously, fastening her seat belt. \u201cI mean, shouldn\u2019t we be doing more to pursue the killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t burst into homes and demand that people let me interrogate them,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re doing what\u2019s most important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking sure the killer doesn\u2019t strike again.\u201d He drove in silence as they headed for the highway.</p><p>\u201cYou do know exactly where you\u2019re going,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve told you\u2014I really am from Nashville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was convenient for us all.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t quite tell what the tone of her voice meant so he didn\u2019t respond. It was already growing late so he drove straight to the restaurant. F. Scott\u2019s was a casual place where some dressed up and some dressed down and the music and food were good. Their table was in a corner by the wall; when they were seated, it seemed intimate. He couldn\u2019t help marveling again that she could look like her cousin\u2014and be so beautiful.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you staring at me?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cHonestly? I was finding it incredible that you could look so much like Malachi\u2014but be so attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalachi is very handsome!\u201d she said, defending her cousin. \u201cAnd thank you. I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>The waitress arrived. Olivia ordered a Jack Daniel\u2019s on the rocks; he opted for the same. They both decided on steak and their order was in.</p><p>She sipped her drink when it was served but still looked restless. \u201cI just wish we could be doing something more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe actually are,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWe are? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in the offices, they\u2019re sifting through backgrounds and finding out everything that they can about everyone involved with the Horse Farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve done that, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just keep going deeper and deeper,\u201d he said. \u201cTrying different approaches and looking for new connections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd does that help?\u201d she asked. She rubbed the condensation on her glass. \u201cI guess I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll never get to the truth.\u201d</p><p>He was surprised when he found himself reaching across the table to take her hand. \u201cWe will. That\u2019s what the Krewe units do.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t pull away.</p><p>\u201cThis is all new to me,\u201d she said. \u201cMalachi was working for himself and the next thing I know he\u2019s at the academy. I researched the Krewe of Hunters and read between the lines. I asked him a lot of questions. I was stunned to discover that he\u2019s really happy. He\u2019s engaged to a coworker and...and then when this happened and I called him...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ended up with me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply; their food arrived. When the waitress left, Olivia cut a piece of meat and asked, \u201cHow did you come to be part of...this? How did you find the Krewe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey found me. Actually, Malachi was partnered in New Orleans with a detective who joined the force in Savannah. And I worked with the same guy, David Caswell, in Savannah. He\u2019d suggested me before your situation came up, and since I do know Nashville and vicinity, it seemed like a good time and place to start.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019d wanted to get in with the Krewe\u2014but you don\u2019t just apply for it. And guess what, Ms. Gordon? I have seniority over your cousin. He got roped into the academy through the Krewe. I was already an agent when I got recruited.\u201d He stopped talking. He didn\u2019t need to defend himself.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m just glad someone believed me. Except that I knew Malachi would.\u201d She inhaled a shaky breath. \u201cHow...how did you find out? Are you one of those people who sees them\u2014\u201d She broke off, and lowered her voice. \u201cWho often sees ghosts?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cOften enough. It started when I was a kid. I used to talk to an old fellow who haunts a tavern\u2014the place where I first met your cousin, by the way\u2014and my parents thought I had an imaginary friend. I think, prior to that, I was intended to be an only child. No, I think I was a surprise myself. But I do know I made them decide to have another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have been a wonderful kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I scared them. Anytime Rayna starts getting uppity with me, I remind her that she might not have existed if it weren\u2019t for my \u2018imaginary\u2019 friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gets uppity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccasionally.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut not usually. She\u2019s a good kid. And she\u2019s the perfect product of Nashville. She loves music. In fact, she\u2019s like a kid herself when she sees others perform.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAha! It\u2019s parental and sibling issues that plague you! We can work on that at the Horse Farm,\u201d she said solemnly, but a small smile curved her lips.</p><p>He grinned, sitting back. \u201cMy parents are great people, too. They\u2019re major-league academics and spend their lives pursuing interesting places and knowledge, even in retirement. They don\u2019t see ghosts or believe in them. Ghosts aren\u2019t scientifically verifiable, in their opinion. What about you? What\u2019s your history with ghosts?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to avoid seeing them\u2014or else I tell myself that I don\u2019t see them. But of course Malachi always knew and when I needed someone to talk to about a ghost or...when I was scared, I talked to him.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou may already know this, but Malachi has a live-in ghost who\u2019s friendly, charming and interesting. I\u2019ve always seen General Cunningham, but I guess I usually pretend I don\u2019t. None of this is easy.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. So, tell me about the jerk who left you. Did that have to do with you seeing ghosts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d she said, straightening. \u201cHe\u2019s not a jerk. No, it had nothing to do with ghosts. He never suspected I saw anything...unusual. He\u2019s in music, like your sister. A producer. He had fabulous opportunities in Austin. He asked me to come with him, but I knew our relationship wasn\u2019t really going anywhere. We were...comfortable together. That\u2019s all we were by then. So, what about you? Did the love of your life slap you down in public for being too inquisitive?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, setting down his fork. \u201cNo. No love of my life. In high school, I became involved with the police because I\u2019d seen a ghost. Naturally, I didn\u2019t tell them that.\u201d He hesitated and then shrugged. Her life had been laid bare for him; no reason not to tell the truth. \u201cI was dating the high school prom queen, the puppy love of my young life, when I met Sarah Sharman. She\u2019s dead, by the way, and she was dead when I \u2018met\u2019 her.</p> <p>\u201cShe was standing outside the alley where I\u2019d wait for my sister. I\u2019d pick her up after her private music class. So I talked with this young woman who seemed very sad. After I\u2019d seen her a few times, I guess I wound up having an adolescent crush on her. I said I wanted to take her out somewhere, make her happy. She said, \u2018Oh, Dustin, don\u2019t you understand? I can\u2019t go anywhere. I just stay here, and I watch and I wait and I try to help.\u2019 Turns out this killer was kidnapping women and taking them to a derelict meat plant, and what he was doing before they died is...not dinner conversation. Anyway, she gave me some details that I passed on to the police, and they caught him before he could kill the next girl. I claimed I\u2019d overheard a conversation in an alley. It all turned into a big deal, and I tried to hide from it. In the midst of talking to the police and the whole thing, I missed some school, missed some games...and my high school queen ended up with the quarterback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was your last affair?\u201d she asked dubiously. \u201cIf affair\u2019s the right word.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThe last one that broke my heart, anyway. I was seeing someone in Savannah for a while. But I was restless, and I wanted to go to the academy. So I guess I\u2019m the jerk. I felt I had to leave. We split up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there were a few brief interludes. We never exchanged numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhh,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means...oh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never wanted to have a wild, fantastic night with no obligations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds...meaningless.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWell, it is meaningless. That\u2019s the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never lonely? You\u2019d never like a night where you were with someone, no commitment? Or where you just go out?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m boring, I guess. I don\u2019t just go out. We don\u2019t have that many places to just go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never come to the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do. Sometimes we all go to the Ryman Center for a concert, or come in to see a movie or...we go bowling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBowling is fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBowling is fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! I\u2019m agreeing with you. So, let me get this straight. The guy you weren\u2019t really in love with went to Austin. And you decided to remain unattached. Single and celibate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not that it\u2019s your concern, but I haven\u2019t decided anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnline dating!\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the answer.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, shaking her head. \u201cNo, but don\u2019t knock it. I do have friends who\u2019ve found the loves of their lives through online dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always wonder what happens when everything looks perfect but you meet someone and you just don\u2019t gel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you part ways. Maybe you should try online dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do I put? \u2018Must love ghosts and be willing to spend long evenings waiting for them to appear\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at that and smoothed her napkin on the table. \u201cSpeaking of ghosts... We\u2019ve got ten minutes to make the downtown ghost tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get going.\u201d</p><p>He was afraid she\u2019d argue over the check, but he insisted and she acquiesced. A few minutes later, he was finding parking downtown at the meeting spot, and they joined the group and listened to the stories. Dustin was astonished to realize what a good time he was having with her. They heard a few stories that might have occurred anywhere, like the one about the waitress who haunted a particular bar, serving up ale when people weren\u2019t expecting it. Apparently she was still waiting for her soldier to return from the war. They heard about the four thousand Native Americans who died as U.S. policy forced them from their homes to reservations west of the Tennessee border. They went by the Ryman Auditorium\u2014originally the Union Gospel Tabernacle and still undisputed mother church of country music. Dustin teased her that he could\u2019ve given her a much better tour\u2014an insider\u2019s tour\u2014if his sister had been home.</p><p>When they came to the capitol building, the guide went into a coughing fit and kept excusing himself. Olivia hurried to a nearby bar to get him some water. Dustin was actually feeling so comfortable and relaxed that he offered to tell the story. The distressed guide raised his eyebrows; Dustin launched in. Olivia, running back with a bottle of water, looked at him curiously.</p><p>He bowed to her and began his speech.</p><p>\u201cWhen Tennessee first became a state, the capital was Knoxville\u2014Nashville was the frontier back then, little more than a wilderness. But by 1806, Nashville was starting to thrive. Yeah...a lot of outlying areas were still wilderness, but she was now becoming a great city. An important city. So Nashville was voted as the capital but the seat of government was just a small building. In 1845, Architect William Strickland was hired to construct the new capitol building. He fought constantly with Samuel Morgan during the many years it took to get the building completed. Morgan, called the \u2018Merchant Prince of Nashville,\u2019 had been appointed by the Capitol Commission to oversee construction. The two men did not get into a duel or murder each other, but alas, they both died, William Strickland in 1854, Morgan some years later, in 1880. The capitol building wasn\u2019t complete at Strickland\u2019s death, but he would be interred in a vault within its walls. This honor went to only one other man\u2014Samuel Morgan. Today, people believe, you can still hear the two of them, arguing eternally over the most minute details of construction.\u201d</p><p>By then the guide had recovered. He asked if Dustin would mind if he took over again, and Dustin stepped back beside Olivia. Not thinking, he placed an arm around her shoulders. She laughed at the guide\u2019s antics and didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>When the tour was over, he drove back to the small chain motel, where they checked into adjoining rooms under his name alone.</p><p>He bade Olivia good-night and went to his own room. He\u2019d slipped his Glock into the top drawer of his bedside table and had stripped down to his briefs when there was a knock at the adjoining door.</p><p>He rose and walked over, opening it partially.</p><p>Olivia stood there in a sheer black gown with red trim. It might have been the most seductive garment he\u2019d ever seen\u2014on the most seductive body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d His voice was too deep, too gruff.</p><p>\u201cI...was thinking about those one-night no-obligation flings you talked about.\u201d</p> <p>He felt as if he\u2019d suddenly become paralyzed, and then he felt as if someone had set him on fire. He lowered his head, fighting the fierce longing that ripped through him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI apologize. I can tell that...\u201d She started to step back, to close her side of the door. He stopped her, his hand firmly on the door she would have closed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d he asked her, his tone harsh. \u201cI do know your number\u2014and it would mean something.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t fight him. She didn\u2019t run in embarrassment.</p><p>She met his eyes. \u201cYes, yes, it would. Thank you. Thank you for rejecting me. I think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d never really reject you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She looked down and then back up at him, a trace of amusement in her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet. Thank you again. And good night.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shut the door, and he allowed her to do so. He went to bed, knowing he should have been seeking a killer in his mind even as he fell asleep. He should have been thinking about clues, about putting together small pieces of information in some logical order.</p><p>Instead...</p><p>He dreamed of what the night might have been.</p><p>8</p> <p>No way out of it. Olivia was almost certain that the morning would be incredibly awkward. She wasn\u2019t sure why she\u2019d done what she\u2019d done; maybe it was the way they\u2019d laughed together or how much they\u2019d shared. Maybe it was simply that she\u2019d been impressed with the man from the moment she\u2019d seen him. Maybe it was the fact that she\u2019d given too much of herself and her life to the Horse Farm.</p><p>It was a wonderful place. No, they weren\u2019t a cure-all or a fix for everything that befell humanity. They didn\u2019t cause autism to vanish; they didn\u2019t make Down syndrome disappear. They couldn\u2019t automatically make an addict see the light. But they did help people learn about trust, self-worth and their ability to control themselves, their own lives, within the world around them. Most important, perhaps, to believe that they could love themselves. All this because of Marcus Danby.</p><p>All of it could be ruined. And here she was, upset about being rejected when she\u2019d made her first sexually aggressive move ever. An action she still didn\u2019t entirely understand...</p><p>But what a nice rejection.</p><p>For a moment, mortification seized her. Did men talk? Would he call Malachi and say, \u201cThat cousin of yours is really something. She tried to hop into my bed last night.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think so\u2014oh, not that men didn\u2019t talk! She just didn\u2019t think Dustin would be so callous.</p><p>She\u2019d just finished brushing her hair when there was a tap on the connecting door. She opened it. Dustin was dressed and ready to go. \u201cI figure you have to be at work,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI do. But I have to go by the house first to take care of Sammy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. Sorry. I was planning on stopping at your place first, anyway. I want to see if we have footprints on your porch.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cYou can tell I don\u2019t have a pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have a pet,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou\u2019d be a good pet owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPets deserve more than I can give,\u201d he said. He glanced at his watch. \u201cLet\u2019s grab some coffee in the lobby and drive to your house. After that, once you get your own car, I\u2019m still going to follow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>She picked up her backpack and they walked to the lobby, where the motel offered coffee and Danishes. They each filled cups and quickly chose some food.</p><p>To her relief, their time together wasn\u2019t awkward at all. He was completely natural. Still fun, still quick to smile, even quicker to tease her.</p><p>But when he pulled into her driveway, he sat there for a few seconds, looking over at her. It was going to get awkward then, she just knew it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to say what I want to say, what I want you to know. I can\u2019t tell you how much I would have loved to have been with you last night. You\u2019re...spellbinding. That\u2019s the only word I can think of. You must have some idea how attractive you are. More than attractive\u2014beautiful, inside and out. And I admire what you do. But...I wouldn\u2019t want just one night. I\u2019d want a lot more. And we both know what it\u2019s like when people leave\u2014or when you have to go.\u201d</p><p>She gazed down at her hands and then raised her eyes to meet his. \u201cWhen I said thank you, I meant it. You were really decent about the...situation. You were honest\u2014and kind. You\u2019re a good person.\u201d To her, there was no higher praise.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not. I spent years being bitter and wondering why I was a freak. Then I spent more years patting myself on the back for being a freak\u2014but for dealing with it so well. I finally figured out that my...unusual skills could be of some service in the right line of... Good? Decent? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m kind of hard and brash and not always socially adept. I\u2019m constantly looking over my shoulder. But I do care about you, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a dog who must really need to go out by now,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled, lowering his head. \u201cYeah. But first...\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to expect when he opened the compartment between the seats. What he produced was a can that looked like it might contain hair spray.</p><p>\u201cPepper spray,\u201d he told her. \u201cBetter than nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlip this tab. That\u2019s it\u2014no safety or anything. Flip the tab. Keep it on you at all times, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a little tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t carry things when I\u2019m working. I leave my purse in the office, and I shove my phone in a jeans pocket.\u201d</p><p>He sighed with exasperation. \u201cI was afraid of that,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep the pepper spray with you, in your bag, so you have it while you\u2019re in your car, or going to and from your car\u2014whenever you\u2019re out. I\u2019ve got something else that\u2019ll do during the day. This is the best I can manage unless you want to go to a shooting range, and that can\u2019t be done for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He reached into the console compartment again. The next thing he took out looked like lipstick.</p><p>\u201cThis one, you do have to pull the cap. It\u2019s also pepper spray. It works just like a tiny perfume bottle. The spray is small but you can at least aim for the eyes and blind someone temporarily.\u201d</p><p>She took it from him. \u201cThis will fit in my pocket,\u201d she said. She\u2019d bent close to listen to him and could feel the energy of his body, which seemed to radiate to hers. They looked at each other. She\u2019d already been rejected once, but...</p><p>She leaned in even closer and kissed him swiftly. Felt his lips, and the vibrant aura of assurance about him. Something threatened to spring to life and she instantly pulled away\u2014not giving him another chance to reject her. Then she opened her door to get out of the car.</p><p>Oddly, she was hurting more than she had last evening. But, of course, he was right. If they got involved, where could they go with it?</p><p>\u201cWait up,\u201d Dustin said, exiting the car and running behind her. He stepped in front, blocking her as they reached the porch. \u201cSomeone\u2019s been here,\u201d he said.</p><p>She glanced around him at the porch. The dirt she\u2019d left yesterday had been disturbed. He moved ahead of her gingerly, hunkering down to study the prints in the dirt. She bent down to look. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough to get a clear impression. But I\u2019d say a man in boots\u2014probably a size twelve or thirteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be Aaron, Mason, Sydney or Drew,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cOr half the men in the area. It\u2019s horse country, farm country\u2014cow country, too. Everyone wears boots.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBut who gained the most from Marcus\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she replied unhappily, \u201cAaron.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and smiled grimly at her. \u201cThat means Aaron might have been here. On the other hand, the fact that he benefited from the will doesn\u2019t prove anything. So...it could equally be someone else. And whoever it was may well have come here to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we haven\u2019t got anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re getting an alarm put in tomorrow,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI have to let Sammy out and feed him.\u201d</p><p>He stepped aside, and she started to open the door, inserting the key. She gave him a questioning look before she turned it, despite Sammy\u2019s frantic barking.</p><p>He raised his voice. \u201cWe already know that whoever came here wears gloves,\u201d he said. \u201cThis person wouldn\u2019t have known if you were here or at Marcus\u2019s house, but probably tried both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if someone asks where I was last night, what do I say?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cMy guess is that no one will ask because no one\u2019s going to admit he was hunting you down.\u201d Dustin shrugged. \u201cOr if someone does ask\u2014and there is, of course, a slight chance that your visitor was legitimate\u2014you can say you were going back and forth between the two places. That\u2019s not even a lie. You were at both houses last night.\u201d</p><p>Olivia opened the door. Sammy greeted her as if she\u2019d been gone an eternity. \u201cHey, boy! It was just overnight,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Either Sammy didn\u2019t know it was Dustin\u2019s idea they not spend the previous night there or he was so happy to see anyone human that he leaped up on Dustin in a frenzied greeting. \u201cDown, boy, down, and I\u2019ll scratch ya good, I promise.\u201d Dustin kept his promise, and Sammy barked happily, then headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cDoes he need a leash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really, but\u2014\u201d Olivia broke off, remembering that the dog had recently been injured. \u201cOne of us should be out with him. He\u2019ll just run around and then head to his spot at the side of the house.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got him,\u201d Dustin said. Olivia set her bag down. She hurried into the kitchen to refill the dog\u2019s food and water, then changed her mind. Sammy was coming to work with her. The camping trip was tonight, and she\u2019d leave him at the Farm with Sydney.</p><p>She ran upstairs and packed fresh clothes, then exchanged the regular shoes she\u2019d been wearing for her boots. When she hurried down, Dustin and Sammy were back inside. \u201cHe\u2019s coming with us today,\u201d she told Dustin.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d They went out again, Dustin starting for his car, and Olivia for hers. He made an abrupt turn.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your schedule today?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo groups in the morning. A couple of hours with a patient\u2014but only in the pasture\u2014this afternoon. A group meeting with Mariah and the kids coming on the camping trip at five. And then we all head out.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cAre you going to be around during the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some business to deal with, so I\u2019ll need a few hours this morning. Nothing\u2019s going to happen to you while you\u2019re with the groups. I should be back by about noon. First, though, I\u2019m going to see that you get there safely, and please keep that pepper spray handy.\u201d</p><p>She waved, and Sammy jumped into the car. \u201cYou can hang around the horses but you have to behave, okay, Sammy?\u201d</p><p>Sammy gave a pleased whine, obviously grateful that he wasn\u2019t being left home again.</p> <p>He could call it professional interest. Or curiosity. Either way, Dustin wasn\u2019t really worried about getting into the morgue.</p><p>And, in fact, it wasn\u2019t difficult. He flashed his badge. The handsome middle-aged woman at the reception desk accepted his credentials without question and told him she\u2019d page Dr. Wilson. A moment later, he came out and shook Dustin\u2019s hand.</p><p>Dustin told the most plausible story he could, which was\u2014in the midst of his lie\u2014the truth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m attending the Horse Farm, doing a few sessions there. It\u2019s a vacation with some therapy thrown in. I\u2019ve been on some rough cases lately,\u201d he told Wilson.</p><p>Wilson shook his head. \u201cI worked L.A. for a while and wound up doing autopsies on some of the victims of a serial killer\u2014a sexual sadist. I can see where you guys might need a break now and then.\u201d Wilson seemed trustworthy and solid. He was probably in his late fifties, lean, with white hair that was thinning and tufted on top. \u201cCome on into my office,\u201d he invited.</p><p>When Dustin was seated in front of him, he asked, \u201cWhat can I do for you, Agent Blake?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right to the point. I\u2019m interested in Marcus Danby. I\u2019ve become aware of some, shall we say, dubious circumstances concerning the way he died. What can you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Danby was buried four days after his death, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour days? It was about eight, wasn\u2019t it, before you let the police have the results of the autopsy?\u201d</p><p>Wilson nodded. \u201cI was holding off. Not stalling, mind you, but holding off. I was waiting on a few of the tests I had done because, frankly, I didn\u2019t want the truth out there. Trust me\u2014every move I made was within the law. But I have to say, it broke my heart to release that report. I sent a nephew out to do some sessions at the Horse Farm. Changed his life. Well, I guess the whole rehab thing I got him into had a lot to do with it, but the Horse Farm gave him a new direction. He\u2019s still working with horses. He bought into a hack ranch in the area. Anyway, I had a lot of respect for Marcus Danby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did he take the drugs?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was easy to find. Needle mark right in the crook of his arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there was no drug paraphernalia found near him. And it appeared to be a first-time event for Marcus? I heard that he\u2019d been clean for decades.\u201d</p><p>The medical examiner nodded again. \u201cNo collapsed veins, nothing to indicate he\u2019d relapsed at any point before. Just the one needle mark.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd no needles anywhere around him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work on the human body, Agent Blake. The police are responsible for finding evidence. I can only tell you that Marcus Danby did receive a lethal dose of heroin that caused his heart to fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo alcohol in his system, or some kind of pain relaxer or antianxiety pill that might have made him want to go further?\u201d Dustin noted that Dr. Wilson had said \u201creceived\u201d rather than \u201cshot up\u201d or any other term.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just heroin.\u201d</p><p>Dustin leaned forward. \u201cDo you really believe the man killed himself\u2014accidentally or otherwise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just look at facts, Agent Blake,\u201d Wilson said.</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you for your time. I really have no official standing here, you know,\u201d Dustin told him, getting to his feet.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Wilson rose, too, and Dustin turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cOdd, though,\u201d Wilson said in a low voice. Dustin immediately turned back. \u201cSuppose a man who\u2019d been clean for over twenty years suddenly decided he couldn\u2019t take the pressure anymore, that he had to feel the high one more time... Suppose that happened. He was off by himself. He could\u2019ve had a stash in the woods. But...if it were me, I would\u2019ve shot up between the toes, done it somewhere hard to find. That way\u2014if I wasn\u2019t planning on killing myself, and I don\u2019t think Marcus was\u2014it would be much harder for anyone to see.\u201d He paused. \u201cAddicts know about these things, these little tricks.\u201d</p><p>Dustin studied the medical examiner for a moment. \u201cThanks again for your time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been very informative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I don\u2019t even remember that you were here.\u201d</p><p>Matt Dougal, Sean Modine, Nick Stevens, Joey Walters and Brent Lockwood were scheduled to be in Olivia\u2019s early group that morning. They\u2019d be staying all day, helping out at the stables and joining Mariah\u2019s tour and campout that night. Olivia was gratified to be working with everyone in this group.</p><p>When the boys from Parsonage House had first started doing group with Brent, they\u2019d giggled behind the young man\u2019s back, making fun of his Down syndrome. Brent had quickly proven how adept he could be with horses; he\u2019d shown them nothing but unconditional acceptance and had beaten the heck out of them in a game of Pictionary following a session.</p><p>They\u2019d learned a lot from working with Brent. She believed Brent had learned to be himself, discovering that he could have fun with others\u2014and his parents had learned that they didn\u2019t need to be everywhere with him, protecting him.</p><p>As Brent had once told the boys, \u201cI know you\u2019ll like me or you won\u2019t. But if you don\u2019t accept me the way I am, well, I may have Down syndrome, but that means you\u2019re the ones who have a mental handicap.\u201d</p><p>Olivia remembered the day he\u2019d said that. Sean had grinned and given him a punch on the shoulder. \u201cI guess we have to like to you \u2019cause we\u2019re cool dudes\u2014and so are you.\u201d</p><p>Arriving at the office, Olivia went to her desk in the long room behind Aaron\u2019s office, where the therapists kept their notes and records. Mason was at his desk, working away at his computer. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, not looking up.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mason.\u201d She set her purse under her desk and opened her own computer. She needed to finish some notes on Matt. She didn\u2019t intend to embellish anything, but she wanted his father to know how well he\u2019d been doing in his interactions with others at the Horse Farm. He\u2019d been a withdrawn, sullen kid at first.</p><p>She\u2019d just started when Mason got up and walked around to her desk, perching on the edge.</p><p>\u201cSo where were you last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChecking out the new digs? Personally, I like the house you already have better. So, what do you think you\u2019ll do with Marcus\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMason, I haven\u2019t even begun to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think everyone\u2019s happy the house went to you,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re therapists, Mason. We\u2019re not supposed to be gossips!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d His grin was even wider now. \u201cWe\u2019re human.\u201d He glanced around, then bent low to whisper to her. \u201cI think Aaron was planning to go and talk to you about the house last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaron can talk to me about the house anytime he wants. I was just as stunned as everyone else, and I\u2019m not surprised he feels the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to talk in private.\u201d Mason raised one shoulder in a careless shrug. \u201cActually, Aaron seemed okay about it. But guess who might just have it in for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMason! Stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra,\u201d he told her, leaning closer still. \u201cI was eavesdropping. Well, I really couldn\u2019t help it. They didn\u2019t know I was still here. She said it was too bad you hadn\u2019t taken up drugs and OD\u2019d.\u201d</p><p>He straightened suddenly. They\u2019d both heard footsteps. But then Mason seemed to relax; it was just Mariah. \u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s coming tonight! Except for Sydney\u2014he says we never should leave the whole place entirely deserted. It was one thing for Marcus\u2019s funeral, but that was only for a few hours and we were close by. So\u2014\u201d she counted off the names on her fingers \u201c\u2014it\u2019ll be Brent, Sean, Matt, Nick, Joey, Drew, you guys, plus Aaron and Sandra. Oh, Liv, pitch in with me on the stories, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, if you want,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>Mariah shrugged. \u201cOh\u2014I forgot. And the cool FBI agent. He seems to have a thing for you, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just his therapist!\u201d</p><p>Mariah nudged Mason and they both laughed.</p><p>\u201cTherapists are human, Olivia. I already told you that. Right, Mariah? Hey, you think every therapist out there lives a perfect life? Come on, you won\u2019t be this guy\u2019s therapist forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me you haven\u2019t even thought about sleeping with him?\u201d Mariah asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia frowned but didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve learned to live with rejection. I know you\u2019re not sleeping with me. But, seriously, you want to turn into some old maid? You\u2019ve got to sleep with someone,\u201d Mason said.</p><p>Olivia groaned and let her forehead fall onto her desk. \u201cPlease, guys, could we have a little decorum here?\u201d</p><p>Mariah punched Mason again. \u201cYeah, get up. Mama Cheever\u2019s on the way. I could tell the click, click, click of that woman\u2019s boots anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>The two of them stood quickly, going to their separate desks. Olivia returned her attention to her notes. Sandra poked her head in. \u201cThe boys are here, Olivia. Sydney has them stashing their gear for the day. They\u2019ll be ready as soon as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust finishing a report on Matt, for his dad.\u201d</p><p>Sandra frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ll let me see it before you send it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to be very careful these days, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know. I\u2019m being very objective here, Sandra\u2014not exaggerating Matt\u2019s accomplishments, but not minimizing the truth, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople will believe in us or not, Sandra,\u201d Mariah said. \u201cWe can\u2019t sugarcoat everything and we can\u2019t constantly be vigilant about what we say. We just have to move forward. And the rest of us...well, we weren\u2019t addicts so we can\u2019t fall back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people think that former addicts are the best therapists. They know where their charges are coming from,\u201d Mason put in.</p><p>Sandra sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re here to help everyone who comes to us deal with their personal issues through equine therapy. Not all our guests are addicts! Brent\u2019s not, for God\u2019s sake! We\u2019re much more than you\u2019re implying we are.\u201d She turned briskly to Olivia. \u201cI\u2019d like to see the report. Aaron wants me to approve everything before it goes out.\u201d</p><p>Olivia punched a key on her computer. She smiled sweetly. \u201cOn its way to you now, Sandra.\u201d</p><p>As she walked toward the front door, she realized that the floor was dirty. She paused, looking down. It appeared to be the same fine dirt she\u2019d dusted on her porch before leaving with Dustin the night before.</p> <p>She bent down to touch it. As she did, Aaron came out of his office. He beamed at her. \u201cMorning, sunshine.\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cGood morning, Aaron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to talk to you later, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Anything in particular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to rent Marcus\u2019s house from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ll talk? Or, okay, you\u2019ll rent me the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. I didn\u2019t expect to get the house, Aaron. You know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Liv. Marcus really loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Aaron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left me everything I need,\u201d Aaron told her.</p><p>As she began to leave, she was certain that she heard someone snicker behind her back.</p><p>When she turned around, Sandra was watching her, arms crossed. When she noticed Olivia\u2019s scrutiny, she acted as though she\u2019d been waiting for Aaron, immediately asking him a question about schedules.</p><p>Olivia hurried over to the stables and the paddocks. She could see that the boys were already there, talking with Drew, who held Trickster, ready to go out.</p><p>Brent turned and saw her. \u201cLivia!\u201d he cried, coming toward her. The other boys looked her way and smiled, too, calling out to her.</p><p>\u201cTrickster! We\u2019re taking Trickster today!\u201d Brent said, giving her a hug.</p><p>As she walked to join the group, Sean was telling Matt, \u201cI told you it was Bruce Willis in that old movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure,\u201d Drew told the boys apologetically. \u201cI can look it up on the computer while you guys are on your ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Brent says so, then I believe it,\u201d Matt said. He ruffled Brent\u2019s hair. \u201cHe\u2019s our resident expert.\u201d</p><p>Brent grinned at Olivia happily. He was shorter than the other boys, but he was on a good diet and in darned good shape.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a resident expert!\u201d he told Olivia.</p><p>\u201cSo you are,\u201d Olivia said, smiling at the other boys.</p><p>She remembered why she loved what she did so much.</p><p>From the morgue Dustin drove out to the Horse Farm, but he didn\u2019t pull into the drive.</p><p>He passed the farm and parked along the side of the road. He was on adjoining land that bordered the trails; he assumed it belonged to a local farmer\u2014he saw dairy cows behind fences, grazing and letting out a chorus of moos now and then.</p><p>He walked around the far side of the fence, heading into the forest.</p><p>Walking trails were plentiful and they were actually something of a maze. But once he reached the first riding trail, the path was cleaner and broader. He moved quickly, listening and watching all the while.</p><p>It was a good brisk walk but eventually he reached the copse where they\u2019d seen the deer and her fawn the day before. He searched through the trees, which was way more than a one-man job, but he wanted to get in at least a cursory inspection.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the real reason he had come.</p><p>He was convinced that he wasn\u2019t going to find a stash of drugs or drug paraphernalia.</p><p>There were no hollows in any of the trees he searched. He walked on, determined, looking harder.</p><p>Something had whizzed through the trees.</p><p>Joey had heard it. Olivia\u2019s horse had reared.</p><p>What?</p><p>It sure as hell hadn\u2019t been a bee. Or a bird.</p><p>It was hard to remember exactly where they\u2019d been, hard to imagine the exact trajectory. He calculated and recalculated. In the end he moved deeper into the woods, through the trees themselves, ignoring the trails.</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>Tired, frustrated, he leaned against one of the trees.</p><p>And then he saw it.</p><p>It was tiny, so tiny it was barely visible. The little bit of feathering was what had caught his attention. When he went to retrieve it\u2014carefully, using his handkerchief\u2014the feathers detached and all he drew from the tree was the tiny point of something that looked like a needle.</p><p>He studied the point, wrapped it and, trying not to move his feet, hunkered down.</p><p>It took forever, sifting through the leaves and bracken on the forest floor. Then he found it\u2014a delicate cluster of feathers.</p><p>Though small, they would have helped direct the tiny needlelike object.</p><p>It was a dart. It had been aimed at Olivia\u2014or her horse.</p><p>He began to leave, but hesitated, pulling out his knife to cut away the section of bark it had struck. He got out the handkerchief and very carefully rewrapped all the tiny pieces of his find.</p><p>Then he started back through the forest.</p><p>So a dart had come whistling through the woods.</p><p>It was too small to be deadly...unless a toxin of some kind had been placed on the tip. He hurried back to his car and checked his watch. Still early; Olivia would be with her group.</p><p>He drove back to the morgue. He would\u2019ve preferred to send the specimen to the Krewe lab, but he didn\u2019t want to take the time. And sometimes a man had to go on gut instinct.</p><p>Wilson was surprised to see him again but listened earnestly. He promised results on lab tests as soon as humanly possible.</p><p>To his extreme bad luck, he ran into Deputy Sheriff Frank Vine as he was leaving.</p><p>\u201cAgent Blake,\u201d Vine said, eyes narrowing as he studied him.</p><p>\u201cHello, Deputy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of therapy are you having at the morgue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I just stopped by to ask about Marcus\u2014how he\u2019d injected the heroin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing out here?\u201d Vine demanded.</p><p>\u201cI never suggested such a thing. You didn\u2019t really give me an answer when I asked, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got your answer now. And you have no jurisdiction out here. We really do know what we\u2019re doing, Agent Blake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>Vine stared at him, obviously still irritated. He walked past Dustin, stopped and came back, wagging a finger at him. \u201cYou stay out of our business, Blake. You\u2019re not here to police my officers. I\u2019ll call your superiors, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Dustin said again. \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d He smiled and strolled out to his car.</p><p>He prayed that his gut had been right and Wilson wouldn\u2019t betray him.</p><p>Then he drove as quickly as he could\u2014watching the speed limit\u2014to the Horse Farm.</p><p>God knew he didn\u2019t want Vine arresting him for a traffic violation!</p><p>9</p><p>By five-thirty that evening, they were ready to start out on their camping trip.</p><p>Olivia was, naturally, taking Shiloh and she was glad to see that Drew had chosen Chapparal for Dustin. The two seemed well-suited to each other. Dustin was obviously familiar with horses and had riding experience.</p><p>The horses were all in use except for Martin, and he\u2019d remain behind with Sydney. If for any reason someone needed to be reached quickly during the night, Sydney knew where they\u2019d be and had Martin to get to them.</p><p>Mariah led the way on Pixie as they rode out, not starting her spiel yet, since they were riding single file on the forest trail.</p><p>They moved deep into the trees. Eventually they came to a clearing in the forest and Mariah reined in, allowing them all to break and dismount for a few minutes. She directed them to a little path that led deeper into the thickness of the woods, an area where the dying sunlight now brought about an eerie green darkness. Everyone had a penlight, while Drew, Aaron, Mason and Sandra carried lanterns.</p><p>Mariah said, \u201cIn a few minutes, we\u2019re going to visit one of our small Confederate graveyards. You have to remember that when you go to a national cemetery, you won\u2019t find any Confederates, unless they were pardoned and joined the Union army after the war. Confederate dead have their own cemeteries, or else they were returned to their hometowns. And certainly many soldiers\u2014North and South\u2014remain in unmarked graves on the fields where they died. While it was incredibly important for both God-fearing men of the North and South to retrieve their dead, it wasn\u2019t always possible. They died on bloody fields that had to be abandoned, or they were beyond recognition by the time they were found. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA side note of interest\u2014what we celebrate now as Memorial Day was begun by Confederate women who decorated the graves of their loved ones. Many places lay claim to having the first true \u2018Decoration Day,\u2019 but most historians agree that the widows and other grieving women of the South began what became our national holiday before the end of the Civil War\u2014or, as we were sometimes taught to call it, the War of Northern Aggression.\u201d Mariah grinned. \u201cNo one get mad at me for getting my history wrong tonight, huh? Remember, Tennessee was always a divided state and we\u2019re all darned glad we\u2019re one Union now!\u201d Mariah stopped speaking, reaching for the water bottle attached to her saddle. She looked at Olivia. \u201cWant to take it for a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cMariah was preparing you for the first step in the \u2018ghost\u2019 tour part of this. We\u2019ll tell more stories when we\u2019ve made camp. But right now, we\u2019re in a little graveyard begun by locals who found their own boys, and other dead soldiers, left behind after the Battle of Nashville. In some instances, those who lived in this area stumbled upon the dead and did their best to bury them in accordance with whatever identification they found on the bodies\u2014you know, sometimes they got them back to their states or buried them here with others from their homes or regiments, Feds or Rebs. Sometimes the dead they found were their own. Some of them were brought out here for burial.</p><p>\u201cDuring the Civil War, the forest was different from the way it looks now. There\u2019d been a farmhouse just up the ridge, and this had been land that belonged to a George C. Turner. George and one of his sons were killed in the battle, and when Mrs. Evelyn Turner discovered the bodies\u2014and those of others\u2014she got the local preacher and a stone carver to create a little cemetery. Actually, Evelyn Turner herself wound up in this little burial ground. It\u2019s said that on a misty evening she can be seen walking through the trees, searching for more dead, determined that they be given a Christian burial. She\u2019s buried just down that path with her husband and her son\u2014and our area\u2019s most famous ghost, General Rufus Cunningham. So we\u2019ll take a walk down the path, pay our respects and then go on to the campsite. Once we\u2019re there, we\u2019ll set up our tents and start a fire, cook our dinner\u2014and settle in for some good stories.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced back at Mariah, a question in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou want to lead them through with Mason? Drew, Aaron and I can watch the horses,\u201d Mariah said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, then,\u201d Olivia urged. She noticed that Brent looked frightened.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou can stay with Mariah and the guys and watch the horses.\u201d</p><p>Brent shook his head. \u201cI\u2014I want to go.\u201d</p> <p>Dustin walked over and slipped an arm around his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m a little scared, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go together.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled at Dustin. \u201cWell, then, we forge ahead.\u201d</p><p>She accepted a lantern from Mariah and started through the pine-and leaf-covered trail. The others followed. They entered a small graveyard. Perhaps twenty stones remained, some broken, most at an angle, all shrouded with lichen. The break in the trees allowed the last light of the day to seep through, but it cast an aura of something mysterious, perhaps sacred, over the stones.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d Sean called. \u201cHere, right here! I found Evelyn Turner\u2019s grave\u2014and her son\u2019s grave and...here\u2019s the dad!\u201d</p><p>The other boys rushed over. Holding the lantern high, Olivia saw that Dustin\u2014Brent close at his side\u2014had come upon the most famous grave, the one with the largest stone and flowers strewn upon it.</p><p>\u201cGeneral Rufus Cunningham,\u201d Dustin read aloud. He went down on his knees to study the writing on the stone. \u201c\u2018Hero of the Battle of Nashville. To save lives, he gave his own.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sean let out a creepy sound. \u201cHe\u2019s here! I can feel him. Can you feel him? He\u2019s here with us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? Where?\u201d Brent asked, alarmed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Brent,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cIf his spirit\u2019s still around, he doesn\u2019t mean us any harm. He was an exceptional man who wanted the best for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mock the dead!\u201d Joey snapped at Sean.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Joey,\u201d Sean said. \u201cHave some fun!\u201d</p><p>Olivia hadn\u2019t seen the general among them; Malachi had told her once that it didn\u2019t really make sense for a spirit like Rufus Cunningham to hang around his grave. Malachi believed he still watched over the living. But just as she opened her mouth to speak again, she saw him.</p><p>He was on foot.</p><p>Maybe ghost horses couldn\u2019t make it through the dense growth of trees and brush that now surrounded the little burial ground.</p> <p>But the general was among them. He wore his uniform, passing by the others, pausing to give Sean a stern pat on the back of his head.</p><p>Sean jumped a mile high.</p><p>Matt burst into laughter. \u201cScared?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWho did that? Stop it\u2014that wasn\u2019t funny!\u201d Sean yelled.</p><p>\u201cNeither is disrespect for the dead,\u201d Dustin said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry! Can we go now? I\u2019m starving,\u201d Sean muttered.</p><p>\u201cEveryone okay with that?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cOne minute. Can I take just one minute?\u201d Brent looked up at her.</p><p>She nodded. Brent went down on his knees and bowed his head, hands folded in prayer.</p><p>One by one, the other boys joined him. Olivia held the lantern and watched, deeply touched.</p><p>When they started back, Matt asked her, \u201cHow come we can read some of those stones so clearly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause volunteers come out now and then and see that the headstones are kept clean,\u201d Olivia told him. \u201cSome of the graves were known, and some weren\u2019t after time took its toll, so the carving was scrubbed on all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut everyone knew the general, right? And they knew about Mr. and Mrs. Turner and their son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Olivia assured them.</p><p>When she reached the end of the trail and the boys had gone on ahead of her, she looked back. She could see the general; he stood in a military position, watching as they left.</p><p>She smiled. He was still keeping guard over the land. But then her smile faded. She\u2019d seen him when Marcus died. What had he been trying to tell her? Had he come upon Marcus too late?</p><p>\u201cLiv? You ready?\u201d Mariah called.</p><p>\u201cComing.\u201d</p><p>Brent was riding Battle-ax, a truly big boy, although gentle. She went to give him a boost up but Dustin was already with him, helping him onto the horse.</p><p>As they rode, she noted that although Dustin was keeping an eye on Brent, he was staying close to her.</p><p>He was also watching everyone riding with them\u2014and the forest around them, as well.</p><p>Soon, they reached the open ground that led to the stream and the bluff that forded it, where they usually camped. The rocks created an overhang that had been useful whenever they were surprised by rain. Tonight, however, promised to be beautiful.</p><p>They pitched the tents, the work going well, everyone helping. Sean now seemed subdued; he looked over his shoulder frequently\u2014and kept close to the others. Aaron sent the boys to gather wood for the fire. They used the camping area often and had a fire site ready. It was on clean, swept soil and surrounded by rocks to prevent the fire from spreading.</p><p>Within forty minutes of their arrival, the tents were pitched and the fire was blazing. Aaron quickly had coffee going, while Mariah and Mason set up the grill. They\u2019d brought hot dogs and beans and the makings for s\u2019mores. Everyone seemed hungry, and it wasn\u2019t until they\u2019d eaten and had gorged themselves on the s\u2019mores that Joey asked Mariah when she was going to get to the ghost stories.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, now!\u201d Mariah smiled at him and gestured grandly. \u201cNow that the moon is high, and the mist will soon gather and rise on the moor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a moor?\u201d Joey asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. It\u2019s a field in the foothills, but close enough,\u201d Mason said.</p><p>\u201cRemember, I don\u2019t just tell ghost stories. A ghost story doesn\u2019t amount to anything unless you know why the ghost stayed behind,\u201d Mariah said. \u201cAnd that means knowing the history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to tell us about General Rufus Cunningham, right?\u201d Joey asked excitedly.</p><p>\u201cWith a little help from my friends,\u201d Mariah said. \u201cLiv, you want to start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you\u2019d like,\u201d Olivia said. She looked around at all the boys, and forced herself not to smile. Brent was sitting on Dustin\u2019s left side.</p><p>Sean was on his right\u2014sitting even closer than Brent.</p><p>\u201cThe best stories always come with truth and time,\u201d she began. \u201cAnd to understand what brought about a ghost, you first have to understand some history, just like Mariah said. As I\u2019m sure you already know, Tennessee was the last state to join the Confederacy. That happened on June 24, 1861. As soon as Tennessee seceded, it was like Nashville had a target painted on her. Because the city was a major shipping center and had a major port on the Cumberland River, both sides saw Nashville as extremely important. Battles couldn\u2019t be fought without supplies, without a way to keep soldiers clothed and fed. And, of course, Nashville was also the capital of Tennessee. It was important for the Union to take a capital, because that affected morale. One thing we learn in therapy of any kind is that morale can dictate what happens. We can create self-fulfilling prophesies\u2014believe there\u2019s no choice but to fail and you will. Believe you can make it and you will.\u201d</p><p>Joey cleared his throat. \u201cUh, Olivia, the South did lose the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, didn\u2019t you hear?\u201d Matt asked her, giggling.</p><p>\u201cOkay, it doesn\u2019t always work.\u201d She smiled. \u201cHard and bitter as that defeat must have been for the Confederates, time has shown us that we\u2019re better and stronger as one country. To many people living in the nineteenth century, the main focus was states\u2019 rights, and, okay, that was connected to slavery\u2014and the economy. But one of Lincoln\u2019s great triumphs was that slavery was abolished. Today, we can look back and wonder how any human being believed he could own another human being.\u201d She paused to let the boys think about that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A moment later she continued. \u201cBut, as I said, it was important for the Union to hold the city. Protecting Nashville was Fort Donelson, which fell on February 16, 1862. As soon as the fort fell, Union troops came in and the federal occupation of Nashville began. And Nashville became the first Confederate capital to fall to the federal government. Again, something that was actually good for some\u2014the Unionists\u2014and not so good for others\u2014the ardent secessionists. Remember, we were divided on the matter of secession. The state government moved to Memphis at that time. But the Union sent in a military governor. Anyone know who that was? I\u2019ll give you a hint. A future president.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew Johnson!\u201d Matt called out.</p><p>\u201cGold star for that boy,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cOkay, so there was a Union Army of Tennessee and a Confederate Army of Tennessee. On December 2, 1864, the Confederate Army of Tennessee came to face off against the Union Army south of the city. On December 15, the Union Army arrived and started the Battle of Nashville. While the Confederates fought hard, they were badly defeated and had to retreat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s where we get our famous ghost!\u201d Mariah said, beaming.</p><p>Matt set his flashlight beneath his chin so the beam would give him an eerie look. \u201cGeneral Rufus Cunningham!\u201d he moaned.</p><p>\u201cHey, stop it!\u201d Sean said. \u201cRemember\u2014we respect the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Mariah then took over the story. \u201cGeneral Rufus Cunningham had a daughter and she was married to one of the Union lieutenants with the troops occupying Nashville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, the girl was kind of a traitor, wasn\u2019t she? Ooh\u2014maybe she hated her dad!\u201d Sean suggested.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no! It was very sad,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cThe whole war was tragically sad. Many of the men\u2014the foot soldiers and ranking officers\u2014were good friends or relatives of the soldiers they fought. Cunningham\u2019s daughter was named Eliza. She married Nathan Randall in 1858, and she met him because her father had been his commanding officer at the time. Many of the men went to West Point or other military academies together. Many of them had fought together in Mexico. The thing is, General Rufus Cunningham loved his son-in-law. But even if he hadn\u2019t loved him, he would have tried to save him. He\u2019d ordered that any man who\u2019d been injured\u2014whether wearing blue or gray\u2014was to be given medical attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Mariah continued, taking up the story, \u201cNathan Randall was injured. Seeing him\u2014although he was already in retreat with his troops\u2014General Cunningham stopped. In saving his son-in-law, he was caught in the crossfire between the advancing Union and the retreating Confederates. He died not far from where we\u2019re camping tonight and he\u2019s buried in the tiny Confederate Cemetery we just visited, where you saw his grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Joey added, \u201cit\u2019s said that General Rufus Cunningham still rides these hills, watching out for those who are in danger, trying to save lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he failed with Marcus, huh?\u201d Matt said. His words were followed by silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he would have helped if he could,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>Brent rose and sat next to Matt. The tough guy smiled at the Down syndrome boy and placed an arm around his shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s a romantic story, too,\u201d Olivia quickly offered. \u201cThe beautiful stream we can hear trickling. Know how that was formed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s tears?\u201d Joey asked.</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d she replied. \u201cThere was a beautiful maiden called Little Deer. She was in love with a warrior named Soaring Eagle. This was during a terrible time in our history when we were land grabbers\u2014and we forced all the eastern Native Americans west, toward Arkansas. The two of them were torn apart because Soaring Eagle was with a peace delegation sent to argue out terms. He should\u2019ve have been back before Little Deer was forced to leave. But the army was determined to get this done. There was a horrible mistake in communications. Soaring Eagle was only trying to reach Little Deer, but he was shot down because an army lieutenant thought he was trying to create an uprising. Little Deer heard the shot from miles away. She cried this stream that runs from the river down to the hills and plains. Sometimes at night you can hear the two of them calling to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Aaron said, rising, \u201csometimes at night, people go to bed. I say we call it a day and we\u2019ll get an early start tomorrow. Then we\u2019ll argue with the black rock!\u201d</p><p>Dustin glanced over at Olivia. She wished she didn\u2019t feel herself tense every time he looked at her now. Or that, in the middle of a group of people, she could tell him she didn\u2019t give a damn what happened in the future, she\u2019d like one night with him. Just one...</p><p>\u201cThe black rock is a natural boulder stuck out here, and it\u2019s black because it\u2019s aged,\u201d she explained. \u201cOkay, maybe it\u2019s more of a dirty gray. The kids tell it everything they\u2019re angry about\u2014and throw water balloons at it. Believe it or not, it actually seems to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it soothes the old soul,\u201d Mason said. He stood, yawning. \u201cI do have to say it feels great to be out here, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and may I remind you all...bathroom visits demand clothing of some kind,\u201d Mariah said sternly. \u201cBoys\u2019 bushes to the left\u2014girls\u2019 to the right!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho wants to help rinse off the plates and pots and pans?\u201d Olivia asked. \u201cYou can grab your toothbrushes and we\u2019ll get water for face washing at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Joey, Matt and Brent said they\u2019d come with her.</p><p>Sean no longer seemed willing to be by himself and refused to leave a crowd.</p><p>The boys helped her with the dishes. When they returned to the camp, everyone was settling in. Brent, Sean and Joey were in a large tent with Dustin, whose sleeping bag was closest to the entrance\u2014closest to where she was, in the second tent with Mariah and Sandra. Aaron, Matt, Nick and Drew were in the third.</p><p>\u201cYou think this was too soon?\u201d Mariah asked worriedly as she lay on her cot. \u201cI mean, too soon for one of these trips\u2014after Marcus died?\u201d</p><p>Sandra, ready to turn down their lantern, sighed. \u201cMariah, we have to go on as usual. You\u2019re just telling stories that you grew up with. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Mariah murmured. \u201cWhat do you think? Did they all like the little cemetery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey seemed to,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo one \u2018saw\u2019 the general?\u201d Mariah asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, we all see him one way or another, don\u2019t we?\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mariah told her. \u201cI never have. I wish I could see him. I should see him. You can trace my family back in this area for two hundred years! You\u2019d think he\u2019d appear to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an image in people\u2019s minds!\u201d Sandra said impatiently. \u201cLet\u2019s get some sleep!\u201d</p><p>The tent went dark. The night was lit by an almost-full moon and the remnants of the fire in the clearing. Olivia lay still, listening to chirping of insects around them. There were coyotes in the hills, but they\u2019d never bothered them, not here at the campground. The cows were sometimes in danger\u2014the Horse Farm dogs occasionally came back with a piece of beef that hadn\u2019t been processed. But there was really nothing to fear at their campground during the night.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt edgy before.</p><p>That night, she lay awake in her sleeping bag.</p><p>Through the canvas walls of the tent she could see the shapes of distant trees, making giant shadows that waved and moved in the breeze, looking like monsters that might reach into the tent and drag someone out. She told herself that was a childish fantasy, but couldn\u2019t quite dispel her nervousness....</p><p>She was just staring at the trees when she became aware of something moving outside\u2014coming toward the tent.</p><p>She bolted halfway up, glancing over at the other women.</p><p>Neither Sandra nor Mariah was in the tent. She hadn\u2019t heard them rise; maybe she\u2019d dozed off, after all.</p><p>Whatever was coming toward her seemed to grow large with menace\u2014as if a tree had uprooted itself and become a monster stretching its skeletal fingers toward her....</p><p>She jumped to her feet, ready to rush out and scream an alarm. But even as she did, she heard someone speak sharply. She recognized Dustin\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cAaron!\u201d</p><p>There were no monsters and trees didn\u2019t uproot themselves to attack.</p><p>She hurriedly left the tent to see what was happening.</p><p>Aaron was out there.</p><p>And Dustin was right behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2014I think,\u201d Aaron said. He looked at Olivia. \u201cI heard something rustling over here. I wanted to see if you three were okay. We should\u2019ve put the women in the middle tent.\u201d</p><p>Sandra came walking out of the woods. \u201cAaron Bentley! You employ extremely capable women. I had to make a dash to the powder room, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mariah?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, she must have taken a bathroom break, too,\u201d Sandra said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d Aaron muttered. \u201cI want to make sure she\u2019s in her tent before I go back to sleep. I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dustin demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought I heard someone prowling around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did! Us. So much for privacy,\u201d Sandra said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cHow long can a break in the bushes take?\u201d Aaron asked.</p><p>He probably meant it as a rhetorical question, but Joey emerged from the tent, saying, \u201cUm, it takes as long as it takes, doesn\u2019t it? Especially for women...\u201d</p><p>Aaron ignored that and walked toward the bushes. \u201cMariah!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cMariah!\u201d he shouted louder.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>They heard her call back to them. Her voice didn\u2019t come from the bushes. Olivia saw that she\u2019d been down to the stream; she\u2019d apparently filled her canteen. Her face was damp and she was smiling. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked quickly, her smile fading. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Aaron let out a sigh. \u201cI was just worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Aaron, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mariah said. \u201cI went down to the stream for some more water. And it was so beautiful in the moonlight! I was looking across the water\u2014hoping maybe I\u2019d see the general on his horse on the other side.\u201d</p><p>Somewhere, far in the distance, a coyote howled at the moon. The sound was so forlorn, so chilling\u2014and foreboding.</p> <p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re all here now,\u201d Sandra said with a shrug. \u201cLet\u2019s get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDustin, you\u2019re going back in the tent, right?\u201d Joey asked. As he spoke, Brent, too, came out. He looked frightened. Brent was a joy to be around, always loving, but he was also easily frightened when things weren\u2019t precisely as they were supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cLivia?\u201d he said worriedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Brent. We\u2019re all here. Everything\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured him, going over to give him a hug.</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get some sleep!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, okay, everyone back where they belong.\u201d Grinning, Aaron joined Olivia and put his arm around Brent. \u201cIt\u2019s all good, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Brent nodded solemnly. \u201cThe general is watching over us,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right, Brent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is watching us. I saw him. I saw him\u2014he was on the other side of the stream. I saw him with Livia when we were washing the plates,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Sandra shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure we should\u2019ve brought him,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cHalf the world sees the general.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe thinks he really saw him,\u201d Sandra snapped.</p><p>\u201cCome on, buddy, back to bed,\u201d Aaron said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, come on, we\u2019re all going in,\u201d Joey added kindly.</p><p>\u201cGood night, all,\u201d Aaron said, and, ducking through the entrance, escorted Brent back into the tent. Joey followed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sit by the fire awhile,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cYou all go back to sleep. Sorry. I\u2019m just restless. I like to watch the dying embers\u2014helps me sleep.\u201d</p><p>Sandra went back in. Mariah waited for Olivia, then returned to the tent. Olivia fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>She awoke to early daylight\u2014and the sound of a high-pitched scream. Bolting out of bed, she collided with Sandra as they both tried to get out at the same time.</p><p>Drew was already outside, looking around wildly, trying to ascertain where the scream had originated.</p> <p>\u201cStay here!\u201d Olivia ordered Sandra. \u201cWatch the boys. Drew, come with me!\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t really her place to give instructions, but Olivia hadn\u2019t thought it out. She started running into the bushes, assuming the scream had come from the women\u2019s side of the \u201cbathroom\u201d area. But when she saw a glimmer of light through the trees, she realized it must have come from farther back. Olivia kept running, with Drew on her heels. They burst into a little clearing. The gray skies of dawn made it hard to see clearly.</p><p>To her astonishment, Olivia found Dustin there\u2014bending over Mariah, who was crouched on the ground. His small flashlight didn\u2019t reveal much detail but did show her horrified expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Olivia shouted.</p><p>Drew barely managed to stop himself before colliding with her; she felt his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>Mariah rose, shaking, clinging to Dustin. \u201cOh, Lord, I am sorry...again!\u201d</p><p>Olivia frowned at Dustin.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI wake easily and run fast,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Olivia demanded a second time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I thought I saw...oh, this is so stupid!\u201d Mariah apologized. \u201cI thought I saw the general when I went to use the, uh, bathroom, and I tried to follow him and I got here and...\u201d She stepped aside, displaying what she\u2019d stumbled on.</p><p>The torn remnants of cow\u2019s hindquarters lay there, blood trailing off into the bushes.</p><p>\u201cA coyote got a cow,\u201d Olivia said calmly. \u201cUnfortunately, it happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I just wasn\u2019t expecting it!\u201d Mariah groaned.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the hell back now,\u201d Drew suggested. Olivia could feel him close behind her\u2014and she could tell that he was shaking. \u201cThe others are going to be worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s go!\u201d Mariah said. \u201cOh, Lord, I\u2019m going to have to apologize to the kids and tell them what an idiot I am!\u201d</p><p>They walked back. By then, the others were milling around by the fire, waiting wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Sandra asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cFreakiest camping trip ever!\u201d Mason said.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Nick murmured.</p><p>Sean jabbed him with an elbow. Mariah went into her explanation, but before she\u2019d finished Dustin interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Aaron?\u201d</p><p>They looked around; Aaron wasn\u2019t among them.</p><p>\u201cHe must be...I don\u2019t know, in the bushes, too?\u201d Mason asked.</p><p>\u201cWith this much commotion going on?\u201d Dustin demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all go look for him,\u201d Joey said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you boys stay here. Drew, you, Sandra and Mariah stay. Mason, check out the bushes. I\u2019ll try the stream. Liv...\u201d His eyes were on hers.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her alone with any of them, she realized.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can cover most of the stream that way.\u201d</p><p>They headed off together.</p><p>When they reached the stream he stood dead still for a few seconds. Then he swore and ran straight in.</p><p>Olivia saw why.</p><p>They\u2019d found Aaron.</p><p>He was floating facedown in the water.</p><p>10</p><p>Dustin was afraid that Deputy Sheriff Frank Vine simply didn\u2019t like him. Vine arrived with Jimmy Callahan, but Vine did most of the talking. Callahan was younger, more sympathetic, more concerned about those who\u2019d witnessed the event, especially the boys.</p><p>Dustin knew damned well that he\u2019d done everything right, performing artificial respiration competently and with determination.</p><p>And he\u2019d gotten Aaron Bentley breathing again, although not conscious, before the rescue crew made it to the campsite via helicopter.</p><p>The med techs had commended him. Everyone around him had been in shock; they\u2019d watched helplessly, holding one another while he brought Aaron out of the cold water. Olivia had run back for blankets, and the others had followed her to the stream. They\u2019d carried him back to the campsite, where Drew had gotten the fire going again.</p><p>But Frank Vine... He and Callahan had arrived on the medevac helicopter, then stayed behind at the campsite.</p><p>Now Vine stared at him as if he were the Antichrist.</p><p>Dustin had watched as Frank tried to find out what had happened. The group had mostly talked at once, trying to explain where they\u2019d been, how no one had any idea that Aaron was down at the stream. Mariah was nearly hysterical, certain that it all was her fault. If she hadn\u2019t been startled and screamed, they might have found Aaron earlier.</p><p>No one could say just how long he\u2019d been in the water. The med techs didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d live. If he did, they didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d suffer brain damage. He was breathing; he was alive. That was all anyone knew. He might walk out of the hospital, perfectly fine, the next morning.</p><p>Or he might live for years in a vegetative state.</p><p>They\u2019d find out when they got him to a hospital.</p><p>\u201cSo, no one saw Aaron get out of the tent and walk to the stream?\u201d Frank demanded.</p><p>Sandra was sobbing. \u201cNo. We heard Mariah scream from the other direction. Some of us stayed right here...some of us went to look for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault!\u201d Mariah said again and again. \u201cAll my fault. If I didn\u2019t want to see the general so much...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You were chasing a ghost,\u201d Vine said sarcastically.</p><p>That made Mariah cry harder. Olivia went to slip an arm around her. So did Deputy Callahan.</p><p>Olivia looked at Deputy Sheriff Frank Vine and spoke evenly and clearly. \u201cNone of us was anywhere near the stream. The fact that Mariah was in the bushes had nothing to do with Aaron. Even if we hadn\u2019t run after her and she hadn\u2019t screamed, Aaron was still at the stream. He probably thought nothing of being down there. We\u2019ve all been camping here dozens of times.\u201d She turned to her friend and coworker and said, \u201cMariah, there\u2019s no reason you should feel guilty. What happened was not because of you. Aaron was already there when you screamed. And think of it this way\u2014we were all up, and Dustin found him at the stream because of you. If it hadn\u2019t been for you, we might not have known he was missing. We might not have searched for him until it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Liv?\u201d Mariah whispered. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>Frank Vine looked at them and shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s something not right with you people. How can so many bad things happen in one group? Pretty careless if you ask me. First Danby and now this... How could Aaron have such a ridiculous accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccident?\u201d Dustin asked, entering the fray despite the look Vine had given him. \u201cA grown man, Aaron\u2019s size, accidentally falls face-first into a stream, knocks himself out and nearly drowns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t an accident, what did happen, Agent Man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why law enforcement investigates such situations,\u201d Dustin said flatly.</p><p>Frank Vine scowled at him. Everyone was quiet. Dustin almost felt as if they were on some dusty street in the Old West\u2014about to have a shoot-out.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to investigate and figure out what happened, is that it? When you\u2019re under suspicion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf causing an accident?\u201d Dustin raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYou found him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd saved his life. Before that, I was the first one to dash into the forest when I heard Mariah scream,\u201d Dustin told him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mason cleared his throat and said, \u201cHell, Dustin wasn\u2019t even around when Marcus Danby died.\u201d</p><p>Callahan stepped into their group, looking shy and young\u2014and yet speaking with a soft calm that belied his years.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get these kids out of here.\u201d</p> <p>Vine spun on him but held his temper. He let out a long breath and Dustin realized the man was frustrated.</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll get the kids out of here,\u201d Vine said. He looked at the boys again, his eyes narrowing. \u201cAnd not one of you saw anything?\u201d</p><p>Joey spoke up. \u201cI saw Aaron get out of his bedroll, but I was still half-asleep. I didn\u2019t jump out myself until I heard Mariah scream. Then...we stood around with Mama Cheever\u2014Sandra\u2014waiting.... Drew, Olivia, Dustin and Mariah came back from the woods and that\u2019s when we noticed Aaron wasn\u2019t with us.\u201d</p><p>Frank Vine studied him suspiciously. \u201cSo everyone knew where everyone else was\u2014except for Aaron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Drew said, gesturing around at all of them. \u201cSandra\u2019s not here now because she went in the helicopter with Aaron, but I was with her, so I know exactly where she was. I mean, all of us were here, except for Mason, who was searching in the bushes, and Dustin and Liv\u2014who rescued Aaron.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where everyone was when Mariah first screamed,\u201d Dustin explained. \u201cBut when we found Mariah and returned to camp with her, we did know. That\u2019s when we discovered that Aaron was missing. None of us necessarily knew where everyone else was before that,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cNor do we know if anyone else was in the area,\u201d Olivia added.</p><p>Mariah suddenly started sobbing again. \u201cAaron!\u201d she wailed. \u201cOh, my God, Aaron.\u201d She sank onto the ground and Olivia crouched down beside her. With everyone upset, Brent began to cry, as well. Dustin went to him, trying to offer some comfort. Brent was extremely susceptible to the emotions of others.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said soothingly. \u201cAaron\u2019s gone to the hospital. They\u2019ll see what they can do for him there. He might be fine by tonight, Brent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Aaron,\u201d Brent told him between sobs. \u201cI liked Marcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dustin murmured.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s move along,\u201d Frank said. \u201cJimmy, get these people moving. Who\u2019s in charge now?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Drew cleared his throat. \u201cUm\u2014Olivia. If Aaron\u2019s out of action, Olivia is in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiv,\u201d Frank ordered, \u201cget your stuff packed and take these boys back to the Horse Farm. I\u2019ll get on the horn and see that someone from Parsonage House shows up and that Brent\u2019s mom knows to come for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave them ride back as they are\u2014don\u2019t pack up. Leave the campsite as it is. There might be something here that can give us some explanation...or at least a hint,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cThis is my jurisdiction,\u201d Frank Vine told him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to find anything that might cause a man to walk to a stream and fall in. You want to investigate? Fine, walk down to the stream. Olivia, you get the others packed up and out of here!\u201d</p><p>Short of doing something that would land him in jail or get him shot, Dustin was afraid his options were severely limited. So he took the risk of sharing the one piece of information he\u2019d hoped to hold back\u2014until he had the lab results, anyway.</p><p>\u201cWe need to look for a dart gun,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just Frank who stared at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind. Everyone did.</p><p>\u201cAsk Joey. We heard something whizzing by us in the woods the other day. Later I was out here walking and found a dart.\u201d He decided this might be their only chance to discover the truth; he had to get Frank to at least consider the possibility. Coincidentally, he\u2019d be able to observe the others\u2019 reactions....</p><p>\u201cI think Marcus Danby might have been hit by a dart, one that might have been tipped with horse tranquilizer. It would have knocked him out\u2014and then heroin could\u2019ve been administered. And down at the stream, Aaron could have been hit with a dart, causing him to nearly drown when he pitched forward. Someone could\u2019ve put together a cocktail of acepromazine and barbiturates\u2014just enough to knock someone out. Something that would dissolve quickly and not show up in the standard blood tests done at an autopsy.\u201d</p><p>They all looked at him incredulously. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a stretch, Mr. Agent Man,\u201d Vine said. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right? Someone\u2019s running around with a dart gun? This is twenty-first-century Tennessee! We\u2019re not in Africa or worrying about some ancient tribe on a Pacific island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about drugs and tranquilizers readily available on any farm in the area,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cStill...\u201d Frank protested.</p><p>\u201cI found a dart in the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you report it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I supposed to report a dart?\u201d Dustin asked with mock innocence. To you? So you could say some kid simply got a new dart gun for his birthday?</p><p>\u201cYou should report everything to local law enforcement\u2014and that happens to be me,\u201d Vine growled. \u201cEven if you are a federal agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I know that now. I know you\u2019re open to anything that might be out of the ordinary. So, Deputy Sheriff Vine, why not investigate?\u201d Dustin demanded. \u201cAre you trying to hinder an investigation or carry one out?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he thought he\u2019d gone too far\u2014that Frank Vine was going to order Callahan to put handcuffs on Dustin.</p><p>Maybe the man was even in on it. He\u2019d been involved with the search the day Marcus was found dead; he\u2019d been one of the first to arrive at the scene.</p><p>Why would a cop do such a thing? An old ax to grind? Maybe Marcus had refused to give him the dog he\u2019d wanted. Murder over a rescue pup? Seemed unlikely. He wondered what other reasons the deputy sheriff might have to obstruct the inquiry.</p><p>But to his amazement, Vine seemed willing to listen to him. He looked at Dustin for a long moment, his jaw tightening. Then he looked down at the ground for an equally long moment. Finally he raised his head. \u201cBelieve me, I don\u2019t want to hinder an investigation.\u201d</p><p>Dustin did believe him. Vine was trying to be a good officer. He just had trouble accepting that something so absurd and devious could be going on.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, you get everyone going,\u201d Vine said. \u201cThe agent and I are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Matt broke in. \u201cIs that legal? Don\u2019t you need a search warrant? I mean, what if you catch a killer, but your evidence turns out to be tainted?\u201d He looked around worriedly. \u201cMy, uh, dad\u2019s an attorney,\u201d he added. \u201cFruit of the poisonous tree, and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my permission to search all Horse Farm property,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cThere. That handles the tents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can search all our personal property, as well. Does anyone have any objections?\u201d Drew asked. \u201cMatt, I\u2019m pretty sure that if you say it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. There are a lot of witnesses who\u2019ll hear you give your permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can search anything of mine. Hell, we have our blood and urine tested all the time. What do I care about a backpack?\u201d Matt said. \u201cGuys?\u201d he turned to the others.</p><p>They all murmured that they had no objections.</p><p>\u201cThen, Olivia, if you\u2019d please get everyone mounted up? We\u2019ll return everyone\u2019s property later,\u201d Vine said. \u201cDeputy Callahan\u2019s going to ride with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I finally got to use my iPod again,\u201d Matt moaned. \u201cAnd you\u2019re taking it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get it back to you by tonight,\u201d Dustin promised.</p><p>Olivia helped Mariah to her feet. \u201cWe just leave everything?\u201d she asked Dustin.</p><p>He nodded, speaking to her privately as the others went to get the horses saddled and ready for the ride back. It was decided that Callahan would be riding Aaron\u2019s horse.</p><p>\u201cAnd stay with the deputy,\u201d Dustin emphasized. \u201cGet the kids back where they belong, and you stay with Callahan. I don\u2019t like you being without me. I\u2019d thought the answer might be here, but...no one reacted when I brought it up.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cSo, I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me anything about a dart gun,\u201d she accused him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long shot.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cIf you\u2019ll pardon the bad pun.\u201d</p><p>She nodded distractedly. \u201cBut who could have struck him? We were all at the campsite together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us was at the stream when he went down there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize Aaron was missing, there was so much commotion over Mariah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suspected Aaron,\u201d she said. \u201cYou thought he killed Marcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never put that into words.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll make it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s breathing, and they can keep him breathing. How long he was out, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Drew had the kids saddling the horses. All the saddlebags\u2014everything else\u2014was left behind.</p><p>A dart could easily be hidden. And even though a dart gun was small, Dustin hoped he could see if anyone was carrying anything that looked suspect. He surveyed the riders and saw cell phones pressed against pockets, but nothing in the shape of a dart gun.</p><p>But, he figured, the dart gun could\u2019ve been tossed in the forest somewhere.</p><p>When the riders were all mounted and ready to head back, he stood close to Olivia for a moment. She appeared to be calm and in control. She also looked drained and weary.</p><p>He wanted to rebuff the whole concept of searching for the dart gun\u2014which he didn\u2019t think he was going to find, anyway. He wanted to head back with Olivia, take a steaming shower and fall into bed with her. He\u2019d never in his life regretted trying to be noble as much as he did now. And he hated the idea that she was riding away while he stayed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they were gone, Vine turned to him. \u201cListen, we\u2019re not idiots or incompetent. Nor are we close-minded. We are a small department, though, and we don\u2019t get a lot of murders out here. When something bad happens, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s usually a domestic situation. So, G-man, what\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMethodical and boring,\u201d Dustin told him. \u201cWe search everything. And, to be honest, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to find what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are we doing this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn case we do find something.\u201d</p><p>He remained surprised\u2014and impressed\u2014by the turnabout in Frank Vine. But he figured the man was good at his job. He could probably maintain order, find the missing, collar rabble-rousers, and he no doubt ran a tight ship.</p><p>As he\u2019d said, he wasn\u2019t accustomed to murder\u2014or attempted murder. Especially when it appeared that no one had been in the vicinity to cause an \u201caccident\u201d that might lead to death.</p><p>\u201cFirst, can you use your radio and get hold of someone to see that Aaron Bentley\u2019s kept under surveillance at the hospital?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d He studied Dustin, then shook his head. \u201cYou really think someone might have murdered Marcus Danby\u2014and attempted to kill Aaron Bentley?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. You call the shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to take over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you take over. I\u2019m giving you an order to call the shots.\u201d</p><p>Dustin grinned. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Using Dustin\u2019s light and the sheriff\u2019s more powerful one, they started at the stream. Daylight was upon them, but the water was murky and it was much easier to search ground, bushes and bracken with the extra light. Frank Vine was skilled at tracking; he found disruptions in the grass where Aaron had first walked. Vine also discovered exactly where he\u2019d stepped into the stream and then fallen and nearly drowned. Dustin carefully searched the area where Aaron had fallen but to no avail. He\u2019d been intent on saving a man\u2019s life, not on collecting evidence. If a tiny dart had gone whistling at the man, it was now lost in the stream.</p> <p>\u201cNeedle in a haystack,\u201d Vine muttered.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not there,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>He and Vine backtracked and starting going through the bags and equipment at the campsite. As Dustin had expected, they found nothing.</p><p>While they searched, he and Vine discussed the case. \u201cWhy?\u201d Frank asked. \u201cWhy the hell murder Marcus Danby? I don\u2019t get it. Suppose someone had an old grudge. Something that festered in his mind for years. Okay, that might be a reason to kill. But we notice strangers and tourists out here. Say that had happened, anyway. Or, say, someone wanted the Horse Farm\u2014but that someone would most likely have been Aaron Bentley, and now...\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wish I did,\u201d Dustin said. They\u2019d gone through everything, every backpack and sleeping bag; they hadn\u2019t found a thing.</p><p>Not one of the boys had been carrying \u201ccontraband,\u201d not so much as a magazine.</p><p>He looked around. That morning, when he\u2019d heard Mariah scream, he\u2019d dashed out of his tent into the woods, in the direction of her scream. Still, he could remember how he\u2019d gone.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s check the woods,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhich woods?\u201d Vine asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d They started through the trees. There were a few trails\u2014the woods in this area had long been the \u201cwashrooms\u201d of the campground. But Dustin moved deeper, making his way to the exact spot where he\u2019d found Mariah early that morning. Frank Vine walked ahead of him, while he searched the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat the frickin\u2019 hell?\u201d Frank yelled.</p><p>Dustin looked up. Frank was staring at something stashed in the trees. Dustin walked over to join him.</p><p>Frank Vine hadn\u2019t found a dart gun.</p><p>What he\u2019d found was even more perplexing.</p><p>The sun had fully risen now, but the wind was brisk and the ride back felt long. For the most part, everyone seemed subdued. But, of course, they were all worried about Aaron.</p><p>Olivia was numb. Cold and numb. She hadn\u2019t wanted to believe that anyone at the Horse Farm could have wanted to kill Marcus, but now something had happened to Aaron, too. And it seemed highly unlikely that Aaron\u2014with the most to gain from Marcus\u2019s death\u2014would have attempted to drown himself. Especially when he wasn\u2019t in a position to believe that someone would be there to save him.</p><p>It all seemed crazy.</p><p>When they neared the Horse Farm, Olivia felt her phone buzz. She answered it. Sandra was on the other end, spewing furious words at her.</p><p>\u201cSandra, I can\u2019t understand you. Please, calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that idiot agent friend of yours around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Dustin?\u201d Olivia was surprised by the way Sandra had voiced the question. Dustin was a guest at the Horse Farm. He shouldn\u2019t have been referred to as her \u201cidiot agent friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Sandra spat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s done, but they won\u2019t let me in with Aaron. There\u2019s a deputy watching him and they won\u2019t let anyone else in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra, that would have been Frank Vine\u2019s call, not Dustin\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour FBI man put him up to it,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cI want to talk to that man on the phone. I need to be with Aaron!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not with them. We\u2019re almost back at the Horse Farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, you get down here as soon as you\u2019re back! You have to do something. This is ridiculous. And appalling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra, I\u2019m not going to be able to do anything,\u201d Olivia told her. \u201cI\u2019m not law enforcement. Speak to the deputy. He can reach Frank.\u201d</p><p>Sandra swore. Olivia tried to tell her that, right now, Aaron really needed medical care more than he needed his hand held\u2014even if he was having an affair with the person who wanted to hold his hand.</p><p>But as she tried to form the words, the phone went dead. Sandra had hung up on her.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Mariah asked, riding up to her.</p><p>\u201cSandra. She\u2019s upset. They won\u2019t let her in with Aaron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she want you to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake Dustin tell Frank that the hospital should let her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe blames Dustin?\u201d</p><p>Olivia just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting kind of scary, huh? Two accidents, one deadly, the other one almost so. Well, I guess Marcus brought on his own accident, but Aaron\u2019s as straight as an arrow. Makes you wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMariah,\u201d she said, irritated, \u201cI still don\u2019t believe Marcus brought about his own death.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cI guess we all need to be careful.\u201d</p><p>Mariah nodded. \u201cMaybe we should close down for a while. Maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Maybe the Horse Farm shouldn\u2019t be open for a while. Maybe that\u2019s what...someone wants.\u201d</p><p>Olivia turned to look at her. \u201cMariah, what\u2019s happened lately is bad. But the Horse Farm\u2019s done so much for so many people. Brent\u2019s a different person now. Lots of kids\u2014and adults!\u2014have developed their own sense of self-worth through the work we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. The Horse Farm is my life\u2014I wouldn\u2019t want it to close permanently, but...if there\u2019s another accident...\u201d She shivered violently. \u201cThis morning...I was so excited. I thought I\u2019d finally seen the general! And then, when I found the bloody remains of that cow... And who would\u2019ve figured that Aaron would be drowning at the same time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead,\u201d Olivia reminded her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Olivia! He has to make it!\u201d she whimpered. \u201cIt\u2019s so horrible. We were all so close. We loved working together. We were a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still a family,\u201d Olivia said firmly. \u201cAnd, please, stop talking in the past tense. The kids can hear us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think the kids aren\u2019t saying the same thing?\u201d</p><p>Olivia turned in her saddle, looking back at the other riders. Matt and Joey were close together, deep in whispered conversation. At the end of the line, Drew was riding listlessly, as if he were in shock. Deputy Callahan was trying to be cheerful, riding beside Brent. Mason was with Sean.</p><p>\u201cThe work isn\u2019t what\u2019s wrong, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this the best we can.\u201d</p><p>But Mariah\u2019s words were to prove prophetic. When they reached the Horse Farm, the van from the boys\u2019 rehab house was already there to get them; the driver and Sydney were out front, talking. Brent\u2019s mother was standing by the fence, her face pinched with worry.</p><p>When Olivia dismounted, Sydney hurried over to her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t good,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Parsonage is reconsidering. They\u2019re talking about withdrawing the boys because of everything going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She saw Brent dismount from his horse. He ran to her, burying his face in her shoulder. \u201cLiv...\u201d</p><p>His mother hurried over. \u201cBrent!\u201d</p><p>She hugged her son, and Brent hugged her back. Brent gave others unconditional love, something Olivia truly appreciated. He loved his mother and he instinctively understood her concern. But he also understood that she\u2019d come to take him away\u2014and that he might not be coming back.</p><p>Olivia squared her shoulders. She spoke to Brent\u2019s mother, assuring her that the boys were never alone and nothing like this could happen to one of them; she didn\u2019t know why Aaron had been alone but he was an adult. Besides, she added, accidents did happen.</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe it for a minute.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, we adore you\u2014my husband, my other children\u2014we all adore you. And this place. But... Well, Marcus is dead. And now this? It\u2019s a little frightening. No, it\u2019s really frightening. I... Well, I\u2019ll call before we come out for any more sessions.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Olivia told her dully.</p><p>Accidents happened.</p><p>Well, they did, but in this case it was a lie.</p> <p>But she gave the same lie to the boys\u2019 van driver from Parsonage House, saying that the Horse Farm premises and activities were safe. She said they were all devastated by Aaron\u2019s accident and that they prayed he\u2019d make a speedy recovery.</p><p>When the boys were gone, she walked into the office and fell into one of the comfortable chairs, exhausted. Sydney followed her in.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Sammy?\u201d she asked him. The dog should have been there when she arrived; he should\u2019ve been around, wagging his tail and barking with excitement.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in my room. I love that dog\u2014and I know how much you love him\u2014but he\u2019s been a pain in the ass! Howled last night, scratched at the door. I put him on a leash and took him out for a while. I guess he didn\u2019t want to be left behind. Or else...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe he sensed something was wrong. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll go get him for you, but...can you tell me more about Aaron?\u201d His features were tense. \u201cI\u2019ve only spoken with Frank Vine and the info line at the hospital. Oh, and Sandra. They don\u2019t seem to know anything at all, except that apparently he wasn\u2019t breathing, the fed got him breathing again and...that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know as much as we know. We haven\u2019t had phone service most of the way. I spoke with Sandra briefly and she was breathing fire. I was hoping you could tell us something,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>Before he could answer her, Drew, Mason and Mariah trailed in, all looking weary and dejected. They perched on various seats about the room. Mariah started to say something but Deputy Callahan walked in behind her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sydney, do you have coffee going by any chance?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI always have coffee going,\u201d Sydney retorted. \u201cOr someone does, anyway.\u201d The stress he was feeling was apparent.</p><p>He poured the deputy a mug of coffee and handed it to him.</p> <p>\u201cSo, at this moment,\u201d Sydney said, \u201cno one knows anything. We could all go and sit at the hospital, but hell, Sandra\u2019s already doing that. I\u2019ve been calling the hospital\u2019s patient-information line every thirty minutes,\u201d he went on. \u201cThey don\u2019t say anything except \u2018the patient is in stable condition.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cStable is good,\u201d Mariah said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mason agreed. \u201cMuch better than...\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t finish his sentence. They all knew what he hadn\u2019t said.</p><p>Dead. Stable was much better than dead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked to Sandra a few times, too, and like you said, Liv, she\u2019s breathing fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course. They\u2019ve been seeing each other for ages\u2014discreetly, or so they believed,\u201d Mariah said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Olivia murmured.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you aren\u2019t one for gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor, apparently, do I pay much attention to what\u2019s going on around me,\u201d Olivia said dryly.</p><p>\u201cThey did tell her this much,\u201d Sydney offered. \u201cThey\u2019re putting Aaron through a bunch of tests\u2014brain scans\u2014hoping he didn\u2019t do any permanent damage to himself. I guess right now... Well, he\u2019s breathing. They\u2019re doing all the things...that hospitals do.\u201d He looked at Olivia. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose Aaron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to go on faith and hope.\u201d</p><p>Sydney took a cup of coffee himself and sat on one of the sofas across from her. \u201cYou already know that the staff at Parsonage House don\u2019t think the boys should come back here, at least for now. They\u2019re afraid the parents will pull all the kids out of their program.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was quiet for a moment. \u201cYou know,\u201d she began, \u201cMarcus started this place with little more than one broken-down horse and an abused dog. He built it up, creating the wonderful facility that exists today. We\u2019ll hang in and wait this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe in what we\u2019re doing. I kid all the time about wanting to be a movie star, but...I love what we do,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThe thing is...we\u2019ve all still got to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEating is a good pastime,\u201d Mariah murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got savings,\u201d Drew said. \u201cI\u2019m fine, and I\u2019ll stick it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorses have to eat, too,\u201d Sydney reminded him.</p><p>Mariah stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going home, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m exhausted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you go home, you\u2019ll be doing so at your own risk,\u201d the deputy said.</p><p>Everyone in the room seemed to freeze.</p><p>At last Mariah repeated his words weakly. \u201cAt my own risk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t believe these were accidents anymore,\u201d Callahan told her.</p><p>She sank back into her chair. \u201cYou think that someone...that something...that Aaron was...pushed into the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure. Not yet. We\u2019re hoping to learn the truth,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping Aaron will wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d Sydney asked sadly.</p><p>Drew managed a faint smile. \u201cHe has to wake up. I can\u2019t spend the rest of my life just looking at you guys! Not that I don\u2019t love you, but there are days Sydney and I can\u2019t wait for you to leave so we can head up to our apartments!\u201d</p><p>The others tried to smile, too. It was then that Callahan\u2019s phone rang. He answered it and spoke briefly.</p><p>\u201cAaron Bentley is conscious,\u201d he announced.</p><p>11</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what Sandra Cheever does, she\u2019s not getting in to see Aaron,\u201d Dustin told Frank Vine. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thankful as can be that Aaron Bentley is alive. But he has to speak with us before he sees anyone else. It doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re a couple. For one thing, Sandra was out here in the woods. For another, I don\u2019t believe that Aaron going face-first into the stream was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still convinced he was struck with a dart?\u201d Frank shook head grudgingly. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to go with you on all this, but you do know it still sounds crazy.\u201d</p><p>They were halfway back to the Horse Farm, Frank\u2019s discovery rolled up and draped over his saddle.</p><p>It was General Rufus Cunningham. Or rather, Frank had come upon a rendering of the general on cotton gauze. He\u2019d stumbled across it in the trees, stretched between two branches. While the artwork was darned good, the cloth was the type often used by community theater groups\u2014or colleges. Places without Broadway budgets for their backdrops. This particular piece seemed like the kind of thing frat guys might use to scare their dates.</p><p>But it was equally possible that someone in their group had put it up and done some vocal tricks to lure Mariah into the forest\u2014just when Aaron was supposed to be dying.</p><p>With Frank Vine now grudgingly accepting the fact that things might not be what they seemed, Dustin had faith that the image would be investigated.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not mention the cheesecloth image of the general yet,\u201d Dustin suggested. \u201cI think we should investigate and find out where it was produced and by whom.\u201d</p><p>Frank Vine glanced over at him. \u201cAgent Blake, you must have a lot more resources at your fingertips than we have out here. I cover a pretty wide space and I do it with an eight-man team. Well, sorry, that includes two women. I\u2019m not trying to be a sexist.\u201d</p><p>Dustin grinned. \u201cI didn\u2019t take you for one, Vine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a yokel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I take you for a yokel, sir. I\u2019m grateful that you\u2019re giving me a chance\u2014and that you\u2019re willing to look at this thing from all sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould still simply be accidents. Strange and sad accidents,\u201d Vine reminded him.</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d he agreed. But they weren\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t explain to Frank Vine that a ghost had told them about his own murder.</p><p>They were almost back at the Horse Farm. Frank, who\u2019d arrived via the rescue helicopter, had ridden back on Shebaan, Sandra\u2019s mount. The tents were folded up and the gear was being carried back on Gargantua, who was trailing behind them. Luckily the massive horse didn\u2019t seem to be overburdened.</p><p>As they closed in on the property, Frank\u2019s phone rang. At the same moment, Dustin felt his own pocket vibrate. He answered; Olivia was on the other end, speaking softly. \u201cHe\u2019s conscious! We got a call that Aaron is conscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s the same information Frank\u2019s getting right now,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cSandra\u2019s having a fit. They\u2019re giving her some information but not allowing her to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t see him. Not until I\u2014\u201d he glanced over at Vine \u201c\u2014not until we\u2019ve had a chance to interview him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked, sounding a little desperate.</p><p>\u201cAlmost at the Horse Farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. The natives are getting restless,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIf you can get Drew and Sydney to meet us, that would be helpful,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Olivia said, and hung up.</p><p>He glanced over at the deputy sheriff again.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want anyone in to see him?\u201d Vine asked him. \u201cThey say Sandra\u2019s hollering up a storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, she was there when it all happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think she somehow got a dart into Aaron Bentley and ran back to the camp?\u201d Despite his open mind on the matter, Frank sounded somewhat skeptical.</p><p>\u201cSomeone did,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really know that. Remember, you\u2019re talking to me about an investigation. We\u2019re going to need to deal with facts\u2014not supposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. My educated theory\u2014because of what I found in the woods when I was riding with Olivia\u2014is that someone is knocking people out with a dart gun. Once they\u2019re unconscious, this person kills them and makes the deaths look like accidents. Like they\u2019re caused by an overdose or a lack of coordination. Look, I know this still seems far-fetched to you, but I swear there\u2019s more to it, and if we don\u2019t find out the truth, there\u2019ll be another body. A dead one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll play along\u2014best as I can,\u201d Frank told him.</p><p>\u201cI can bring in help.\u201d</p><p>Vine was silent.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to invite in the FBI?\u201d Dustin asked after a minute. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be that official. If you prefer, I can just get a few people to drive over to Tennessee and do some legwork.\u201d</p><p>Vine shook his head. \u201cDamn, I wish I could say I can manage this without help.\u201d</p><p>Dustin smiled. \u201cFrank, we couldn\u2019t come in and manage anything\u2014if you weren\u2019t giving us help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see a couple of guys coming out to give us a hand with all this gear. I\u2019m assuming you want to get right to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. And I want Olivia Gordon with us.\u201d</p> <p>Frank groaned. \u201cSomething else going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think someone tried to break into her house the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve called. We could have done something.\u201d</p><p>Dustin didn\u2019t respond, and Frank sighed. \u201cYeah, yeah, you\u2019re right. We would\u2019ve walked around and seen nothing and probably thought she heard raccoons crawling around on her porch. But you don\u2019t think it was that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Frank sighed again. \u201cThings are weird around here, no matter how you look at it. I\u2019m damned glad I\u2019ve already taken my dog from that place! So, here\u2019s the deal. You bring in whoever you want\u2014but you keep me apprised. You make me aware of everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak anymore; they\u2019d reached the ranch and both Drew and Sydney were outside, waiting to take the horses as they dismounted. Sammy was out in the yard and he greeted Dustin as if he were his master, as if they\u2019d been together ever since the big mutt had been a puppy. He could only give the dog his distracted attention because Drew was anxious to speak.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014he\u2019s conscious,\u201d he told Dustin. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me, Drew. Sounds good to me,\u201d Dustin assured him. He looked toward the office. Olivia was standing by the steps. Deputy Callahan came out behind her, presumably to see what his next orders were.</p><p>\u201cHang in here for a bit, Jimmy. Help these fellows keep an eye on things,\u201d Frank told him. \u201cI\u2019m going to the hospital with Agent Blake. Liv, you come on with us. You\u2019re in charge now, so if Aaron\u2019s up to speaking, he just might want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Dustin lowered his head, trying not to smile.</p><p>It was good to be in with the local law. That could make things so much easier. Frank knew he was worried about Olivia; he was helping him keep her close by.</p><p>\u201cSure. Okay. Thank you,\u201d Olivia said. She walked out to meet them. Sammy ran up to her, and she dropped down, petting the dog. \u201cSammy, I\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019ve got to stay here awhile longer. Okay? I\u2019ll be back for you, I promise.\u201d</p> <p>Frank was already headed to his official car; he\u2019d had a couple of his deputies drop it off. The dog was whining, as if afraid to see Olivia go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got him.\u201d Sydney grasped Sammy\u2019s collar. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d he demanded. \u201cOlivia will be back!\u201d</p><p>Sammy continued to whine as she joined Dustin, and the two of them followed Frank to his police car. Within minutes, they were halfway to the hospital.</p><p>Vine had decided to use his siren.</p><p>Aaron looked good. In fact, his appearance didn\u2019t even resemble the way he\u2019d looked the last time Olivia had seen him\u2014wet, a strange shade of pale ashen blue, his bones seeming to protrude everywhere.</p><p>He was in a semiupright position on his hospital bed. An IV was providing him with some kind of nourishment or medication, but his color was back and his eyes were bright.</p><p>\u201cAaron!\u201d she whispered, entering. She ran to his bed and realized she was trembling. She\u2019d almost lost another friend; she was suddenly weak at the knees, so grateful that she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLiv!\u201d</p><p>She carefully hugged him. He hugged her back with a surprising and gratifying strength.</p><p>She stood at the side of his bed, gazing down at him. Dustin and Frank were behind her, while Sandra remained in the waiting room, fit to be tied. Dustin had told her they just needed a few minutes, and then she\u2019d be able to see Aaron.</p><p>When Frank tried to explain that Olivia had to be first because of her position at the Horse Farm, Sandra had looked at her resentfully. Olivia had been shocked by the venom in that stare.</p><p>But, in all honesty, she understood\u2014in a way. Sandra was sleeping with Aaron. Something she\u2019d apparently been the last to realize.</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re here!\u201d Aaron said, looking at Olivia and then Dustin and Frank. His voice seemed to tremble. \u201cI understand I\u2019m alive because of you, Dustin. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did what anyone would have,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. We\u2019re glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t they let Sandra in?\u201d Aaron asked.</p><p>\u201cWe needed to speak with you first,\u201d Frank said. \u201cAaron, what happened to you? You\u2019re not the kind of man who\u2019d walk to the stream and just fall in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. It was odd as hell, and dumb as hell!\u201d Aaron told them. \u201cI\u2019d walked on over to the stream\u2014didn\u2019t think anyone else was up yet\u2014and I was getting ready to kneel down and wash my face. Then...\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes for a minute, puzzled. \u201cThen I don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t know?\u201d Frank repeated, clearly annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI was there, and then I was in the water,\u201d Aaron said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, think, Aaron. Did you see anyone, hear anyone? Was there anything out of the ordinary?\u201d Dustin asked, trying to encourage him.</p><p>Aaron was thoughtful. \u201cNo... Must have hit my head on a rock or something. I mean, the water isn\u2019t even deep. What, I was in about two feet of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Dustin confirmed.</p><p>\u201cAaron, this just beats all,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThere must have been something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. It was just a regular morning,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cGot up, looked over at the horses, felt the chill of the morning. I walked the fifty or so yards to the water...heard some birds chirp...the buzz of some insects and then...I woke up here. In some kind of brain machine! I\u2019m fine now, honest to God, I\u2019m fine now. If they\u2019ll just let me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll keep you overnight for observation,\u201d Frank told him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s back up,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cFrank\u2014you heard insects? Like a buzzing in your ear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlies and mosquitos do seem to buzz in your ear, don\u2019t they?\u201d Aaron asked, shaking his head and smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhich ear?\u201d Dustin persisted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich ear?\u201d Dustin repeated. \u201cNever mind. May I look at your neck, at the side of your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Aaron shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019ve pushed and prodded everything else.\u201d</p><p>Dustin walked over to Aaron and moved his head forward, studying it with intensity. He frowned suddenly, feeling something in his hair.</p><p>\u201cSmarts there a little,\u201d Aaron said.</p><p>Dustin pulled out his penlight and inspected Aaron\u2019s scalp. He nodded at Frank, who walked over.</p><p>\u201cLooks like an insect bite,\u201d Frank said.</p><p>\u201cExcept it isn\u2019t.\u201d Dustin stepped back. \u201cAaron, I believe someone shot you with a dart gun. There was enough of a drug cocktail on the arrow tip to knock you out. It wouldn\u2019t have killed you. But since you were standing by the water, you fell in and nearly died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Aaron demanded incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI believe Marcus Danby was murdered, struck with a like dart laced with a similar cocktail of drugs. When he was unconscious, he was injected with the heroin and \u2018helped\u2019 to fall into the ravine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d Aaron said, staring from one to the other. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that yet,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>Aaron turned to Frank Vine. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy kill Marcus? Why kill me? All he had, really, was the Horse Farm and it\u2019s tied up in trusts and it\u2019s nonprofit, so...\u201d</p><p>He broke off. His eyes fell on Olivia\u2014not with accusation but with confusion. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cWe were hoping you might\u2019ve seen someone, heard someone... Been able to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry. The thing on my head must be a bite. Not a prick from a dart gun. Dart gun! Come on! Who the hell runs around the hills of Tennessee with a dart gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we have to find out,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure?\u201d Aaron asked in a trembling voice.</p><p>Olivia glanced at Dustin, then turned back to Aaron. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Marcus suddenly went mad in the woods and started shooting up. You knew him. Did you believe that when you heard it?\u201d</p><p>Aaron swallowed. \u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut...dart guns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever the exact composition of the poison, it causes an instant knockout,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t remain in the system. Or it\u2019s difficult to identify\u2014and requires special tests at autopsy. The kind that aren\u2019t usually done unless poisoning is suspected. I think that same person tried to attack Olivia in the woods, and then went after you at the stream.\u201d</p><p>Aaron looked at Frank Vine. \u201cThis is crazy\u2014crazy,\u201d he said.</p><p>Frank shrugged. \u201cYou wanna live, Aaron? Crazy or not, you might want to listen to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do I do? How the hell do you hide from a dart gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou watch your step,\u201d Frank told him. \u201cStay with people at all times. It\u2019s hard for someone to pull off an \u2018accident\u2019 when you\u2019re in a group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow close are you to catching whoever is doing this?\u201d Aaron asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot very close, I have to admit,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>Aaron let his eyes drift shut. \u201cMay I please see Sandra?

After that, I\u2019ll rest at my place for another twenty-four. Then we\u2019ll see where we are.\u201d</p><p>Olivia inhaled and exhaled slowly. \u201cAaron, there may not be a lot to manage. We\u2019re starting to lose clients\u2014guests.\u201d Aaron stared at her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d he asked thickly.</p><p>\u201cFind whoever is doing this,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cThere had to be someone else in the woods with us,\u201d Aaron insisted.</p><p>\u201cThat is a possibility,\u201d Frank said.</p><p>\u201cWill you let Sandra come in now? Please?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, fine, we can do that,\u201d Frank told him.</p><p>Olivia gave Aaron a kiss on the forehead. He looked up at her and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll fix it, kid. I know you will.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know, Aaron! I don\u2019t know.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say the words out loud. She offered him what she hoped was an encouraging smile and followed Dustin and Frank out of the room. As Frank spoke to the deputy who\u2019d been assigned to watch the room, Dustin told Sandra she could go in.</p><p>She walked by Olivia, looking as if she\u2019d like to scratch her eyes out. Olivia didn\u2019t believe Sandra would harm Aaron in any way. But, at that moment, she thought the woman would have gladly strangled her.</p><p>12</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to reschedule all our weekend appointments,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>They\u2019d returned to the Horse Farm and she was speaking to Mason, Mariah, Sydney and Drew. Dustin leaned against the wall, watching as she spoke.</p><p>Sammy had taken up a position at her feet.</p><p>She\u2019d announced that the police suspected the situation that plagued them might have nothing to do with a relapse and an accident.</p><p>The room had already buzzed with protests and disbelief. But now, the group was subdued and concerned.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019ll reschedule. If anyone even comes back,\u201d Mason said glumly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll hope for the best,\u201d Olivia responded. \u201cIf they don\u2019t reschedule, we\u2019ll be understanding, and we\u2019ll tell them we hope they\u2019ll come back in the future. We\u2019ll explain that we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but\u2014\u201d Olivia paused, looking over at Dustin \u201c\u2014but the authorities will discover the truth very soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you want us to do, Olivia?\u201d Drew asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou and Sydney do what you always do\u2014tend to the horses. And the cats and dogs and...I think that\u2019s all we have right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we close down, though,\u201d Mariah said, \u201cdon\u2019t we look like we\u2019re guilty of something?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head. \u201cNo. We look like we\u2019re concerned about all our guests and we want to make sure we\u2019re providing an entirely safe environment for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should start looking for work,\u201d Mariah said.</p><p>\u201cIf you feel you need to move on, everyone here will understand,\u201d Olivia told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jumping ship! I\u2019m just thinking about it,\u201d Mariah added quickly.</p><p>\u201cThe Horse Farm is all right for now. We can make it for a while with all the trusts and provisions in the will. I\u2019ll call the attorney and let him know where we are,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI\u2019m expecting Aaron will be back in the office by Tuesday. We can try to reschedule our sessions for next week.\u201d</p><p>Mariah excused herself as her cell phone rang. She stepped into the games room to take the call.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we be doing?\u201d Mason asked Olivia. \u201cI mean\u2014no offense, guys\u2014but this is easier for Sydney and Drew. They just keep looking after the place and the animals. But for you and me and Mariah...\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled at him. \u201cMason, why don\u2019t you get some new modeling shots done? See if there\u2019s any extra work in the area for the next few days.\u201d</p><p>Mason looked back at her and then laughed. \u201cYou know what I\u2019ve never done? Visited the Hermitage. It\u2019s almost anti-American to be this close to Nashville and not have visited the Hermitage. Old Hickory\u2019s homestead! I think I\u2019ll do that tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan!\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>Mariah stepped back into the room, her eyes wide. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cI just got a call\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople want to support us, right?\u201d Mason interrupted. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to book sessions, anyway!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mariah said, frowning. \u201cThat was the agency that sets up ghost tours for me. They say they\u2019re getting constant calls from tourists who want to come out here and go on ghost tours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Mason said.</p><p>\u201cNo, not great,\u201d Sydney said, frowning. \u201cSounds like people just want to see where Marcus died, along with Civil War ghosts. That\u2019s ghoulish, not great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Sydney, I wouldn\u2019t tell stories about Marcus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think it would come up? That people wouldn\u2019t ask you where Marcus Danby died?\u201d Mason demanded.</p><p>\u201cAnd where Aaron Bentley almost died?\u201d Drew asked quietly.</p><p>Mariah stared at them all. \u201cHey, guys, I\u2019ve always done ghost tours. History tours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s fine, Mariah,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cYou give great history tours and you have for a long time. Just don\u2019t book anything until Aaron\u2019s back on Tuesday. Not tonight, though. We\u2019re all drained.\u201d</p><p>Mariah nodded. \u201cOf course. I agree, tonight would be bad. And they\u2019re not my horses. They belong to the farm, and one of you guys usually comes with me and sometimes we camp.... But I\u2019m definitely not camping again for a while! Anyway, it\u2019s all on hold.\u201d</p><p>Mason stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going home\u2014at my own risk, mind you. Call me if there\u2019s anything new or if you need me. Oh, it\u2019s okay if we go see Aaron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>Mason started to walk out, but stopped and looked directly at Dustin. \u201cWhat do you make of all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. That\u2019s why I suggest you all stay in public places, hang around in groups\u2014and watch your backs,\u201d Dustin told him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, thanks,\u201d Mason muttered. When he reached the door, he paused and turned back. \u201cSomeone want to walk me to my car?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Dustin smiled, pushed away from the wall and said, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ll take off, too,\u201d Mariah said, rushing over. \u201cNot that I think anyone would be after me. Or you, Mason. But then, I wouldn\u2019t have thought anyone would be after Aaron....\u201d She stared at Olivia. \u201cYou should be careful, Olivia. Really careful. I mean, if things go in order... Marcus, Aaron\u2014you. Oh, Liv! I can\u2019t believe I just said that. Hey, you want to come and stay with me?\u201d</p><p>Dustin stepped in. \u201cOlivia will be all right. I\u2019ll be watching over her,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mariah started to smile. Her lips twitched as if she was about to make a sexual innuendo.</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She waved at Drew and Sydney. \u201cWe won\u2019t just desert you two. I\u2019ll be here tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mariah,\u201d Drew said.</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d Sydney told her.</p><p>Mariah brightened. \u201cAaron is fine\u2014and that\u2019s the main thing, right? By next week, we\u2019ll be back up to speed. I just know it!\u201d</p><p>Her words seemed to fall into empty space.</p><p>Then Drew gave it a try. \u201cSure, Mariah.\u201d</p><p>Dustin walked Mariah and Mason out the door and toward the parking lot. Both hesitated as they stepped outside, looking out over the rolling pasture.</p><p>\u201cThis place is so beautiful,\u201d Mason said, his voice reverential.</p><p>Mariah nodded. \u201cSo, Dustin\u2014even Deputy Vine thinks something odd is going on. But in a court of law, wouldn\u2019t we be looking at a bunch of circumstances? As opposed to solid evidence? Sorry, I guess I watch too much crime TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m into being safe and if Frank wants us to be safe\u2014well, I\u2019m there,\u201d Mason said. \u201cSee you all. Thanks, Secret Agent Man.\u201d</p><p>Dustin didn\u2019t bother to protest. \u201cTake care, Mason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do!\u201d Mason promised. He walked to his car. Mariah started walking to hers; by the end, she was running. She hopped in, revved the engine and lifted a hand to show that she was on her way.</p><p>He walked back into the office. Olivia, Drew and Sydney glanced up at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Drew asked him.</p><p>\u201cFind a killer,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>13</p><p>\u201cThat was pretty blunt,\u201d Olivia told Dustin as they drove away from the Horse Farm.</p><p>His rental car was staying there.</p><p>They were driving to her place. Together.</p><p>Sammy was with them, of course. The dog was in the backseat but his head appeared between them every few seconds, despite Olivia\u2019s suggestion that he stay in the back. Dustin had a feeling that she was usually a little more authoritative with the dog, but she was tired. Worn out. And she was feeling guilty about Sammy.</p><p>\u201cBlunt? Perhaps. Not much else to say at this point, though.\u201d He turned to look at her. \u201cWhoever is doing this has to be in your group. And you did the best thing you could have done\u2014stopping all sessions until Aaron\u2019s back. If Aaron makes it back.\u201d</p><p>Olivia gripped the wheel and glanced his way quickly. \u201cFirst of all, canceling our sessions wasn\u2019t entirely my choice. And what do you mean, if Aaron makes it back? He looked great. They\u2019re just keeping him for observation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s keen to get out of the hospital. He almost died, Olivia. According to him, he heard a \u2018mosquito\u2019 buzz and went down immediately after that. He\u2019s not a stupid man. He listened to what Frank and I had to say, but he just wanted to see Sandra and get out. The sheriff\u2019s department doesn\u2019t have the manpower to put a guard on everyone at the Horse Farm, so I\u2019m hoping he and Sandra stay together. For now, Aaron is fine. However, I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen when they release him\u2014even if Sandra never lets him out of her sight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re really scaring the hell out of me,\u201d Olivia muttered.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomeone had an image of the general on his horse out in the forest. I don\u2019t know much about art, but it\u2019s on some kind of cheesecloth, which, I assume, would make it look ghostly in the right light. Frank Vine was the one to find it. That\u2019s good, because it means he\u2019s bought into our suspicions about what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. An artist drew a picture on gauzy cloth\u2014and put it in the forest? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you\u2019re stumbling around at night or in the early morning\u2014when the light\u2019s hazy\u2014you\u2019d think you were seeing the general.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...wouldn\u2019t you check to see if it was real?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cNo, not most people. Most people would run like hell!\u201d</p> <p>Olivia nodded thoughtfully. \u201cOkay, so what would the image of the general in the forest have to do with someone attacking Aaron at the stream? And are you sure Aaron was attacked?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head impatiently. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not one hundred percent sure, but anything else is unlikely. Aaron might just happen to have a little wound the size of an insect sting near the base of his neck. And I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not one hundred percent sure of the connection between those two events\u2014Aaron\u2019s so-called accident and Mariah\u2019s discovery\u2014either.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMaybe Mariah simply imagined that she heard the general speaking and then happened to wander into the woods where she found an image of him\u2014and the torn-up carcass of a cow. Like I said, it\u2019s unlikely, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is possible,\u201d Olivia said a little stiffly.</p><p>She pulled into her driveway and let out a little cry of dismay. Dustin frowned, looking toward the entry.</p><p>There was a note on the door.</p><p>\u201cThe alarm company came and went,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI forgot all about them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d he told her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll just reschedule them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have liked to get the alarm system in today. Funny, I\u2019ve lived by myself for several years and I\u2019ve never been afraid. But now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s call them right away,\u201d Dustin suggested.</p><p>\u201cAnd after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a few other calls to make. And for what it\u2019s worth\u2014I won\u2019t be leaving. But we\u2019ll put some faith in Sammy, too. He does seem to be an excellent watchdog.\u201d</p><p>Sammy was apparently attempting to prove it by barking ferociously. As they got out of the car, the dog bolted past them and went dashing around the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the matter with that dog?\u201d Olivia asked, worried.</p><p>\u201cDogs are sensitive. He senses that something\u2019s going on,\u201d Dustin answered. He smiled at her. \u201cHey, come on. You know that. You\u2019re a therapist who works with animals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cI know he\u2019s not barking for nothing, and that scares me even more.\u201d</p><p>She hurried over to the house, taking the sticker the alarm company had left before opening the door. Sammy came rushing back and swept by their legs as they entered.</p><p>\u201cWant me to call the alarm people?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can\u2014but I\u2019m happy to do it. I thought maybe you\u2019d forage through the kitchen and find food.\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed at that. \u201cOkay, you get on the phone. I\u2019ll look for food.\u201d</p><p>He sat in the living room and put a call through to the alarm company. They were exceptionally pleasant, completely understanding of an emergency and happy to reschedule for later that week.</p><p>He could hear pots and pans and cutlery being moved about in the kitchen, so he went ahead and called the office. He spoke to Jackson Crow first, filling him in, and then he was put through to Malachi, who was eager to hear what was going on.</p><p>\u201cI told Jackson it\u2019s pretty much out in the open now,\u201d he explained to Malachi. \u201cAnd the local lawman has been okay. I thought he was going to be difficult at first, but he came around. We\u2019re dealing with Deputy Sheriff Frank Vine and Deputy Jimmy Callahan. Vine knows he doesn\u2019t have the manpower to work on this. Oh, the medical examiner is all right, too. I brought him the bits of dart and the pieces of tree bark I took from the woods, and I\u2019m waiting on a report from him now.\u201d</p><p>Malachi put him on hold while he had a quick discussion in the office. A moment later, he was back on the line. \u201cI\u2019m heading out there with Abby, Sloan and Jane. We don\u2019t want to make an announcement or anything like that. We\u2019ll just show up. We should be in by tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cLet us know when you\u2019re in the vicinity. I\u2019ll keep you posted on where we are.\u201d</p><p>As he ended the call, Olivia walked out of the kitchen. \u201cThere\u2019s a casserole in the oven. I\u2019ll be back down in ten. Oh, the guest room is across from mine upstairs. Make yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking up at her. They were both the worse for wear, but even covered in trail dust with bedraggled hair, Olivia Gordon was...striking.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d His voice sounded hoarse to his own ears. \u201cMalachi and some of the Krewe will be here tomorrow,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She seemed pleased. And yet, he thought, not as pleased as she would\u2019ve been a few days earlier.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d grown on her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean...considering all the variables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You obviously do. You saved Aaron\u2019s life this morning,\u201d she said fervently.</p><p>\u201cAnyone with a few courses in emergency medicine could\u2019ve done what I did\u2014and I\u2019m sure that you would have acted if I hadn\u2019t been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is you found Aaron. You saved him. Will you excuse me? I\u2019ll be down in a bit.\u201d</p><p>She turned and ran up the stairs. He found his backpack by the door and hiked it onto his shoulders, then followed her up. The door to the left was hers, he knew. He pushed open the opposite door and went into the guest room, where he set his backpack on the bed. He headed into the shower, trying not to think about the fact that she was across the hall.</p><p>Naked.</p><p>While the heat of the water felt wonderful, he didn\u2019t want to tarry. And he didn\u2019t\u2014the hot water lasted a few minutes, and then it went cold. He stepped out, swearing softly, and remembered that while the bathroom was probably fairly new and up-to-date, the house itself was very old. Hot water just wasn\u2019t going to last that long, not with two people showering at the same time.</p><p>He dressed, got his computer from his bag and left the room.</p><p>Sammy lay in the upstairs hallway between the two rooms, as if watching over both of them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good old boy,\u201d Dustin said, bending to scratch behind the dog\u2019s ears.</p><p>As he made his way down the stairs and into the kitchen, Sammy followed him. Dustin saw a bag of dog treats on the counter and offered him one. \u201cYou tried hard, didn\u2019t you? You knew something wasn\u2019t right the day Marcus was killed. I think you went after the killer. But the killer wasn\u2019t really supplied with the customary murder weapons. No gun, no knife. So you were probably whacked with a good-size rock or maybe a branch. But you went up to the killer\u2014close enough to get a walloping\u2014because it was someone you trusted, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to yourself?\u201d Olivia asked, sweeping into the kitchen. Her hair was still damp. She was wearing a casual cotton halter dress and sandals. There was something compelling about her\u2014the naturalness of her movements, her lack of makeup, the tempting scent of her soap.</p><p>\u201cSammy is an excellent listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were discussing...?\u201d</p><p>He smiled grimly. \u201cSammy and me? We were discussing my certainty that someone involved with the Horse Farm is doing this. I think Sammy trusted the person who hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if someone at the Horse Farm hurt him, wouldn\u2019t he be afraid of that person now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014unless the person threw something at him from a distance, maybe as Sammy approached. In that case, it\u2019s possible he never associated the person with the action and the pain it caused him.\u201d</p><p>She walked past him and into the kitchen, pulling a casserole from the oven. \u201cIt\u2019s just hamburger and potatoes, with a soup mix and crisp onion topping. Not very gourmet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever smelled anything better,\u201d he said.</p><p>Not true. He\u2019d never smelled anything as good as her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring it out. There\u2019s a dining table set up in the family room. You can eat and play on your computer at the same time,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She carried the casserole into the spacious back room. The table appeared to date from the early 1800s, and there were heat pads on it for protection. \u201cAgent Blake, have a seat,\u201d she said, placing the casserole on one of the pads.</p><p>He was wondering how she\u2019d managed anything other than the casserole, but she also put out a platter of raw vegetables and dip, along with glasses of sweet tea, plates and silverware.</p><p>He\u2019d opened the computer while she set up.</p><p>She closed it as she joined him. \u201cI\u2019m starving, and I know you are, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, and we can talk, which is almost as good as staring at a computer screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost?\u201d</p><p>He was pretty sure he actually flushed. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean it that way. It\u2019s just that the facts and figures I need are in the computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think Marcus has been lately?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI assume he\u2019s off trying to solve his own murder\u2014except that he could help a lot more by hanging around with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never did like camping,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cStrange, because he loved nature so much. He loved a walk or a ride through the hills or along the stream.\u201d She looked away quickly and he realized she was close to tears. You could accept the death of a loved one, but it often took time to really remember the good times and be able to smile and laugh at a memory. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s still with us,\u201d he reminded her softly. \u201cSomewhere,\u201d he added. \u201cBut let\u2019s go back to that day. So Marcus was at the Horse Farm and we know he definitely went in to see Aaron. We know they talked. He probably talked to Andrew and Sydney, too, because they would\u2019ve been working at the stables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and we know that because Frank spoke to them. They had casual conversations with Marcus fairly early in the day. I had a session in the morning. When I\u2019m with my groups, I\u2019m not paying attention to much else. As gentle as our horses are, they\u2019re still horses. I keep an eye on every interaction. Not to mention that I\u2019m talking most of the time. So, the upshot is that I wasn\u2019t really watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did Sammy come back hurt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDuring the lunch break. It\u2019s from twelve to one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was around during the break that day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. You\u2019re not going to like this. I had some paperwork to do so I was at my desk. I saw Drew when I brought in Trickster. He was cleaning Gargantua\u2019s hooves. I think he\u2019d been checking all their shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see Sydney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until Aaron talked about how concerned he was once Sammy came limping back. I remember Sydney called the vet right away\u2014and our vet is wonderful. He came out and made a house call, then took Sammy with him because he wanted to keep him still for the night. He was afraid Sammy might tear out his stitches. By the time the vet left, we were all worried about Marcus. We started calling him and looking for him, then we mounted up and headed out on a search. Everyone except Sandra. We needed someone to stay at the house. Oh\u2014we\u2019d called Frank Vine. He gave us a spiel about Marcus being a grown man, but Aaron insisted that something was wrong. Because of Sammy, you see. Sammy would never have left Marcus.\u201d</p> <p>Dustin was glad to hear her memories of the day; for one, listening to her, he was able to eat. And he\u2019d been famished. But now she was waiting for him to respond.</p><p>\u201cAs far as you know, any one of the others could have been out in the woods during the lunch break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so. I wasn\u2019t keeping track. And we were focused on Sammy and on the fact that Marcus seemed to be missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone could still have slipped through the cracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you eliminated anyone?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, but if you were going to eliminate someone, I\u2019m assuming it would be Aaron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDustin! He almost died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and groaned. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were going to eliminate someone, I\u2019d say Sydney and Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I like them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, there\u2019s a good reason for you. I like everyone I work with\u2014most of the time. And you have to realize it might not be someone involved with the Horse Farm. You could be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be\u2014but I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re confident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrogant, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s be kind. Go back to confident.\u201d</p><p>She began to pick up their dishes, and he rose to help. As she moved into the kitchen she asked, \u201cWho, then? Mason? His greatest flaw is his self-regard\u2014but he\u2019s still a good therapist. Mariah loves history, is almost obsessed with it, but that doesn\u2019t seem like much of a flaw. Sandra\u2014well, okay, she can be bitchy. I had my head in the clouds about her and Aaron. I mean, I had no idea there was an affair going on. But if they\u2019re in love, and I think they are, it sure doesn\u2019t make sense that she\u2019d try to hurt him, does it? Anyway, Aaron is really a doll. He\u2019s always patient and never loses his temper. As you say, Sydney and Drew are great. They\u2019re both low-key. Drew works with the boys from Parsonage House a lot, while Sydney is more of a loner. He\u2019s the sweetest man on earth, but he does tend to like animals better than people. I don\u2019t really hold that against him. And...you did suspect Aaron.\u201d</p><p>He stood behind her at the sink. His arms were almost around her as he set down their glasses. He had to step away. He\u2019d barely heard what she\u2019d said; he\u2019d been breathing in the scent of her hair.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cThey all have clean backgrounds,\u201d he said. He paused. \u201cNone of them have any charges against them, no criminal history or official complaints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes any of that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but finding out everything we can about all of them is important.\u201d</p><p>The dishes were done; the kitchen was clean.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go outside with Sammy,\u201d she said. \u201cUsually I\u2019d just let him out, but tonight...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go with him.\u201d</p><p>They walked to the front and unlocked the door, waiting for Sammy, who came running. Olivia stood on the porch, with Dustin just behind her.</p><p>\u201cSammy, stay in the front, please. Do what you need to do and come back in, okay?\u201d</p><p>The dog barked as if he understood her every word.</p><p>Maybe he did.</p><p>When they were back inside, Dustin watched her lock the door.</p><p>\u201cI wish we hadn\u2019t missed the alarm company,\u201d she said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We have a dedicated watchdog\u2014and I sleep with a big gun beside me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at that, then yawned. \u201cI...guess I\u2019ll go on up. Like I said before, make yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>She turned quickly and ran up the stairs.</p><p>Dustin double-checked the door. He walked through the house, checking all the windows but, of course, they remained bolted tight. The way the dog had behaved earlier disturbed him, though. He was pretty sure someone had been at the house\u2014someone other than the mailman or the people from the alarm company.</p><p>Satisfied that no locks had been compromised, he returned to the back porch and his computer and tried to focus on the histories of the people involved. He needed to go deeper into their backgrounds, searching for motives, but he had a hard time concentrating. Restless, he stood and called the information line at the hospital; Aaron\u2019s condition was described as \u201cgood.\u201d</p><p>Next, he called Frank Vine, who seemed grumpy when he answered. Okay, it was nighttime, and it had been a long day. Yes, Frank had been in touch with the officers on duty at the hospital and everything was fine; Sandra Cheever was sleeping in a chair next to Aaron. Frank grumbled a little more about the overtime it was going to cost him and hung up.</p><p>He\u2019d barely put his cell phone away when it rang. He could tell from his call display that it was Ellie, the young clerk at Willis House. \u201cHi, Agent Blake. I don\u2019t mean to bother you, but we were just a bit worried. We knew you were off on the camping trip, but then we hadn\u2019t heard from you.... It\u2019s pretty quiet out here, so we tend to worry about other people\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Ellie. But I won\u2019t be back tonight. Don\u2019t worry\u2014and please don\u2019t let my room go, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we wouldn\u2019t do that, Agent Blake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I intend to pay for every night, whether I\u2019m in the room or not.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cNot to worry. We\u2019ve got your credit card number. The management definitely intends to make you pay. I was just checking that you\u2019re all right. Because, of course, everyone knows what happened today!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hero! You saved Aaron Bentley\u2019s life!\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cNo, Ellie, that\u2019s kind of embarrassing. I\u2019m not a hero. The real heroes are the nurses and doctors and paramedics who save lives every day. I\u2019ve taken a few classes in emergency procedures, that\u2019s all. Pretty basic stuff. And it was more a matter of right time, right place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Maybe I should take a class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing first aid is always a good idea\u2014for anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, Coot says hello. He says he misses you and that you should go to the caf\u00e9 for breakfast tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019ll try to make it.\u201d</p><p>He put his cell away and hesitated for a minute; instinct really did count for a lot in his field. His instincts told him it would be quiet tonight. Or maybe it was pure logic\u2014if the killer didn\u2019t want to be caught, he or she would lie low for a while.</p><p>He walked to the stairs and paused there. \u201cMarcus?\u201d he said aloud. But he hadn\u2019t sensed the presence of the ghost. And Marcus didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>It was quiet on the second floor. He went into the bedroom and placed his Glock within easy reach on the nearby table. He prepared for bed, then prowled the room anxiously before he settled down to sleep. He was glad Malachi was coming with more Krewe members tomorrow. His concentration was at a low point, maybe because he\u2019d figured out he was a fool. Everything wasn\u2019t forever; everything didn\u2019t need to mean something. Adults encountered one another in life, enjoyed physical relationships, moved on....</p><p>Yes. Hell, yes, it happened all the time. Didn\u2019t make people enemies; didn\u2019t naturally make them lasting friends or lovers, but...</p><p>Sometimes the attraction was too strong, too much was expected, he told himself. And in those situations, getting involved was a mistake.</p><p>Oh, bull. He\u2019d been an idiot to turn her down.</p><p>As he lay there, he heard her door open and close. She was going downstairs. He waited for a few minutes and leaped to his feet. There was nothing that suggested a break-in; he was certain he would have heard.</p><p>He left the room and walked to the landing. Sammy was sleeping there. He raised his head, wagged his tail when he saw Dustin and went right back to sleep.</p><p>Nothing could be wrong if the dog was so sedate and unconcerned, but still...</p><p>Barefoot, he moved quickly and quietly down the stairs. As he rounded the staircase, he saw her in the kitchen, wearing a robe, something that clung to her body like silk, making a cup of tea.</p><p>\u201cUh, hello,\u201d he said, wishing he\u2019d grabbed a robe himself rather than running down in his boxers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said thickly. \u201cI just heard you down here.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cTea,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p><p>She let the tea bag fall into the cup and, grinning, walked up to him. If a man could emit sexual desire like sweat, he\u2019d have been drenched. He didn\u2019t move. He was afraid to\u2014for several reasons. There was the way he felt. There was his lack of attire. She was so close he could breathe in her scent, and if he moved, he\u2019d have to touch her.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs. Here. Not, um...not. You and me...not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, after all,\u201d she told him seriously, \u201cI\u2019m quite prepared. I\u2019m on birth control. It doesn\u2019t make sense for two people to abstain when the desire is there. And, well, it\u2019s the age of Fifty Shades of Grey\u2014and...I want to have sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Just sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just sex.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of sex?\u201d he asked, but he knew she saw the grin twisting his lips.</p><p>He thought she was about to say normal sex. But she stopped herself and moved a fraction of an inch closer, her presence touching him without touching him, the heat of her excitement reaching out to him.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she said softly, eyes alight. \u201cLet\u2019s see. Hot, steamy, passionate, wet, sweaty sex? Energetic, explosive...sensual, vital, vibrant, amazing, incredible... The kind that makes you forget everything else in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. Still, he didn\u2019t touch her. Not yet. Then he asked, \u201cDid you want that once\u2014or twice? If you\u2019d like it twice, I\u2019ll do my very best to oblige.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething tells me you\u2019re up for the job\u2014and that you\u2019ll be pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust pretty good?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPossibly excellent. This is all still theory, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheories need to be tested,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way to prove them.\u201d He didn\u2019t know which one of them moved first. She eased up on her toes; he crushed her into his arms. He found her mouth and kissed her, trembling in his effort to control the force of everything he wanted. She returned the kiss and it was passionate...and hot, wet, steamy. His hands were on her and the robe seemed to slide from her skin in slow motion. She was naked beneath; maybe she\u2019d been dreaming of him, of this, before she felt the urge for tea. Maybe she\u2019d even hoped he\u2019d come down.</p><p>Maybe didn\u2019t matter. They were together. Everything in the kitchen\u2014pots, pans appliances\u2014seemed to evaporate. He slid down the length of her body where they stood, his kisses covering her flesh, his fingers sweeping along it. Desire stoked energy, and each time his lips touched a new inch of her, it seemed as though something gripped him and shook him and wouldn\u2019t let him go. He felt her hands on his shoulders, heard her sweet urgent whispers and sought her with ever greater intimacy. She trembled, crying out at last, as she slipped into his arms. Their mouths met in another kiss and he lifted her up, seating her on the counter. She was breathless and beautiful, lips parted softly, eyes intense with sensuality.</p><p>He moved against her, thinking about his boxers, but somehow he\u2019d lost them; he couldn\u2019t recall when. Something on the counter crashed to the floor. Neither of them paid any heed. They just began to move, clinging to each other.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted her. He denied himself, and now...</p><p>The excitement, the urgency, was almost unbearable. His muscles ached and trembled, and everything in him\u2014muscle, flesh, blood\u2014felt the building explosion.</p><p>It was inevitable; the moment of climax came and seemed to roar through him with the shattering force of a windstorm. He\u2019d tried to hold out...and yet he felt her fall against him, heard the lyrical tone of her cry as she held him tight, shaking, all but melded to him.</p><p>And there they were, on the counter in her kitchen. Tremors continued to rack his body so that he almost feared he wouldn\u2019t be able to stand.</p><p>He smoothed back her damp hair, feeling awkward because, as he\u2019d feared, somehow it wasn\u2019t just sex, although it had been incredible sex.</p><p>\u201cI think we nailed the sweaty,\u201d he told her, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>He felt her smile before she pulled away to look up at him. Her arms locked around his neck as she leaned her head back.</p><p>\u201cPretty good on the passionate, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd vital, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Her smile deepened.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to give our theory a second go-round?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like checking and rechecking the facts,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cAlways important,\u201d he said.</p><p>She slid off the counter and into his arms. He ducked down to retrieve his boxers and her robe. They ran up the stairs.</p><p>Olivia stopped on the landing, and he nearly plowed into her. He looked over her shoulder.</p><p>Sammy had raised his head again. Once more, he wagged his tail\u2014and promptly went back to sleep.</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d he said. \u201cI wonder where I\u2019d be if the dog didn\u2019t approve.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, caught his hand and led him into her darkened room. The moon was almost full and its opaque glow seemed to shine like a strange and magical blessing.</p><p>He fell into bed beside her and felt her hands moving over him, felt the unrestrained passion of her kisses.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to try this again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but...I think the earth moved,\u201d she said solemnly. She rose up on her elbows. Her hair cascaded around her face. He marveled again at her stunning beauty, and he marveled that they were together.</p><p>He lay with his hands laced behind his head. He smiled. \u201cReally? The earth moved?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWho knows? They might\u2019ve been digging in a nearby mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there nearby mines anymore?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOh. Maybe not. So the earth moved, and...\u201d</p><p>He supported himself on one elbow, facing her. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it was even better than that,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot the world,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He pulled her back into his arms. The moon shined on.</p><p>They might forget the world when they were together like this, but reality always came back soon enough.</p><p>As if sensing his thoughts she sighed softly. \u201cNothing compares to a night like this.\u201d She smiled. \u201cOur theory was a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheories should always be thoroughly proven,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAre you interested in some more fact-checking?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were absolutely hypnotic and dazzling in the moonlight. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to oblige,\u201d she said.</p><p>And she did.</p><p>14</p><p>When morning arrived, Olivia was glad they\u2019d enjoyed such an incredible night. And glad that they\u2019d slept in each other\u2019s arms.</p><p>In the morning, Dustin explained that he\u2019d talked to Ellie over at Willis House and that she\u2019d said Coot wanted him to show up for breakfast.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d she told Dustin. \u201cThe caf\u00e9 has a great Sunday brunch. But I wasn\u2019t aware you\u2019d gotten to know old Coot so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I know him that well,\u201d Dustin responded. \u201cBut I\u2019ve spent some time talking to him and he seems like a savvy guy. He watches the people around him. He appears to be an elderly gentleman simply enjoying the beauty of the countryside as his later years slip by. People wouldn\u2019t expect him to be as observant as he really is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019ll meet Coot for breakfast,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>Before they left, they let Sammy run around the yard for a while, and Olivia lavished some affection on the dog.</p><p>Delilah called out a greeting to them as they entered the caf\u00e9 and indicated that Coot was sitting in a booth toward the rear. They waved to her and slid into the booth with Coot.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he told them. \u201cI\u2019m just enjoying a \u2018Liv\u2019 here. Mighty good coffee. And I\u2019m glad to see you two young people looking so healthy. That was something, what I heard about yesterday morning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar too much excitement for a camping trip,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>Coot shook his head.</p><p>\u201cCould\u2019ve been much worse.\u201d Delilah served some tourists at the counter, then came bustling around to see them. \u201cWhy, honey, I am so proud of you!\u201d she said to Dustin. \u201cWhat you did was amazing.\u201d</p><p>As he lowered his head, Olivia realized that she was loving more and more about the man; he was uncomfortable when people put him on a pedestal. He glanced at her and a little smile came to his lips. \u201cI think we decided that the \u2018amazing\u2019 actually went to you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She blushed, hoping the others hadn\u2019t heard. Dustin looked up at Delilah. \u201cHonestly, it was nothing more than simple first aid, but thank you, Delilah. I\u2019d love to have a \u2018Liv\u2019 this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d also love your Sunday-morning hash and\u2014oh, Dustin! If you haven\u2019t had them yet, you have to try the cheese grits. They\u2019re the best in the South, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, two \u2018Livs,\u2019 two orders of corned beef hash and two orders of cheese grits,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the biscuits,\u201d Coot added.</p><p>When Delilah was gone, Dustin turned to Coot and asked softly, \u201cYou know something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t rightly say I know anything,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I just figured, what with everything that\u2019s going on, any small thing might be important.\u201d</p><p>Dustin nodded. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Coot glanced at Olivia. \u201cA bunch of those boys from Parsonage House were in here last night, with one of their monitors. I was sitting at a booth reading the paper.\u201d He shook his head sadly. \u201cAaron is great with those boys but I guess everyone over at the Horse Farm is kind of on the \u2018watch and wait\u2019 list.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia cringed and stared down at the table. \u201cThe monitor was reading a book, not paying much mind to the boys. They were talking about the camping trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they said something,\u201d Dustin said, gently urging Coot to go on.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they were trying to reconstruct things for themselves,\u201d Coot told them.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did they talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was where when. Seems Joey saw you go flying out of the tent when everyone heard the scream. He scrambled out himself. He saw Olivia\u2014and she grabbed Drew and they ran off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much what happened,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cThey went on to talk about it, and they said there was one person they didn\u2019t notice until Dustin asked about Aaron. She must\u2019ve been gone for a while, \u2019cause she came back to the group late,\u201d Coot said.</p><p>\u201cSandra?\u201d Olivia asked.</p> <p>Coot looked at her. \u201cYeah. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was the only other \u2018she\u2019 there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t see her crawl out of the tent?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cThey might have\u2014they\u2019re not sure. But they\u2019re certain they didn\u2019t see her the whole time. They all mulled it over for a while, but then, of course, they started saying they couldn\u2019t be positive, so they\u2019d best not say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Coot.\u201d They all fell silent as Delilah came over with their food.</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d she said, setting down the plates, which were garnished with melon and apple slices. \u201cNow you two eat up. I\u2019m glad you ordered big. This isn\u2019t a morning to be snacking on nothing but tomato juice and a few wedges of fruit. The body needs nourishment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt looks wonderful, and we\u2019re going to enjoy every fattening bite of it,\u201d Olivia assured her.</p><p>\u201cYou burn energy like a bird in flight, Liv,\u201d Delilah said. \u201cSpeaking of juice\u2014want some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, juice sounds great,\u201d Olivia replied. \u201cThat will make it a bit healthier, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I told Sandra Cheever last night. She said she\u2019d been sitting at the hospital for hours and was going back\u2014but that she had to have something besides hospital food.\u201d</p><p>Coot frowned. \u201cSandra was here last night? I didn\u2019t see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she came in before you and the boys.\u201d Delilah made a dismissive gesture. \u201cFirst she says she has to have some good food\u2014then she turns her nose up at my menu, saying I didn\u2019t have healthy choices. Why, I told her to have some juice and a salad and she said I needed fat-free dressings!\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, the door to the caf\u00e9 opened again.</p><p>Frank Vine came in. He nodded to the tourists at the counter and walked back to join them in the booth.</p> <p>\u201cStrong coffee, Delilah, please,\u201d Frank said as he slid in next to Coot. \u201cMorning, everyone.\u201d</p><p>They all greeted him, and Delilah asked, \u201cThat\u2019s it, Frank, just coffee?\u201d</p><p>Frank nodded. When she\u2019d left, Frank looked at all of them.</p><p>He inhaled loudly and rubbed a hand over his eyes. \u201cAaron Bentley is dead,\u201d he told them.</p><p>Accident. Like hell.</p><p>Dustin stood in Aaron Bentley\u2019s bathroom, studying the scene.</p><p>Aaron had insisted he get out of the hospital that morning, and he\u2019d been deemed well enough to go home. No problem; a cop had stayed outside his house.</p><p>Then, according to the police officer who\u2019d been watching the house, there was a loud hissing sound and the house seemed to glow and then went dark.</p><p>He\u2019d rushed in. Aaron had been alone in the bathtub, dead. Somehow, he hadn\u2019t had the sense not to place his iPod charger on the back of the commode\u2014next to the tub. It was ridiculous. He\u2019d been saved from drowning only to die in his bathtub\u2014electrocuted.</p><p>Dustin still couldn\u2019t believe the man had died so stupidly. Or that such a death could have been an accident. According to the crime scene tech who\u2019d first escorted him through, Aaron Bentley must have reached for the iPod to change it\u2014but knocked the whole system into the tub. It had been plugged in. Electricity had raced through the water like wildfire.</p><p>There was nothing in the bathroom to suggest that anyone else had been with him. Dustin\u2019s first question, of course, had to do with Sandra Cheever. She\u2019d been so determined that she was going to stay with Aaron. Where the hell had she been?</p><p>According to Sandra\u2014and there were witnesses to verify that it was true\u2014she\u2019d dropped Aaron at home and gone, at his suggestion, to check on things at the Horse Farm. She\u2019d promised to be right back. But by the time she\u2019d returned, the officer on duty had already flown into the house\u2014breaking the lock to get in.</p><p>So, the house had been locked, an officer had been on duty, Sandra had been at the Horse Farm\u2014and Aaron had managed to kill himself in his bathtub.</p><p>He remained in the tub.</p><p>Frank Vine had come to the diner to make the announcement regarding Aaron\u2019s death, then bring Dustin back with him to Aaron\u2019s house.</p><p>Dustin hadn\u2019t left Olivia behind. But he hadn\u2019t brought her in here, either. She and Callahan were outside, waiting. There was no reason for her to see a man she worked with and cared about as he was now, naked and scorched, his eyes still open as if they were about to pop out of his skull, an expression of horror on his face. The smell of singed flesh hung all around them like a musky haze.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say to this?\u201d Frank asked him.</p><p>\u201cI say he didn\u2019t reach for anything\u2014that someone was here and tossed that charger into the water and electrocuted him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no indication that anyone was in here with him,\u201d Frank said.</p><p>\u201cSo I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring Sandra in for questioning. And, of course, the medical examiner may find something we\u2019re not seeing. Then again, he may not. Why the hell did the idiot have to take a bath?\u201d Dustin muttered. \u201cHe made it so damned easy for whoever was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just got out of the hospital. After a camping trip. He was probably trying to relax\u2014hell, why not?\u201d Frank said disgustedly. \u201cThere was a sheriff\u2019s car right in front of his house. He must have felt safe and secure.\u201d</p><p>Dustin turned around and stalked out of the bathroom. The sheriff\u2019s department, crime scene people and medical personnel were all still at work. He paused in various rooms of the house, looking around, trying to stay out of everyone\u2019s way. He noticed that the medical examiner was Dr. Wilson.</p><p>Wilson walked straight over to him. He seemed to be glancing around to see if Frank Vine was anywhere near them and satisfied himself that he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHorrible business, this,\u201d he said. He lowered his voice. \u201cI have results for you. That dart you brought me. There was a concoction of drugs\u2014some had seeped into the bark. It was a cocktail of stuff, the kind that wouldn\u2019t be found in an autopsy unless specific tests were ordered. The kind that would do a swift number\u2014a real doozy on someone\u2014and then fade quickly away.\u201d He stopped speaking. Dustin turned to see that Frank had come out of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Robbie,\u201d he told Dr. Wilson. \u201cYou\u2019re not conspiring against me. Agent Blake is working this case with my permission and he\u2019s called in a few coworkers, I believe?\u201d</p><p>Wilson\u2014apparently \u201cRobbie\u201d to Frank Vine\u2014let out a sigh of relief. \u201cFrank, I haven\u2019t seen anything like this in all my years out here. Best to accept any and all help, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to remove your corpse,\u201d Frank suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get the body now,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAt least we know the time of death,\u201d Frank pointed out. \u201cThe deputy made a note of it. Not to mention that all the clocks stopped at 10:23 a.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Aaron down to the morgue and get right on this.\u201d Wilson shook his head wearily. \u201cHell, twice. Men I liked, men I admired. This is a sad day for all of us.\u201d</p><p>As he returned to the bathroom. Dustin looked at Frank Vine. \u201cI still say you bring Sandra in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were witnesses who saw her when this happened,\u201d Frank argued. \u201cShe was nowhere near the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still might know something. See if Aaron was talking about having anyone over, or if he said anything to her about what he planned to do,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to shake this up, Frank. There could be other victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou coming down to the station?\u201d Frank asked him.</p><p>Dustin nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Olivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting her out of my sight,\u201d Dustin replied.</p><p>Vine didn\u2019t protest; he just nodded. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll have her brought in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave your men checked whether there\u2019s any sign of forced entry?\u201d Dustin asked. \u201cWindows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a back door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Dustin walked toward it. He used a paper towel he grabbed from the kitchen to check it. There was no bolt, only a push lock, the kind you could depress as you were leaving and the door would lock behind you.</p><p>\u201cSomeone could have left this way,\u201d Dustin told Frank, who\u2019d come with him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they could have left this way, but how would they have gotten in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Sandra. An officer followed them from the hospital. She let him off, waved to the deputy watching the house and drove away before Aaron even went inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean someone else wasn\u2019t already in the house,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>Disposing of the paper towel, Dustin walked outside. Olivia was leaning against the car; Deputy Jimmy Callahan stood next to her, arms crossed over his chest, looking vigilant. When he saw Dustin, he nodded and walked into the house to talk to Frank.</p><p>Olivia gazed mutely at Dustin, her eyes beseeching him to tell her it wasn\u2019t true. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She knew it was.</p><p>She didn\u2019t cry. Her face, though, was pinched and tight. She was in shock, he thought. Two men she\u2019d worked closely with, two men she saw almost every day, were dead. He wanted to tell her to cry, that it was all right.</p><p>But she spoke before he could.</p> <p>\u201cHave they informed the others yet?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think someone from the sheriff\u2019s department was calling\u2014trying to reach the Horse Farm to let Sydney and Drew know what happened. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll try to contact Mason and Mariah, too. They\u2019re going to pick up Sandra now.\u201d He indicated a news van down the street, held back by an officer in uniform. \u201cThe media have picked up on it. The police always try to make the first notification.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s dreadful to hear that something horrible has happened to someone you know via the TV or radio or\u2014 They\u2019re going to pick up Sandra? Why? Sandra wasn\u2019t even with Aaron when he...died....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have to rattle some cages. They\u2019ll start interviewing everyone now, wanting to know where they were every second.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like to go to the Horse Farm. I just want... I want to tell Sydney and Drew that we\u2019ll do everything in our power.... That we\u2019ll hang in there.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cDustin, if someone wanted the Horse Farm\u2014I\u2019m the next person in line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cSo people can\u2019t be dying for the Horse Farm\u2014I mean, there is no Horse Farm if we don\u2019t have any clients. Any guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Dustin looked straight ahead as he drove, hardly able to bear her stoicism, her emotional restraint. He knew she had to be suffering and understood that she wasn\u2019t ready to express her grief.</p><p>When they reached the Horse Farm, Olivia sighed audibly.</p><p>Drew and Sydney had dragged a couple of feed crates out front. They sat on them\u2014both cradling shotguns as they squinted down the road.</p><p>Olivia hopped out of the car and approached them. \u201cWhat the hell are you two doing?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cYou heard, right?\u201d Sydney asked her thickly. \u201cAaron\u2014he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the bathtub,\u201d Drew said. \u201cElectrocuted. They\u2019re saying it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccident?\u201d Sydney snorted. \u201cAccident, my ass. We should\u2019ve been listening to you a lot earlier, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved the poor bastard\u2019s life,\u201d Drew said, shaking his head at Dustin. \u201cAnd then he goes and takes a bath!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knew bathing could be lethal?\u201d Sydney said dully.</p><p>Olivia set a hand on his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re all so sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss him so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen now?\u201d Sydney asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll\u2014we\u2019ll just go on. Somehow, we\u2019ll go on. I\u2019m going to get out a press release saying that we\u2019re closed\u2014in mourning. We\u2019ll reopen in a few weeks,\u201d Olivia said.</p> <p>\u201cHorses have to eat,\u201d Drew mumbled. \u201cI can manage, though. And if you need financial help...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She gave him a shaky smile. \u201cBut I think our operating sheets are pretty good. We can maintain the place for a few months without digging into anyone\u2019s personal funds and if it comes to that\u2014well, we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d Olivia cleared her throat. \u201cI don\u2019t think the two of you need to sit here with shotguns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We just need to stay out of bathtubs,\u201d Drew said.</p><p>\u201cAnd out of the woods,\u201d Sydney added.</p><p>\u201cDuck flying needles,\u201d Drew muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnd darts,\u201d Sydney agreed.</p><p>\u201cI have people coming in this afternoon,\u201d Dustin told him. \u201cWe\u2019ll get someone to stay here at the Horse Farm. I don\u2019t think either of you is a target, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe someone wanted to kill Marcus to get this place, except that doesn\u2019t make sense because of all the trusts and the nonprofit and...\u201d Sydney\u2019s voice trailed off. He shook his head and began again. \u201cIf there had been someone who wanted Marcus dead, logically it would\u2019ve been Aaron. But now Aaron\u2019s dead, and next in line is Olivia...and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Liv a target now?\u201d Drew asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But you don\u2019t need to worry unduly. Some people will believe that what happened to Aaron was an accident. He was alone in his house\u2014there was a deputy stationed outside it,\u201d Dustin explained.</p><p>\u201cWe had to go through this twice\u2014thinking he died,\u201d Drew said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t fair.\u201d He glanced at Dustin with a look of resignation on his face. \u201cHe\u2019s really dead this time, huh?\u201d</p><p>Dustin thought about Aaron\u2019s corpse in the bathtub. \u201cHe\u2019s really dead,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re safe enough. You can go into your apartments. Just be aware of whoever\u2019s around. You have plenty of dogs here to bark if any cars drive in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Sydney told Drew. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all the dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll still keep the rifles handy,\u201d Drew insisted.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t shoot each other, okay?\u201d Olivia said, trying to smile.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll solve this thing. Really,\u201d Dustin promised.</p><p>Sydney looked at him skeptically. \u201cHow do you solve accidents, Dustin? How do you solve accidents that happen when no one else is around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else was around. And we\u2019ll figure out who. Liv, come on. We\u2019ve got to get to the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two take care,\u201d Olivia told them.</p><p>Andrew nodded. \u201cYep. We\u2019ll take care. And you take care of Olivia, Dustin. Agent Blake. Don\u2019t you let anything happen to her!\u201d he said fiercely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be fine,\u201d Olivia vowed. She let Dustin lead her to the car. He could tell that she was trembling.</p><p>\u201cYou are going to be fine,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He drove to the station. She sat beside him, pale and silent.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She turned to him. \u201cI can\u2019t grasp it! I can\u2019t seem to grasp it. Aaron is really dead. I feel...numb. I should hurt more. A friend and a colleague is dead. I cared about Aaron. I just feel...numb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll cry in time,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing numb right now is probably good. It\u2019s a kind of emotional protection. We still have a ways to go until we get to the end of this case so being numb will help you get through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I do feel anything...I\u2019m angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnger isn\u2019t a bad thing, either.\u201d</p><p>She was silent again until they arrived at the station. A deputy led them down a hall and into an observation area. It abutted an interrogation room with a one-way mirror. While Sandra could only see her own reflection, they could watch her sitting at a table. She looked lost and alone and she\u2019d obviously been crying. For a moment, Dustin wondered if she could be involved in any way. She appeared to be stricken\u2014with grief? Or remorse? She hadn\u2019t been the one to kill Aaron, but did she know who had? Was Sandra\u2019s not being at the house on purpose?</p><p>Frank Vine opened the door and came in to join them. \u201cHell, Dustin, do you really think this woman could\u2019ve had anything to do with Aaron\u2019s death? She really looks like she\u2019s been through the wringer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go in and talk to her, Frank. Ask her if she can imagine why anyone would want to hurt Aaron,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cYou do realize that to anyone else in law enforcement, I\u2019d look like an idiot. An old addict\u2019s dead and a man\u2014who was apparently alone in his house with a cop watching\u2014electrocuted himself in a bathtub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know that someone\u2019s been running around with drugged darts. That\u2019s a fact,\u201d Dustin reminded him. \u201cFrank, come on. First, Aaron pitches forward into a stream and nearly dies in two feet of water. Then he\u2019s electrocuted in a bathtub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man should have stayed dirty,\u201d Frank muttered as he left them in the observation room and went in to sit across from Sandra.</p><p>Jimmy Callahan slipped into the room with Dustin and Olivia. He nodded to both of them. \u201cThink this\u2019ll help?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to try everything,\u201d Dustin told him.</p><p>Then he grew silent and they all watched Sandra as the interrogation began.</p><p>Sandra almost pounced on Frank. \u201cFrank, what am I doing in here? This is one of the worst days of my life! It is the worst day of my life. The man I loved is dead, my work is in the toilet\u2014no, it\u2019s already flushed away. Oh, that doesn\u2019t matter. Aaron is dead! And you have me here, treating me like...like some kind of suspect. I need to lie down. I need to be sedated. I want to sleep. I want to forget everything that\u2019s happened. I want to dream that it hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra, we believe you may be able to help us,\u201d Frank said.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Sandra dragged her fingers through her hair. \u201cFrank, I wasn\u2019t there. I should\u2019ve been there. But it might not have made any difference,\u201d she added in a low voice, \u201cbecause I might not have been in the bathroom with him when he did whatever he did. And then you would really have suspected me. I loved Aaron. Oh, the others cared about him, too. We\u2019re a family. We all care about one another. But I loved him. We were going to officially announce that we were seeing each other. We were going to get married, Frank. I was going to be his wife!\u201d</p><p>Sandra broke down in tears, sobbing hysterically. Frank pushed a box of tissues across the table to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sandra. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. But if you loved him, you\u2019ll want to help us.\u201d</p><p>Sandra nodded, took a tissue and mopped her face. \u201cHow can I help in any way? I don\u2019t know what happened!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was Aaron so determined to leave the hospital so quickly?\u201d</p><p>Sandra waved a hand in the air. \u201cBecause he was being Aaron! He\u2019d recovered from his near-drowning, and there was no reason for him to be in the hospital. He didn\u2019t even have a headache, he told me. He was fine and he wanted to go home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSandra, did you let anyone know when Aaron was going home?\u201d Frank asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. No. Well, kind of,\u201d Sandra said.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI called the Horse Farm to tell everyone that he was doing well and getting ready to check out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did you talk to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left a message,\u201d Sandra replied. \u201cNo one answered, but I know our group. They wouldn\u2019t have been able to stay away from the farm. Our therapists would\u2019ve gone out to check on Sydney and Drew...who might well have gone into the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Sandra. The morning you were all camping, where were you when Mariah screamed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Mariah screamed...\u201d Sandra repeated dully.</p> <p>Frank leaned forward. \u201cSandra, listen. First Aaron falls into the stream and nearly dies. Then he does die at home in the bathtub? Supposedly alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it! Stop it, Frank! I didn\u2019t kill him. I. Wasn\u2019t. There!\u201d she said, enunciating clearly.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question. Where were you when Mariah screamed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my tent!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd right after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside the tent\u2014running around like an idiot. Watching the boys. Olivia grabbed Drew and went racing toward the sound.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou loved Aaron, but you didn\u2019t notice he wasn\u2019t at the campsite with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank. We were asleep. Suddenly, there\u2019s this high-pitched scream. We jumped up. Aaron could have been peeing, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Sandra,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a deputy take you home. I just have one more question. If you called the Horse Farm and left a message, why did you drop Aaron off and then go there?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cAaron wanted me to. He asked if I\u2019d reached anyone. I told him no, that I\u2019d gotten voice mail. He asked if I\u2019d go check in on Drew and Sydney, tell them he was feeling just fine and that he planned to be in the next morning. I was supposed to say we\u2019d have a powwow so we could work on saving the Horse Farm. Not much hope of that now, huh?\u201d she asked, and started to weep again.</p><p>When Frank rose, he placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. \u201cSomeone\u2019s going to take you home right now. Or would you prefer to go to the hospital? They can fix you up with something that\u2019ll help you sleep.\u201d</p><p>Sandra sniffled. \u201cHome,\u201d she said. She looked tearfully at Frank. \u201cYeah, I know. I run the Horse Farm. Where we work with substance abusers. But I have a stash of sedatives at home for when I need them. I...occasionally have problems sleeping. Don\u2019t worry. I never abuse them. I know better than that.\u201d</p><p>Frank nodded. \u201cFine. Shall we go?\u201d</p><p>As Frank rose to open the door for Sandra, Dustin felt his phone vibrate. He reached for it.</p> <p>Both Olivia and Jimmy Callahan watched him.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured. He glanced down at his phone and immediately saw a text message from Malachi.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your cousin,\u201d he told Olivia. \u201cI\u2019m going to have him and the others meet us at your house.\u201d</p><p>She nodded in agreement.</p><p>Callahan stepped aside as Frank came in. \u201cOkay, I questioned her like you wanted, but I\u2019m not sure where that got us. Unless it\u2019s a massive conspiracy and both Sydney and Drew are in on it, Sandra can\u2019t have had anything to do with this. What she says is true. She dropped Aaron off and drove to the Horse Farm. He died before she ever got back to the house.\u201d He exhaled with frustration. \u201cSo. I questioned a grieving woman in tears. To what end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet, Frank. It might have proven that she had an accomplice,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cSomeone could have been in that house\u2014waiting for Aaron. Someone who knew when to be there, because Sandra had told that person when he was leaving the hospital and heading home. And she did make sure that both Drew and Sydney saw her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to come up with a hell of a lot more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dustin assured him. \u201cCan you make sure Dr. Wilson calls me when he\u2019s doing the autopsy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be on it this afternoon. I talked to him about thirty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll go over to the morgue in about an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should catch him right in the middle of it,\u201d Frank said. \u201cHe only had one other body\u2014an old-timer who keeled over eating his oatmeal. He\u2019ll be getting on to this one pretty fast.\u201d</p><p>Frank turned to Olivia. \u201cDid you see Sandra when you got up yesterday morning at the campsite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI practically collided with her when I burst out of the tent at the sound of the scream,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cDid you see her?\u201d Frank asked Dustin.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019d been up during the night,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cI woke up and found Aaron on his way to the women\u2019s tent. He was worried because he didn\u2019t see Mariah\u2014who\u2019d gone to the stream for water. When Mariah came back, half the campers were awake and Sandra was annoyed. She just wanted to get back to sleep. I stayed out by the campfire for a while, waiting to see if anyone got up again. I went back into my tent, and I heard Aaron stirring, but then Mariah screamed and I went chasing after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra was outside when I came out of the tent,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cBut Dustin didn\u2019t see her when he ran ahead, a few minutes before I stepped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she could have come out of the tent just before you did?\u201d Frank asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible, yes,\u201d Olivia agreed.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt, but we\u2019ve got to get moving,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cI do want to be there for that autopsy, and we\u2019ve got friends coming to Olivia\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make sure I get to know your friends, right?\u201d Frank\u2019s question wasn\u2019t really a question.</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Dustin promised.</p><p>Frank nodded. \u201cStay in close contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>Jimmy Callahan opened the door for them, tipping his hat. \u201cLiv, take care of yourself,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>As they left the station and drove to Olivia\u2019s house, Dustin noted that she still looked shell-shocked. He wished he could do something to ease the pain and confusion she must be feeling\u2014and he knew it was only going to get worse once she got over the sense of numbness. It protected her, to some extent, from the full reality of her losses. Still, her whole world had to be reeling.</p><p>When they pulled into the yard, she let out a yelp of joy, leaping out of the car before he\u2019d turned off the motor.</p><p>Malachi Gordon stood on the porch. He was with the very tall cowboy agent Dustin had met at the office, Sloan Trent, and two women. He quickly realized that the women were Jane Everett and Abby Anderson. He hadn\u2019t had a chance to meet all his fellow Krewe unit members before he\u2019d gone to Tennessee, but he\u2019d studied some of the information on them. Jane Everett was an artist who had frequently worked with the Texas police before joining the Texas Krewe. Sloan Trent had joined after working with Jane on a situation in Lily, Arizona. Abby Anderson and Malachi were a couple; they\u2019d met when Jackson Crow brought Malachi in on serial killings that had occurred in Savannah.</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t bothering with formality at the moment. She ran over and was lifted into her cousin\u2019s arms to be greeted, hugged and swung around. Introductions were made, Olivia telling the others that she\u2019d heard good things about them. She dug in her pocket for her keys, but even as she twisted the lock, they heard something behind the door, which appeared to move as if someone was trying to open it from within.</p><p>Inside the house, Sammy began to bark excitedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d Dustin murmured, pushing her aside. The Krewe members instantly went into alert mode, drawing their weapons. Malachi pulled Olivia against the wall as Dustin drew his own weapon and threw open the door.</p><p>Sammy nearly knocked him over, jumping up with jubilation. Dustin holstered his weapon and stepped inside, greeting the dog and firmly ordering him down. But as he stepped into the entry, he heard excited words.</p><p>\u201cI did it! I touched the door. I touched the door and it almost moved. I am getting some kind of...some kind of spiritual or ectoplasmic strength!\u201d</p><p>Marcus Danby had finally decided to make himself known once again.</p><p>15</p><p>Olivia understood why Malachi had changed his life\u2014why he\u2019d stopped working for himself to become part of the Krewe.</p><p>She\u2019d known plenty of people who would get excited and swear they\u2019d seen General Rufus Cunningham seated atop his warhorse up on a hill.</p><p>She\u2019d never believed that there were so many people who actually spoke with the dead and that she could sit in her own parlor serving tea to the living while the ghost of Marcus Danby was among them, repeating everything he\u2019d told Olivia and then Dustin. It had been hard, he\u2019d explained to her, to be somewhere. Long conversations wore him out. When he got too tired, he assumed he was in some kind of \u201cghost sleep\u201d because he knew he faded, and he wasn\u2019t sure where he was. It seemed that he needed to rest in order to gain the strength to manifest himself again. He was thrilled that he\u2019d managed to make it look as if there was someone on the other side of the door; he was heartbroken and disturbed to discover that Aaron Bentley had now joined his ranks. He went from deep sorrow to brightness in a whirl of emotions, astounded that he was facing six people who could see and hear him.</p><p>Dustin told the other Krewe members and Marcus everything that happened during the camping trip and what had occurred so far that day. Malachi listened gravely, then asked, \u201cThe deputy sheriff in charge, Frank Vine, he\u2019s really come around? He\u2019s ready to have us here?\u201d</p><p>Dustin nodded. \u201cHe wants to meet you all and he\u2019s asked that we keep him in the loop. And the medical examiner is a great guy. He had the fragments of the dart I found analyzed, so they\u2019re all aware that these deaths aren\u2019t accidents at all. It\u2019s been impossible, of course, to have someone on guard everywhere. The deputy should\u2019ve gone in with Aaron this morning. But despite the information about the dart and the fact that Aaron nearly died, I don\u2019t believe anyone thought the killer could possibly be in his house, ready to finish him off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Malachi looked at Olivia. \u201cSo, you\u2019re in charge of the Horse Farm now. It\u2019s fallen to you.\u201d</p><p>Abby Anderson said, \u201cIt seems that you might be the next target, then. What happens if you\u2019re...unable to run the Horse Farm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe will is complicated,\u201d Olivia said, glancing at Marcus. \u201cMarcus had it go to Aaron and then me. If the Horse Farm fails\u2014even as nonprofit\u2014the land is to be sold off and we\u2019re to see to it that every animal ends up in a good home. And then, we move on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one after you to \u2018inherit\u2019 the leadership position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Marcus interrupted. \u201cI never thought there was anyone who wanted to kill me, much less Aaron! I figured by the time Aaron and Liv were ready to retire, they\u2019d know who should take over next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t be prepared for insanity or evil in those around us,\u201d Sloan Trent said. \u201cYou probably did an excellent job thinking it all out, Marcus. No one could have expected this.\u201d</p><p>Marcus seemed to sigh. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I certainly didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t learned any more about what happened since we saw you?\u201d Olivia asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m dead, not omniscient,\u201d Marcus snapped. \u201cI...just lost all energy. Like I already told you, it\u2019s not easy being dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why the general doesn\u2019t talk to anyone,\u201d Olivia mused. The others, except for Dustin, gave her questioning looks. \u201cAs far as I know, he just watches,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe\u2019s always watching. I think he tries to warn people, tries to stop bad things from happening. Many people have seen him\u2014or claim to have seen him\u2014through the years. But no one\u2019s ever mentioned having a conversation with him.\u201d</p><p>Sloan cleared his throat and sat forward. \u201cYou have to remember that ghosts are the spirits of those who were alive. Some were shy, some were gregarious. Some were graceful or athletic\u2014and some were clumsy as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe speaking thing wasn\u2019t difficult for me, at least when I was talking to Olivia,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cOthers...I don\u2019t know. I was aware of Olivia when she found me and passed out. Then everyone else came over and I tried...I tried to tell Vine and Callahan and the medical examiner what happened. I tried to talk to Aaron and Sydney and Drew. But no one heard me.\u201d</p><p>There was silence for a minute.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Dustin said, \u201cwe know for a fact that someone was using drug-poisoned darts. So we can go into the backgrounds again and see if we can find anything that suggests someone might know about darts. We also need to find out who\u2019d know enough about drugs to mix the right cocktail, in the right quantities. And who would have access to that kind of pharmaceutical. Then, there\u2019s the rendering of the general.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cArtwork,\u201d Jane Everett said. She smiled at Olivia. \u201cMy specialty. I\u2019ll find out. Where\u2019s the cheesecloth art, or whatever it is, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank Vine has it at the station,\u201d Dustin told her. \u201cYou could head over there. Oh, I promised Sydney and Drew that we\u2019d have someone at the Horse Farm. Any volunteers? I want to get to the autopsy and I don\u2019t think Olivia should be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can watch over the Horse Farm while Jane goes to the police station,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cLater, I\u2019d like to ride back to the stream. I keep figuring there\u2019s something we missed somehow. A sign...\u201d</p><p>Olivia assumed he meant an otherworldly sign, a message from the general, perhaps? Not the kind of hard evidence the sheriff would be looking for.</p><p>\u201cThe campsite by the stream,\u201d Malachi murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up here, but my family often came out, so I\u2019ve been to the stream. And the little cemetery in the woods.\u201d</p><p>Dustin nodded. \u201cThen let\u2019s plan a ride for later. But...\u201d He hesitated and looked at Sloan. \u201cI don\u2019t want Sydney and Andrew left alone there,\u201d he said.</p><p>Trent nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t take my eyes off them. Among all of us, we\u2019ll keep up a twenty-four-hour watch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the others\u2014the therapists?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>Olivia already knew, of course, that Abby and Malachi were a couple as well as team members. Malachi had been eager for her to meet Abby before any of this had come up. She\u2019d been just as eager. Malachi had been married to a wonderful woman who\u2019d died. He hadn\u2019t been the same after that. Not until Abby.... She made him want to live again.</p><p>Olivia automatically liked her for that reason.</p><p>They seemed to fit; Abby Anderson was striking, with tremendous blue eyes and pitch-black hair. She managed to look like an agent, smart and savvy and agile. But Malachi had told Olivia that Abby\u2019s heritage included a many-times-great-uncle who\u2019d been a famous\u2014or infamous\u2014pirate known as Blue. Whether that was because of the darkness of his hair or the blueness of his eyes, no one knew. The distinctive coloring had been passed down through the family.</p><p>\u201cMason is supposedly off seeing the Hermitage. He\u2019s never been there for some reason,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what Mariah\u2019s doing. She said she\u2019d go by the Horse Farm today. And we heard Sandra say that she was going home to sedate herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSedate herself,\u201d Dustin repeated. \u201cThat did make me wonder...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s talking about Valium or something like that,\u201d Olivia said quickly.</p><p>\u201cWho at the Horse Farm knows about drugs and sedatives?\u201d Dustin asked. \u201cAll of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all know the rudiments,\u201d Olivia told him. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to tranquilize rescue horses now and then\u2014and once a pit-bull mix that wanted to chow down on Drew when he was trying to help him. We all know what we\u2019re doing. Everyone there knows where we keep the tranquilizer gun and how to use it.\u201d</p><p>Dustin stared at her, frowning. \u201cHow can you know how much it\u2019s loaded with at any given time? Some of your horses are close to a thousand pounds, but a pit bull mix, you\u2019re looking at forty or fifty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always loaded for a seven-hundred-pound horse,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, in the tack room, we have different size...tranquilizer darts.\u201d</p><p>Dustin stood. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to the autopsy. \u201cI can drop Sloan at the Horse Farm first and give him the keys to the rental, and then drop Jane at the station.\u201d He turned to the now-fading ghost of Marcus Danby. \u201cDid you know about the affair, Marcus? Sandra and Aaron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t care. I don\u2019t know why they thought they had to be secretive about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Sandra really did love Aaron?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cAs best I could tell,\u201d Marcus replied, his voice faint. \u201cI never asked either one of them but I could tell from the way they talked to each other, looked at each other...but I figured it was their business. They\u2019d say something when they felt like it. What does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out if she\u2019d conspire with anyone to kill him,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cOr you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try to sort out motives later,\u201d Malachi said briskly. \u201cLet\u2019s meet up at the Horse Farm in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be close to dusk,\u201d Abby pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right. It will be dusk,\u201d Malachi said. He smiled at Olivia and she returned his smile, so glad he was there. \u201cThe general always had a tendency to prefer dusk.\u201d</p><p>Despite the fact that he was at a morgue looking at the electrocuted body of a man he\u2019d known and tried to save, Dustin felt confident that they were finally starting to get somewhere.</p><p>Sloan Trent had been an immediate hit with Sydney and Drew\u2014because he knew horses. He talked about his own, and how the move from Arizona to northern Virginia had been interesting for him and his horses, and they were soon discussing feed, hay, saddles and tack. Sydney and Drew both seemed to forget, for a few minutes at least, that they\u2019d lost two bosses in less than three weeks.</p><p>Jane Everett also did well at the station; she charmed Frank Vine, Jimmy Callahan and the other deputies milling around her. She described how researching the general\u2019s picture\u2014determining who\u2019d created it and how it had ended up in the woods\u2014might help them uncover just what was going on.</p><p>At the morgue, Dr. Wilson had already cut into Aaron Bentley. His assistants were sewing up the body when Dustin arrived, but Dr. Wilson showed him just what electrocution did to the body.</p><p>Blood samples had been sent to the lab and Wilson suspected they\u2019d find trace elements of whatever medication Aaron had been given in the hospital\u2014but nothing else. Too much time had passed. However, it appeared that he\u2019d died because of his own carelessness in knocking the iPod charger into his bathwater.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a closed-door mystery,\u201d Wilson said, frustrated. No way in, no way out.\u201d He shrugged, asking, \u201cDo you think Aaron might\u2019ve just been tired and sloppy? After all, there was no one else in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no one else that we know of,\u201d Dustin reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could help you more\u2014that the body was telling me more,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBut in this case...it really does appear to be accidental.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIf only a corpse could talk...\u201d</p><p>Dustin stared at the corpse, wondering if this one could. At the moment, he saw nothing, felt nothing, to suggest that Aaron Bentley could suddenly speak to him, tell him what happened.</p><p>\u201cNaturally, when I get the lab results, I\u2019ll let you know immediately,\u201d Wilson said.</p><p>Dustin thanked him and drove to the police station to collect Jane. By the time he arrived, she was ready to leave, having taken dozens of photographs and done considerable research on the internet. She summarized what she\u2019d discovered thus far.</p><p>\u201cThe cheesecloth is cheap and available in almost every art store in the United States. The rendering of the general was done in chalk and watercolor\u2014and wouldn\u2019t withstand a rainstorm. The artist was fairly decent, so I\u2019d say you\u2019re looking at the work of an art student, either someone who went to a good school or is still taking classes. That\u2019s what I have so far.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jimmy Callahan said, \u201cwe\u2019re looking for someone with access to the workers at the Horse Farm, someone who knows their hours and their habits. This someone also knows the campsite and the surrounding area. And he or she knows about tranquilizer drug concoctions that don\u2019t show up in blood tests at a customary autopsy. And this person happens to be a fairly decent artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept maybe our killer doesn\u2019t need to be an artist at all, decent or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jane agreed. \u201cThis person\u2014the killer\u2014could have bought the image.\u201d</p> <p>Dustin nodded. \u201cThe murderer knew that Mariah would go snooping if she thought she was about to see the general. Although I don\u2019t think she ever got to see this picture of the general floating in the forest mist. She happened on the pieces of coyote-torn cow first.\u201d</p><p>Frank sat on the edge of his table and shook his head. \u201cHow did this person lure Mariah out\u2014and hit Aaron Bentley with a dart at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could\u2019ve been done,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cThe plans would have had to be laid the night before. And then the killer had to count on luck, as well. But most people know that Mariah is the local historian and ghost-queen. An eerie sound would definitely have caught her attention. Not a rebel yell or anything like that\u2014too loud. A whisper? A distant bugle? Whoever this was came prepared.\u201d</p><p>Frank shook his head again. \u201cYou still think Sandra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the very least, I think she knows something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d Frank asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a group riding\u2014retrace our steps again, see what we can discover,\u201d Dustin told him. \u201cI particularly want to check out the stream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy partner and I will be at the Horse Farm,\u201d Jane told him quickly.</p><p>Frank looked at Jimmy. \u201cGo pay Sandra Cheever a visit. Tell her you\u2019ll be watching over her so that she can get some rest. See if you can stay inside at her place, rather than out in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, you got it.\u201d Tipping his hat to Jane, Jimmy left the room.</p><p>\u201cIs this crazy, or what? Is everyone at that place supposed to die in some kind of presumed accident?\u201d Frank asked.</p> <p>\u201cCould be. What\u2019s still eluding us is the reason,\u201d Dustin muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be watching over Olivia, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA killer would have to get to her over my dead body,\u201d Dustin assured him. \u201cAnd you know that Malachi Gordon\u2014Olivia\u2019s cousin\u2014is here, too.\u201d</p><p>Frank nodded. He walked around to his desk and rummaged in his bottom drawer, then handed Dustin an outdated walkie-talkie. \u201cYou can reach the station with this. Keep me apprised of your movements.\u201d</p><p>Dustin agreed to do that. As they drove back to the Horse Farm, he asked Jane, \u201cThere was nothing else you could get from that image of the general?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve just spent a couple of hours with Frank Vine. We\u2019re working with the facts, sir, just the facts. Like I said, the artist was decent. The rendering seems relatively accurate, judging by some of the Civil War photographs I looked at online. And some of the shading was really nice. This artist probably does have a career in his or her future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019d say a young artist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. Although art is\u2014no pun intended\u2014a sketchy field. It might be an older artist who\u2019s a better technician than he or she is at finding a personal style. That\u2019s my opinion. I work with reconstruction a lot. Or doing sketches from someone\u2019s description. This seems to be along those lines. There must be a portrait of the general like that somewhere. I didn\u2019t come across it in my online research but I\u2019ll keep looking. The artist almost certainly copied the painting\u2014or maybe even a photograph. I asked Frank, but they weren\u2019t able to lift any fingerprints, nor did they find hairs or fibers or anything that might help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, we have to locate the artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to locate the artist,\u201d Jane agreed.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she\u2019d been away for any length of time, but Olivia was glad to be at the Horse Farm. Everything was in good shape, just as it always was. Stalls were clean; horses were well fed and watered. Drew told her that Sydney had even gone on a cleaning binge in the office.</p><p>The two of them knew Malachi from other visits he\u2019d made over the past several years, and they seemed to like Abby Anderson when they met her, as well. While they waited for Jane and Dustin to return, Drew and Sydney took them by the stalls, introducing them to each of the horses, the cats prowling around and the Horse Farm dogs. By the time Jane and Dustin returned, they were ready for their ride. Olivia, of course, would be on Shiloh. Dustin would take Chapparal. Malachi would ride Zeus, the big paint\u2014a horse he\u2019d ridden before\u2014and Abby, who hadn\u2019t been on a horse all that often, would be on the palomino mare, Carina. Carina could move when needed; she was also extremely gentle.</p><p>But while Olivia rummaged around in the cupboards below the coffee machine in the office, gathering supplies, Jane told them about the rendering of the general she\u2019d studied.</p><p>Olivia paused. \u201cYou think it was a copy of another work?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. The general appeared to be posed\u2014as if for a picture,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cI think I might know the painting, then. Of course, I haven\u2019t seen this particular rendering. But there\u2019s a Civil War picture of the general in the county archives. It was actually taken by Matthew Brady\u2014according to local lore. And it\u2019s possible, since the general had been assigned to different fields of battle during the war, although legend has it that Brady did take the picture of him somewhere in Tennessee. Both he and the general were at Chattanooga. I\u2019m sure there are copies of the picture here and there. I only know of one, but it\u2019s in a coffee shop near Vanderbilt University.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s likely any art student might see it?\u201d Jane asked. \u201cAnd copy it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cImitation being the sincerest form of flattery and all that. Plus, kids come out here to camp. A lot of this land is public access and public park. It\u2019s possible that some students recently decided to scare their friends\u2014and left their artwork behind.\u201d</p><p>Dustin had entered the office. \u201cAnd it\u2019s possible someone bought, borrowed or stole it. As you mentioned yourself back at the office,\u201d he said to Jane. \u201cWhile you and Sloan are keeping watch here, can you get on the computer and look up the different universities in the area and the art departments? It\u2019s a long shot, but you might find something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Jane promised.</p><p>\u201cWe ready?\u201d he asked Olivia. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a tent packed, matches, lanterns, all the fixings. Did you find any food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be having hot dogs, canned grits and soup,\u201d she told him. \u201cOh, and some muffins for breakfast. They don\u2019t taste too bad when heated over a fire. And we have lots of coffee and water.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThen we\u2019re good to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to check in with Mariah and Mason before we leave. Is that an okay thing to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very good thing to do,\u201d he said.</p><p>When she reached Mason, she wondered if it had been a mistake. He went on a rampage for what seemed like several minutes, horrified about Aaron, worried about their lives\u2014and then worried about her. She managed to calm him down and ask him, \u201cMason, where are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill at the Hermitage,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d planned to come, and when I heard about Aaron, I almost changed my mind, but I couldn\u2019t stay home. So I\u2019m here. And I\u2019m glad I came. Andrew Jackson was really an interesting guy. Yeah, he was a bastard as far as the Native Americans went, but he could be kind, too. And he loved Rachel\u2014and Rachel was so reviled! But he didn\u2019t give a damn. He loved her. She didn\u2019t live long enough to go to the White House with him, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was definitely an interesting man, Mason,\u201d Olivia broke in. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad you\u2019re out and enjoying the day.\u201d Dustin made a motion indicating that he wanted her phone for a minute. She handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cMason, you should keep on doing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing Nashville. Can you stay in the city tonight?\u201d</p><p>Olivia couldn\u2019t hear Mason\u2019s response, but he must have agreed because Dustin continued with, \u201cGood. Just to be on the safe side. Do something else that includes a lot of people tomorrow. Visit the Country Music Hall of Fame, for instance.\u201d He said goodbye and gave the phone back to Olivia. \u201cMariah?\u201d</p><p>She punched in Mariah\u2019s number. Mariah answered almost immediately. She was upset, as well; she was whispering, but she sounded calmer than Mason. \u201cI\u2019m fine. One of the deputies came in with me to see Sandra. She\u2019s sleeping now, so I\u2019ll hang here for a while. Maybe I\u2019ll just stay, since he\u2019s still here.\u201d</p><p>Olivia lowered her cell and told Dustin what Mariah had said.</p><p>He took the phone from her again. \u201cKeep in touch, Mariah. And when you leave, see if they can send another deputy with you. Just call Frank Vine. He\u2019ll make sure it happens. Callahan\u2019s with you now, right?\u201d</p><p>Mariah had obviously said yes, because Dustin nodded and handed the phone back to Olivia.</p><p>\u201cTake care,\u201d she started to say. But Mariah had already rung off.</p><p>\u201cWe should get moving,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep Sammy at the Horse Farm.\u201d</p><p>It was nearing dusk; one of those beautiful evenings when the moon, although not quite full, rained down a glorious opaque and ivory light.</p><p>Dustin and Olivia led the way as the group set out on horseback. When she neared the ravine where Marcus had died, Olivia glanced over at Dustin and asked, \u201cDo we stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cLet Malachi and Abby take a look around\u2014see who or what appears. If anyone does, of course.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia dismounted and walked the few feet back to Malachi and Abby.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to say anything. \u201cThis is where Marcus died?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>Dustin, down from Chapparal, joined Malachi at the ravine\u2019s edge.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, even at night\u2014and Marcus died during the day\u2014that this ravine is here, that there\u2019s a drop. And,\u201d Malachi said, hunkering down at the edge, \u201cif you did fall in, you\u2019d roll and brace yourself and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Marcus had been knocked out and then shot up with heroin,\u201d Olivia reminded her cousin. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop his fall.\u201d</p><p>Malachi nodded. \u201cSomeone could have died under those circumstances, even if he was trying to save himself, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe general came. He looked down at me when Marcus was in my arms and tapped me on the shoulder at the same time, and...and I passed out,\u201d Olivia said, embarrassed.</p> <p>Dustin was glad that Abby laughed. \u201cTrust me!\u201d she said. \u201cThat kind of surprise would get to the most hardened of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d he concurred. \u201cWe learn that we see and hear what others don\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t be startled as hell. That really never changes. Ghosts. Sometimes they show up when you least expect them\u2014and hide when you\u2019re trying to reach them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the right time,\u201d Abby said quietly. And it was. The moon was rising; the sun had almost fallen below the horizon. The hills, the plains, the landscape\u2014all had that magical quality of twilight.</p><p>They were still for a minute, until Dustin cleared his throat, and the sound roused them from their trance.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the general\u2019s at the cemetery,\u201d Malachi suggested.</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s forge ahead.\u201d</p> <p>They rode on and eventually came to the clearing that led to the small cemetery.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of Mariah\u2019s favorite places,\u201d Olivia told them. \u201cThe stories, of course, that go with the cemetery are tragic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhost stories often are,\u201d Malachi said</p><p>Dustin dismounted, lifting his lantern high. \u201cLiv, do we leave the horses and walk along the trail?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. There are coyotes in the area. We don\u2019t want spooked horses. If we had to walk back, it would be a very long walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, this is your terrain, Liv. I\u2019ll stay with the horses,\u201d Dustin offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve been to the cemetery plenty of times,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cOlivia\u2019s house belonged to our uncle when we were growing up,\u201d he reminded Dustin. \u201cI came out here\u2014\u201d he paused, grinning \u201c\u2014to the frontier often enough. You show Abby.\u201d</p><p>Dustin didn\u2019t argue. Olivia raised her own lantern high and led the way along the trail.</p> <p>They came to the graves, and the old lichen-covered stones were haunting and sad in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised the general has been allowed to rest here\u2014that someone hasn\u2019t decided to dig him up for a memorial,\u201d Abby said. She knelt down by the grave, dusting it off. \u201cIt\u2019s nice here, though. Lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to be a Tennessee thing, respecting his right to this place,\u201d Olivia said, getting down on her knees beside Abby. \u201cThere\u2019s never even been any vandalism out here, nor do we ever find beer cans or any hint of frat kids fooling around. Not here, not in the cemetery.\u201d She glanced up at them. \u201cThere\u2019s an urban legend about the place\u2014that in the 1960s or \u201970s, some kids came out here, but there was a coyote prowling the area and they got scared and started to run. One of the boys got tangled in some vines. He was in a panic and he swore afterward that the general came and helped him. People believe that this cemetery is haunted\u2014by more than coyotes. I guess it\u2019s been tacitly accepted through the generations. The cemetery is maintained by local restoration groups, and no one interferes with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little forlorn,\u201d Abby said. \u201cAnd definitely out of the way.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shrugged. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why the general keeps riding.\u201d</p><p>But the general wasn\u2019t riding.</p><p>He was leaning against a tree, arms crossed over his chest, watching them. Dustin watched him for several minutes without moving or speaking. He didn\u2019t warn the women. At last he spoke, very quietly. \u201cGeneral Cunningham, we could really use your help.\u201d</p><p>Neither Abby nor Olivia started. They looked over at him, where he stood by the trees. Olivia rose, wiping her hands on her jeans. \u201cSir,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you tried to save Marcus. We desperately need your help now.\u201d</p><p>Abby rose slowly to her feet beside Olivia. The general stared back at all of them. He lifted his hand in a dignified greeting.</p><p>But then he disappeared.</p><p>Abby sighed. \u201cI hope it wasn\u2019t me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe just\u2014he just isn\u2019t a talker,\u201d Olivia told her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he will be when he has something to say,\u201d Abby suggested.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get going. We have to pitch a tent for the night and then I want to go over everything that happened when Aaron fell into the stream,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cEvery single thing we can recall....\u201d</p><p>They returned to the horses, and Malachi instinctively seemed to know something had happened.</p><p>\u201cWe saw the general,\u201d Dustin explained.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>Abby shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWell, we know he\u2019s been here\u2014watching,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>They rode on. When they broke into the clearing by the rocky hills, the sheer beauty of the area made them pause in unison. \u201cWe should get the tent pitched,\u201d Malachi said once they\u2019d reached the campsite. \u201cHey, Liv, this has been fixed up nicely over the years. The rocks around the fire pit\u2014great! You can keep embers going at night without worrying that you\u2019ll start a forest fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s windy, of course, we still douse it completely,\u201d Olivia said, dismounting. She untied the saddle pack she had on Shiloh. \u201cWho has the tent supports?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got \u2019em,\u201d Malachi called out.</p><p>They went to work erecting the tent. Soon it was done; Dustin was glad they\u2019d chosen to bring one\u2014it was getting too cold for sleeping bags alone. They\u2019d take turns being on guard duty during the night.</p><p>They gathered firewood and got a blaze going. By then they were all famished and eating became the next order of business. Even the canned food tasted delicious at that point.</p><p>While they ate, Dustin and Olivia relayed everything that had occurred when Aaron had nearly drowned. Malachi and Abby nodded, asked questions and, after they\u2019d finished eating, were shown the routes taken by the different players during the event.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we should act it out. Count the seconds each movement takes, and so on.\u201d Abby yawned. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind if I got to sleep first,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cEveryone go ahead. I\u2019ll take this shift,\u201d Dustin told them.</p><p>Olivia rose with Abby, obviously feeling a little awkward. She turned to face Dustin; he gazed back at her, meeting her eyes.</p><p>It\u2019s up to you, he tried to tell her silently. I\u2019m not afraid of Malachi. He\u2019s sleeping with his partner\u2014well, beside her, anyway. In separate sleeping bags.... So I think it\u2019s okay if we do the same thing!</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, but joined Abby and they entered the tent.</p><p>Malachi studied him across the fire. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate my cousin\u2019s strength,\u201d he finally said. \u201cShe may not carry a weapon, but she\u2019s a powerful personality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never doubted that for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s beautiful. She might be my cousin, but she\u2019s still one of the most beautiful people I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. I... Well. Hell. I care about her. A lot.\u201d</p><p>Malachi said nothing further, but he grinned. Maybe that was what he\u2019d wanted to hear. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>He got up and went into the tent. Dustin shifted, wrapping his arms around his chest. It was chilly. He didn\u2019t want a blanket, though; he wanted to stay awake.</p><p>The flames grew small. The embers barely burned anymore. There was still light above him from the moon, and in the distance, a coyote howled. A branch snapped on the fire.</p><p>He stared out into the dark woods, but saw nothing.</p><p>He could hear the trickle of the nearby stream.</p><p>And then, walking toward him out of the trees, came the general.</p><p>General Rufus Cunningham.</p><p>He stopped across the fire from Dustin, then sat down to join him.</p><p>His voice was gruff when he spoke. \u201cI\u2019d help you\u2014God knows I\u2019d help you. But I didn\u2019t see enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I understand,\u201d Dustin told him. \u201cBut, please, tell me whatever you did see. Anything\u2014 anything at all might help.\u201d</p><p>The general sat back, gazing into the darkness.</p><p>And then he began.</p><p>16</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t sure what had awakened her.</p><p>At first she\u2019d thought she\u2019d never sleep, but she\u2019d closed her eyes and drifted off with surprising ease. Maybe it had been a release of tension; so much had happened. Aaron had almost died and been saved\u2014and now he was actually dead. The Horse Farm was falling apart. But two armed agents rested nearby and Dustin was just outside. She felt...safe.</p><p>But just as easily as she\u2019d slept, she awoke.</p><p>She lay there for a minute, trying to ascertain what had wakened her, her heart beginning to beat too fast. Fear set in so quickly these days.</p><p>But then she realized she heard Dustin\u2019s voice and that it was calm and relaxed. She saw movement near her; Malachi had risen and crept to the opening of the tent. Abby was awake, as well, watching Malachi.</p><p>Olivia inched silently toward Malachi. He turned to her in the darkness. She could barely see his features but he whispered, \u201cMove slowly.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Malachi eased himself out of the tent. She saw that he stood motionless for a few seconds and then moved toward the rock-circled fire, where the embers still burned with a soft glow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia glanced back at Abby, who rose carefully and together they stepped out of the tent. Malachi had just taken a seat near the fire by Dustin.</p><p>Across from them sat the general. He was in his cavalry uniform and appeared as he surely had in life. Olivia felt as if she\u2019d stumbled upon a campfire meeting after a reenactment.</p><p>She hesitated, and then moved very slowly, coming around the fire to sit cross-legged on Dustin\u2019s other side, facing the general as the men were doing. A second later, Abby joined her. The general nodded to them each in turn. When he spoke, his voice seemed raspy, like a wind on leaves, and she thought again that he didn\u2019t speak often, that he saw his role in the afterlife as something that didn\u2019t require words.</p> <p>\u201cThe dog cried out and I hurried to the sound,\u201d the general said. \u201cA fine dog, a loyal animal. When I reached him, he was trapped. There was a large rock at his side. It must have been thrown at him and shoved him into a tangle of brush. It was all I could do to ease the tangle so he might run on. When I emerged from the trees, I saw someone wearing clothing in earth colors, greens and browns. In one of those short coats that covers the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hoodie,\u201d Dustin mused. \u201cBut you couldn\u2019t see a face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I first went down to the ravine where Marcus Danby lay. But to my great sorrow, the man was no longer living. Danby was a fine man. We spoke sometimes.\u201d The general was silent, reflective, for a moment. \u201cAnd so I rose from the ravine and mounted Loki, and I went after that person. But as I rode, many people were out riding. I did not recognize anyone\u2014and no one appeared in the clothing I had seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Dustin said politely, but Olivia could hear disappointment in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d suspected that Sammy, the dog, had been hit from a distance, which you\u2019ve confirmed. If he knew who\u2019d harmed him, he\u2019d growl at that person. Thank you,\u201d Dustin said again. \u201cSammy is a good dog, and we\u2019re grateful he\u2019s alive.\u201d</p> <p>The general nodded gravely, but a slight smile curved his lip.</p><p>\u201cI did see a horse,\u201d he told them. \u201cWhen the hooded figure disappeared, I saw that he ran to a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich horse?\u201d Olivia asked. \u201cWhat did it look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA large animal. One of the largest horses in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGargantua!\u201d Olivia whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat would be a fitting name,\u201d the general said.</p> <p>Dustin turned to her; she could feel his tension. \u201cWho was riding Gargantua that day?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Olivia let out a breath. \u201cAaron. Aaron Bentley,\u201d she said in a shaky voice.</p><p>Dustin frowned and looked back at the general. \u201cSir, were you in this area when we were camping? The night before last?\u201d</p><p>The general nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid...did you try to talk to one of the young women with us? Mariah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seldom try to speak,\u201d the general said. \u201cNo, I did not try to speak with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see anything that night\u2014or early morning, as it was?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cI watched over the camp. I saw the man walk to the stream. I followed him at first. I saw him slap at his neck, as if he had been stung by a bee. Then he fell. There was nothing I could do.\u201d He raised his arms. \u201cI have little strength. By will, if something...if something is light enough, perhaps my will can make it move. But he was a big man. I could not lift his face from the water.\u201d</p> <p>His sorrow was evident.</p><p>\u201cDid you see anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard the scream and I followed. I saw you race into the woods. I wanted to try to bring you to the water, but you were gone before I could show myself to urge you toward the stream,\u201d the general said. He shook his head sadly. \u201cI wish I could help more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have helped incredibly,\u201d Dustin told him. \u201cWe are grateful, sir.\u201d</p><p>The general nodded and stood. \u201cThe truth must be discovered. Such a man as Marcus Danby must not be falsely remembered for living a lie. He salvaged his soul and his life and gave life to others, in quality and in years.\u201d</p><p>Dustin got to his feet; Olivia, Malachi and Abby quickly followed suit.</p><p>\u201cWe will find the truth,\u201d Dustin vowed.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are fine soldiers. You will carry on. I have spoken too long, but I will remain here. I will not leave, although I grow faint and weak,\u201d he said, pausing to offer them a grim smile. \u201cI am but a ghost of the man I was. Still, I will watch, and I will do what is in my power.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled in return, thankful for his promise\u2014and appreciating his unexpected humor.</p><p>He walked away from the fire, fading as he did. Just as he reached the heart of the forested shadows, Olivia saw his white horse, radiant in the moonlight. She thought she heard a whinny. Then the general mounted Loki, and they disappeared into the darkness as if they\u2019d never been.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, are you sure?\u201d Dustin asked when the general had ridden away.</p><p>She stared at him, disoriented for a minute.</p><p>\u201cAm I sure...about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Aaron Bentley was riding Gargantua that day?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe always rode Gargantua. And when they found me with Marcus, he\u2019d definitely been riding Gargantua.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps there was a switch-up with the horses?\u201d Malachi suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know how or when. When we all rode out from the Horse Farm that day, Aaron was on him. When I came to, Aaron was there, and he got back on Gargantua when we left.\u201d</p><p>Dustin looked at Malachi. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to ask at the Horse Farm. If someone else had taken the horse out first, Drew or Sydney would know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Malachi frowned thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that. But it is possible that Aaron killed Marcus\u2014and someone else killed Aaron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, perhaps someone knew that Aaron had killed Marcus\u2014and then killed Aaron because he killed Marcus?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cThere are a few other possibilities,\u201d Abby pointed out. \u201cLike Dustin said, someone else might have taken the horse.\u201d</p><p>Malachi shook his head. \u201cI doubt it, since Liv seems convinced that Aaron was on Gargantua during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s something else,\u201d Dustin put in. \u201cAaron and someone else might have been working together\u2014in which case his partner could have taken the horse. It could\u2019ve been part of the plan. And then...this partner may have decided Aaron was too much of a risk, that he was going to blow it all somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if someone knew that Aaron had killed Marcus\u2014with or without that person as an accomplice\u2014would he or she have gone to the police?\u201d Olivia asked slowly.</p><p>Malachi draped an arm around her shoulders. \u201cHey, you know better than most how twisted and corrupt people can be, cousin.\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighed. \u201cSo, we\u2019re more or less nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cWe have more clues to follow now. Tomorrow we\u2019ll search this area again. And as soon as we get back, we\u2019ll find out what went on with the horses. And, with Jane\u2019s help, we\u2019ll track down that image of the general Frank found in the trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think we should reenact what happened that morning,\u201d Abby suggested. \u201cTry to understand the timing of what went on better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. But for now, let\u2019s get some sleep,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cYep, my turn to take over,\u201d Malachi announced. He sat back down by the fire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never sleep now,\u201d Olivia muttered.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cCome on. Give it a try.\u201d</p><p>He set his hand on her back, pressing her toward the tent. To her surprise, once she\u2019d climbed into her sleeping bag, with him beside her and Abby just feet away\u2014and Malachi on guard duty by the fire\u2014she did begin to drift off.</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t so serious, it would be amusing. It was the most asexual situation ever despite the fact that they were crammed together in such intimate quarters. And yet she was comfortable because she could feel his warmth.</p><p>The packaged muffins weren\u2019t very good, but they were edible and Dustin had to admit that the coffee they brewed with stream water was excellent. When they\u2019d eaten, Abby did the directing.</p><p>\u201cShe used to play a pirate wench at her grandfather\u2019s tavern,\u201d Malachi told Dustin with a grin.</p><p>Abby pointedly ignored that. \u201cMalachi, you\u2019ll be Aaron. I\u2019ll be Mariah, and Olivia and Dustin, you two will be yourselves. So...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m Aaron. I\u2019ve woken up, stretched and I\u2019m going to the stream.\u201d</p><p>He walked away.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what next?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cI hear the scream\u2014I bolt up and run into the woods,\u201d Dustin answered.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Dustin shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Mariah, so you\u2019re supposed to be in the woods already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019m going. How far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust past the \u2018powder room\u2019 bushes over there, past the first trees, and into the first clearing,\u201d Dustin told her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, wait until I get there and scream.\u201d</p><p>Abby ran ahead. A few seconds later, she screamed. Dustin went flying after her; he heard Olivia coming after him. They met up with Abby in the woods.</p><p>\u201cThat was only about ten seconds,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>Abby nodded. \u201cWhat next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were here with Mariah for maybe two minutes and then we all went back to the site. Drew was with me,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cAll right. We head back now.\u201d Abby led the way. When they returned to the campsite, she asked, \u201cAnd everyone was here then, at the campsite. Everyone except Aaron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone except Aaron,\u201d Dustin confirmed.</p><p>\u201cHow long until you realized he wasn\u2019t here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAlmost immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so now we go to the stream,\u201d Abby directed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This time Dustin ran ahead of the others, just as he had that morning. Malachi, who was waiting by the water, looked at his watch. \u201cThe entire thing took place in under five minutes,\u201d he said.</p><p>Olivia gazed around her and then back at the campsite.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dustin asked.</p> <p>\u201cThis just keeps getting worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it really could have been anyone. Even Mariah,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cAlthough that would never have occurred to me if we hadn\u2019t done our reenactment.... She could\u2019ve been at the stream\u2014and then looped around the campsite to get to the woods. And since we don\u2019t know if anyone else was out before Dustin went racing off, one of the others could\u2019ve gone to the stream and come back.\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019m positive we can rule out the boys, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. There are more of us working on this now,\u201d Malachi told her, slipping an arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s finish searching through the trees again, see if we can find anything else,\u201d Abby said.</p> <p>They returned to the woods; Dustin described what it had looked like where he\u2019d found Mariah. \u201cThe, uh, cow pieces are gone now. I guess the coyotes came back and finished them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Malachi agreed. \u201cLet\u2019s split the area into quadrants, start in the middle and we\u2019ll each work outward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are we searching for?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cAnything that doesn\u2019t belong here,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>They explored in silence for a while, combing through the bushes, trying to identify anything out of place on the forest floor.</p><p>Suddenly Olivia let out a little cry.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dustin asked, hurrying over to her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe nothing, but...\u201d She opened her hand. She was holding something red with a tiny needlelike point. The small object was in the shape of a horse. \u201cThis is one of the tacks we use to put notices up on the office bulletin board,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone might just have had one in a pocket.\u201d</p><p>Dustin shook his head. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t a random find, Olivia. This is where Frank Vine discovered the image of the general. I\u2019d say that means someone\u2014most likely from the Horse Farm\u2014hung it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo lure Mariah out,\u201d Malachi said, approaching them from the other side.</p><p>\u201cSo Mariah is innocent. One down.\u201d Olivia raised a finger as though counting.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d Dustin shook his head again. \u201cWhat if she put it here herself to make us believe her story?\u201d</p><p>Olivia groaned in frustration. \u201cHow will we ever get anywhere?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWell, Sydney was at the Horse Farm, watching over the place, right?\u201d Malachi said. \u201cOr...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr was he?\u201d Olivia finished for him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s something we can prove one way or the other,\u201d Dustin suggested.</p><p>\u201cWe reach the solution by following every direction,\u201d Malachi told her. \u201cIt was a good find, cousin. Now we know it wasn\u2019t just left here by some college kid. That\u2019s important\u2014and it narrows down the possibilities.\u201d They searched a while longer, with no further results, and started back.</p><p>En route, Dustin used his radio to call in; Frank Vine told him the night had been uneventful.</p><p>When they reached the Horse Farm, Drew and Sydney came out, hearing their arrival. Sammy came out, too, barking excitedly. Olivia immediately dismounted and captured the big dog in a hug, sternly ordering him not to jump.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Drew asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cAnything here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet as a tomb all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew, I heard people say that Aaron always rode Gargantua,\u201d Dustin continued. \u201cIs that right? The day Marcus died, was Aaron riding him?\u201d</p><p>Drew raised his eyebrows in evident surprise. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s true. Aaron\u2014when he went riding, which wasn\u2019t that often\u2014always took Gargantua. He\u2019s a big horse but he\u2019s gentle. I once saw him let himself trip rather than step on Aaron when he\u2019d fallen off. He\u2019d gotten on him bareback, which was kind of foolish for Aaron. I wouldn\u2019t call him an incompetent rider, but he wasn\u2019t the best by far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was Gargantua before everyone saddled up to go looking for Marcus Danby that day?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cIn his stall,\u201d Drew said. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>Sydney had been listening, Dustin realized, because he walked up to the two of them. \u201cDrew, no. Remember? We had all the horses out in the pasture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSydney\u2019s right,\u201d Drew said. \u201cI remember now. We had to round them all up to get saddled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it important?\u201d Sydney asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Do you ever worry about the horses when they\u2019re out in the pasture? I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t notice all of them all the time. Have you ever worried about one of them being stolen? Could one be stolen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never had any horses stolen,\u201d Sydney replied. \u201cI guess all the ones we have now are known by people in the area, but we\u2019ve also brought in rescues. Some could be dangerous\u2014unless you knew the horse, knew the problem and the animal\u2019s behavior. Like Shebaan. She was a kicker when we got her. But the first thing we teach anyone who comes here is that you don\u2019t stand in kicking distance behind a horse. Any horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we be worried?\u201d Drew asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Dustin assured them. \u201cI wasn\u2019t suggesting that. But could someone, say, use a horse and put it back in the pasture without anyone noticing?\u201d</p><p>Drew looked at Sydney; Sydney looked back at Drew.</p><p>Then both men looked at Dustin and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat does all this mean? Does it matter?\u201d Drew asked worriedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Maybe,\u201d Dustin said evasively. \u201cThanks, you guys.\u201d He left Chapparal with the men and made his way to the office.</p><p>Sloan was standing behind Jane Everett at the door, waiting for them. \u201cAnything?\u201d Sloan asked as they entered and shut the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cMore confusion,\u201d Olivia said, going straight to the coffeepot, Sammy following her every move.</p><p>\u201cWe spoke with the general,\u201d Olivia said. She poured her coffee and sipped it.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t see a face, but he did see someone running from the ravine when Marcus was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he saw a horse,\u201d Dustin filled in for her.</p><p>\u201cWhich horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGargantua,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cGargantua\u2014the massive horse, I take it?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>Olivia nodded.</p><p>Dustin turned to Olivia. \u201cCould he just have disappeared from a pasture and reappeared? Drew and Sydney didn\u2019t seem certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s possible,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see and do things every day and you don\u2019t really pay much attention to your surroundings. We often keep the horses in the pastures, and we\u2019ve never had to worry about them. Sometimes they hang around the fences. Sometimes they cluster in the corner by the trees. When I get here every morning, at least some of them are usually out in the pasture, unless they\u2019re being brushed for a session or saddled for a ride. They\u2019re always in their stalls at night, but during the day...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHonestly, you\u2019d have to ask me to count them. Otherwise, I\u2019d assume they were all where they\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it is possible someone took him without being seen,\u201d Dustin concluded.</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Olivia said unhappily.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cWe found one of our horse-shaped thumbtacks out in the woods. We\u2019re assuming that means whoever tacked up the image of the general brought it from here\u2014and probably came from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019ve learned the source of the image,\u201d Jane said. She sat on the sofa with her laptop and opened it. \u201cFive weekends ago, there was an art show at the Opryland Mall in Nashville. It was kind of a big deal. They had name bands playing there, as well as a contest for artists to create props for haunted houses.\u201d She turned her computer around. There was the gauze cloth, with the watercolor and chalk image of the general. A young man of perhaps twenty-two was standing next to it; a judge stood beside him, handing him an award. \u201cThe kid who won is a senior at Vanderbilt. His work will go into a haunted house being set up in an old farmhouse near Murfreesboro. His prize was a grant of five thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you contacted him?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>Jane nodded. \u201cHis name is Simon Latinsky and you can visit him this afternoon. He rents a room on Capri Street. He\u2019s expecting you anytime before five. Oh, by the way\u2014the original, the one we\u2019re seeing in this picture, is already in the haunted house. But he did a few practice runs, which he sold.\u201d</p><p>Dustin looked at Olivia, meeting her eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go talk to the budding artist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay with me,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cMeanwhile, I\u2019ll spend some time with Sydney and Drew,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cSee if I can find out anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe one of you could drop by the caf\u00e9,\u201d Dustin suggested. \u201cDelilah is a veritable fount of information and sometimes some of the kids from Parsonage House go there. Oh, if you run into Coot, say hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to check up on the whereabouts of your fellow therapists, Mason and Mariah\u2014and I\u2019ll stop by and introduce myself to Sandra Cheever,\u201d Sloan said with a grimace. \u201cI\u2019ve already talked to her on the phone a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Why?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cAccording to the last will Aaron Bentley wrote, you\u2019re his executor. And Sandra wants to plan the funeral. Oh, by the way\u2014she quits.\u201d</p><p>Olivia groaned. \u201cAnother funeral...and I\u2019m not surprised she wants to handle it. All she had to do was talk to me. I\u2019m happy to let her make the arrangements.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she likes you a lot right now,\u201d Sloan told her.</p><p>Dustin nudged Olivia. \u201cFinish your coffee and let\u2019s go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an art student to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSammy and I will hold down the fort here,\u201d Abby said. She yawned. \u201cMaybe take a bit of a nap on that sofa.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia set down her cup and took Dustin\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s see what Simon Latinsky has to say.\u201d Sammy let out a mournful howl, as if he knew he was being left again.</p><p>\u201cAh, come here, boy. I\u2019m going to cuddle you while we take a nap,\u201d Abby crooned, enticing him over.</p><p>\u201cJust FYI, he\u2019s not supposed to be on the couch,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>Abby grinned at her. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be on the couch\u2014and he can sleep on me!\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled. It was evident that she approved of the woman who\u2019d become Malachi\u2019s partner in every possible way.</p> <p>Simon Latinsky lived in a turn-of-the-century house on Capri Street near Vanderbilt. When they knocked on the door, the woman who opened it seemed to be expecting them; she welcomed them in and asked if they wanted coffee. They declined, and she directed them to Simon\u2019s room, explaining that she owned the house but rented four of her rooms to students.</p><p>The house reminded Dustin of his college days. The tenants seemed to be musicians and artists. He and Olivia could hear someone practicing a guitar as they walked up the stairs, and the hallway was lined with lithographs.</p><p>Simon let them into his room. He looked much as he had in the picture Jane had found online.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d he greeted them. \u201cCome on in. Sorry, it\u2019s such a mess.\u201d It was a mess. Simon dumped a pile of clothing from a chair and another from the foot of his bed so they could sit. \u201cI heard you\u2019re with the FBI!\u201d he told Dustin.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Dustin said, introducing himself and Olivia.</p><p>\u201cCool. But I\u2019m not sure what I can do to help. The lady on the phone was asking me about my General Cunningham picture. She says the sheriff out by you found one\u2014in some trees. The thing is, it can\u2019t be the one in the newspaper photo. That\u2019s owned by Hysterically Haunted Happenings\u2014they\u2019re the guys who had the contest. I was really happy to win. Tuition is stiff, you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cAnd I sympathize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, want to be a model? What a great face you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean a nude or anything. I have a little money now.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI could even pay you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe some other time.\u201d Olivia smiled at him. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for models, we have gorgeous horses at the Horse Farm, not to mention adorable dogs and cats. You could come out and see them sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a woman on a horse. A naked woman on a horse! Oh, no\u2014sorry. You can tell I like historical images,\u201d Simon said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no Lady Godiva.\u201d</p><p>Dustin brought the subject back to their original purpose. \u201cMy associate told me that you had a few other renderings of the general. Practice runs, she called them. But you sold them all?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo bad I didn\u2019t know I was going to win!\u201d Simon groused. \u201cI\u2019d have held out for more money. Yeah, I did two practice images. They weren\u2019t as well-shadowed or defined as the one I entered, but they were still pretty good. They probably wound up someplace where they won\u2019t really be appreciated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think one of them is appreciated,\u201d Olivia murmured.</p><p>\u201cSo, you sold two. Who did you sell them to?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>Simon screwed up his face. \u201cWe had an art sale right in the yard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do them every few months. Mrs. B.\u2014you met her, she owns this place\u2014is really cool. Some of my friends play their own music, she makes lemonade and sangria and we have a great day. I sold a bunch of stuff, sketches, some watercolors\u2014and the practice pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but who did you sell them to?\u201d Olivia asked, repeating Dustin\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m trying to remember,\u201d Simon told them. \u201c\u2019Cause I sold so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it all cash?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>Simon brightened. \u201cNo. No, I took several checks.... Oh, yeah! I took a check for one of the renderings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wrote it?\u201d Dustin persisted.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014a guy,\u201d Simon said vaguely.</p><p>\u201cOld guy, young guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of in the middle. He wasn\u2019t a kid, but he wasn\u2019t keeling over or anything, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he dark-or light-skinned? What color were his eyes? Did he have a beard? How was he dressed? Is there anything you remember about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he was wearing a baseball cap, I\u2019m pretty sure. I don\u2019t remember his eyes. No, he didn\u2019t have a beard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have the check he gave you?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cI already deposited it,\u201d he replied. \u201cEveryone told me I was an idiot to take a check. But here\u2019s the good thing\u2014it didn\u2019t bounce!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon, I swear we\u2019re not after your bank account, but you must have online banking,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cIf you pull up your account, you should be able to find a copy of the check.\u201d</p><p>He got up. His desk was piled high with pens and pencils, art sheets and school memos. He brushed them out of the way to get to his computer. A minute later, he\u2019d drawn up his records and hit all the right keys. He swiveled in his desk chair to look at them proudly. \u201cI found it!\u201d</p><p>Olivia got up and walked over to stand behind the boy, studying the computer image of the check he\u2019d been given.</p><p>She turned to look at Dustin with stricken eyes.</p><p>\u201cAaron,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAaron bought the general\u2019s image.\u201d</p><p>17</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll ever get at the truth,\u201d Olivia said as they drove out of the city. She realized that although she\u2019d discovered something she hadn\u2019t wanted to know, she\u2019d been glad to get away\u2014even if Nashville wasn\u2019t really \u201caway.\u201d Any trip there, however brief, was a pleasure; the city was sophisticated and filled with music and charm and yet still had a small-town feel.</p><p>But she loved the Horse Farm, too. She had adored Marcus; she\u2019d cared about Aaron. But Aaron might have gone crazy before he\u2019d died\u2014or been killed. Every clue seemed to lead them in circles.</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Dustin said in a reassuring voice. He was driving, and she sat in the passenger seat, gazing out the window, wishing she could roll back time.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Frank in a little while and find out if he\u2019s come across anything new.\u201d He reached over and squeezed her hand. \u201cHungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, actually. We never did have lunch. We could turn around. I know some incredible restaurants on Elm Pike or back by Music Row.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cI was thinking more of the caf\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Jane was going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she hasn\u2019t gone yet. Maybe we should all meet up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to think I once really enjoyed that caf\u00e9!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGrab my phone and call Jane. See if they want to meet us there for an early dinner. Someone should stay at the Horse Farm, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d As directed, she got his phone. Jane hadn\u2019t been to the caf\u00e9 yet; she and Abby had spent most of the afternoon on the computer, hacking into her coworkers\u2019 social network sites.</p><p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d she asked Jane.</p><p>\u201cSometimes. Pretty easy in this case. Your coworkers use their email addresses as their user names and the name of one of the horses as their passcodes. It wasn\u2019t terribly hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo red flags, but we\u2019ll talk at the caf\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Olivia leaned back in the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cWell\u2014I\u2019m tired of being on edge,\u201d she said. \u201cUh, where are we sleeping tonight?\u201d She meant the question to sound very casual.</p><p>\u201cYour house,\u201d he told her. \u201cJane and Sloan will remain at the Horse Farm, and Malachi and Abby will go and stay at Marcus\u2019s house\u2014or more accurately, your other house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cWill everyone know that?\u201d she asked carefully.</p><p>She thought he was smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t think Malachi will mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of protective....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just wanted to make sure I knew how extraordinary you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is my cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assured him that I think you\u2019re completely extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He was quiet for a few minutes. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked a little about what others see as our strange experiences. Do you remember the first time you had one of those experiences\u2014when you saw a ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the general,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw him sitting proudly on his horse. He was so dignified. And I wasn\u2019t afraid.... And, of course, there was Malachi\u2019s resident ghost. He lives in the family home in Virginia. I sometimes wondered when I was young if I really saw him or if it was just Malachi\u2019s way of teasing me. But...he was a good ghost. A family ghost. You\u2019d never be afraid of him. I haven\u2019t spent my life having conversations with ghosts, though. Not the way it seems the rest of you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts don\u2019t always have a reason to speak or make themselves known,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cBut once you\u2019ve gotten accustomed to the fact that the dead can walk\u2014and speak\u2014you can seek them out. Not everyone, of course. But you definitely have the talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalent,\u201d she echoed. She closed her eyes. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have the \u2018talent,\u2019 as you say, I would\u2019ve been forced to accept\u2014whether I really believed it or not\u2014that Marcus had relapsed. And in that case...Aaron might still be alive. There might be hope for the Horse Farm.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut Marcus Danby deserves justice. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d he began. He didn\u2019t finish. It was almost as if he regretted speaking at all.</p> <p>\u201cBut?\u201d she demanded. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare give me a \u2018but\u2019 and then go silent!\u201d</p><p>He looked over at her. For a moment she wished she\u2019d met him under better circumstances. She loved the line of his jaw, the strength of his conviction and inner resolve and, admittedly, she loved lying in bed with him....</p><p>\u201cJackson would find a place for you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cJackson Crow. Working with one of the units. You could even be based in northern Virginia.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDustin, I know how to fire a tranquilizer gun, but I\u2019ve never held a real firearm in my life. I\u2019m a coward!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the sense to be afraid, we\u2019d be worthless. Fear can consume you\u2014or it can make you wary and intelligent about what you do and how you do it. I\u2019m just saying that if you were looking to move...on to something else...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf the Horse Farm goes under and we\u2019re forced to find homes for the animals and sell the land, I\u2019ll have to,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is happening.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand again. \u201cWe\u2019ll find the truth, and the truth could repair all the harm that\u2019s been done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far it looks as if our founder died of an overdose and our first-in-command was so off his rocker that he nearly drowned and then managed to electrocute himself in his bathtub. The other alternative\u2014to the average observer\u2014is that one or more people who work at the Horse Farm is a devious, bloodthirsty murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth could still salvage the situation,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWhatever that truth is.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019d driven off I-40 and taken the back road. She could see the caf\u00e9 ahead; the SUV in which Malachi and his team had arrived was parked in the lot.</p><p>Olivia braced herself to go in.</p><p>The Krewe agents already had the largest table at the caf\u00e9, the one at the far end, away from the door. As Olivia and Dustin walked through to join them, Delilah was serving a coffee refill to a lone tourist. She returned the pot to the burner and came toward them and, as Olivia had feared, she threw both arms around her in a huge hug. The last thing Olivia felt she could cope with right now was pity.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I am so sorry. I can\u2019t imagine how hard this is for you\u2014all of you. But Sandra, well, she\u2019s a tough bird, and Mariah and Mason just aren\u2019t as invested... Oh, and poor Drew and Sydney! What will they do? They\u2019ve both given their lives to that place!\u201d Delilah said. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m so sorry about Aaron! Now,\u201d she added briskly, \u201cwhat can I get you, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIced tea would be great, Delilah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame for me,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cWell, this table is just one big group of tea drinkers!\u201d Delilah chuckled. \u201cI have chicken potpie tonight, and if I do say so myself, it\u2019s the best!\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken potpie?\u201d Malachi asked, looking around the table to nods of assent. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it easy, Delilah. We\u2019ll all have potpie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy, that is easy!\u201d Beaming, Delilah bustled off to fill their order.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve gotten to know her,\u201d Olivia said to the others.</p><p>Jane smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to get to know Delilah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you learn?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cAaron bought the drawing of the general,\u201d Dustin said, getting right to the point.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know his handwriting\u2014and I know Horse Farm checks,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Abby argued, \u201chis buying the art doesn\u2019t mean he put it in the forest during the camping trip. Or even if he did, it might have been a practical joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t play practical jokes,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cNot when we\u2019re dealing with kids who are struggling with addiction or other issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have intended it for some other purpose,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cMaybe he bought the artwork and then someone else discovered it\u2014and took it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd used his horse?\u201d Olivia asked grimly. \u201cI suppose that if anyone had a motive to kill Marcus, it would\u2019ve been Aaron. And, of course, if anyone had a motive to kill Aaron...people would think it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept,\u201d Dustin pointed out, \u201cby the time it got to you, so much damage would be done to the Horse Farm\u2019s reputation that you really wouldn\u2019t have a motive to kill him\u2014certainly not this quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Malachi warned.</p><p>Delilah came sweeping down on them with a massive tray. Chicken potpies were served with a large plate of biscuits. Delilah fluttered around the table, making sure they had butter, jam and honey for the biscuits, silverware and iced tea refills. When she was finished, she said, \u201cOlivia, honey, have you heard from that lawyer fellow yet?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head, feeling a little guilty. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. I do need to call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I just wanted to let you know. One of my regulars\u2014another attorney fellow who runs back and forth between Nashville and Memphis\u2014was asking me about it. I just wanted you to know that if it comes to selling, which of course I hope it won\u2019t, he\u2019ll buy the place. He\u2019ll meet the price Marcus always wanted so the money could go to his charities. If you have to sell, you let me know.\u201d</p><p>Olivia forced a smile. \u201cThanks, Delilah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this attorney, Delilah?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cName is Henry Whittaker. His main office is in Nashville. I\u2019m sure you can find him easy enough. If not, I\u2019ve got his card somewhere.\u201d</p><p>She beamed at them again and swept off.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking about this all wrong,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>Olivia gave him a puzzled look. \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we suspected Aaron might have killed Marcus\u2014because he\u2019d get to be in charge of the Horse Farm. But Aaron\u2019s out of the picture. I don\u2019t think someone wants to kill everyone in order to run the Horse Farm. I think someone wants it to fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we have to figure out. Sloan, anything on the women today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra Cheever never left her house. I followed Mariah to the Horse Farm and she saw both Sydney and Drew, hugged them a lot, cried a little\u2014and then I followed her back to her place. She didn\u2019t leave again. There\u2019s still a deputy watching over Sandra.\u201d He glanced at Olivia. \u201cI called the office in Virginia and had a trace put on your boy Mason\u2019s credit cards. He\u2019s been in Nashville. Last uses were at the Country Music Hall of Fame and then a restaurant on Music Row.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t solve anything tonight. I say we eat our potpies and get a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d Malachi told them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take Liv for a drive first,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cI think we should stop in and see the Horse Farm guests who live at Parsonage House.\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. She wasn\u2019t sure what they\u2019d get from the boys, but she agreed that it was a good idea for her, as one of their therapists, to see them. They must be in shock. None of them had been particularly close to Aaron, but they knew him.</p><p>And now he was dead.</p><p>As she and Dustin left the diner, Malachi requested the keys to Marcus Danby\u2019s house. Dustin must have discussed the plans with him while she was in the restroom. She found the keys in her bag; as she handed them to her cousin, she asked, \u201cDo you think anyone\u2019s made any attempt to get in there? Is there something they could be looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go through whatever papers we can find. Sometimes even a greeting card can be a clue. Or he might have received some other correspondence that didn\u2019t seem significant to him at the time,\u201d Malachi replied.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019re in any danger there, do you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI doubt it, but it\u2019s not impossible. Marcus doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would kill him so there\u2019s definitely some unknown factor here. However, Abby and I are both well trained and,\u201d Malachi added with a grin, \u201cwe\u2019re armed.\u201d</p><p>When they\u2019d all said good-night, Olivia and Dustin drove the short distance to Parsonage House. They were greeted by the director, Lance Osterly, a kindly, middle-aged man who still had the look of a pro wrestler\u2014which he\u2019d been at one point in his life.</p><p>\u201cLiv, good to see you,\u201d he greeted her as he waved them both in. He nodded at Dustin. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the FBI man, right? The boys talk a lot, you know,\u201d he said with a wink.</p><p>Dustin offered his hand to Osterly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Aaron,\u201d Osterly told Olivia.</p><p>\u201cI am, too. It\u2019s so strange\u2014I don\u2019t even know how to handle this one,\u201d she said.</p><p>Osterly shook his head. \u201cThe poor guy survives what should\u2019ve killed him, and he still dies in a ridiculous way. The kids have talked of nothing else for the past few days. Anyway, I appreciate that you\u2019re here. Come on\u2014they\u2019re outside on the patio.\u201d</p><p>Osterly escorted them to a back door, which led to a pool and patio; the pool was covered until warmer weather returned but the patio was pretty with a rock wall fireplace and plenty of seating.</p><p>\u201cLiv!\u201d Joey was the first on his feet, rushing over to her. She thought of him as a boy, but he wasn\u2019t really; he was an adolescent, taller than her\u2014and awkward, as many young men his age were. She greeted him with a hug. By then, Matt, Sean and Nick had joined them, and she realized that although they were once-upon-a-time tough-guy addicts, now they were scared.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all doing okay?\u201d Dustin asked them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\u2014we\u2019re in an awful dilemma,\u201d Matt said. \u201cWe know we\u2019re okay and everything will be fine, but our parents are acting paranoid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomebody killed Aaron, right?\u201d Nick asked. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t forget that morning at the campsite. He almost drowned. And then he electrocuted himself in a bathtub? That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying\u2014that\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to believe. And changing our lives, going clean, is all about being honest, but there\u2019s no honesty going on here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Sean muttered, \u201cour parents have all been on the phone with Mr. Osterly. They\u2019re questioning our safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have another six weeks here,\u201d Matt said. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about pulling me out. I don\u2019t want to go, Olivia. It\u2019s like this place saved my life and a lot of that\u2019s because of the horses. They taught me about boundaries and respect and they made me...they made me want a different life. A good life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome of us want to become therapists,\u201d Joey told her. \u201cEquine therapists.\u201d</p><p>Olivia glanced at Dustin, grateful that he\u2019d decided they should come here.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, all of you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will find out what happened. What they\u2019re telling you isn\u2019t a pack of lies\u2014it\u2019s just all anyone knows. But wherever you go from here, whatever you do\u2014nothing changes the incredible strides you\u2019ve made or the wonderful young people you are. I\u2019m so proud of every one of you, and I\u2019d love to see you go forward and get into therapy or working with horses, or whatever you feel is best for you.\u201d</p><p>She felt Dustin\u2019s hands on her shoulders. \u201cYou know we don\u2019t believe Marcus Danby fell back into drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd despite the fact that it appears Aaron was alone when he died, it\u2019s just too ironic or coincidental\u2014or stupid\u2014to believe. Sometimes, though, it takes time to uncover the truth. If you are pulled out of this facility, don\u2019t forget what you had here\u2014your friendships, everything you learned. And you can call on us anytime.\u201d</p><p>The boys nodded.</p> <p>\u201cNow, do any of you know anything?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>They looked back at him wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Matt asked.</p><p>\u201cWere you all around the day Marcus died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014until Aaron called Mr. Osterly to have the van come and pick us up because they were all going off to look for Marcus,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember anything odd about that day?\u201d Dustin asked.</p> <p>\u201cPoor Sammy, coming back looking like he\u2019d met up with a bear,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cBefore that, did any of you notice if the horses were all there?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cI was playing Ping-Pong. I didn\u2019t even see Sammy until everyone started screaming,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Joey frowned, then suddenly grew excited. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the big guy\u2014Gargantua. I like him a lot. Olivia used him now and then, I guess to show us that the biggest, toughest animals\u2014and people\u2014could be the kindest if that was the choice they made.\u201d He looked at Olivia.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Olivia agreed. \u201cDid you ask anybody about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did. Sandra was there, and I saw her heading for Aaron\u2019s office. I asked her if they\u2019d let somebody take Gangantua out. She said he was probably just hanging around by the trees and we couldn\u2019t see him. I don\u2019t think she was paying much attention to me. She seemed distracted,\u201d Joey said.</p><p>\u201cShe was distracted before Sammy came back injured?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Joey nodded.</p> <p>\u201cBut she was there,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>Joey nodded again.</p><p>\u201cWho else do you remember being in the office right before you were sent back and everyone went riding off to find Marcus?\u201d Dustin asked.</p><p>\u201cI think Sandra\u2019s the only one. And then Aaron, once Sammy showed up. And then everyone,\u201d Joey said.</p><p>\u201cI saw Mason.\u201d Matt grinned. \u201cHe was fixing his hair in the mirror in back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Dustin told them.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are great, and what you\u2019ve accomplished is great,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cNo matter what happens.\u201d</p><p>They wished the boys a good night, thanking Lance Osterly.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. They really respect you, Liv. I\u2019m praying that all this gets sorted out quickly. We offer the kids all kinds of stuff here\u2014group therapy, individual therapy, art therapy, massage therapy\u2014you name it. But there\u2019s nothing like the Horse Farm for most of our boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep it afloat\u2014and we\u2019ll get our reputation back, I promise,\u201d Olivia said fervently.</p><p>When they reached the car, she burst out with, \u201cWhat a liar I am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn impossible dreamer, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep telling you, when we discover the truth, the world will spin more smoothly on its axis.\u201d They stopped by the Horse Farm to pick up Sammy. The stables were quiet; evidently Drew and Sydney had gone to bed for the night.</p><p>Sloan and Jane Everett were still up, though. Of course, sleeping on couches couldn\u2019t have been conducive to going to bed early. Jane had been looking through Aaron\u2019s correspondence. \u201cI found an offer from a firm, sent to Aaron. He must\u2019ve ignored it and shoved it in his desk,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of offer?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cAn offer for the property. It\u2019s from the offices of that Nashville attorney Delilah mentioned. Henry Whittaker. And it came last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to buy the Horse Farm\u2014and went straight to Aaron?\u201d Olivia asked, puzzled. \u201cBut an attorney would know, or could easily find out, just how tied up the place was! Why didn\u2019t he go directly to Fairchild?\u201d When she saw Jane\u2019s puzzled look, she explained. \u201cFairchild was Marcus\u2019s attorney, and he\u2019s been dealing with everything concerning the Horse Farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this is a friendly letter. It just says that if the Horse Farm is ever in trouble, he\u2019s willing to pay a more-than-fair asking price for the property and buildings, and to see that the charities nearest and dearest to him received the greatest benefit,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>She showed them the letter.</p><p>Olivia said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that an attorney from Nashville would be able to manage any of this without insider assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible, either,\u201d Sloan agreed. \u201cBut it does speak to the theory that someone is trying to ruin the Horse Farm rather than take it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll head back to Nashville in the morning,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cBut right now...we need to let Sammy search Liv\u2019s house before we go inside!\u201d</p><p>They left the Horse Farm, with Sammy happily back in the car, sticking his nose between them. When they reached the house, Sammy showed no sign of fear or suspicion.</p><p>Olivia let Dustin and the dog search for evidence that there\u2019d been any sign of invasion in their absence and went up to shower. She didn\u2019t bother dressing; she went straight into the bedroom and waited.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Dustin came to her room.</p><p>She saw him in the doorframe for a moment, and the longing and anticipation she\u2019d been feeling seemed to overwhelm her. She loved his analytical mind, his concern for others, his kindness....</p><p>She also loved the way he looked, so tall and powerfully built. She loved the scent of him when he walked in, and she loved the feel of his naked flesh when he lay down beside her.</p><p>Their mouths met in a kiss that seemed desperate. But she had to touch him, all of him, taste him, feel his heat and passion rush through her. She felt his lips, his tongue, move over her breasts and down to her belly and below, felt his vibrant life and strength. The pulse of the world became that of her heart as she kissed and teased and stroked him in return. She crawled atop him and looked into his eyes, and he smiled and grasped her, and then he was in her.... The first time was frantic.</p><p>The second began slowly...and became frantic.</p><p>They lay together, panting, slick and sweaty and still entangled, and she breathed again.</p><p>\u201cHot enough?\u201d he asked, his voice a teasing whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cI feel like an inferno,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>She felt her heart begin to slow. She touched him again. The third time their lovemaking remained slow for long enough that she kissed nearly every inch of his flesh, felt his fingers touch her everywhere, felt the passion in his kiss. They spiraled out of control and lay entwined together once again.</p><p>She nearly dozed and then realized he still lay awake, staring at the ceiling.</p><p>He sensed her movement.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about what Jane and Sloan told us,\u201d he said. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe a Nashville lawyer could have pulled any of this off without insider assistance. I somehow doubt he\u2019s really involved, except in a nominal way. Besides, there\u2019s other property available in the Tennessee hills. It has to be more personal and yet...that might well be the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought you were dreaming about hot and sweaty.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and pulled her close. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAlmost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I meant almost as in discovering what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know it\u2019s someone who has something to do with the Horse Farm\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said that from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...now I\u2019m positive that two people had to be involved.\u201d He rolled over to look at her. \u201cTwo people\u2014that means each of the killers can have an alibi. For instance, we wouldn\u2019t think it was Sandra because Joey saw her. We wouldn\u2019t think it was Sydney because he was watching over the Horse Farm while we were out camping. We wouldn\u2019t think it was Mariah\u2014because she was screaming while Aaron was on the verge of drowning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where does that get us? We wouldn\u2019t think it was Aaron\u2014because he actually wound up dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be a way to trip someone up,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cNow...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll trip them up now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I think we\u2019re ready to get hot and sweaty again now.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and curled into his arms as he kissed her. And she wished the night could go on forever.</p><p>Eventually, they both slept.</p> <p>When Olivia woke the next morning, she saw that his eyes were still closed. She started to get out of bed, trying not to disturb him. But she saw him smile and realized he\u2019d probably wake at the slightest sound.</p><p>\u201cYou look cute, cuddled there,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cCute?\u201d he asked indignantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go put coffee on.\u201d</p><p>Sliding from bed, she slipped into her robe. She was surprised that Sammy wasn\u2019t sleeping at his usual post in the hallway.</p> <p>\u201cSammy?\u201d she called. His food and water bowl were in the kitchen, and she assumed he\u2019d gotten tired of waiting for her.</p><p>Still, she walked cautiously down the stairs.</p><p>When she reached the landing, she paused, gasping.</p><p>There was Sammy. He was curled at the foot of the sofa, lying near the first of the three men in her parlor\u2014Marcus Danby, who sat at one end.</p><p>General Rufus Cunningham sat in the wing-back chair, straight and dignified as ever in his uniform, his cavalry hat in his lap.</p><p>Aaron Bentley was at the other end of the sofa.</p> <p>When he saw her, he rose.</p><p>\u201cI did not kill Marcus!\u201d he said, his words trembling with passion. \u201cAnd I most certainly did not idiotically kill myself!\u201d</p><p>18</p><p>Dustin practically flew out of bed, wrapping himself in the sheet and grabbing his Glock when he heard the voices downstairs. He raced to the first-floor landing\u2014and then saw the strange trio in the house.</p><p>\u201cAgent Blake,\u201d Aaron said, \u201cnice of you to join us. I was just explaining to Olivia that, no, I didn\u2019t kill myself. Nor did I kill Marcus.\u201d</p><p>Dustin looked at Olivia. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>He headed back upstairs, still shaking. The sound of the voices in the house had scared the hell out of him; he was still afraid Olivia was at risk. He couldn\u2019t allow himself to get comfortable right now, he reminded himself harshly.</p><p>This time, the house was filled with ghosts\u2014with the dead. Next time, it just might be the living.</p> <p>The lethal living.</p><p>He had to move when she moved, hell, breathe when she breathed. And if he wasn\u2019t with her\u2014in the same space\u2014another agent had to be.</p><p>Dressed, he came back downstairs.</p><p>He was truly astonished to see the Civil War general\u2014with the two very recent ghosts.</p><p>Aaron was wearing a handsome suit\u2014and his cowboy boots. Dustin figured Sandra Cheever had brought the clothing to the funeral director.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to help,\u201d Marcus told him. \u201cThe general\u2019s been teaching me. With his help, I made it all the way to the mortuary. I was very proud of myself. Aaron was still reeling at the fact of his death. We were able to make him see more than himself in the present\u2014that is, fried.\u201d</p><p>Aaron winced. \u201cMarcus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, you are beyond all earthly cares now, other than to help those who remain,\u201d the general said.</p><p>\u201cSo who the hell did it?\u201d Dustin asked. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Aaron stared back at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dustin turned to Olivia and groaned.</p><p>\u201cYou have to know something,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cTell him what you do know\u2014what you believe, son,\u201d the general said. \u201cYou people were good for these hills, and now... I cannot bear this kind of treachery. Where has honor gone?\u201d he declaimed.</p><p>Aaron looked from the general back to Dustin. \u201cI\u2019m dead\u2014and I still can\u2019t bear the pain of it. And I\u2019m being badgered by the past.\u201d He glanced significantly at Cunningham.</p><p>\u201cHonor should not be in the past, sir!\u201d the general said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cI\u2019m just...\u201d</p><p>The ghost of Aaron Bentley faded. \u201cHe\u2019s really not very good at being dead yet,\u201d Marcus told them. \u201cI think, perhaps, I was better adapted.... In my misspent youth, I came close to dying many times.\u201d He straightened. \u201cWe did learn something from Aaron\u2014something that may be important, and something you would probably have discovered in your questioning. Aaron doesn\u2019t want to believe that Sandra could be involved in any way\u2014he loved her, you see. But she was the only one besides him who had a key to his house. He\u2019s convinced that whoever killed him was in the house when he arrived. He says he came in, threw his mail on the table and decided that he smelled like antiseptic from the hospital. He went straight to the bathroom, decided to linger in the tub and listen to music. He turned on his iPod, crawled in and closed his eyes. Next thing he knew the iPod station came flying into the water and he was burning in agony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling Frank Vine,\u201d Dustin told Olivia. \u201cHe needs to bring Sandra Cheever back to the station. At the very least, he can grill her about her key to Aaron\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get dressed,\u201d Olivia said, and went upstairs.</p><p>Aaron was probably still among them, but couldn\u2019t be seen or heard. Dustin called Frank, who sounded tired. \u201cI already questioned her. She couldn\u2019t have killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was the only one with a key, Frank. She has to have given that key to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? You come down here, then. I\u2019ll bring her in\u2014but you ask the questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t get much worse around here,\u201d Frank muttered.</p><p>Dustin sighed. \u201cIt can always get worse\u2014that\u2019s why this has to be solved now.\u201d He hung up and turned back to the duo still in the parlor.</p><p>\u201cHe should\u2019ve been more careful after nearly dying at the stream,\u201d Marcus said sadly. \u201cAaron should\u2019ve been...afraid.\u201d</p><p>As Dustin had assumed, Aaron was still there\u2014just not visible. \u201cHey,\u201d he protested. \u201cI was in my own house and there was a deputy posted outside. I should\u2019ve had a dog,\u201d he said mournfully. \u201cI should have taken one of those rescue mutts. A dog would have barked. Warned me. Oh, wait\u2014that didn\u2019t help you, Marcus, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaron, I have an important question. Why did you buy that artwork?\u201d Dustin asked. \u201cThat rendering of the general?\u201d</p><p>Aaron didn\u2019t answer. He seemed to have lost the energy to speak now, as well.</p><p>\u201cHe bought it because he wanted it for the Horse Farm. He thought Mariah would love it\u2014that it would be great when she was telling her ghost stories,\u201d Marcus explained.</p><p>Olivia came back down the stairs, ready for the day in jeans and a denim shirt, her bag thrown over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to go through everything with Sandra one more time. And then we\u2019re going to tear the Horse Farm apart,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep watch,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cWe\u2019ll split up and...\u201d He sighed. \u201cThing is, we can\u2019t be everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSammy, look after the house,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>They left. For once, Sammy didn\u2019t care. Marcus had risen, but Sammy was still at his feet.</p><p>Dustin tossed Olivia the keys. \u201cYou drive. I\u2019ll make calls.\u201d She nodded and slid behind the wheel.</p><p>First, he called Malachi, who said he and Abby were still going through Marcus\u2019s house, hoping to find something. Dustin told Malachi about the ghosts in Olivia\u2019s parlor\u2014and that he was going down to the station to question Sandra again.</p><p>Then he called Sloan at the Horse Farm and gave him the latest information.</p><p>Sloan asked him, \u201cCan Olivia hear me right now?\u201d</p><p>Dustin glanced at her. She couldn\u2019t hear, he decided.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may want to bring her here first. Drew suggested it. He\u2019s called the vet because there\u2019s something wrong with her horse.\u201d</p><p>Dustin barely prevented himself from saying, \u201cShiloh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew says it might be colic. He might have gotten hold of something bad for him out in the pasture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, you two\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay on that horse like flies. I know, Dustin. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll watch over her or die in the attempt. You know that.\u201d He paused. \u201cI guess you\u2019d better tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said thickly.</p><p>Dustin ended the call and looked at Olivia. \u201cHead over to the Horse Farm. I\u2019m going to leave you there with Sloan and Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting the vet out. I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s something wrong with Shiloh.\u201d</p><p>Her skin grew ashen but she concentrated on the road, carefully taking the next turn.</p><p>\u201cPeople are dead,\u201d she said, her voice heavy. \u201cAnd still... I love that horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to love your horse.\u201d</p><p>They arrived at the ranch minutes later. Olivia had barely turned off the ignition when she was out of the car and racing for the stables. As he followed, he saw that Drew was there, coming toward her. Dustin heard Sloan call his name and turned to see him leaving the office.</p><p>Dustin slowed as he saw Drew give Olivia a hug and talk to her. Sloan reached Dustin\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cThe vet\u2019s delayed. Apparently, there\u2019s only one guy in the immediate area and he was called to a dairy farm some distance away,\u201d Sloan explained. \u201cDrew had just come to tell me this when you phoned. He gave me a few other numbers but it\u2019ll be at least half an hour before anyone can get out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it? You know horses.\u201d</p><p>Sloan kept his own horses at a farm in Virginia, close to their base. \u201cLooks to me like it\u2019s just a matter of very mild colic. Shiloh\u2019s down right now, but I believe he\u2019s going to be all right. Right after I talked to you, Drew and Sydney and I got a hose down his throat and did a decent job of pumping his stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sloan,\u201d Dustin said. He and Sloan hurried to the stables and over to Shiloh\u2019s stall. Olivia was in with the horse. Shiloh lay on the ground, but his head was up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHis eyes are brighter,\u201d Drew remarked. \u201cSloan, you made the right call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sloan,\u201d Olivia was kneeling on the ground by her horse. She looked up at Dustin, and there was anger in her eyes now. \u201cGo to the station,\u201d she told him. \u201cGo! I\u2019m fine. I want you to find out who did this!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou...you think someone poisoned the horse?\u201d Drew asked.</p><p>\u201cI do\u2014and I\u2019ll find out who did it!\u201d Olivia said. \u201cOr, rather, we\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>Dustin nodded. \u201cAll right. I\u2019m on my way. Don\u2019t make a move without Sloan or Jane, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be making a move, period\u2014not until the vet comes and we\u2019re sure Shiloh\u2019s okay,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cGo. Sandra knows something\u2014and I want to know what!\u201d</p><p>Dustin looked at Sloan and turned back to the car. He drove fast. If a deputy stopped him now, he\u2019d just say he was on his way to see Frank Vine.</p> <p>It was wrong, Olivia told herself, to feel such intense anger and fear over Shiloh when people were dead. But the general, who\u2019d kept his horse haunting the hills with him for a century and a half, and Marcus, who had loved all living creatures, would understand. Aaron... Maybe he wouldn\u2019t understand completely.</p><p>She was encouraged, though. Drew had described how the horse was at first\u2014eyes rheumy, unable to stand, wobbling. Now, since they\u2019d pumped his stomach, he seemed to be on the mend.</p><p>She hugged the horse\u2019s neck, just sitting with him. He nudged her and gave a little whinny. She stroked his big, beautiful head and curled his forelock with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay. It\u2019s not a bad thing to have a cowboy around, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiv, I\u2019ll go in and get you a cup of coffee,\u201d Drew told her. \u201cSloan\u2019s right here, and Sydney\u2019s in his room, within shouting distance. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great, Drew.\u201d Olivia said gratefully. She glanced up. Sloan was on guard, smiling at her from the stall gate. \u201cThe horse is going to make it, Liv.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cThanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also thanks to Drew and Sydney. They run a good stable here.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but before Sloan could speak again, they heard a shout from the office.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Sloan frowned and backed away from the stall, peering through the stable entrance to the office. Olivia jumped up to join him and together they started toward the office.</p><p>Drew was running in their direction.</p><p>\u201cJane! It\u2019s Jane. I don\u2019t know what the hell\u2019s wrong with her. She\u2019s down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown?\u201d Sloan shouted. \u201cStay with me!\u201d he ordered Olivia, and tore for the house.</p> <p>Olivia did stay with him\u2014right on his heels. Sloan burst into the office and she ran in behind him.</p><p>Jane Everett was on the sofa; she\u2019d been there with her computer, a cup of coffee on the driftwood coffee table in front of her.</p><p>She had collapsed onto her side. Her computer lay haphazardly on the floor.</p><p>Sloan rushed to her.</p><p>\u201cA dart! Look for a dart\u2014a small dart somewhere!\u201d Olivia told him. She fell onto her knees by Jane\u2019s left side as Sloan took the right.</p><p>Olivia saw the tiny dart that had struck Jane; she reached for it. \u201cSloan! I\u2019ve got the dart.\u201d</p><p>But even as he turned to her, reaching for his gun, she heard a \u201czzzz\u201d in the air.</p><p>The big cowboy fell onto his partner and beloved. Olivia ducked close to the couch, trying to see who was in the office shooting the darts.</p><p>She stared at the door, but the sunlight was streaming in. She couldn\u2019t see the man\u2019s face. And then...</p><p>\u201cDrew!\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get out of the woman,\u201d Frank Vine muttered to Dustin. \u201cShe has an answer for everything\u2014and I don\u2019t have a single thing to hold her on.\u201d</p><p>They were in the observation room. Jimmy Callahan stood watching Sandra while Frank and Dustin talked.</p><p>\u201cHold her on suspicion of murder,\u201d Dustin said.</p><p>\u201cWith what proof? We have nothing! No district attorney would be able to take this case to court!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt if Sandra knows that. Just tell her she\u2019s going to be booked for murder. Then I\u2019ll go in.\u201d</p><p>Dustin watched as Frank went to talk to Sandra. She immediately flew from her chair in a fury, telling him he was an idiot.</p><p>\u201cStrange, huh, that they called her Mama Cheever? She\u2019s a real virago. I guess she ran a tight ship, though. But it seems like she did love Aaron. You really think she might have killed him?\u201d Callahan asked.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t do the deed\u2014but I think that, somehow or other, she was in on it.\u201d</p><p>Frank returned to the observation area. \u201cShe\u2019s all yours,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dustin nodded and walked into the interrogation room. Sandra watched him suspiciously, radiating pure tension. \u201cYou,\u201d she spat. \u201cYou are a despicable federal ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra, you were the only one who had a key to Aaron\u2019s house\u2014besides Aaron.\u201d Something in her manner changed slightly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou loved him and you were having an affair with him. Are you telling me you didn\u2019t have his key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I had his key! But how the hell would I know just how many keys Aaron had out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have any other keys out there, Sandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaron told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaron? Aaron is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, he is.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her lips twitching with derision. \u201cYou spoke to a dead man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe spoke to me,\u201d Dustin said. He could well imagine Frank Vine and Jimmy Callahan frowning at each other in the observation room. Their lips would be twitching, as well.</p><p>Dustin leaned forward. \u201cYou had the only extra key, Sandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill Aaron! I loved him.\u201d</p><p>Dustin eased back in his chair. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cI don\u2019t think you realized he was going to be killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t killed. It was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just told you\u2014I\u2019ve talked to Aaron. Or, as I said, he talked to me. It wasn\u2019t an accident. He didn\u2019t reach for anything electrical, including his iPod charger, while he was in the bath. Someone was in his house. Someone who probably knew he liked baths.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI never took you for stupid, Sandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid! You bastard, I\u2019m hardly stupid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Then you did know what was going on. So, which is it? Are you stupid\u2014or guilty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cWho had the key? Who did you tell about your affair? What was the real plan\u2014if you didn\u2019t want Aaron dead? And, if you loved him so much, why did you leave his house when you knew your accomplice was in there, lying in wait for him?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>He stood up. \u201cFrank? Frank, come and book her for murder. She\u2019s definitely involved. She didn\u2019t do the killing, but she was in on the conspiracy. She facilitated the killer.\u201d He turned back to Sandra. \u201cBut then the whole thing got away from you, didn\u2019t it? Then you started fearing for your own life, right? So you figured you had to keep quiet. Because unless we caught the killer\u2014\u201d</p><p>He broke off. He was pretty sure he had it figured out, but he needed to trip Sandra up just once.</p><p>He slammed his palms down on the table. \u201cThe Horse Farm was supposed to go under, right? But not so it could be sold to a Nashville lawyer. Right?\u201d</p><p>Sandra glared at him. Then she jumped to her feet and pointed to the one-way mirror.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his fault\u2014all his fault! Jimmy Callahan! He was always talking about the countryside and how wonderful it is, but he said the Horse Farm was a nothing place. He\u2019s the one who talked about the land, and how someone who came from such a long line of Tennesseans should be the one to own it! Someone like that could turn it into a special destination, he said. It was him\u2014he started it all!\u201d</p><p>Dustin turned and stared at the mirror himself; that wasn\u2019t the direction he\u2019d been going with this at all.</p><p>Before he could move, Jimmy Callahan burst into the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he shrieked. \u201cOh, my God!\u201d</p><p>Even as Olivia watched Drew, a dark silhouette in the doorframe with sunlight pouring in behind him, he pitched over. She hadn\u2019t heard the whizzing sound that time; she\u2019d been watching Sloan fall before she turned to Drew.</p><p>Something told her she needed to get the dart out of Sloan\u2019s back.</p><p>She managed to rip out the tiny shaft and drop down by the sofa, ruining anyone\u2019s clear shot at her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Drew trying to kill her, though, because poor Drew was out on the floor. Sydney?</p><p>But Sydney was in the stables.</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDrew? Hey, Drew! Liv? Sloan? Where the hell is everyone?\u201d Sydney had left the stables; he sounded perplexed, and he was on his way to the office.</p><p>\u201cSydney, no! Go back, get on the phone! Call for help!\u201d Olivia shouted, staying down, hoping she was protected by the sofa\u2014and the drugged bodies of the two agents with her.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>This time she heard the strange \u201czzzz\u201d sound.</p><p>And she heard Sydney\u2019s body hit the earth, a few feet from the door.</p><p>FBI agents are always armed!</p><p>Down in front of the sofa, she groped at Sloan\u2019s body until she found the holster at his side. She struggled to find the gun\u2014and get it out without killing herself. She had no idea how to use it.</p><p>It was a gun, she told herself; you took the safety off, you pointed and fired.</p><p>But even as her fingers curled around it, she heard movement behind her.</p><p>\u201cCome on out, Olivia. They\u2019re all down. And I don\u2019t want to hurt you. Not yet. We\u2019re going for a little ride. Don\u2019t you want to buy all the time you can? Come on, now, get up\u2014slowly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia\u2019s fingers were curled around Sloan\u2019s gun. She straightened her back, which was toward the killer. Not allowing any other part of her body to move, she slipped the gun into her fingers.</p><p>\u201cNo more cutesy little dart guns, Olivia. I have a Smith &amp; Wesson trained on you now.\u201d</p><p>Olivia stiffened, arching, trying to pretend she was giving up.</p> <p>She managed to shove the gun under the waistband of her jeans. Then she rose slowly, just as she\u2019d been ordered.</p><p>She was terrified. She was going to faint, her knees would give out.... Being afraid could make you smart; that was what Dustin had said.</p><p>She hoped the gun didn\u2019t protrude from her belly\u2014or that she wouldn\u2019t shoot off the lower portion of her body.</p><p>A shot suddenly exploded over her head, and Olivia froze in shock.</p><p>\u201cJust wanted you to know I have a real gun with real bullets.\u201d</p> <p>She turned to face the killer she should have known.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we riding to? And which horse am I taking? You nearly killed Shiloh.\u201d</p><p>She was answered with a careless shrug. \u201cI had to be sure you\u2019d come here today. So...don\u2019t worry. We have a number of horses to choose from. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Dustin drove in the sheriff\u2019s department car with Frank Vine and Jimmy Callahan.</p><p>Not one of his phone calls to the Horse Farm had been answered. Malachi and Abby were on their way and backup vehicles, including ambulances, were behind them.</p><p>\u201cExplain this to me again,\u201d Frank said to Callahan. \u201cDamn you, Jimmy, why the hell didn\u2019t you figure out what was going on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow was I to know I was dating a maniac?\u201d Callahan demanded. \u201cFrank, we talked about family history. I thought it was really interesting that she could trace her history back so far, and I also suggested that maybe she should consider taking a job in Nashville when it was offered. She might have gotten one of those ghost tour shows\u2014she might have gone really far. I had no idea that...that...whatever!\u201d</p><p>They reached the Horse Farm; Dustin paid no heed to the arguing officers.</p><p>He saw the prone body of Sydney Roux in front of the house and rushed to him, crouching down to check for a pulse. It was faint. On the porch, he found Drew. He, too, was still alive.</p><p>As he rushed into the house, he saw that Jane was trying to help Sloan stagger to his feet.</p><p>\u201cDustin, they used the darts.... We were down.... Olivia... I think Olivia pulled the darts out of us,\u201d Sloan said, and swore furiously.</p><p>\u201cWhoever...came in from the back\u2014none of the dogs barked,\u201d Jane told him.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she? Where\u2019s Olivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But the attack came from inside the house,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cAnd whoever it was took my gun...\u201d</p> <p>Dustin rushed out. Sloan and Jane came tearing after him, but as they arrived at the stables, Jane faltered.</p><p>Sloan stayed back to steady her. Dustin swung on both of them. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? You\u2019re in no shape to be running around! Wait here\u2014ambulances are on their way.\u201d As he spoke, Malachi came driving in with Abby.</p><p>Frank left the stables and headed for Dustin, while Malachi and Abby ran to meet them.</p><p>\u201cTwo of the horses are gone,\u201d Frank said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and we need to get going. Malachi, tell them\u2014they\u2019ve been hurt. They can\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>Malachi pointed at Sloan and Jane. \u201cYou two\u2014emergency attention,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Dustin urged, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to follow quickly. I can\u2019t imagine what she\u2019s planning for Olivia, but if she rode away with her, we\u2019ve got a chance.\u201d</p><p>Jimmy Callahan hurried to the stables. As Dustin followed, he heard movement in one of the stalls. He pulled his gun and whirled around.</p><p>It was Shiloh. The horse was back on its feet.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Malachi shouted.</p><p>Dustin turned to stare at him. \u201cLook, we\u2019re not talking about someone in her right mind here. And she\u2019s just about gone over the edge while being in a desperate situation at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying we have to be prepared to play mind games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you have a suggestion?\u201d Malachi demanded.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Jimmy Callahan said, striding between them. \u201cI do. Mariah is crazy about the history here\u2014crazy about General Rufus Cunningham. She\u2019ll say everyone sees him except her, but that she\u2019s the one who deserves to know him. If you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, tell me what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d Dustin snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take another five minutes. Come with me. To Drew\u2019s room. He\u2019s involved with a reenactment group. Come on, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Dustin had no idea whether it was going to work or not; it might be his only chance. He was trying with all his might to think rationally, like an agent, and not like a man who felt he\u2019d die if something happened to the woman he, yes, loved.</p><p>He looked at Malachi and remembered that he and Liv were cousins and that Malachi must be feeling as torn as he was.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ve done a lot of reading on the general,\u201d he said.</p><p>Five minutes later\u2014as Jimmy had promised\u2014he was ready.</p><p>Malachi and Abby were on their way out, while ambulances thronged the drive to the Horse Farm. Various deputies were mounted up and moving, and Chapparal had been saddled and bridled for him. He climbed on the horse and started to leave the stables.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Malachi held up a hand. \u201cLet\u2019s divide the area into sections. We\u2019ve got a lot of property to cover.\u201d</p><p>Callahan was on Battle-ax. \u201cThe ravine?\u201d he asked Dustin. \u201cThe ravine\u2014where Marcus died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Frank, why don\u2019t you take the ravine with some deputies. Malachi, you and Abby stay with me, but give me some space. I\u2019m going to follow the trail to the campground.\u201d</p><p>He galloped out of the stable on Chapparal and across the pastures.</p><p>If you were crazy and thought you had some kind of divine right to a piece of land\u2014as well as the hereditary right to speak to a ghost\u2014where would you go?</p><p>A cemetery.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cYou\u2019re a good therapist, Mariah. And I always thought you loved what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an okay therapist,\u201d Mariah told her. \u201cYou\u2019re the great lover of the downtrodden, confused and drug-addicted. And, oh, yeah, they love you, too. You should see the disappointment on their faces when they find out they\u2019re with Mason or me for the day. Now, what I am is a great historian. I can tell you everything about the occupation of Nashville. I can describe every Civil War battle in this state\u2014oh, and I can tell you anything you want to know about Andrew Jackson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grew up in Nashville,\u201d Olivia reminded her. She felt the gun inside her shirt and wondered if and when she\u2019d get a chance to use it. During the ride they\u2019d taken so far\u2014running the horses hard most of the way\u2014she\u2019d had no opportunity.</p><p>Mariah was a good storyteller. She was also a skilled horsewoman. The entire way\u2014gallop, trot, canter and walk\u2014Mariah had kept the gun on her.</p><p>And Mariah knew a lot about marksmanship; she\u2019d proven that.</p><p>\u201cYes, you grew up in Nashville. And your good-looking cousin is with the FBI. And you have a great house from your uncle, so naturally you just have to inherit another house from Marcus. And, of course, an agent comes out here with drop-dead looks and of course he immediately falls for you while... Never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, never mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pull any therapist bull on me, Olivia. You can\u2019t analyze an analyzer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it more like you can\u2019t con a con artist?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Give it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I take it you plan on killing me, although that\u2019s pretty dumb. They\u2019ll know it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey arrested Sandra Cheever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think she\u2019ll go down alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her a liar. She had the motive. She was the one sleeping with Aaron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s in custody now, Mariah. She couldn\u2019t have done this. People will arrive at the Horse Farm. They\u2019ll find all the bodies you left strewn around\u2014and they\u2019ll realize I\u2019m missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one saw me. There are dozens of other people who might have done this,\u201d Mariah said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. Aaron\u2019s dead. Drew and Sydney are half-dead. Sandra is in custody and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMason is out there somewhere and, God knows, I\u2019d implicate that crazy old broad at the caf\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKey words, Mariah\u2014crazy old broad at the caf\u00e9. She\u2019s always working, always surrounded by witnesses. When could she have done any of this? But the point is, if you\u2019re going to kill me... What started all this? Marcus was good to everyone. Why did you kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked it up, Olivia. My great-great-great-grandfather was born on this land. I\u2019m entitled to it. The Horse Farm had to fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could buy it?\u201d Olivia asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really my land. I have the right to it. I shouldn\u2019t even have to buy it\u2014but I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Marcus\u2019s family land\u2014that\u2019s how he got it,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I went on one of those ancestry sites. And it led me back a bunch of generations. My great-great-whatever was Marcus\u2019s great-whatever\u2019s brother, which means I have just as much right to the land as he did. And then I wouldn\u2019t have to be a so-so therapist. I\u2019d get to be a great hostess for a haunted bed-and-breakfast, and every night I\u2019d give history and ghost tours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt should have been so simple. Everyone should just have said, oh, how sad. Marcus Danby became a heroin-whore again and it proves that the whole therapy thing was a pile of bullshit. It would\u2019ve been simple as hell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simple? The murder had been simple?</p><p>\u201cBut no...you wouldn\u2019t believe it. You dragged in the law, and then when the law here realized that yes, addicts do fall back, you just had to call your cousin. You know, I was onto you\u2014I knew as soon I saw Mr. Handsome Federal Agent walk in that you\u2019d pulled some strings. Yeah, he needed therapy, my ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra was in on it, though, right?\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI mean, you needed help, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSandra is an idiot!\u201d Mariah snapped. \u201cShe wanted Marcus out of the way because she wanted Aaron running the place. She wanted Marcus\u2019s house, and she wanted Aaron in charge, and she wanted a raise. After that, she wanted the two of them to play house forever and ever. But then, when everything seemed to be coming together once Marcus was dead, it looked like the Horse Farm was going to survive! And Aaron was a jerk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Sandra just let you kill him?\u201d</p><p>Mariah sighed. \u201cSandra might have been a bad choice as a helper\u2014although she should\u2019ve been good. She can be such a bitch, but she\u2019s really a total coward. And dumb! She actually thought what happened at the stream was an accident! I set up the image of the general so I could get all excited and create a diversion before Aaron was found. She didn\u2019t help me. She didn\u2019t even know. I didn\u2019t count on the ripped-up pieces of that cow being all over\u2014they really did make me scream. And it meant I could leave the picture behind, which made everything that much more convincing.\u201d</p><p>Olivia stared at her. It was almost impossible to fathom the complexity of a deranged mind. The old clich\u00e9 about method in madness occurred to her. \u201cWhat...what about the darts?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow did you come up with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, I have to tell you\u2014the dart thing is just great. I make those little suckers myself. I add the tiny feathers and then they fly like a damn. They fall out at the slightest movement, which is another plus, and the concoction I put together is pretty impressive. You\u2019d have to be looking for specific poisons to even hope to find them at autopsy. I learned all that from Drew and Sydney, by the way. They know how to mix stuff up because Marcus insisted they had to be prepared for animal emergencies at all times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood to hear you\u2019re such a wonderful student,\u201d Olivia told her. \u201cSo, Sandra didn\u2019t know you were going to kill Aaron\u2014but she gave you the key to his place, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Mariah didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t give you the key, did she? You took it and had a copy made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did that months ago,\u201d Mariah said proudly.</p><p>\u201cSo, Sandra\u2019s really innocent?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Sandra innocent? Give me a break. She\u2019s totally conniving. She knew what I was going to do to Marcus. In fact, she told me that if I wanted to make it look like someone else was involved, I should take his horse\u2014or hers. Depending on who I wanted to implicate.\u201d She giggled. \u201cI would\u2019ve taken Shiloh, but you were riding him that day. As far as Sandra\u2019s concerned\u2014well, if this bit her in the butt, she deserved it.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia reined in and turned around. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Mariah smiled at her. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want from you\u2014before you die, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see the general.\u201d</p><p>Olivia gaped at her.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve seen him. I should have that. And you can give it to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMariah, I\u2019m trying to stay alive here, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts were people, Mariah. They remain the real essence of the person they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpiritual crap, Olivia. Keep at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts don\u2019t just appear on command!\u201d Olivia felt the gun against her waist. There had to be a chance for her to use it. Maybe now...</p><p>By the time she drew it out, she\u2019d be dead.</p><p>\u201cKeep moving and quit stalling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you know it\u2019s all over? That someone will come searching for the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they do, we\u2019ll go out together,\u201d Mariah promised her sweetly. She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re always telling the kids to do their best\u2014to reach for what they want and work hard to achieve it. I\u2019m just listening to you, Olivia. So, keep moving. We\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>They rode again and came to the point in the copse where they had to dismount so they could walk the trail to the cemetery.</p><p>\u201cDo you think the general\u2019s going to hang around his grave?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better hope,\u201d Mariah muttered. \u201cNow, get down.\u201d</p><p>Olivia dismounted. Mariah waved the gun she was carrying.</p><p>\u201cMove.\u201d</p><p>Olivia followed the trail to the small cemetery where General Rufus Cunningham\u2019s mortal remains lay buried. It was still daylight, but the surrounding trees shaded them from the sun.</p><p>The cemetery, situated in the shadow of the forest, was touched by traces of sunlight. It was difficult to tell if anyone had used the trail leading to the cemetery in the past hour or so. Although there were a few signs of recent use, he couldn\u2019t be sure. Still, as they neared the small collection of graves, Dustin became convinced that he was right\u2014and that Jimmy Callahan had been right, as well.</p><p>He reined in before they came to the clearing in the woods. Behind him, Malachi and Abby stopped, too.</p><p>He slid down from Chapparal and walked back to Malachi. \u201cThere are some broken branches here that seem fresh. I think they dismounted a short distance ahead and walked to the cemetery. There\u2019s really only one main trail. I\u2019m going to crawl through some of the trees and bushes to approach from the other side.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cIf I get a clean shot at Mariah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it,\u201d Malachi told him. \u201cI intend to do the same. Abby and I will tether the horses and come up along the old trail.\u201d</p><p>Dustin tried to move as quietly as possible\u2014and as quickly as possible.</p><p>He thought of the different situations he\u2019d faced in his life.</p><p>This was just one woman.</p><p>One crazy-ass woman with a gun\u2014a gun she was pointing at Olivia.</p><p>He paused, stepping on bracken and expecting to hear the crack of a branch. But he heard nothing. Until, moving forward, he heard voices.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, I\u2019m from this land\u2014don\u2019t you get it? This land right here. You\u2019re from the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t you get it, Mariah? It\u2019s all connected. The city needs the country, the country needs the city. Look, if you want to see the general...you have to be open to him. And he has to be in the area.\u201d</p><p>Malachi finally came up on the cemetery. He hid behind one of the trees that grew around the little area, as if they were nature\u2019s homage to the dead.</p><p>They were at the general\u2019s grave site.</p><p>Mariah had Olivia by the arm. Her gun was wedged into Olivia\u2019s side. He could take a shot; he could kill her easily. But there was no guarantee she\u2019d go down before she pulled her own trigger.</p><p>Mariah suddenly swung Olivia around. Dustin could see that she was sweating, agitated. The hand that held the gun against Olivia was jerky. The trigger might be pulled easily.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Mariah demanded.</p><p>They were looking right at his position, right at where he stood. Dustin straightened his cavalry jacket and pulled the plumed hat he wore lower over his forehead.</p><p>\u201cMariah,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI told you\u2014I\u2019ve tried to explain. Ghosts don\u2019t appear on command. They exist, and if you\u2019re just open to them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent my life being open to the general!\u201d Mariah shouted. \u201cHe\u2019s part of me, part of my soul, my existence! You\u2019ve got ten seconds, Olivia\u2014ten seconds!\u201d</p><p>Olivia suddenly spun around, jerking something out from under her shirt. She fumbled with it; Mariah, thrown from her, fired.</p><p>Thankfully, the shot went wild.</p><p>Olivia fired, too. The recoil sent her falling back and she tripped, crashing into a tombstone, the gun flying from her grasp. Mariah stumbled to her feet and half walked, half crawled over to Olivia, rising with the gun aimed directly at her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Mariah!\u201d Dustin said in a hollow voice, stepping from the trees.</p><p>Tension knotted in him fiercely; he was no actor.</p><p>\u201cMiss Mariah!\u201d</p><p>Mariah turned and looked at him. For a moment, she stared at him in awe. Then she smiled and slowly raised her gun. \u201cYou\u2019re not a ghost!\u201d she said. \u201cBut good try, Agent Blake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not alone, Mariah. If you fire that gun, you\u2019re going to go down in a hail of bullets.\u201d</p><p>She aimed at Olivia again. \u201cShe goes with me,\u201d Mariah said.</p><p>Dustin felt something touch him\u2014or almost touch him. He closed his eyes, praying that the real general had come. A man seemed to rise from mist and take shape before him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the general. It was Marcus Danby.</p><p>\u201cI am a ghost, Mariah. I\u2019m a ghost because you killed me. And because you tried to ruin the good that honest, caring people were doing. You won\u2019t join me, Mariah, when you die. I\u2019m not sure what lies beyond this\u2014where I am now\u2014but I know you won\u2019t be there. I can feel sun and light\u2014and all you can feel is darkness.\u201d</p><p>Mariah\u2019s gun remained on Olivia. She frowned, as if trying to ascertain how they\u2019d created the illusion she was seeing.</p><p>Someone else stepped forward, entering into the green shadows of the little cemetery.</p><p>Aaron.</p><p>\u201cWe tried to get the general to come, Mariah,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t want to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit!\u201d Mariah cried. She turned to take aim at Olivia again.</p><p>Dustin moved as he\u2019d never moved before. He was out of the trees as if he were propelled by a sudden spark of fire. He caught Mariah in a tackle and brought her down, rolling with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was strong; they fought for the gun.</p><p>A shot went off and Mariah screamed in agony. Dustin tried to wrench her gun from her but it eluded them both and landed several feet away. But the woman had been shot\u2014and he realized that Olivia had recovered her own gun and managed to fire off a round.</p><p>Despite the fact that she was bleeding, Mariah strained to reach her weapon. Yet she suddenly went still and Dustin struggled with her weight, trying to move around her. And then he saw what she saw.</p> <p>The general had come. He stood with his foot on the gun.</p><p>\u201cNot on this land!\u201d he said. \u201cNot on this land. Cruelty and murder will not happen, not on my land.\u201d</p><p>Dustin inched forward; his fingers grasped the weapon and he threw Mariah off him. She huddled in a ball, sobbing.</p><p>Malachi burst into the cemetery with Abby at his side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d the general said.</p> <p>And he faded away. The ghost of Marcus Danby grinned and saluted Dustin, then faded, too.</p><p>Aaron, also, was gone. Malachi had rushed to his cousin\u2019s side, while Abby assessed Mariah\u2019s injuries.</p><p>Dustin turned quickly to reach Olivia. She was hugging Malachi, but she pulled away and smiled tremulously at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d make a horrible reenactor,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019m sorry. You, uh, need to learn how to shoot,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI guess I do.\u201d</p> <p>She was shaking, but she appeared to be all right. She didn\u2019t even seem traumatized. \u201cThe others?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAmbulances came pretty quickly to the Horse Farm. Sloan and Jane were already up. You managed to get the darts out of them?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She nodded. She started to take a step, but she wasn\u2019t walking very well. He stopped her, looked into her eyes and muttered, \u201cOh, the hell with it.\u201d</p><p>Then he swept her into his arms and headed out on the trail, leaving the shadows of the dead behind\u2014and Malachi and Abby to deal with Mariah.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Mariah Naughton proved to be full of surprises\u2014and her last surprise was especially dramatic.</p><p>She never reached a hospital, and she never explained her entire story. They had to piece together what they could from Jimmy Callahan, who\u2019d been dating Mariah, and from Sandra Cheever, who was willing to do anything to get the D.A. to deal with her as leniently as possible.</p><p>What happened in the end was because Mariah had no intention of leaving \u201cher\u201d land. She had used a gun on Olivia, but she\u2019d still had a supply of poisoned darts. Frank Vine arrived at the cemetery to arrest her, but before he could cuff her, she managed to use her poisons on herself\u2014in a greater dose than she\u2019d used on anyone else. Frank radioed for a helicopter; it came, but Mariah was pronounced dead on arrival.</p> <p>Olivia tried to feel something for her. She couldn\u2019t. She knew she should have sympathy for someone who\u2019d lived with such a disturbed, tormented mind. She worked constantly with people who had issues and problems; she understood the addict and triggers and...</p><p>One day, she thought, she\u2019d forgive Mariah. But it wouldn\u2019t be for a long time.</p><p>The Horse Farm was a shambles. Mariah had set out to destroy it and she\u2019d done an effective job. It would be hard to convince others of the good that had existed, now that Marcus, Aaron and Mariah were dead and Sandra Cheever was busy working out a plea bargain.</p><p>But on Wednesday morning, when she sat with the Krewe members and her Horse Farm team in the office, she was determined.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fired,\u201d Drew said dully. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Sydney said.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ll close our doors for about a week, but we\u2019re actually in a sound financial situation. Of course, we can\u2019t use our reserves forever or we\u2019ll be left with no choice but to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what will we do?\u201d Mason asked.</p><p>She pointed a finger at him. \u201cMason, you\u2019re gorgeous\u2014yes, we all know that and you could probably have a future as an actor or model. But you\u2019re also a good therapist. You\u2019ll be our new director.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re director,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be an absentee director,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou\u2019ll take over as acting director. Sydney and Drew, if you don\u2019t mind, you\u2019ll continue sharing responsibilities as stable managers and horse masters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Drew began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already spoken with Mrs. Lockwood\u2014Brent\u2019s mother. He\u2019s going to come back. Apparently he cries because he\u2019s afraid he won\u2019t be able to see us again. I spoke to Brent myself. He says he likes me best, but that\u2019s okay, he\u2019ll work with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, um, thanks,\u201d Mason said, still confused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve also spoken with Patty Sobles. Remember her? She\u2019s one of the local women we work with. Anyway, she\u2019s coming back. I\u2019ve been on the phone with the parents of the kids at Parsonage House. They\u2019ll give us another chance. As I said, we won\u2019t open our doors for a week. Aaron deserves a good funeral with all of us at it, and Mariah... Well, we have to see that she\u2019s buried, too. I don\u2019t think she had any family left\u2014maybe that\u2019s why the land meant so much to her. Mason, you\u2019re going to have to find a few more therapists. Oh, we\u2019re going to steal Ellie Villiers from Willis House to run the office. She was only part-time there and she\u2019s looking for full-time work. Mason, you\u2019ll move into Marcus\u2019s old house\u2014that\u2019ll save you from paying rent. I\u2019ll just have you guys check on my place now and then, make sure everything\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you will come back?\u201d Drew asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always come back,\u201d she replied. \u201cTennessee is my home. These hills are my home. We all have the right and even the responsibility to love the place that\u2019s our home, to love our heritage. Mariah just let it consume her. But, yes, I will come back as often as I can.\u201d</p><p>Sydney rose, rolling his hat in his hands as he did when he was a little nervous about what he was going to say. He looked at Dustin. \u201cYou treat her right, you understand? Your intentions had better be honorable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most honorable,\u201d Dustin promised him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I work with her cousin.\u201d</p><p>Sydney smiled and sat down again.</p><p>\u201cThis will work,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cThe Horse Farm will survive. We will survive\u2014all of us. Marcus Danby was an incredible man who did incredible things\u2014and the Horse Farm will continue to rescue animals and we\u2019ll continue to do our best to rescue people, as well. Just as Marcus always did.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as everyone in the room applauded. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Mason broke in. \u201cWhere will you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirginia,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to the FBI Academy and I\u2019ll take what I know in a different direction. But I\u2019ll just be a phone call away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mason said. \u201cYou\u2014you...you don\u2019t even like guns!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I never will. However, I\u2019ll learn how to use one,\u201d she told him.</p><p>The room was silent. Then Mason stood up and came over to hug her. \u201cI realize you do have other talents,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd we\u2019d be selfish if we didn\u2019t think you should use them.\u201d He cleared his throat and stepped back, looking at the other agents in the room. He nodded shrewdly. \u201cI read up on you people. And I know what your talents are. And... Well, I guess we have to let Olivia go.\u201d</p><p>Olivia hugged Mason again, and then Drew and Sydney. Abby announced that she had Delilah bringing over a feast\u2014and that today they\u2019d celebrate the lives of Marcus Danby and Aaron Bentley and all they\u2019d tried to do for others.</p><p>It was a nice afternoon. Olivia caught Dustin\u2019s eye across the room; he and Sloan had been talking horses, since she intended to bring Shiloh and Chapparal to Virginia, and Sloan had the land and the stables to house them until she and Dustin could make other arrangements.</p><p>Sammy ran around the room woofing happily.</p><p>There were so many people there to pet him and make a fuss over him. But Sammy, too, would be moving.</p><p>Malachi and the others had to get back the next day, but Olivia needed to stay behind to deal with various legal matters.</p><p>Dustin stayed with her.</p><p>And so, a week later, the day before the horse trailers were ready and before she let Mason take over, Olivia and Dustin rode out to the campground. The weather was growing a little brisk, but they still played in the stream and made love beneath the moon.</p><p>When they rode back, they stopped at the cemetery where the general was buried. There was a fresh bullet hole gouging his tombstone, and Dustin looked at it regretfully.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll mind,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cProbably not. Do you think he\u2019s still here? What about Marcus and Aaron?\u201d Dustin asked her.</p><p>\u201cI think Marcus and Aaron have moved on,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it over the past few days. They did a lot of good while they were alive. All right, so Aaron wasn\u2019t terribly bright in his choice of love interest, but he was a decent guy. He didn\u2019t kill himself and we proved that. He and Marcus can both move on and I hope there is a heaven. They deserve to reach it.\u201d</p><p>Dustin gnawed on a piece of grass and smiled, gazing up at the beautiful green overhang. \u201cThe general deserves his piece of heaven, too, but...I think he sees these hills as his heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too,\u201d Olivia agreed. \u201cDo you believe in heaven?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms. \u201cEvery time I see your face,\u201d he said.</p><p>He kissed her.</p><p>And Olivia was certain that whatever spirits roamed the hills, dales and forests of Tennessee, they looked on and approved. </p> </body></html>"]
