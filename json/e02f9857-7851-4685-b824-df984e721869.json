They stood at the foot of the stage, surrounded by empty seats. That kiss was still burned onto his lips. He couldn\u2019t step away from Mari. His eyes locked with hers, never blinking, never straying from her intense gaze. The moment felt so fragile that Trystan was afraid to breathe. Everything he ever wanted was standing in front of him, looking up in shock.</p><p>Mari\u2019s body shivered in his arms when he told her that she was the reason he wrote that song. Swallowing hard, Trystan breathed, \u201cThe girl who brought me to my knees, was you.\u201d Taking a breath to steady his voice, Trystan lowered his gaze and looked back up at her. \u201cThat song meant everything to me. It was as close as I thought I\u2019d get to you. I\u2019ve made too many mistakes, too many times. And then, like an idiot, I flaunted them in front of you.\u201d A smile lifted the corners of his lips as he allowed a curl to fall from his fingers. \u201cMari, I don\u2019t know what made you do it. I realize that you wanted someone for one night, but that isn\u2019t what I\u2019m looking for anymore.\u201d His lips curved like he was trying to form a word that wouldn\u2019t come.</p> <p>Mari shivered, unable to hold her body still. When she finally spoke, he could barely hear her, \u201cYou love me?\u201d</p><p>It was a question that he wanted to answer every hour of every day, but when she asked, when her lips parted and those words tumbled out, Trystan felt a pang of panic pierce his middle. She wanted a plaything. She doesn\u2019t want you that way, he thought. It felt like fingers were pressing into his throat and cutting off the air. The way Mari looked at him\u2014it was too much.</p><p>There was a slight tremor building in his hands. To hide it, Trystan slipped his fingers off her face and into his pockets. Looking at her through the pieces of dark hair that hung over Trystan\u2019s eyes, he said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s more than that. God, Mari.\u201d He sucked in air, and ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to say, and I have no idea how to say it. I wrote it down, because otherwise all those words, all those feelings, stayed trapped inside of me, in here,\u201d his fist banged on his chest as he lifted his gaze and met hers. Stepping toward Mari, he confessed, \u201cI love you. Everything I am, everything I hope to be, is better when I\u2019m with you. I don\u2019t know...\u201d Trystan was breathing hard, like he\u2019d been running from something terrifying.</p><p>Mari watched him, her beautiful brown eyes impossibly wide, with her lips parted in shock. As he stumbled over his words, lacking the normal Trystan Scott confidence, Mari stepped toward him and took his hand in hers. Brow pinching together, she looked up at him, asking, \u201cWhy are you trembling?\u201d</p><p>Trystan worked his jaw, freeing the thought that was stuck in his throat, \u201cLove destroys, I believe that\u2014but I\u2019m hopelessly in love with you.\u201d His head tilted to the side as he said it, his blue eyes so soft and vulnerable. \u201cWhat am I\u2014\u201d he started to ask, but she cut him off.</p> <p>Heart pounding wildly, he couldn\u2019t stand it. In that moment, Mari didn\u2019t say much. She just stood there shell shocked after he said he loved her, but Trystan had to tell her. She had to know. There was no way he could let her think, after all this time, that he was in love with someone else. But when he said he loved her, she didn\u2019t say it back. The center of his chest felt hollow, like a carved out pumpkin. He couldn\u2019t breathe. His mind was telling Trystan to make a joke and run\u2014do what he always did\u2014but he couldn\u2019t, not now, not with Mari.</p><p>The corner of Mari\u2019s mouth curved up. She held his hands tighter and pulled them to her chest, \u201cDo you feel that? My heart\u2019s pounding in my chest like it\u2019s going to explode. You do that to me. You make me crazy. You make me better. You make everything better. You\u2019re the brightest part of my day and you always have been. I don\u2019t want a fling, Scott,\u201d he recoiled when she said his last name, but Mari pulled him closer, not releasing his hands, \u201cI asked you that question last night, because I couldn\u2019t stand seeing you every day and sitting next to the guy that stole my heart, and act like everything\u2019s okay. When Tucker said you were enlisting\u2014\u201d she let out a rush of air, eyes wide, locked on his face, and continued, \u201cI couldn\u2019t lose you. Not without even trying. How could you think I didn\u2019t love you?\u201d</p><p>Trystan listened to her speak. His mind was trying to pull out of the conversation before his heart was blasted to bits and splattered across the auditorium walls. Mari could destroy him. One word and his life would never be the same, but as she spoke he couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>When she asked that question, Trystan finally met her gaze. \u201cYou love me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Mari nodded, smiling up at him, \u201cI love you, Trystan Scott, every bit of you; past, present, and future.\u201d A grin twisted her pink lips. Mari looked at him out of the corner of her eye, \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not like I can turn it off. If that were possible, we wouldn\u2019t have had that kiss.\u201d</p><p>Trystan laughed softly. The sound filled his chest, making him feel whole. Leaning toward Mari, he used every drop of boyish charm he had, \u201cI really liked that kiss.\u201d</p> <p>Mari\u2019s cheeks flushed as she smiled, and she quickly tried to look at the floor, but Trystan didn\u2019t let her. Instead, he reached for her face and tilted her chin up. Smiling, he took in every inch of her red face and instantly wanted to cover her in kisses, \u201cAnd I suppose you didn\u2019t like it as much?\u201d</p><p>Mari smiled broader. \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to do it again and find out... see for yourself.\u201d She looked up at him through her lashes, her cheeks growing hotter in his hands.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Trystan asked, a soft smile spreading across his lips.</p><p>She nodded, \u201cVery much, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Mari glanced up at Trystan. He pulled her closer and lowered his face, inching slowly toward hers. Mari\u2019s head tilted to the side and he was kissing her again. Her arms wrapped around his chest and she held on tight. Trystan\u2019s palms stroked her cheek as he pulled her lips to his. She tasted like strawberries and sunshine. He couldn\u2019t get enough, he\u2019d never get enough of Mari.</p><p>The bell rang and shocked them apart. Trystan stepped back, his gaze filled with mirth and his lips twisted into a perfectly boyish smile. He crossed his ankles, and bounced on the balls of his feet for a second, drinking her in like this was a dream. \u201cI have more things I\u2019d like to discuss with you, beautiful kiss ninja, but I have to get to class. I can\u2019t miss another or I won\u2019t graduate, because believe me\u2014if that weren\u2019t the case\u2014I\u2019d stay here with you.\u201d</p><p>Mari looked at him, still beaming, \u201cGo on, I understand.\u201d Trystan nodded at her, and grabbed his books. He was half way up the aisle when she blurted out, \u201cWait! Trystan,\u201d</p><p>When he stopped and turned back, he saw concern on her face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Awh, screw it. I can stay.\u201d He threw his books on a chair and walked back down the aisle. Mari met him halfway and laughed.</p><p>Grabbing his books, Mari shoved them into his hands, and said, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t. Besides, I just wanted to ask you if we can keep this a secret, for now. I\u2019m not really supposed to date. If my Dad finds out, well, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it...\u201d</p> <p>Trystan fought back the urge to reach out and run his fingers through her soft curls again\u2014to be that close to Mari, and to be able to touch her...</p><p>Trystan felt like he could fly. There was nothing that could bring him down. Leaning toward her, he touched his forehead to hers lightly, \u201cMy lips are sealed. I won\u2019t tell a soul.\u201d He smiled at her again, beaming with excitement. Pulling away from her was torture. He shouldn\u2019t have gotten so close again. Tearing himself away from Mari was the last thing he wanted to do, but Trystan couldn\u2019t miss another class.</p><p>As it was, he was on thin ice. Tucker saved his ass earlier and he knew it. Who would have thought that today would go this way? Trystan didn\u2019t. Grinning at her, he sucked in a deep breath, letting it fill his chest before turning away.</p><p>\u201cBetter get going,\u201d he said, his voice a little too high, almost like he was laughing. When did it become so hard to hide how he felt around Mari?</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>~MARI~</p><p>\u201cYeah, you better go.\u201d My voice was soft. It was everything I could do to keep it from shaking. Trystan Scott loves me. He said it. He wrote a freaking song about it. A song that went viral. A song everyone knew. My heart lurched in my chest as he pulled away from me and turned to walk up the aisle.</p><p>He looked over his shoulder at me, those brilliant blue eyes gleaming. \u201cThe view\u2019s good coming and going, I hear.\u201d</p><p>At that point, the smile on my face increased to mega-wattage. I glanced down at the floor and back up at him, feeling the blush spreading across my face. Looking up at him from under my lashes, I nodded once and said, \u201cOnly you would say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you would pretend you weren\u2019t looking.\u201d Trystan walked backwards up the aisle, one sneaker squeaking as he clutched his books tightly to his chest. The way he looked at me made everything else melt away. I didn\u2019t remember where I was or what I had to do next. The only thing that mattered in that moment was Trystan. He was like a beautiful black hole, and he absorbed every piece of me.</p><p>I teased, \u201cI\u2019ll make a note to ogle you more openly next time.\u201d</p><p>He held out his arms, his books extended away from his body and balanced on the top of his palm. \u201cWhy wait?\u201d Trystan was standing right in front of the door. I could hear kids moving through the halls, heading to their next class. Trystan turned in a circle slowly, keeping his gaze on me the whole time.</p><p>I laughed. Closing my eyes slowly, I opened my mouth, not knowing what to say. I wanted to look at him. I wanted him to see me do it. I don\u2019t know why, but the moment felt charged. Every spot on my skin was hypersensitive, and when his eyes passed over me, I flushed harder. I\u2019ve never blushed so much in my life.</p><p>Breathing raggedly, I folded my arms over my chest to try and hide it. \u201cVery pretty,\u201d came out when I finally spoke.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s arms fell to his sides, and his books slapped against his leg. He ran back down the aisle to me asking, \u201cPretty? Seriously?\u201d His brows disappeared under his hairline, as his soft lips hung opened waiting for me to respond.</p><p>I grabbed his shoulders and twisted him around, pushing back up the aisle, shoving him toward the door. \u201cYou\u2019re such a drama queen. Get to class already!\u201d Trystan allowed me to push him up the aisle. I could see the laugher in his eyes as he looked over his shoulder at me. When we were standing before the door, he dug in his heels and turned suddenly, which resulted in me smacking into his chest. It would have been sexy if I didn\u2019t have that just-walked-into-a-pole expression on my face.</p><p>Trystan wrapped his arms around me for half a second, and whispered in my ear, \u201cThere are so many words to describe you. I plan on telling you all of them later.\u201d He pulled back and kissed my temple before releasing me. His eyes met mine and held. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNeither can I,\u201d I replied softly. We stood a step apart, not touching, just gazing at each other. The bell rang again, but he didn\u2019t move. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d there was no more laughter in his voice. Those radiant eyes bore into me, cutting past every defense mechanism I had. That gaze stripped me, causing me to feel everything at once, making me realize exactly how much Trystan affected me. My heart pounded harder in my chest, as a shiver worked its way down my spine.</p><p>After a second, I knew why he didn\u2019t want to leave. This felt surreal, like everything would vanish like smoke in the wind when he left. I didn\u2019t want to say it, but it was the only way to vanish the fear. \u201cEverything will still be the same after class. Go. I don\u2019t want you to get in trouble because of me.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Trystan turned and put his hand on the door. He looked back at me, like he was going to say something else, but he turned and pushed through the door instead. I watched the door slowly close, until I couldn\u2019t see Trystan anymore.</p> <p>When he was gone, I sucked in a sharp breath of air. It felt like I didn\u2019t breathe the entire time he was here. The tension flowed out of my body, and I threw myself into the nearest chair. The theater was dark, save for the safety lights spilling off the stage.</p><p>I sat there, alone, in the darkness wondering what just happened. Staring at the empty stage, I felt like my life just took a turn. It was one of those moments that mattered, where I could feel it and I knew this incident was important. This wasn\u2019t a fling. No, it was more than that. Trystan loved me. Somehow, we finally came together.</p><p>Maybe living like a lunatic wasn\u2019t a bad idea. I would have never done anything like that a year ago. Crossing a room and throwing my lips on a guy seemed like something someone else would do, but I did it\u2014and it worked out. It made my life better, it dramatically changed everything.</p><p>I stared at the spot where we stood, where Trystan told me that I was the girl in the Day Jones song. My gaze fell to the floor. A scrap of white poked out from under the chair. Rising slowly, I walked toward that piece of paper like it was my destiny. Those words were Trystan\u2019s heart poured onto paper. There was no mask, nothing hiding any part of him. That was what drew me to the song in the first place.</p><p>Reaching down, I picked up the paper and held it in my hands. The entire song covered the front and back of the page. Trystan\u2019s familiar handwriting lined the margins, along with codas and breath marks mingled amongst the lyrics.</p> <p>Grasping the page in my hands, I looked down at the last line. Mari. My name was there, written in thick dark lines. Pressing my eyes closed, I shuddered and pressed the page to my heart. I was the girl who brought Trystan Scott to his knees. I was the girl he fell in love with.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>The rest of the day passed sluggishly. The clock seemed to tic slower, like it was stuck in tar. Trystan leaned back in his seat after taking a verbal beating for being late, like it mattered. He was out of there in a few months. These last few weeks were fluff, filled with busy work. Trystan hated busy work. It was a waste of time. He\u2019d rather have a test than do another bunch of worksheets and endless essays.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s mind drifted back to Mari, the way her lips felt against his. Trystan got that far off look in his eye and totally missed that someone was talking to him.</p><p>\u201cMr. Scott, will you please share with the class your thoughts on the matter.\u201d The teacher was already beyond irritated with him today.</p> <p>Trystan straightened in his seat like he was going to answer, but after a moment, he smiled sheepishly and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Ms. D\u2019Miagmo, but I don\u2019t know.\u201d There were a few sniggers from the girls behind him, but Trystan ignored them. He also ignored Brie. Her gaze was burning a hole into the side of his face.</p><p>\u201cMr. Scott, please take this class seriously or I will ask you to leave. You must have an opinion on the matter, and since opinions aren\u2019t right or wrong, I want to hear yours.\u201d She arched a gray eyebrow at him and folded her arms over her chest. The woman could have been a schoolmarm. She just needed a wooden ruler and permission to beat kids over the head with it.</p><p>Trystan smiled at her, but knew it was pointless to try and get any sympathy. D\u2019Miagmo had it in for him. There were some teachers that decided on day one that they didn\u2019t like him. He had no idea why, but there was always one teacher who thought he had an easy life and needed to be taught a lesson. Ms. D\u2019Miagmo was that teacher.</p><p>Trystan opened his mouth, but Brie cut him off, \u201cMs. D\u2019Miagmo, I think it\u2019s obvious that Trystan feels uncomfortable answering this question because of his religion. Isn\u2019t it against school policy to discuss faith issues in the classroom anyway?\u201d She flipped her golden hair over her shoulder and blinked her big blue eyes at the teacher.</p><p>Ms. D\u2019Miagmo sucked in air through her nose like a horse. Now Brie was in the line of fire. \u201cBrie dear, and what religion does Trystan practice that he can\u2019t discuss this matter?\u201d</p><p>Brie looked up from her nail like she was thinking about getting a manicure. \u201cHe\u2019s a conservative Baptist,\u201d she said with utter certainty, and then added, \u201cand everyone else here is Catholic or Jewish so it\u2019s not right to press him on this. Faith issues aren\u2019t open for debate in public school.\u201d</p><p>The teacher arched an eyebrow at Trystan. \u201cSo let me get this straight? You can\u2019t discuss women\u2019s rights because it makes you uncomfortable... because of your religion?\u201d</p><p>Trystan smiled once like he was uncomfortable and nodded, \u201cYes, I don\u2019t want a pack of rabid women to attack me in the hallway because you forced my conservative beliefs out of me.\u201d</p> <p>D\u2019Miagmo looked like she might cry... or scream. She looked down her nose at Trystan, not breathing or blinking. Trystan couldn\u2019t tell if she was having an aneurism, and had never been so glad to hear the bell ring. Trystan knew not to stay another second. Scooping up his books, he bolted for the door, but Brie was right behind him. Trystan pushed his way into the crowded halls.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I get a thank you?\u201d Brie said, chasing him down the hall.</p><p>Trystan wove through the crowd, stopping at his locker. He didn\u2019t look at Brie. Gripping the lock, Trystan spun the dial, and opened the metal door. \u201cWhat for? You made me look like a sexist jerk. Some crazy chick is going peg me with a stiletto in the parking lot later, you know.\u201d He tossed in his books and slammed the door shut.</p><p>Brie grabbed Trystan\u2019s arm, and twisted him toward her. \u201cNah, a woman likes to be owned sometimes. If you were handing out...\u201d her voice trailed off.</p><p>At that moment, Seth rounded the corner. Trystan\u2019s shoulders tensed at the sight of him. Brie stopped talking and turned around to see what made Trystan respond that way. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Her gaze followed Seth, noticing an equally tense look from Trystan\u2019s best friend.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Trystan said after Seth passed. They both glared at each other like old enemies. It made Trystan\u2019s guts twist. Why couldn\u2019t Seth be happy for him? Why\u2019d he have to hate Mari so much?</p><p>Brie muttered, \u201cCould have fooled me.\u201d When Trystan didn\u2019t respond, Brie stepped in front of him. \u201cWell, I just wanted to say that rehearsal yesterday was fun. I\u2019m looking forward to it later.\u201d She wrapped her lips around each word, saying them with such a sexy voice that Trystan forgot to glare after Seth.</p><p>Instead his head snapped back toward Brie, eyes wide. \u201cWhat?\u201d he tried to step away from her, but Brie had other plans.</p><p>She lifted her hands and draped them over his shoulders, playing with the hair at the base of his neck. \u201cI know that kiss yesterday was real, and it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m willing to pretend that we\u2019re not into each other, but I know the truth.\u201d</p><p>Trystan shook her off. \u201cWhat are you talking about? That was acting and nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Brie\u2019s ruby lips pulled into a smile that said she disagreed. \u201cI know what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t, and I\u2019m saying it\u2019s okay. We don\u2019t have to let anyone know.\u201d She winked at him before turning on her heel, \u201cIt\u2019ll be our little secret. See you later.\u201d</p><p>With that she was sauntering away from him, her hips swaying as she walked. The bell rang and several guys just stood there, staring at Brie\u2019s ass as she walked down the hall. Trystan stepped back and leaned against the row of lockers, slamming his head against them. She thought it was real; she thought that kiss was hers. Crap. Brie had the potential to make nothing look like a whole lot of something. Trystan took a deep breath and decided to deal with the fallout when it came. There was no point in trying to figure out what move Brie was going to make next. He\u2019d have to wait and deal with it then.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>~MARI~</p><p>Trystan lay in my arms on the old couch. It was the last period of the day. We both managed to sneak away and meet in the basement before practice. The stage above was empty. I touched Trystan\u2019s hair lightly, pulling my fingers back, over and over again. His hair felt like silk.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d he said sounding a little sedate. Trystan seemed like he was running on fumes lately, like he hadn\u2019t slept well in weeks.</p><p>I smiled softly at him, touching my hand to his cheek. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me, and a playful smile twisted his lips. \u201cWhat could you possibly want to know? I\u2019ve told you about every stupid thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d He laughed, \u201cAnd for some reason, you love me anyway.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the word was new. Mari wanted to say love as freely, but it stuck in her throat. Give it time, she reminded herself. This is all new. \u201cYes, I do. And I always will. I\u2019m good like that.\u201d My fingers stilled as I looked straight ahead.</p><p>Trystan felt the tension and took my hand in his. Stroking my palm with his thumb he said, \u201cAsk me anything. I\u2019m yours Mari.\u201d</p><p>Heart beating rapidly, I looked down at him. It wasn\u2019t something that I wanted to ask him, but it had to be done. \u201cTrystan, I\u2019m so glad today went the way it did. I mean, I couldn\u2019t have dreamed something like this would ever happen, but I\u2019m not sure my friends or family will understand\u2014or approve. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me, and it\u2019s selfish. I can\u2019t tell them about us. Not yet.\u201d My tongue felt like cotton as it crashed into my teeth, making my words sound harsher than I\u2019d intended.</p><p>Trystan lifted his hand and ran his fingers gently along my cheek, making my stomach flip. \u201cAnything you want. If you don\u2019t want to tell anyone, don\u2019t. I told you already and I meant it. We can keep this a secret, Mari. That\u2019s fine with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>Trystan laughed. Looking into her eyes, he said, \u201cMad? How could I possibly be mad? My dream girl is holding me in her lap, she steals kisses, and she\u2019s so beautiful that I can barely breathe when I\u2019m around her. This is a dream for me, Mari. I\u2019ll do anything to be around you, to let me love you.\u201d As he spoke, his fingers tangled in my hair and he pulled me down for a brief kiss.</p><p>Everything about him made me feel like I could fly. My stomach lifted inside of me as my heart raced faster. His kiss was so soft and so hot at the same time. He pulled away before I was done, leaving me wanting more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trystan looked up at me. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret until you say otherwise. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded about to say something else when the door above us scraped open. Trystan jumped up and shot across the room. Trystan slumped back in the tattered old chair he frequented and dangled a leg over the arm like he\u2019d been there all along. The click of female shoes descended the stairs and I knew it was her before Brie rounded the corner.</p><p>\u201cHey losers,\u201d she said, grinning at Trystan. Brie glanced at me once, her gaze sliding over my outfit like she thought I was a fashion nightmare. \u201cCutting? Really Trystan, and this close to graduation?\u201d She folded her slender arms across her ample chest, \u201cAnd you kept the thing with you.\u201d</p><p>Have I mentioned that I hated Brie? Bristling, I retorted, \u201cNice to see you too, granny panties.\u201d</p> <p>Trystan snorted a surprised laugh. Brie glared like she wanted to kill me with her eyeballs. If she was a robot, Chinese stars would have flown out of her pupils and sliced my head off. \u201cDon\u2019t you have somewhere to be, you little leech? Nobody wants you here. They just pity you, and humor Tucker, so they can graduate.\u201d She glanced at Trystan, but his expression remained impassive. I wondered if he wanted to punch Brie in the face. The thought made my fist clench. I didn\u2019t notice until my nails bit into my palm.</p><p>Trystan glanced at me for a second. His eyes were light, but the set of his lips let me know he was seething underneath. I shook my head carefully, so Brie wouldn\u2019t see. If he defended me now, everyone would know about us. I had to keep a secret. If my parents found out, I was toast. They\u2019d lock me in my room for eternity.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s brow lifted ever so slightly as he regarded Brie. \u201cIf you\u2019re planning on starting a cat fight, let me run and get a few of the guys.\u201d He grinned wickedly at her and leaned forward like he was serious.</p><p>Brie\u2019s face contorted and she laughed one short burst, \u201cAs if I\u2019d waste my time pounding Mary. Get real.\u201d</p><p>Before I could say anything else, Trystan cut me off, \u201cThen why are you down here?\u201d</p> <p>Her ruby lips pulled up into a seductive smile, \u201cI already told you. The bell\u2019s about to ring and I thought that we could practice the second act, alone, before everyone got here.\u201d Her voice dripped with sexuality, as she walked toward him.</p><p>I\u2019m sure flames erupted from my ears, but my lips were locked. My fists balled harder, my nails cutting through my palm.</p><p>Trystan grinned at her, and tilted his head to the side as if he were admiring her. That was going to take getting used to. If no one knew we were dating, every single girl in the school would still be throwing themselves at him. If they knew he was dating someone, the normal girls would back off.</p><p>Brie wasn\u2019t normal. She was a no-holds barred kind of girl and wanted what she wanted. What I didn\u2019t understand was why she was hitting on Trystan like this. I mean, she has a boyfriend.</p><p>When Trystan answered, his voice was playful. \u201cThanks, but I already practiced it with Mari.\u201d He jumped out of his seat and stretched his hands over his head, which caused his dark tee shirt to hike up and reveal his flat stomach. It felt like I fell down a mine shaft, my heart jumped up into my throat as I hyperventilated. I stared. I couldn\u2019t help it. Trystan was hot and he was mine. As the thought drifted across my mind, a smile drifted across my face.</p><p>Trystan said, \u201cMeet you upstairs,\u201d and walked away from Brie. He winked at me as he passed, his sapphire eyes glittering.</p> <p>Brie stood there with her hands on her hips, watching him take the stairs two at a time. When she turned back to me, her smile turned rancid. \u201cYou need to stay the hell away from him, bitch. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>The butterflies that were fluttering in my stomach moments ago were blasted away by Brie\u2019s words. While Brie was rank, she\u2019d never confronted me like that before. I tried to act like she didn\u2019t bother me. Still slouching back into the couch with my feet kicked up onto the coffee table, I asked, \u201cOr what? Or Tucker won\u2019t pass Trystan. I bet he\u2019d be real grateful if you arranged that for him.\u201d</p><p>Brie stood in front of the table with her hands on her hips before her boot crashed into the cheap wood. It jarred my legs from the table top, jolting me upright on the couch. \u201cYou listen to me and listen good. You\u2019ve been getting in my way, and don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed, because I have. Whatever you think you have going on,\u201d she waved her finger in a circle, indicating all of me, \u201cisn\u2019t working out for me. So stop, or you\u2019ll find yourself somewhere you don\u2019t want to be.\u201d Her eyebrows lifted as she cocked her head, making her earrings sway along with her golden hair.</p><p>Sitting on the edge of the couch, I gaped at her. Was she serious? Brie ruined people, but it was through rumors and carefully making their lives miserable. What could she do to me? At the same time, this didn\u2019t sound like that kind of threat. I wanted to stand up and punch her in the face. Everything she did, everything from the way she acted like she owned the school to the way she assumed she could claim Trystan whenever she wanted, pissed me off. Something inside my brain snapped. That fist that I\u2019d been holding launched from my lap and pulled me to my feet, as it made a beeline for Brie\u2019s perfect nose. When my fist and her nose collided there was a crunch followed by a deafening shriek.</p><p>Brie\u2019s hands flew to her face as she screamed, \u201cYou heinous bitch!\u201d Before Brie could do anything else, she turned and fled, running up the metal stairs as fast as her high-heeled shoes would carry her.</p><p>I stared at my fist in horror and pressed my eyes closed. I sat back down on the couch and leaned forward, burying my face in my hands. What have I done? As if I wasn\u2019t in for it before, Brie will kill me now. I\u2019d be a smudge on the sidewalk by this time tomorrow. I punched her. I cracked her nose.</p><p>Noise filled the stairwell overhead and multiple pairs of shoes descended in rapid thumps like they were running. Katie\u2019s voice rang out, \u201cI leave you alone for two periods and you punch Brie in the face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d I said, almost apologetically, looking up surprised to see her. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>Katie laughed, \u201cWhat am I doing here? Saving your ass. Brie was ranting at the top her lungs to Tucker. I was passing by and heard her say your name, so I stuck my head in. He\u2019s coming. Sound sorry. And next time you break Brie\u2019s nose, I better be there to see. We could have had this up on YouTube. With that shriek, it would have gone viral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, don\u2019t say that.\u201d Panic was setting in. It wasn\u2019t until then that I noticed the owner of the second set of feet.</p><p>Mr. Tucker stood behind Katie with his arms folded across his chest. Neither of us realized he was standing there. Katie turned slowly, like the girl about to get killed in a horror movie.</p><p>Tucker breathed, \u201cGet out.\u201d Katie nodded like a dashboard dog and ran up the stairs without looking back. Before I could explain, Tucker said, \u201cYou too, get out. I don\u2019t want to see you on set again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Tucker, let me explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain what? That we\u2019re days away from a show and you broke my lead\u2019s nose. And for what? Because she was mean to you? Ah, I\u2019ve got some news for you, Mari\u2014get over it! You take everything to heart. You always have. Brie\u2019s Brie. She\u2019s got thorns around other girls, I know. I see it, but you don\u2019t see anyone else punching her in the face, do you?\u201d He sighed deeply, his face returning to a normal color and shook his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you kids today? It must be a full moon. Scott attacks his best friend and now you. You, out of all people, picked today to throw a punch.\u201d He breathed deeply as he looked down, his fingers pinching his nose.</p><p>\u201cMr. Tucker...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it. Just go, Mari.\u201d</p><p>It never fails. When something totally awesome happens, something equally bad blindsides me.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>Practice was weird. Trystan stood on the stage as the completed set was being erected around him. The stage crew raised the flats one by one, installed doors, and touched up some of the paint. Now it looked like a real room, filled with furniture and picture frames. As the stage crew did their thing, the guy in the lighting cage was muttering to himself. His voice carried to where Trystan stood a few feet away. The house lights were flashing on and off instead of dimming. The lighting cage was nearly fifty years old and due for an upgrade, but with the school budget the way it was, they\u2019d never get one. Whenever a budget vote came up, people showed up in drones to vote it down. It didn\u2019t matter what was on the ballot. The roof could be caving in and the town would still vote against it.</p><p>Trystan kept thinking about Mari. A smile leaked across his face. He couldn\u2019t help it. That kiss. And the way she felt laying in his arms. For a small moment, his life felt perfect. Happiness was always something just out of reach for Trystan. Whenever it came along, it was swiftly yanked away. This time, Trystan would make sure he didn\u2019t mess up. Mari mattered too much to him. Everything about her made him better, made him think he had a chance. Trystan wouldn\u2019t be another statistic.</p><p>Waiting in front of the lighting cage, Trystan stood with his hands in his pockets wondering where Brie went. When Brie finally surfaced from the basement, she ran straight into the girl\u2019s bathroom at the back of the stage. Trystan turned to watch Brie flee with her hand over her nose. His heart sank when Tucker followed a few moments later, pointing one of his chubby fingers at the stage door. Katie and Mari left without looking back. Shit. What\u2019d Brie do now?</p><p>Practice took too long. It was close to opening night. Brie acted hysterical. Tucker forced Brie on stage with her nose bandaged and an ice pack taped to her face, which severely screwed with her head. Brie couldn\u2019t get a line out without stumbling or messing up. Tucker didn\u2019t bother to try the second act. They skipped over that part like it didn\u2019t exist, which was fine by Trystan.</p><p>After practice, Trystan grabbed his books from his locker and looked around for Mari, but the school was deserted. He walked past the diner on the way home, hoping to find her inside, but she wasn\u2019t there. Sighing, Trystan pushed his dark hair out of his eyes. The wind blew harshly, flipping his hair over his head and into his eyes again. Trystan tightened his jacket, wishing he had something warmer to wear. The leather was nearly worn away in places, giving the frigid air a way to leak in.</p><p>It\u2019d been a long day and it felt good to finally be out of the school. Trystan just wished he\u2019d seen Mari before the end of the night. Curiosity was part of it, and Trystan wondered how Mari waked away without a scratch and Brie had a bloody nose. Hurrying, Trystan pushed on toward his house, crossing the train tracks, and walking quickly to his front door.</p><p>When Trystan walked into his house, he came face to face with his father. The old man\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. There was a piece of paper in his left hand. Dad was left handed, just like Trystan. God, they were too much alike, Trystan thought as he walked through the threshold and closed the door behind him. He ignored his father\u2019s eyes on his back as he went to the kitchen looking for something that would pass for dinner. Trystan was always hungry lately and there was never enough to eat. Placing his books on the table seemed to be what set his dad off. Suddenly he was yelling like Trystan did something horrible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dad stood behind him, his voice was sharp enough to cut glass. \u201cYou think you\u2019re too good for us. That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with you, you know. Always walking around like you own the place.\u201d Dad slurred his words slightly, telling Trystan that tonight was going to suck.</p><p>Standing with the fridge door open, Trystan froze. It took a moment to recognize that the scrap of paper in his father\u2019s fingers was a picture. When Trystan did, his heart dropped into his shoes. Trystan grabbed whatever food was left, which wasn\u2019t much. He took a few slices of bread and the peanut butter he\u2019d gotten from Sam\u2019s deli and made a sandwich as fast as he could.</p><p>His father droned on and no matter how hard Trystan tried, he couldn\u2019t drown out the words. \u201cYou\u2019re the reason she left. This,\u201d he said, pointing to everything, \u201cis your fault. Me and my whole fucking life got reduced to this because of you, and you stand there like you\u2019re so damn proud.\u201d</p><p>Trystan couldn\u2019t help it. He knew that he shouldn\u2019t speak, but he did. His jaw was tense, the words fell out of his mouth before he could stop. \u201cMaybe she left because of me, but you did this to yourself. Things didn\u2019t have to go this way, Dad. You did this. Not me.\u201d</p> <p>Before Trystan could blink his father was across the room and screaming in his face. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t try! You think I fucking chose this?\u201d Dad bellowed and spit went flying, sticking to Trystan\u2019s cheek. His father laughed with such rage that Trystan stepped away. When Dad spoke again, his voice was low and menacing, \u201cThat\u2019s right, boy. Blame me. You did nothing.\u201d The old man\u2019s rank breath lingered in Trystan\u2019s nostrils, but his dad finally stepped away.</p><p>Trystan went to pass by his father, but was clotheslined. His father raised his arm at the last second, trapping Trystan, before grabbing Trystan\u2019s hair with his other hand, and yanking his son back to his chest. The picture of Trystan\u2019s mother was clutched under his father\u2019s thumb. Thrusting it in Trystan\u2019s face, Dad made him look. When Trystan tried to wiggle free or look away, his father only tightened his grip and forced him harder. \u201cLook! Look at her! Look at those eyes, and how they seem so steadfast, like they\u2019d never leave. You destroyed everything!\u201d He shoved Trystan toward the hall that lead back to Trystan\u2019s room. \u201cGet out of my face. I can\u2019t stand to look at you!\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s chest felt like it was ripped open with a rusty nail. Every muscle in his body was tense, ready to fight, trying so hard to hold back. Trystan\u2019s jaw locked tight to keep from speaking, but the one thing he wanted to avoid the most was that picture and he\u2019d already seen it. Stumbling back to his room, Trystan pushed through the door. His mind screamed, protesting that he should fight back, but something held his rage in check. Taking purposeful breaths, Trystan walked down the short hall, trying to steel himself, trying to make his heart go numb before it shattered into a million pieces.</p><p>When Trystan swung his door open, he meant to lock it and throw himself on his bed, but there was no lock, no bed. The walls were barren. The nightstand was gone. His closet door was open and the only thing inside were shadows. Trystan stood there, his hands shaking slightly, as he realized that his father threw out all of his stuff. Trystan felt his dad behind him but he didn\u2019t turn around. Rage flooded Trystan\u2019s body, making him want to act out, but he refused.</p><p>A hand shoved hard between Trystan\u2019s shoulder blades. Trystan didn\u2019t expect it and fell into the room. \u201cMaybe this will teach you that you\u2019re no better than the rest of us.\u201d Before Trystan could turn around his father yanked the door shut. It wasn\u2019t until then that Trystan realized that the doorknob was turned around. The sound of metal sliding against metal alerted him to the lock closing.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Trystan screamed and threw himself at the door, but it was too late. His fists beat the door, but it was solid, the kind of door that was used at the entry of a house. Trystan knew, because he put it there when he traded it out for the thin particleboard version that had originally been there, in order to keep his father out.</p><p>\u201cYou never learned your place, Trystan. I swear to God, I\u2019m going to teach it to you.\u201d The hallway fell silent.</p><p>Trystan felt the panic slide up his throat. The room was dark. The lights were gone and the fixture that hung from the ceiling had no bulb. Racing to the window, Trystan pushed it open, but the bars kept him from getting out. The cold air rushed in over his face. Trystan turned around and leaned his back against the wall, clutching his face in his hands. He slid down until his back was under the window, hoping that his father would see reason in the light of day, but there was no way to know. Dad had done stuff like this before, when Trystan was little and couldn\u2019t fight back. He\u2019d lock Trystan away for hours, sometimes days. When it seemed like Trystan would die of thirst, the man finally showed his face and let him out. Trystan tried to be good after that, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter what he did or didn\u2019t do\u2014he was never good enough.</p><p>Tucker\u2019s words rang through Trystan\u2019s ears like a gong, ebbing and pulsing. Someone told you wrong. You\u2019re worth something.</p><p>Lowering his head to his knees, Trystan fixated on the words, but they couldn\u2019t penetrate his heart. Tucker\u2019s words couldn\u2019t strip away years of being told he was the reason for his father\u2019s grief. Trystan\u2019s chest felt hollow and he let the numbness overtake him.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p> <p>~MARI~</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d Daddy screamed. He\u2019d been pacing in my room since he got that phone call from Brie\u2019s father.</p><p>There was nothing I could say that would calm him down, but that didn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t try. \u201cWhat was I supposed to do? She threatened me!\u201d Tears streaked my face. I couldn\u2019t help it. I cried when I was angry.</p><p>Daddy turned on me, roaring, \u201cWhat were you supposed to do? Get the teacher! Not punch the girl in the face. Her father is threatening to press charges. Do you know what that means? Do you have any idea? We could lose everything because of you!\u201d</p><p>Sucking a ragged breath, I screamed, \u201cThere was no teacher, there was no help! Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have hit her, but why can\u2019t you even act like you care about me? You didn\u2019t even ask me what she did! You just assumed that everything was my fault!\u201d I trembled with my hands balled into fists at my sides.</p><p>If there was ever a wrong thing to say, that was it. Daddy blew up. His eyes widened, before he started screaming in a blind rage. The verbal assault went on, but I couldn\u2019t process what he was saying, not when he looked so livid. I backed away from him, but he kept coming at me like he\u2019d hit me. My heart pounded in my chest like I was running away from an axe murderer.</p><p>Things weren\u2019t supposed to be like this. Daddy was supposed to defend me. He was supposed to protect me, but instead, he looked like he was going to kill me. After what seemed like forever, my Mom came in. It seemed to calm Daddy down enough to realize that his hands were shaking, lifting toward me like he was going to do something. Dropping his hands, Daddy shook his head fiercely and walked away from me. He shoved past my mother and left the room, leaving a wake of anguish behind.</p><p>All the fright that had built up in my body exited my mouth in loud sob that sounded more like a scream. My mother stood there, staring at me with disgust. \u201cYou brought this on yourself, Mari. Clean up and go to bed.\u201d She turned away and left without another word.</p> <p>After they left, I heard them arguing in the kitchen. The conversation was about lawyers and settlements. They seem to think that Brie\u2019s father had his sights set on their money. I wanted to scream and jump up and down in front of them. Since when does money matter more than people? I didn\u2019t realize I was so disposable. My entire life, I thought they\u2019d stand up for me, but they didn\u2019t. The only thing they cared about was protecting their money and their precious careers.</p><p>I plucked my phone from my backpack, knowing it was insane to try and use it, but I wanted to talk to Trystan. I needed him. He\u2019d understand, but I didn\u2019t have any way to contact him. I sat on my bed sniffling as I stared at the phone. I didn\u2019t want to talk to Katie. She\u2019d tell me to suck it up, that this was part of having the perfect family\u2014so what if they flipped out once every sixteen years? She didn\u2019t understand. Her family fought all the time, but this wasn\u2019t a fight. This was something else. It showed me where my place was in this family, and I didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>The next morning my eyes were puffy. When I sat at the table my mother said nothing, handing me my breakfast like everything was normal. \u201cYour father and I are on for the next four days. I made your dinners for each night. Come straight home after practice and eat. I\u2019ll check on you when I get home.\u201d She poured a glass of orange juice, smiling like a saint.</p><p>I nodded, not wanting to talk about it. It was fine by me if they worked seven days a week. I did my best to eat my breakfast, but I wasn\u2019t hungry. I just wanted to get out of there and go to school. When I cleared my half-eaten plate, my mother said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so dramatic, Mari. I know you\u2019re upset, but you still have to eat.\u201d</p><p>I just looked at her. I couldn\u2019t think of what to say to make her fathom how betrayed I felt. She dropped me off at school without another word. As soon as she pulled away, I felt better. Four days on my own would help. They\u2019d come home from work in time to drop me off at school. We\u2019d barely see each other.</p><p>After going to my locker, I looked around for Trystan. He usually haunted this hallway before first period, but I didn\u2019t see him. I went to class, listening to the teacher droning on. I didn\u2019t get a chance to look for Trystan again until our free period. When I walked into the auditorium I heard Tucker speaking softly and rapidly to Trystan, \u201c...is not okay. You can\u2019t skip class like this and then expect to walk at graduation in June. If there\u2019s something you need to tell me, some reason for your tardiness, tell me. You don\u2019t have to fight the whole damn world by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Trystan used a tone that said he was finished talking about it. When Trystan turned around, I saw an angry red gash marring his cheek.</p><p>The smile I had on my face faltered and slipped away. Tucker looked at me and then back at Trystan. When I was closer, Tucker said, \u201cTalk some sense into him,\u201d as he jabbed his thumb at Trystan.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked, not understanding.</p><p>Tucker sighed, \u201cAsk him how he got that cut on his face and make sure he had a tetanus shot. He won\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s shoulders tensed as he looked after Tucker, who was walking away, \u201cThat\u2019s because there\u2019s nothing to tell.\u201d Tucker walked through the door and left us standing in the aisle alone. The empty seats surrounded us on all sides, the stage lights dim and glowing golden. When Trystan looked back at me, his expression softened, but the slant of his mouth said he still thought he needed to defend himself, and I didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>Before he could speak, I said, \u201cI only want to ask you one thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d the corners of his mouth tightened again. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you hold me?\u201d Tears welled up in my eyes and streaked down my cheeks. Trystan instantly became the man I knew, and forgot about his worries. Stepping forward, I walked into his arms, and he held me tight.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p> <p>When sunlight poured into Trystan\u2019s room earlier that morning, he tried the door. Still locked. Glancing out the window, Trystan saw that his dad\u2019s car was gone. Shit. Trystan stretched, his back aching from sleeping on the hard floor. His dick of a dad turned the heat off so that he was freezing, too. Although it was cold, Trystan refused to close the window last night. It was better than being trapped in the darkness. It was a good thing Trystan didn\u2019t take off his jacket when he walked through the door.</p><p>Running his hands through his hair, Trystan looked at the door. He knelt in front of it wondering what time it was, if he was late for school yet. The teacher\u2019s would ride his ass, threatening to not let him graduate. Some tried to threaten him by saying he couldn\u2019t walk at graduation\u2014like that was a threat. He didn\u2019t care if he walked or not. It\u2019s not like anyone would show up and clap for him. No one cared what happened to Trystan Scott. While the other kids got pats on the back and ushered off to college, Trystan got a psychotic parent who blamed him for everything.</p><p>Trystan stared at the lock, wishing he could remember his mother\u2014at least a little bit\u2014but there was nothing. No voice, no sense of safety, no warm memories of his mother cradling him in her arms or kissing him good-night. It wasn\u2019t something that he usually dwelt on. That was the past. There was nothing Trystan could do to change it. She left. No amount of wondering would bring her back, and Trystan had no plans of looking for her either. What was the point of chasing someone who left him behind? Trystan had had enough misery from the time she left. The thought of finding her and having his mom turn her back on him again was just too much. It wasn\u2019t worth the risk. Not now, not ever.</p><p>Staring at the golden lock, Trystan realized his Dad changed the knob. Trystan could have picked the lock if it was the old one, but not this thing. Rising, Trystan stood back. He took a deep breath, braced himself, and kicked his boot into the door. The door shook, but it didn\u2019t give. Trystan kicked it again and again, trying to weaken the frame, so that it would crack and let him out, but the jam was too strong. Again, another of Trystan\u2019s ways to protect himself came back and bit him on the ass. After a few moments, he was huffing and the door gave no indication of opening. Trystan sat down on the floor hard, and banged his head back into the wall.</p><p>\u201cI have to get out here,\u201d he muttered to himself.</p> <p>He stared at the black bars that shuttered him in. They were solid. There was no way he could bend them or slip out between, they were too narrow. Pushing himself to his feet, Trystan walked across the room to the window. If he drew attention to himself, someone might call the cops, and Trystan learned early on that cops were bad. If they showed up, he\u2019d be in a worse situation than he was already in.</p><p>Trystan leaned on the windowsill and turned his head, making his cheek press into the cold bars. They were jagged with rust. The paint on the bars had blistered and peeled long ago. When Trystan pulled his face away, he felt the grime on his cheek and wiped it away. It left an orange smear on his fingers. Wonderful.</p><p>Trystan stared at the bars, wondering if he could manage to kick them. They were a little loose, like the mortar holding the bolts in place had grown weak. Trystan\u2019s hands clenched at his sides. Before he spent more time thinking about whether or not he\u2019d get into trouble, Trystan kicked. His boot came up and punched the side of the frame hard. To his surprise, his foot kept going. The bars went flying to the ground and bits of brick flew back into Trystan\u2019s face. One piece of shrapnel collided with his cheek, raking a deep cut as it flew by. Trystan swore, but he didn\u2019t have time to look at the cut. The window was the only way out. He was wearing the same clothes as yesterday, didn\u2019t get to shower, and now his face was covered in rust and blood.</p><p>Trystan swung his leg over the windowsill and jumped out. He landed next to a dead bush on the other side of the wall, and ran to grab the bars. Lifting them, Trystan wedged the rusty metal back in place. To his surprise, it held. The only problem now was making sure the school didn\u2019t throw him out when he got there and then he\u2019d have to deal with his dad later.</p><p>When Trystan walked into the high school, Tucker was in the lobby. Trystan stopped mid-step and swung around, ready to bolt, but Tucker grabbed him by the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou missed first period, Scott. What do you\u2014\u201d Tucker stopped speaking as Trystan whirled around. His chubby jaw slipped opened for a second, before taking a deep breath. \u201cWhat happened to your face? Is that rust?\u201d Tucker lifted his hand like he was going to touch Trystan, but stopped when Trystan flinched.</p> <p>Trystan didn\u2019t mean to wince, but so much had happened. He was overly tired and his body was reacting without thought. Shit. Shit. Shit. Trystan tried to laugh it off, by saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re suggesting that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Tucker cut him off, \u201cSave it, Scott. Nurse\u2019s office. Now.\u201d The smirk fell off Trystan\u2019s face. They walked down the hall in silence. Why did things have to be like this? Why was Tucker gunning for him? Trystan grew more defensive, which made his wit so sharp it stung. When he walked into the nurse\u2019s office, Tucker followed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter,\u201d Trystan said in a snarky tone, but Tucker ignored him.</p><p>\u201cGlenda,\u201d Tucker said as he crossed the room to the nurse\u2019s desk. \u201cThis one looks like he was hit in the face with a rusty bucket, but he won\u2019t say what happened. Can you take a look at it and clean him up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Glenda said, eyeing Trystan. She\u2019d always been kind to Trystan, but he didn\u2019t want people fussing over him. It just made things worse. She told Trystan to sit in the chair next to her desk. When he didn\u2019t move, Tucker gave his shoulder a shove.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d this happen?\u201d Glenda\u2019s voice was kind. She bent over and examined the cut, careful not to touch him.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s insides were twisting. Fear clung to his throat in thick clumps, making it difficult to swallow. They\u2019re going to find out. They have to know. Trying to muster his charm, Trystan said, \u201cI ran into a burning building and saved a few babies on the way to school. I must have stepped on a rake on the way in.\u201d</p><p>Glenda grinned at him, \u201cAlways a kidder,\u201d she leaned closer, her fingers pressing on Trystan\u2019s cheek. He forced himself to sit still even though it was sore. \u201cSo this is rust?\u201d Trystan nodded. Glenda stepped away and got a brown bottle and some cotton balls.</p> <p>She dabbed the cotton with the stuff in the bottle and then on his cheek. \u201cIt might sting a little,\u201d she said too late. Trystan didn\u2019t flinch this time. He sat rigid in the chair, staring straight ahead. As she patched Trystan up, she spoke about the weather and other things that nobody cares about.</p><p>At some point Tucker left, because he was alone with Glenda. That was when she said, \u201cDid someone do this to you? It looks like you were hit in the face with a shovel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d Trystan responded, his voice flat.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was a brick, then? Or something else that bruised your face? Trystan, when was the last time you had a tetanus shot?\u201d It didn\u2019t matter what she said after that. He didn\u2019t answer. Glenda was young enough to still be patient. When Trystan wouldn\u2019t answer, Glenda touched her hand to her forehead and said, \u201cI\u2019ll have to call your father and ask.\u201d</p><p>Trystan wanted to jump out of the chair and run from the room. Suddenly he was more cooperative. \u201cI don\u2019t need one. I\u2019m fine. And thanks for cleaning me up. You were always my favorite nurse.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were on her hips as she watched Trystan inch toward the door with a smile on his face. \u201cWait, I haven\u2019t bandaged that yet. When you smile, it\u2019s going to bleed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said over his shoulder, exiting the room. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll come back if it opens up again.\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s heart was pounding. His nerves were like brittle old wires, ready to snap. When he turned down the hallway, Tucker was standing against the wall, his massive arms folded across his chest. There was no way to get away from the teacher. Tucker insisted on talking. They\u2019d gone into the auditorium and Trystan found out that talking meant having Tucker question him for nearly the whole period and Trystan sitting there fuming, not saying much.</p><p>By the time Mari walked in, Trystan felt his sanity slipping away. Then, Tucker left and Mari had questions in her eyes. Trystan couldn\u2019t unwind. Watching his reflection in her eyes, Trystan saw a man that looked too much like his father. Trystan was ready to turn and leave her there if she pressed him for answers, but she didn\u2019t. Instead, she asked him to hold her and tears streaked down her cheeks. All the anger and fatigue melted away as Mari pressed her wet face against Trystan\u2019s chest.</p><p>His arms closed around her shoulders, holding her tight, wanting to fix whatever made her like this. Trystan ran his fingers through her soft curls, pushing it away from her tears, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Mari\u2019s body shook gently. When she looked up at him, he wanted to make her smile so badly. Tears didn\u2019t belong on that perfect face. Trystan\u2019s thumb wiped a tear away as it spilled from her eye and ran down her face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just had a really bad night.\u201d</p><p>Trystan pulled her close and held on tight. \u201cI know what you mean. Mine was less than stellar, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have called you, but I didn\u2019t know what your number was. Either way, my parents probably would have gone postal on me if they knew I was talking to you.\u201d She sniffled, trying to smile. Trystan felt Mari\u2019s back rise and fall as she sucked in huge, ragged breaths.</p><p>After a moment, Trystan suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s go downstairs for a little while. I\u2019ll hold you all you want and we don\u2019t have to worry about anyone walking in and seeing us together. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>The pulled apart and Mari looked up at him, nodding. When they got to the basement, Trystan flipped on the lights and they descended the stairs. No one was down there. No one was ever down in the basement during the school day.</p><p>Trystan sat on the couch and pulled Mari onto his lap. She fit perfectly, like she was made for him. When Mari leaned back into his shoulder, Trystan felt whole. The emotions that flooded him earlier were gone and he found himself wanting to confide in her.</p><p>Trystan squeezed his arms, which were wrapped around Mari\u2019s waist. She slipped her arms around him and held on harder with her face buried in his chest. Trystan could smell her hair. The mingled fruit scents filled his nose.</p><p>When Mari pulled back, Trystan asked, \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot really. I finally stopped crying and there\u2019s only twenty minutes or so until the period is over. I\u2019d rather just sit here like this. You make me feel so much better, I can\u2019t even tell you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trystan kissed her temple softly, pulling away slowly, like it pained him. \u201cYou make me feel better, too.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. It wasn\u2019t full wattage, but it was a start. After a second Mari said, \u201cI\u2019ve been banished from the theatre after school.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI heard. You punched Brie in the face.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help it, a smile spread across his lips as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. It just happened. One minute she was threatening me and the next my fist was crushing her nose.\u201d Mari spoke quickly, like she couldn\u2019t believe she was telling him this. Panic laced her voice, but he didn\u2019t know why. It was a hit, and from what he knew of Brie, she deserved it. \u201cAnyway, Tucker banished me for the rest of the semester, so I won\u2019t be able to see you until after.\u201d</p> <p>Smiling, Trystan asked, \u201cYou want to see me after?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she said, \u201cYes. I was thinking about things\u2014about what I posted on your Day Jones wall\u2014and I\u2019ve decided something.\u201d Mari spoke slowly, her eyes drifted to the floor as she spoke.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s stomach felt like it was in a free fall. Was she saying what he thought she was saying? He tried to stay cool and act like he didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. \u201cWhat\u2019d you decide?\u201d</p><p>Mari was silent for a moment as she looked at the floor, with those long dark lashes blinking slowly. When she looked up at him, Trystan knew he\u2019d give her anything she wanted. Her brown gaze was intent, focused on his face, making Trystan\u2019s heart race faster. Suddenly, he was much more aware of her weight on his lap, the curve of her hips in his hands, and the way her chest swelled when she breathed.</p><p>Staring at her lips, he waited for her to say it.</p> <p>\u201cI want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s mind erupted with conflicting thoughts, both warring to win. But the thing that came out of his mouth was Mari\u2019s thoughts on the matter, not his, \u201cBut, you said you wanted to wait until you were married. I love you, Mari, but don\u2019t change things for me. That\u2019s part of who you are.\u201d</p><p>She looked into his eyes, pinning Trystan in place, making him want to squirm. \u201cI need you,\u201d she said so softly that he barely heard it. When he didn\u2019t answer, Mari rested her head on his shoulder and said, \u201cPlease, Trystan.\u201d</p><p>The please and the way she said his name made Trystan come undone. Before he could do something stupid, he kissed her cheek and slipped Mari off his lap. The look of horror on her face struck him like a bat.</p><p>Quickly, Trystan said, \u201cI can\u2019t say no to you. I\u2019ll do anything you want, be anything you need. I promise, but I\u2019m not doing it in the school basement. You deserve more than that and if you keep sitting on my lap and talking about having sex with me, we won\u2019t be talking about it anymore.\u201d Mari\u2019s face flushed and she looked away. Trystan put his fingers under her chin and pulled her gaze back toward him. \u201cI love that about you. I love how you can blush like that. Actually, I uh... wrote a song about it.\u201d Before he knew what happened, Trystan grabbed the guitar and was tuning it, talking about one of the songs he wrote for her.</p><p>\u201cYou wrote a song about me blushing?\u201d Mari asked, surprised.</p> <p>Trystan looked up from below his brow and smiled at her. \u201cSort of. It\u2019s about all the little things you do; the things that make me love you.\u201d</p><p>Placing his fingers on the strings to form the cord, Trystan began to strum. It was a song that was Mari to the core. It revealed more of Trystan\u2019s heart, but he didn\u2019t care. He wanted her to smile and he knew this would help. Trystan sang, watching Mari, as he slipped his hand across the neck of the instrument, allowing the notes to fill the air. As he played, her lips lifted into a smile and her brown eyes glittered just for him. Trystan couldn\u2019t help but smile back at her.</p><p>Everything about Mari was magic. She touched him like nothing else could, and honestly, the thought of having sex with her was equally appealing and terrifying. If a look from Mari could produce that much emotion, Trystan wondered what sex would do. If Mari had her way, Trystan was going to find out. The song ended and Trystan remained where he was, across from her on a stool.</p><p>Mari stood with a sweet smile on her face and walked slowly toward him, her hips swaying gently as she came closer. \u201cThat was so incredible. The way you see things is so pure, so intense, and so vulnerable at the same time.\u201d Stopping in front of him, Mari took the guitar from his hands, making Trystan\u2019s pulse pound harder in his ears.</p><p>He watched her, saying nothing as she set the guitar down and stood in front of him. A smile spread across Mari\u2019s lips. \u201cYou think blushing is sexy?\u201d She placed both hands on his thighs, splaying her fingers, leaning in close to his lips.</p><p>\u201cI think everything you do is sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she commanded, and he did.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s hands threaded in her hair and pulled her mouth down on his, tasting her sweet, hot kiss on his lips. Heart hammering in his chest, Trystan let the kiss grow stronger and hotter, tasting Mari when she opened her mouth, and stroking her tongue with his. They were both breathing hard when the bell rang and shattered the moment.</p> <p>Mari stood and stepped away, her hands shaking slightly. Grinning at him, she said, \u201cYou follow directions really good.\u201d</p><p>Trystan laughed. He stood and rushed toward her, snatching her up by her waist and spinning her around until she shrieked. When he set her down, Mari looked up at him smiling like everything was all right. After a second, Mari reached into her pocket and fished out a piece of paper and handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my address and my cell. Come by later, okay?\u201d Suddenly, she was shy again.</p><p>Trystan looked at the address, and confusion pinched his face. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want your parents to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t. They\u2019re working for the next four nights.\u201d</p><p>Trystan felt his heart speed up. The way she looked at him said she had plans for all four nights.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>~MARI~</p><p>After school, Katie sat with me at the diner. We ate a bunch of fried food and topped it off with ice cream. I was so nervous. I\u2019m not sure what person took over my brain and invited Trystan Scott into my bed, but she was gone now and I was left with moody Mari who fretted over everything.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you?\u201d Katie asked, dipping a fry in ice cream before popping it in her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out of sorts for days.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, \u201cPMS?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cYeah, right. More like boy-on-the-brain. Don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re still pining over Trystan.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head confidently. That wasn\u2019t a lie. I wasn\u2019t pining over him at all. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>I debated telling her what had me on edge. The question was could I tell her and omit names? I didn\u2019t know. And if Katie snooped, she\u2019d see it was Trystan coming to my house later. I decided to risk it. I needed someone to talk to about it and I sure wasn\u2019t asking my mom. \u201cYou know how I was going to wait to be with someone? Well, I changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>Katie\u2019s jaw dropped open and the ice cream slipped out. It splattered on the table in one big goopy slop. Neither of us said anything for a moment. As she wiped up the ice cream glob, she asked, \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought it\u2019d be romantic to wait for the guy who\u2019d marry me, but now that just seems corny.\u201d Corny was the wrong word. The real reason was that I felt so alone and I thought that sex would make it better. I wanted to feel wanted.</p><p>Katie stared at me like I\u2019d grown two heads. \u201cSomething\u2019s not right here, but I have no clue what it is. Who are you and what have you done with Mari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Katie. I wanted to talk to you about it.\u201d My voice was serious, pleading almost. I felt stupid for bringing it up.</p><p>Katie noticed and became serious. In a hushed voice she said, \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Having sex will bind you to that guy for the rest of your life. Be picky about who you\u2019re with. Honestly, I used to laugh at you, but when I see him,\u201d she couldn\u2019t stand to say her first boyfriend\u2019s name, \u201cnow, well, I think you had it right. I wish that I\u2019d waited for someone that I wanted to be attached to forever.\u201d</p><p>Katie\u2019s eyes darted away from mine as she spoke, as if she were ashamed of what she did. \u201cBut it felt right at the time, didn\u2019t it? How were you supposed to know he wasn\u2019t forever?\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed bitterly, \u201cI knew, Mari. He wasn\u2019t the one. I just didn\u2019t bother waiting. Maybe it was stupid, but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get another chance. Now I\u2019ve learned that there\u2019s always another chance, another guy willing to do it. They\u2019re not picky when it comes to sex, so I figure I have to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ll regret it?\u201d I asked, my voice nearly a whisper.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou sound disappointed. What did you think I would say? You see the way I avoid my ex. Whatever amount of fun I had wasn\u2019t worth worrying about getting knocked-up or contracting something gross. It probably sounds funny, but you rubbed off on me. I\u2019m waiting from now on. The guy has to prove he loves me and stick around for a while before he gets into my pants.\u201d Just then the waiter walked by and nearly tripped as he overheard Katie. She was blunt and gorgeous. Hearing her talk about sex made guys salivate.</p><p>My gaze fell to the table as I played with my napkin.</p><p>Katie asked, \u201cAre you going to tell me who he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>Trystan looked at the piece of paper in his hands. Theatre practice had dragged on, mainly because Brie refused to cooperate with her face looking the way it did, but it was finally over and he was on his way to see Mari. The streetlights cast a yellow glow on the pavement. The night air wasn\u2019t as frigid as last evening.</p><p>Trystan walked past Mari\u2019s house, not stopping in front. His heart raced faster, as his mind repeated the words she\u2019d said earlier. Lowering his gaze, Trystan shoved his hands in his pockets and walked on. Circling the block, Trystan came up behind Mari\u2019s house, cutting through the neighbor\u2019s backyard to remain out of sight.</p><p>Although Mari didn\u2019t ask him to sneak up to her house, Trystan was too smart to be seen. No one wanted him around their daughter and Mari\u2019s parents were probably worse. She was smart, like really smart. They probably wanted to send her off to some Ivy League school next year and he\u2019d never see her again.</p><p>Trystan sighed, pushing through the spot where the fences met. Neighbors might have looked cordial in this neighborhood, but they were cheap. That last inch of vinyl fence was an expense that no one wanted to pay, since it was covered by tall shrubs and trees. Trystan twisted sideways and sucked in to press himself between the gaps in the fence. No one saw him do it.</p><p>Within seconds, he was standing on Mari\u2019s back porch, looking up at the two story house, with his eyes fixated on the only bedroom with a light shining through the windows. Mari crossed the room, her hands stretched above her head, as she pulled her hair into a ponytail. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As if she sensed him, Mari stopped and turned toward the window. Slowly, she stepped to the sill and looked down. A smile slipped across her face. The window was already open and her curtains fluttered in the breeze.</p><p>Smiling down at him, she said, \u201cYou could have come to the front door.\u201d Mari had on a white cami and jeans. There was a patch of lace at the top of the cami, but the shirt was cut lower than anything she usually wore. It was the kind of tank top that Mari would have layered, but tonight she hadn\u2019t. Her arms were bare, her hair pulled up, and that smile on her face made Trystan want to climb up the side of the house to her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to risk being seen. You know, by nosy neighbors and all that.\u201d Trystan had his hands in his pockets. He might have looked suave on the outside, but his pulse was pounding in his ears and the paper with Mari\u2019s address on it was getting strangled in his pocket.</p><p>Mari leaned on the windowsill. Her breasts curved beautifully, swelling, as she leaned on her elbows. \u201cAre you sure this didn\u2019t have anything to do with, I don\u2019t know, being you?\u201d</p> <p>Trystan grinned. \u201cWhat does that mean? Being me is pretty good, but you\u2019ll have to be more specific.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. It was that magical sound he loved. It reached deep into Trystan and he didn\u2019t want it to end. \u201cThe Romeo and Juliet thing, this little seduction scene you\u2019ve got going on here. It\u2019s insanely romantic. If you showed up with your guitar and sang from below my window, I would have died.\u201d</p><p>Trystan snapped his fingers. His palms were so damp from nerves that they nearly slipped past each other without making a sound. \u201cDamn it. I knew I forgot something.\u201d</p><p>Mari smiled down at him before straightening up. \u201cI\u2019ll be down in a second. There\u2019s a door by the kitchen,\u201d she pointed the direction he needed to go, \u201cI\u2019ll come down and open it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was going to scale the wall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d she said, still laughing and disappeared from the window.</p><p>Trystan walked in the direction she pointed and came to a leaded glass door made from thick wood. His heart dropped into his shoes. Not only was she smarter than him, but she was way richer. He was poor. Suddenly a rush of cold ran through his stomach and he wanted to leave. This was a mistake. There was no way they\u2019d have enough in common, coming from such different backgrounds, but before Trystan could give it another thought, Mari threw open the door. She looked fantastic, her body all smooth curves and that bared neck was perfect for kissing. Trystan felt every inch of his body respond to her. If only his body listened to his brain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came,\u201d she said shyly, tucking a stray curl behind her ear. \u201cI started to think you weren\u2019t going to show up.\u201d</p><p>Trystan walked past her and into the kitchen, trying not to gape. The kitchen looked like something that belonged in a showroom somewhere. His fingers found his pockets again and hid out in there to conceal the nervous twitch of his hands. \u201cPractice ran late.\u201d Turning toward Mari, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have missed this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She held out her hand and Trystan reached for it, hoping she wouldn\u2019t mind how warm it was. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m glad you came. Not seeing you after school was weird. We\u2019re always together. Did you notice that before?\u201d</p><p>His eyes slipped over Mari\u2019s body and her face flamed red. \u201cOf course I noticed. I notice every inch of you, every day.\u201d He tugged her hand, pulling her into his arms. This was where she belonged. He could feel it. Smiling that wicked smile of his, Trystan said, \u201cFor the longest time, I thought you knew, and that you were just playing me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHa!\u201d she blurted out, and wrapped her hands around Trystan\u2019s waist. \u201cI was playing you? You made me so crazy that I couldn\u2019t think straight. I had no clue you thought of me that way at all, I mean, why would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Trystan asked, his hands tangling in her hair, as he tilted her face up to meet his gaze. \u201cYou have no idea what you do to me, how you make my heart hammer in my chest, until it feels like I can\u2019t breathe another breath, how one look from those dark eyes sets my skin burning, longing for your touch, or how your smile sets me on edge and fills my dreams until I see you again. I thought you were doing it on purpose, but then I realized that you didn\u2019t know\u2014that you were just being you and I was the one with the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was hopelessly in love with you.\u201d He ran his fingers through her hair as he spoke, brushing the back of his hand against her cheek. She looked up at him with such wide dark eyes, eyes that didn\u2019t trust what they saw. She was afraid he\u2019d hurt her, and Trystan felt exactly the same way.</p><p>After a moment, Mari looked down, breaking the intensity of the moment. \u201cCome this way. I want to show you something.\u201d Trystan followed her through the dark house, their fingers laced together. As they climbed the stairs, he knew where they were going, to her bedroom.</p><p>Stopping in front of the door, she turned to him. \u201cI thought we could hang out and talk for a while, if that\u2019s all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>Mari pushed the door open and a smile leaked across Trystan\u2019s face. She stepped into the room and turned to watch his reaction. He glanced around at the white moldings and thick trim around the door and window. There was a flat screen TV on one wall along with a stereo and iPod dock. A Kindle sat on her night stand, with a computer screen glowing softly on the desk next to her bed. The bed made Trystan pause. It was larger than his\u2014well, the one his dad threw away\u2014and was covered in a white and purple bedspread that had a cascade of ruffles on the skirt.</p> <p>Trystan turned back to her, an eyebrow rising on his face in surprise, \u201cRuffles? Really?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with ruffles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said grinning, \u201cit\u2019s just more girlie than I would have thought you\u2019d have. I thought you\u2019d be practical, a solid colored comforter kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it when I was twelve. Everything was purple, white, and unicorns. The bedspread was too expensive to toss, so the ruffle monster remains.\u201d Mari folded her arms over her chest as she spoke, like she was embarrassed a little bit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sweet. I can\u2019t picture you at twelve, wearing ruffles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never wore ruffles. My mom wouldn\u2019t let me. She said ruffles made me look fat.\u201d She shrugged like it didn\u2019t matter, but Trystan could tell it was more than that. There was a rift between Mari and her mom. He\u2019d heard it before, the way her voice sounded weary, like she\u2019d given up on her mom.</p><p>Trystan didn\u2019t comment. Instead he crossed the room to a board decorated with ribbons. In the center of the board was a piece of paper with familiar handwriting. Trystan pressed his finger on the page and turned to look back at her, \u201cDay Jones fan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it. He\u2019s dreamy.\u201d</p><p>Trystan grinned and looked down for a second before meeting her gaze, \u201cI thought I lost this. Some much happened that I didn\u2019t know where it went.\u201d It was the song he\u2019d writen for Mari.</p><p>\u201cI picked it up. If you want it back\u2014\u201d she reached past him to unpin it from the board, but Trystan took her hands and stopped her.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s yours. It\u2019s your song. I want you to keep it.\u201d</p><p>Mari looked at his hands and Trystan released her wrists. Mari walked across the room and sat on the bed, patting the spot next to her. Trystan felt like his body had frozen and turned to ice. For some reason, he couldn\u2019t move. It felt like he\u2019d shatter into a million pieces. It wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t done this before, but Mari made it different. Everything was intensified to the point he could barely breathe.</p><p>Sensing his apprehension, Mari said, \u201cCome sit with me. We can watch TV or talk.\u201d She meant, we don\u2019t have to have sex.</p><p>The pit of Trystan\u2019s stomach was in a free-fall. He breathed in deeply and ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve known you forever, but this is...\u201d he paused reaching for the right word, willing her to understand him, \u201cthis is too important. I don\u2019t want to mess it up.\u201d</p><p>Mari smiled at him and shook her head. Pushing off the bed, she crossed the room and grabbed Trystan by the wrist, \u201cTrystan Scott, I swear. If you act like this when I say I want to watch TV, what will you act like when I say I want to sleep with you? Come here and sit. You won\u2019t screw this up.\u201d She yanked his arm, pulling him to the spot in front of her bed. He watched her, thinking too many thoughts to speak, but Mari just smiled at him. Wrapping her arms around his waist, Mari suddenly sat down and pulled Trystan down with her. They fell to the floor with a thud.</p><p>Mari laughed when she hit the floor. Sensing Trystan\u2019s tension, she said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m still me. This is still us. Nothing\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s smile faded as he sat up. Looking at her eyes, he whispered, \u201cEverything has changed, for the better. Every time something finally goes right, something comes along and destroys it.\u201d</p><p>Mari leaned in and kissed his cheek, \u201cYou\u2019ll always have me, Trystan. No matter what happens, I promise my friendship is forever. Don\u2019t worry so much. Let\u2019s just spend time together the way we used to, but maybe you could kiss me once in a while, instead of torturing me with those sexy lips.\u201d A wicked grin spread across her pink lips.</p><p>The taste of strawberry lip gloss filled his mouth. Trystan was worried, but that was only because he cared about her so much. \u201cAnything you want, kiss ninja. But, you gotta realize that I\u2019m in uncharted waters here. I don\u2019t want to fall off the edge of the map.\u201d</p><p>Mari laughed, \u201cWhat, are you a pirate now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how much you like those puffy shirts, so yes. My eye patch arrives tomorrow. I ordered it directly from Davy Jones, so it\u2019s totally authentic. It\u2019ll be kind of soggy, but his customer service wench assured me that it\u2019ll dry out and have a nice sea brine coating.\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish talking, Mari\u2019s fingers found his waist and she started tickling him. Trystan managed to finish saying the snarky sea brine thing before retaliating. God, everything about Mari made him want to be with her. He was just so afraid of screwing it up.</p><p>No matter how much Trystan tried to worry, he couldn\u2019t with Mari\u2019s fingers wiggling against him. Every thought in his brain flew away as a massive tickle war ensued. Mari rolled across the floor, her smile and laughter intoxicating him further. She jumped to her feet a few times and Trystan jumped at her, knocking her back down and slipping his hands under the hem of her shirt. Her soft skin felt perfect. When Mari looked like she was about to cry, he\u2019d let her wiggle away, only to repeat the scenario again.</p><p>Holding Mari close and hearing her laughter made him so high. If Trystan could stay like that, with her forever, he would.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>~MARI~</p><p>The look in Trystan\u2019s eyes faded, as my fingers found flesh under his shirt and tickled. Trystan squirmed and wiggled, periodically laughing harder than I\u2019d ever heard him laugh. The tickle fight went on until I\u2019d rolled across the room twice. I had no idea how much time passed\u2014a few minutes maybe\u2014but when I looked at the clock it was past eleven. How\u2019d it get so late? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trystan reached for me, his fingers snatching at my waist and he pulled me closer. Positioning himself above me, Trystan held me in place, tickling me until tears leaked from the corners of my eyes, and I was screaming like a lunatic.</p><p>That\u2019s when I cheated. I totally lost. He had me pinned, but I couldn\u2019t stop looking at his lips. Trystan\u2019s mouth was so close and that smile was so sexy. I wanted to taste it. Trystan\u2019s grin dissolved when my lips pressed against his.</p><p>Without a word, the tickle fight was over and he was on top of me. Trystan\u2019s hands found my face and stroked my hair while his kisses grew hotter. Teasing me at first, Trystan\u2019s teeth gently nipped my lower lip like he was hesitant to do more. He lingered there, pressing small kisses to my mouth and gently nibbling my lip, teasing me until I couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><p>Heart racing, I slipped my hands under the bottom of his shirt and found his back. Trystan\u2019s skin was hot and smooth. Lifting my fingers, I held him closer, pulling him tighter against my chest. We were both breathing hard, like we\u2019d been running for miles. I was so hot, so lost. I needed him so much. Trystan had no idea, but I decided I wouldn\u2019t mention sex again, not after the way he acted before. I expected Trystan to be happy about it, but instead he seemed skittish.</p> <p>I lay in his arms and enjoyed Trystan\u2019s hot kisses and the sensation of his full lips pressing against mine. Heat seared through me, swirling in my stomach until my nails bit into his back. I didn\u2019t mean to. It just happened. That\u2019s when he finally kissed me. I mean, kissed me fully, deeply\u2014the way he felt he should. The kisses up until that point were like he was holding back. Passion surged through us and things got hotter. If I could have pulled Trystan closer, I would have. I couldn\u2019t get enough of him. Everything from his scent, to the way his skin felt beneath my fingers, to the way his muscles rippled beneath my touch made me want him more.</p><p>I was kissing Trystan Scott. No, it was more than that. He loved me and he was showing me what that meant, how he wanted to tease me with kisses until I lost my mind.</p><p>\u201cTrystan,\u201d I breathed his name. He broke the kiss and looked down at me breathing hard. We were both covered in a thin sheen of sweat. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Dazzling me with a pure smile, he said, \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>We stayed like that for a moment, both of us breathing hard, just staring at each other. The way Trystan\u2019s gaze moved between my eyes and my lips made me want to kiss him more. When his scorching look drifted lower, I knew I was toast. We had to do something else or I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop.</p> <p>As if he was reading my mind, Trystan sat up causing a blast of cold air to rush between us. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that I don\u2019t have the self-control I thought I did.\u201d Trystan gazed at the window with a sheepish look on his face. It was so sweet.</p><p>Laughing softly, I pushed myself up on my elbows and looked up at him. \u201cNeither do I.\u201d Scooting over behind him, I threw my arms around his shoulders and squeezed hard, hugging him from behind. Trystan nearly fell over, but I held him against me. After a second I released him, and Trystan turned around to look at me. I knew what he was thinking, that he should leave. It was insanely late. My parents would have killed me if I stayed out this late.</p><p>Before he could say anything, I asked, \u201cStay? Just a little longer? You have no idea how much better tonight is compared to last night.\u201d The smile slipped off my lips. I couldn\u2019t keep the bitterness out of my voice.</p><p>Trystan sat on the floor, his arm draped over his knee, with those sapphire eyes softly searching mine. Finally, he nodded, \u201cI can stay a while longer. I just want to be gone by the time your parents get home. I don\u2019t want to get you in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re working the seven to seven shift and they usually get breakfast before coming home, so unless you stay all night, there\u2019s no way you guys will run into each other.\u201d I looked at him for a moment, wondering why he wasn\u2019t antsy about missing his curfew, so I asked, \u201cWhat time do you have to be home?\u201d</p><p>Trystan smiled. It was the one that said he was going to evade the truth, but not quite lie. \u201cThere is no time. I don\u2019t have a curfew.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting across from him, I felt my head cock to the side like a confused Pomeranian. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSeriously.\u201d It felt like he was leaving something out, but he didn\u2019t say what and I didn\u2019t want to push him.</p><p>\u201cThen, stay here as late as you want. Oh, and since you don\u2019t have a cell phone, I want you to have this.\u201d I crossed the room and opened my closet door. Fishing out a box from the top shelf, I turned around and handed it to him.</p><p>Trystan had crossed the room and was standing behind me. He looked at the box and bristled a little. \u201cYou\u2019re giving me a phone? Mari, I can\u2019t take this.\u201d He tried to push it back into my hands, but I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. It\u2019s one of those cheap throw away phones. I bought it a few months ago because I lost the super-expensive phone my dad had gotten me. I bought that one and forwarded my calls to it until I found this phone.\u201d I pointed to my smart phone on my dresser. \u201cI can\u2019t use this one and no one has the number. I thought it\u2019d work good for us, you know, so I can hear your voice at night\u2014so you can get hold of me, if you need to.\u201d I felt fragile for some reason. I didn\u2019t want him to say no, but I could see it on his face. He didn\u2019t want it. After a second I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make you\u2014\u201d Pressing my eyes closed, I shook my head and snatched the box back from his hands. I turned to shove it into the closet, but Trystan\u2019s hands fell lightly on my shoulders.</p><p>His voice was level, but when he spoke there was an intensity there that I\u2019d never heard before, \u201cWhat happened last night? Did someone hurt you?\u201d</p><p>I turned toward him. Tears stung my eyes but they didn\u2019t fall. I shook my head. His eyes searched mine like they were trying to find the truth. I wanted to tell him, but I couldn\u2019t say it out loud. My parents don\u2019t care about me. I\u2019m alone. My throat tightened and I couldn\u2019t speak, even if I wanted to.</p><p>Trystan looked down at the box and took it out of my hands. \u201cI\u2019ll borrow it for a while. I want you to call me if something like that happens again.\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t help it. The tears flowed over my eyes and ran down my cheeks. I wrapped my arms around his neck and Trystan held me. I had no idea how much time passed, but when he stepped away I felt like everything might be okay, and it wasn\u2019t because he took the phone. That was symbolic. For some reason Trystan didn\u2019t want it, but he took it anyway to make me feel better. He put me first. No one did that for me before. I smiled and cried like a crazy person until Trystan\u2019s shoulder was soaked with tears.</p><p>Trystan kissed my temple softly and said, \u201cTell me what happened when you\u2019re ready. I\u2019ll always be here for you, Mari. And if anyone ever hurts you\u2014\u201d he left the threat hanging in the air. I nodded and pulled away.</p><p>I sat down on my bed and before I knew it, I was recanting what happened last night. Trystan stood for a while and then he finally sat next to me. By the time I finished, he had his arms around me. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d I sniffled. \u201cI\u2019m crying because I got yelled at. I sound like a brat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d He kissed my wet cheek and held my face between his palms. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not why you\u2019re crying. I know you, Mari. I know what this is about.\u201d He stroked my hair away from my face, and then I leaned into his shoulder, staring blankly ahead, not speaking. It was silent for a moment, until he whispered, \u201cWe\u2019re more alike than I thought.\u201d</p><p>Lifting my head, I asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Trystan didn\u2019t meet my gaze. Instead he looked down and stared the floor. \u201cOur fathers\u2014they seem to have unrealistic expectations. That\u2019s all. It\u2019s kind of paralyzing.\u201d I nodded, wondering what his father did to him. Trystan seemed so hard, so cynical at times. He constantly had a wall up that blocked everyone out, but somehow I snuck through. \u201cI was going to leave after graduation, but things kind of changed.\u201d</p><p>My heart beat faster as hope flooded through my veins. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to enlist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd leave you?\u201d he grinned. \u201cNah, I\u2019ll have to move onto plan B, which has something to do with staying here with you.\u201d</p><p>I threw my arms around him. Trystan embraced me and we stayed like that. I couldn\u2019t help the smile on my face. When he pulled back, I said excitedly, \u201cYou should go down the Day Jones path and see where it leads.\u201d Trystan didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cYour songs are powerful, they speak to people, and I\u2019ve seen you on stage\u2014you glow. People can\u2019t help but love you. You\u2019d be really good at it.\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s gaze cut to hers. His mood was a tad off, apprehensive maybe. \u201cYou really think you\u2019d want to share me with all those people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy here with you. You\u2019re all I need.\u201d Trystan\u2019s thumb rubbed the back of my hand. His eyes drifted to my lips and I knew he wanted to kiss me again. Trystan broke the gaze, like he was trying to control himself, and looked at the clock. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly 2:00am. You\u2019re going to be a zombie tomorrow. You should get to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Lethargy had been pulling on my body like giant sandbags. \u201cSo should you.\u201d</p><p>He looked down, and ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cYeah. I will.\u201d</p><p>Liar. What\u2019s with him tonight? I thought about it for a moment, what it could mean, and stumbled on the answer. \u201cYou don\u2019t sleep, do you?\u201d Trystan\u2019s blue eyes lifted to mine, nervous like I\u2019d wound him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Listen, you can stay here until dawn, if your dad won\u2019t mind. If you don\u2019t want to sleep, you can watch TV downstairs, eat something\u2014\u201d He was staring at me with his lips parted slightly. I couldn\u2019t read his expression. Trystan seemed to be caught between terror and surprise and I had no idea why. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Trystan smiled sadly and shook his head. That haunted look slipped away like it was never there. \u201cNothing. You\u2019re just amazing. I\u2019d like to stay longer, if that\u2019s okay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. Let me get ready for bed. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I dressed for bed, pulling on a pair of sleep shorts and a cami. I crawled into bed, and pulled up the blankets. Trystan sat at the foot of the bed and smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cWill you stay until I fall asleep?\u201d I blinked slowly, barely able to keep my eyes open.</p><p>\u201cSure, that\u2019d be nice. And then I\u2019ll sneak out so your parents don\u2019t skin me. I\u2019ll see you at school in the morning.\u201d He stood and sat down again, closer to me, leaning in to kiss my forehead. My eyes fluttered like they wanted to close. I didn\u2019t want the night to end. It was so perfect.</p><p>Trystan started to sing softly, as he stroked my cheek. The result was instant bliss. The sound of his voice washed over me, comforting me. There were few things in life that were certain, but I knew this was real. We were meant to be together. My breathing slowed as I snuggled into my blankets. Trystan\u2019s gentle touch and voice lulled me into a sleep coma. I didn\u2019t wake up until my alarm went off the next morning. The night passed, and when I looked, Trystan was gone. It was like a dream, a wonderful dream. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>Trystan pulled his jacket tighter and looked back at Mari\u2019s window one last time before darting between the houses. It was nearly 3:00am. His father should be passed out by now. It was possible his dad didn\u2019t even know Trystan was gone. The room looked the same from the outside, so unless his dad opened the door, there was no way to know Trystan wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Trystan didn\u2019t want to think about that right now. His heart was still enraptured by Mari. God, he loved her. Her scent was still on him. He inhaled deeply, basking in it. Mari\u2019s aroma made him lightheaded and giddy at the same time.</p> <p>A smile snaked across Trystan\u2019s lips as he continued down the deserted streets alone. Porch lights flared on houses that were more expensive than anything he\u2019d ever own. Glancing down the street, he caught the telltale silhouette of a cop car, and cut down a side street to avoid the police. A kid out alone, at 3:00am was looking for trouble. They\u2019d haul him back home and all hell would break lose.</p><p>Trystan walked faster. Shoving his hands in his pockets he felt the phone Mari gave him. He didn\u2019t want to take it from her. It felt like a lavish gift that Trystan didn\u2019t deserve, but when he saw her face, he knew that she needed him to have it. It wasn\u2019t about stuff. It was about Mari. Trystan felt the edges of the little phone and wondered if he\u2019d have to add minutes to it. He was totally broke, so unless it was prepaid for a while, that would create a problem. While Mari knew he didn\u2019t have a lot of money, no one realized how strapped Trystan was. He did everything he could to keep it hidden.</p><p>Arriving at the condo complex, Trystan walked past the group of older guys who were drunk. The night air was temperate so they were hanging out in front of their door, sitting on the front step like it was a patio. They tried to get Trystan to come over, but he\u2019d rather die than get hooked on alcohol. That damn stuff was what caused of all his problems. It wasn\u2019t that his mom left them; it was that his dad refused to pick up the pieces and move on.</p><p>Trystan stopped at his front door and debated whether or not to go through his window. After a second, he chanced the door. Trystan slid his key in the lock and the door creaked open. Glancing around, Trystan didn\u2019t see his father, but he could hear his insanely loud snoring carrying from the back of the apartment.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Trystan sighed and locked the door behind him. That sound was music to his ears. It meant nothing could wake the old man, so Trystan headed for the shower. When he finished, Trystan unlocked the door to his room and closed it quietly, locking himself inside. Lowering himself to the floor, Trystan slept against the door to make sure his father didn\u2019t try anything.</p> <p>The next morning Trystan awoke with the door slamming into his ribs. \u201cGet up, Trystan.\u201d The door pulled back and slammed into him again. Trystan shook the sleep from his eyes and sat up and braced his back against the door to keep his dad out, but the old man didn\u2019t try to come in. He was just in a foul mood. \u201cGo to school today, before they come looking for you. And I swear to God, if you ever do that again, I\u2019ll lock you in here and never come back.\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s jaw tightened as his father spoke. If Trystan didn\u2019t have to come back, he wouldn\u2019t. There was nothing here for him. His life was ahead of him, but he couldn\u2019t leave. Not yet. Trystan swallowed his pride and said what his father was waiting to hear, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Trystan said those words, his father\u2019s footfalls headed away from his room. A few moments later the front door opened and closed. He was gone. Trystan sighed in relief. Sitting on the floor, he pulled his knees into his chest and wrapped his arms around them. Lowering his head to his knees, Trystan sat in the quiet wondering what he should do. If the army was out, then he had to find somewhere else to live, and fast.</p><p>Trystan sat in the cafeteria looking out the window for Mari. He had an apple in his hand and was about to take a bite when Seth sat down hard across from him. Trystan stopped and scowled. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood, Seth.\u201d</p><p>Then, Seth did something very un-Seth-like and apologized. \u201cHe man, listen... I shouldn\u2019t have said that. I knew you wanted to hit that, but I thought she was just another chick.\u201d</p><p>Trystan rolled the apple in his palm, and lifted his gaze. He held his temper in check. Flatly, he replied, \u201cI told you she wasn\u2019t, so don\u2019t try to bullshit me now.\u201d</p> <p>Seth rolled his eyes, and slammed his hands on the table making the metal fittings underneath jingle. \u201cI\u2019m not bullshitting you. I\u2019m sorry, okay? I said it. If she means that much to you, I won\u2019t go there again.\u201d</p><p>Trystan wanted to tell him about Mari, about how things changed, but he couldn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t know how Seth would react and he\u2019d promised Mari he wouldn\u2019t. So Trystan nodded, \u201cFine. Enough of this crap. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s face lit up. He reached across the table and slapped Trystan\u2019s shoulder just as Mari got out of her Mom\u2019s car outside. Seth\u2019s gaze followed Trystan\u2019s and landed on Mari. \u201cYou want me to help you get her?\u201d</p><p>Trystan flinched. He turned back to Seth. \u201cThe answer to that would be, hell no. Don\u2019t even think about it. She\u2019s mine. I\u2019ll get her, eventually.\u201d Trystan\u2019s lips pulled into a grin. He already had her heart\u2014she loved him. It made Trystan wish he could shout from the tabletops and dance across the hallways, but he didn\u2019t. Trystan was careful to leave his poker face in place.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she? The only girl in the drama class that you haven\u2019t nailed?\u201d</p><p>Trystan stood and glanced at the doors. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Tucker walked through, and turned his face at the two of them. It was as if he was looking for Trystan. Tucker waved Trystan over and Seth followed. \u201cI need to speak with you, Scott. This weekend is the play and Brie refuses to go on with her nose the way it is. I told her we could cover it with stage make up, that no one would know, but she said she quit. Her parents pulled her out of the class. You have no co-star, Scott. Can you please go talk some sense into her? She listens to you.\u201d</p><p>Seth glanced at Trystan, but Trystan was still looking at Tucker. \u201cMaybe, but I have a better idea.\u201d A sly smile lined Trystan\u2019s lips. He cut his gaze to the cafeteria doors just as Mari walked by and flicked his chin up. \u201cHer.\u201d</p> <p>Tucker\u2019s face pinched. \u201cWhat? You can\u2019t be serious. Mari doesn\u2019t know all the\u2014\u201d Tucker stopped midsentence. His eyebrows shot up as a smile lifted the worry off his face. Looking back at Trystan, Tucker seemed amazed at the idea, \u201cShe knows all the lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Trystan nodded. \u201cAnd she\u2019s been practicing with me longer than Brie. Mari can do it.\u201d</p><p>Tucker glanced at the hallway, and watched Mari walk away. \u201cFine. Talk to her. You both get A\u2019s for this. That might not matter to you, but it does for her. She\u2019s the one that caused this issue in the first place by punching Brie in the face.\u201d</p><p>Seth laughed and jumped from one foot to the other like a happy monkey. He pressed his palms together, \u201cNo way! Girl fight and I missed it? Little goodie-two-shoes took a swing at the slut?\u201d</p><p>Tucker opened his mouth to say something and then snapped it shut again. He shook his head and walked away.</p><p>Seth turned to Trystan, \u201cSeriously? Your new conquest bitch-slapped your old girlfriend? Ha! I didn\u2019t think Mari had it in her.\u201d Suddenly Seth seemed more interested in Mari, which wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>\u201cBrie had it coming,\u201d Trystan snapped. \u201cAnd now she thinks she can screw everyone else by not showing up on Friday.\u201d Trystan grinned, thinking about acting opposite Mari, and that kiss at the end of act 2. Oh God, he\u2019d get to kiss Mari like that in front of everyone without anyone thinking anything was going on with them. \u201cThis is going to be awesome.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>~MARI~</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an actor, Trystan. I can\u2019t do what you do.\u201d He asked me to take Brie\u2019s role. Part of me wanted to, but the other part said there was no way I could pull it off.</p><p>Trystan sat on the table in front of me. We were in the prop room under the stage. He waited to tell me until we had some time alone. Trystan\u2019s hands found my shoulders and he gripped them gently. \u201cYes, you can. You already have, and you did it a lot better than Brie.\u201d</p><p>My mind raced. If I said yes, this would be the third time I\u2019d pissed off Brie in a really short amount of time. It just wasn\u2019t smart. \u201cTrystan, I wouldn\u2019t know where to stand or how to respond to the other actors. This isn\u2019t my thing. I\u2019d suck it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker said you have a C in his class right now. He wanted me to tell you that you\u2019ll get an automatic A if you take her spot.\u201d He watched my face as he spoke the magic words.</p><p>My face pinched. I wanted to say no, but that was too tempting. \u201cDamn him\u2014Tucker, I mean. That C will cause as much trouble as Brie.\u201d I started thinking out loud without realizing it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Trystan asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cThe C. My dad is a psycho with grades. I\u2019ll catch hell for it. But, if I take Brie\u2019s place so I get the A, I\u2019m going to catch hell from her. I\u2019m already on her shit list.\u201d I sighed and looked into Trystan\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s not much of a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of Brie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie\u2019s suing me, well, my Dad\u2014\u201d I just blurted it out. I\u2019d managed to leave out that part last night. The conversation skirted around it. I made it sound like a teacher tattled on me and not Brie\u2019s father. Trystan\u2019s hands slipped off my shoulders, as his jaw dropped open. \u201cbecause I punched her. That\u2019s what caused the fight the other night with my Dad. It was Brie.\u201d</p><p>Trystan pressed his eyes closed and shook his head, like he couldn\u2019t believe it. He stood and paced, thinking. The muscles in his jaw worked as he walked. Trystan crossed his arms over his chest. The dark blue tee shirt he wore showed off his sapphire eyes. I couldn\u2019t help but stare at him. He was beautiful.</p><p>When Trystan stopped, he said, \u201cBrie is a pain in the ass, but we have a shot at handling her. Your father, on the other hand, we have no control over him at all. I\u2019d get the grade and deal with the Brie, if I were you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. That was what I was thinking, I just wished there was another option. Standing, I walked over to him, \u201cAnd this decision has nothing to do with the kiss at the end of the second act?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how hard it is to stand in front of you and not touch you? Right now\u2014\u201d he shook his head, \u201cI can\u2019t even tell you what I want to do right now. It\u2019s more than a kiss Mari. It\u2019s more time together, more kissing, and more you. Of course I want you to say yes.\u201d Trystan looked down into my eyes. He held my gaze making butterflies erupt in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My voice was light.</p><p>Trystan blinked at me, like he hadn\u2019t heard me right. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and stepped closer to him, slipping my arms around his waist. \u201cYes. You\u2019re right. I know the part and I really don\u2019t mind kissing you, actually I look forward to it.\u201d I ran my fingers through his hair while I looked into his eyes. Trystan\u2019s gaze remained locked on mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wicked, you know that? The only thing I can think about now is kissing you.\u201d Trystan\u2019s fingers pulled at my waist until my chest was firmly against his. The way we fit together made me feel tingles all over. It felt like I was blasted with a heater when he touched me. Suddenly I was hot and breathing like I\u2019d run miles. He didn\u2019t even kiss me yet. We were just talking about it.</p><p>\u201cAll part of my plan, kiss assassin.\u201d I flirted back.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if tha\u2014\u201d Trystan didn\u2019t get to finish his remark because I reached up and grabbed his neck, and pulled his lips down on mine. Trystan\u2019s hands held me tight as he kissed me back, his lips gently tasting mine before he lost all control and kissed me harder. I think I forgot to breathe at one point. The whole thing was perfect; the way he held me, the way he kissed me, the way he said my name like there was no one else and there never would be.</p><p>When we pulled apart, I sucked in ragged breaths and tried to calm down. Trystan smiled at me. I grinned back, and swatted his arm. \u201cI\u2019m wicked? That was supposed to be a little kiss?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see you keeping it little,\u201d he said, bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet. Trystan was happy, happy like I\u2019d never seen him before. Every inch of Trystan was alive and resonating with mirth.</p><p>\u201cHa! Like that\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s kind of hard to do things half way with you. When you kissed me, while we were rehearsing, I almost died. No one\u2019s ever kissed me the way you do.\u201d I sat down hard on the couch, fanning myself. My heart was still pounding in my ears.</p><p>Trystan jumped onto the couch beside me. \u201cAnd who else kissed you?\u201d</p><p>My spine straightened and I turned slowly to look at him. I didn\u2019t want to talk about that. Instead of answering, a blush stained my cheeks. Trystan took my hands, his eyes glittering with curiosity, and said, \u201cOr should I ask how many? Are you really a sexual deviant? Could I be that lucky?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. I couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cA sexual deviant?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBack on track, Mari, my love. How many others have there been?\u201d When I hesitated, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you mine if you tell me yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know how many girls you\u2019ve slept with! God, Trystan.\u201d I pulled my hands away and rubbed my eyes.</p><p>He was still smiling, \u201cAre you sure? You might be surprised. I\u2019m not the male slut everyone thinks I am. I\u2019m only a little slutty.\u201d He pinched his fingers together, leaving a tiny space between.</p><p>That got my attention. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Trystan shook his head, still smiling, not offering more information. \u201cYou tell me your\u2019s first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re evil,\u201d I laughed. Trystan waggled his eyebrows at me and grinned widely. \u201cFine...I had one serious boyfriend. We didn\u2019t do everything, but it didn\u2019t matter. He still crushed me when we broke up. He goes to another school, so at least I don\u2019t have to see him every day.\u201d Trystan kept his hand on mine, rubbing the back of my palm. I glanced up at him from under my lashes, feeling foolish. \u201cI haven\u2019t been with anyone. Seth\u2019s nickname for me is accurate.\u201d</p> <p>Trystan leaned forward and kissed me on the end of my nose. Grinning, he sat back slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect, Mari. Holding out for the right guy isn\u2019t stupid, and guys who say it is just want to get in your pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you?\u201d I said, kiddingly.</p><p>\u201cLike me,\u201d Trystan continued to hold my hand, his fingers gently brushing against the side of my fingers as he gazed at me. \u201cWell, like me before I met you, and I\u2019ve heard your chastity sermons for a few years now. Let\u2019s just say you weaseled your way into my brain and I didn\u2019t hook up with every girl I came across. The rumors of my conquests have been greatly exaggerated.\u201d Trystan lifted my hand to his lips and kissed it.</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d My heart was racing. Was he saying what I thought he was saying? That couldn\u2019t be true, but I could tell from the expression in his eyes that it was\u2014this was a secret that he was happy to share\u2014one that he couldn\u2019t wait to tell me.</p><p>\u201cMeaning, I\u2019m still a novice at this. I only had one relationship and it was with Brie.\u201d He cringed. \u201cObviously I\u2019m a total moron and have no idea what I\u2019m doing. Besides her, I messed around and made-out, but...\u201d Trystan looked at me for a second and then looked to the side, his lips curling into a bashful smile. \u201cAre you really going to make me say it?\u201d</p><p>I blinked at him, assuming I was dumb as a post and not following. \u201cI think I have to. Are you seriously telling me that you were only with one girl? What about all that stuff Seth said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2019s a moron. He\u2019s all bluster, Mari. Have you ever seen him do anything but suck face with a girl?\u201d</p><p>I cringed, \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, same thing for me. Appearances are deceiving. I hope you won\u2019t use this information to tarnish my bad-boy persona at school. I like all the ladies drooling when I walk by.\u201d He was laughing now, watching me with laughter in his eyes.</p><p>Grinning, I swatted him with my hand, \u201cOh, gross! Now you sound like him!\u201d</p><p>Trystan and I laughed and kissed until the bell rang. When I emerged from the auditorium, I ran into Katie. She instantly noticed my swollen lips and blotchy skin. \u201cSucking face? With whom might this suckage be occurring? Or should I go look for him?\u201d She glanced behind me, hoping to see the object of my affection.</p><p>I yanked her arm and led her down the hall. \u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re running away, so I can\u2019t see the invisible man who ate your strawberry lip gloss.\u201d Katie\u2019s tone was light, teasing. She kept looking over her shoulder like the guy would magically appear.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mathboy when I need him?\u201d I glanced around hoping he was nearby.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my sexy nerd, and he\u2019s not going to save you from the slew of questions I\u2019m going to hurl at your head.\u201d We walked into the classroom and Katie set her books on her desk.</p><p>I looked back to the spot where Brie sat. Her chair was empty. I swallowed hard wondering if I could really go up against her and walk away intact.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>Rehearsal was much more enjoyable with Mari in his arms and Brie god-knows-where. Trystan tried as hard as he could to live in the now, but he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it would all slip between his fingers at any moment. The more time he spent with Mari, the more they kissed, the more he realized he wanted her\u2014and not in a temporary kind of way. There was something about Mari that made him come alive when she was around. All the years of jaded cynicism melted into giddy glee around her.</p><p>Tucker barely corrected Mari. She remembered everything, because she\u2019d been prompting the entire time. She\u2019d only lost a couple of days when Tucker threw her out. The cast had a different feel with Mari among them. She affected Trystan\u2019s performance for the better and everyone around him strove to be as charismatic as Trystan. It was a domino effect and it started with Mari.</p><p>When Tucker first announced Brie\u2019s replacement, no one though Mari could do it. She sat in the shadows, reading books\u2014she wasn\u2019t an actor\u2014but Mari proved them wrong by the end of the first scene. Tucker didn\u2019t stop the play, he let the entire thing run from start to end and when they finished, Tucker just sat there, staring at them with one eyebrow lifted too high.</p><p>The entire cast stood on stage, waiting for him to say something.</p><p>\u201cDid he have a stroke?\u201d Tia whispered out of the side of her mouth to the girl standing next to her.</p><p>Tucker laughed one sharp, \u201cHA!\u201d And then stood in his seat, clapping his beefy hands until they were all deaf. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have imagined that a high school cast was capable of this skill level. Trystan and Mari, I don\u2019t know what it is, but there\u2019s something about you two that pulled the whole performance up a few notches. I didn\u2019t think this was possible.\u201d Tucker stood there, arms folded across his chest, shaking his head.</p><p>Trystan spoke to Tia out of the side of his mouth, \u201cWe must have really sucked before.\u201d All the girls instantly fell into a fit of giggles. Trystan waggled his eyebrows at Mari, who grinned at him in return.</p><p>Everyone looked around, wondering if they could take a break, or if they needed to do another run through. Tucker finally realized this and said, \u201cWe\u2019re done. It can\u2019t get better than this!\u201d Murmuring to himself, Tucker turned and grabbed his folders and jacket.</p><p>The lights were turned off as Tucker made his way to the door. The stage lights remained on for another moment while the kid in the lighting cage got his books. Everyone ran from the room like rats from a sinking ship, except Mari who hung back in the wing, waiting for Trystan.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>They walked out of the school farther apart than either of them wanted to be. Mari looked over her shoulder and smiled at Trystan. Her dark curls blew like ribbons in the wind. Trystan and Mari already discussed walking places together. They decided that they\u2019d act the way they usually did. He walked her to her block sometimes, before crossing the railroad tracks and heading towards his house. Mari knew he lived in the condos in the rough part of town, but she\u2019d never been there.</p><p>\u201cThat went well.\u201d Trystan smirked at her. Mari smiled back, her dark eyes caressing his face as soft as a touch. His stomach dropped. God, he wanted to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cI was surprised it went that well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. I knew you\u2019d rock it. I mean, you have a natural talent for this kind of stuff. You always have.\u201d Trystan stood at the street corner waiting for the light to change, when he felt Mari\u2019s eyes on the side of his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, \u201cNothing, it\u2019s just every time I think I know you, something else comes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore you. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. It\u2019s your conviction. You said that with total certainty, like you knew I could do it when I didn\u2019t even know that. How can you talk like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I not? Did you see you up there? It was amazing. Why haven\u2019t you tried out for a part before?\u201d</p><p>Mari shrugged, \u201cDaddy doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a productive use of my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he thinks he\u2019s helping you, but he\u2019s holding you back.\u201d Trystan looked at her as they crossed the street. \u201cYou have so much potential and he\u2019s channeling it into this little tunnel that sucks the light out of you.\u201d</p><p>Mari\u2019s gaze was on the ground in front of her. \u201cThere are some things that can\u2019t be changed\u2014like parents\u2014I\u2019m stuck with mine.\u201d She glanced up at him.</p><p>Trystan knew what she meant. It pierced him at his core. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t pick your parents, but you get to choose what life you live. Mari, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but I want you to know this... you\u2019re capable of so much more.\u201d They\u2019d stopped walking and were standing face to face in front of Mari\u2019s house. Trystan wanted to touch her face and pull her in and feel her lips against his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo are you, Day Jones,\u201d she said, knocking him off kilter. \u201cWhat\u2019s holding you back?\u201d Those brown eyes searched his face.</p><p>Trystan tensed. \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it? \u2018Cause it looks kind of the same. You get a choice. You\u2019re beyond exceptional. You\u2019re pure magic, Trystan, and yet, you hide it from everyone. No one really knows who you are. For some reason you let me see, and I can\u2019t look away. I can\u2019t understand why you\u2019d leave your musical talent hidden. It\u2019s a solid future, enough money for college, and a solid way to get your life started, but you won\u2019t take it. Why won\u2019t you take it? What are you afraid of?\u201d Mari said these things looking into his eyes. She spoke softly, like she was afraid he\u2019d run.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s heart beat harder and harder as she spoke. Every truth she struck rang out with pristine clarity. She saw him clearly, which was both amazing and terrifying at the same time. He felt his hands shake and slipped them in his pockets. He wanted to tell her. He wanted to say that it was his father, that he\u2019d been beaten and neglected his entire life, but he couldn\u2019t. Trystan\u2019s sardonic smile laced across his lips.</p> <p>Mari\u2019s gaze narrowed in response. \u201cDon\u2019t say something witty right now. You\u2019re asking me to do the same thing, to tell them that the life they picked out for me isn\u2019t the one I want, but you won\u2019t do it yourself. You\u2019re not a hypocrite, Trystan, so there\u2019s got to be another reason for it, one you won\u2019t tell me\u2014one I can\u2019t figure out on my own.\u201d</p><p>Before Trystan had a chance to respond, Mari\u2019s front door opened and a man stood there. He was tall and thin with waves of dark hair slicked back neatly. He had on dress slacks the color of caramel and a dark silk sweater that did nothing to block out the cold. The man was covered in subtle status symbols. From the way he looked at them, Trystan knew this was Mari\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cMari! Get in here!\u201d His tone was clipped. Trystan watched him go back into the house, instantly disliking him. He snapped at Mari like she was a dog.</p><p>Mari looked over her shoulder when she was called, then said to Trystan, \u201cI have to go. Come later, okay? After 7:00pm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p> <p>Trystan avoided his home at all cost, but he needed a shower and clean clothes. When Trystan arrived, his dad wasn\u2019t home. Thank God. It was still too early, but you never knew with him. Some days dad would show up early and Trystan didn\u2019t know why. The way Trystan figured it, he had just enough time to take a shower and get out.</p><p>Trystan washed quickly, happy to get clean before seeing Mari again. He pulled on the same pair of jeans he wore earlier, but he had no shirt. Rummaging through his dad\u2019s closet, Trystan pulled out a tee shirt and put it on. Trystan combed his damp hair, pushing it out of his eyes. Thoughts about Mari and what she said kept drifting through his head. When Mari spoke like that it was contagious. She believed he could make it as Day Jones. Her confidence made Trystan feel like he could do anything, be anything, that there were no limits.</p><p>The Day Jones phenomenon was still raging and getting more insane by the day. Rabid fans wanted more. They wouldn\u2019t let it die, and since Trystan\u2019s computer was gone, he didn\u2019t know what level of insanity things had grown to. Last he looked, the number of comments had more than tripled. Agents and record labels were begging him to contact them. There was no way Trystan could read the comments all in one sitting. It would take days.</p><p>Maybe Mari was right. Maybe confessing that he was Day Jones was the best option, the best way out of this hell hole. Trystan liked the idea of performing, of singing on a stage, and of everything that goes with being in the limelight\u2014except the paparazzi. They\u2019d dig into his past and find out everything. It was too much to even think about. Mari was right. There was something holding him back, something that prevented him from ever coming forward as Day Jones. His father.</p><p>As if he conjured the old man from thin air, Trystan heard the front door slam shut. Trystan swore and ducked into his room quickly. His dad wasn\u2019t supposed to be home for another hour, at least.</p><p>His father\u2019s garbled words rang out. \u201cI busted my ass with the company for twenty years!\u201d There was a loud crash, the sound of something heavy hitting the wall. \u201cAnd how do they thank me for it?\u201d Another crash, followed by the sound of shattering glass.</p> <p>Trystan\u2019s eyes grew wide. He knew he had to get out now, but his father was blocking the exit. Trystan turned toward the window, wondering if the bars falling to the ground would make too much noise. Looking back at the door, Trystan decided that it was too risky. Besides, his father would know that he\u2019d left his room if the rusted bars were on the ground. Like it or not, Trystan was stuck here for a few more weeks. He had to make it through. The sounds of things being destroyed suddenly stopped. The apartment was silent. The hairs on the back of Trystan\u2019s neck stood on end as a shadow stretched across the floor. His father stepped into the doorway, irate. His muscles were corded tight, ready to explode.</p><p>Glaring at Trystan, his dad growled, \u201cYou little shit, you\u2019re home? You hear me yelling and screaming and you didn\u2019t bother to come see what was wrong?\u201d His father\u2019s bloodshot eyes locked on his. Dad was still wearing his dress shirt, but the tie and jacket were gone. It was unlike him to get plastered before heading home. That kind of awesomeness was reserved for Trystan alone.</p><p>Trystan didn\u2019t answer. There was nothing he could say that would make this better. His father\u2019s gaze swept over his son\u2019s damp hair and clean T-shirt. Recognition formed on Dad\u2019s face. \u201cWho said you could take my shirt?\u201d</p><p>Trystan knew his silence was being taken as defiance. Everything in his body told Trystan to run, but he was trapped in his hell-hole of a room with his dad barring the exit. \u201cAll my clothes seem to have been thrown out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you steal my stuff? That\u2019s your solution to everything, isn\u2019t it? You see what you want and take it. There\u2019s no talking to you. Even now, with the way you look at me like your better.\u201d As his dad spoke, he walked into the room. With every step his dad took forward, Trystan took a step back.</p><p>Fuck. He was going to get trapped in the corner. Trystan had to get out of there. Every muscle in his body tensed, waiting for the old man\u2019s fists to start flying. Trystan had not seen his dad this irate before, not during daylight hours anyway. \u201cI\u2019m not better than anyone,\u201d Trystan breathed the words through his teeth, his chest tightening as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a goddamn lair and a thief.\u201d</p><p>Trystan stepped away again. \u201cWhat happened today? Why are you even here?\u201d</p> <p>His father\u2019s face pulled into a grim smile. \u201cThat fucking company that I spent my entire life working for let me go. They merged with another office and decided to downsize. Did they bother to tell any of us that? No. We walked in today and guess what? Surprise! After working my ass off for two decades, I have no job.\u201d He ranted, anger surging through him as he spoke. His gaze narrowed on his son. \u201cAnd then, I come home and find my kid stealing my stuff. What the fuck gives you the right?\u201d He was yelling now, his hands flying through the air.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s back was nearly against the wall. He\u2019d rather fly into his dad\u2019s fists than get trapped in the corner. Don\u2019t fight back, he chanted in his mind, over and over again. Get around him and run. But Trystan couldn\u2019t see how.</p><p>Swallowing hard, Trystan said, \u201cNo one gave me the right.\u201d Trystan grabbed the shirt and pulled it over his head as fast as he could and threw it at his dad. The shirt hit his father in chest and fell to the floor.</p><p>The anger in his father\u2019s face exploded. Dad\u2019s normally nice features contorted with rage. He lunged at Trystan, his hands open like he planned on strangling him.</p><p>Trystan dogged to the side at the last second and darted past his dad into the hallway. Quickly, he reached for the door and pulled it shut. His dad started screaming profanity at him. It was the worst verbal assault he\u2019d ever had. It combined every failure, every short coming, and every fear that lurked inside Trystan\u2019s mind. Trystan tried to let the words slip past him, but every single one lodged into his skin like darts. By the time his dad tried pulling on the door, Trystan had the knob in his and was twisting the lock. When Trystan heard the metallic scrape, he knew the door was locked.</p><p>Resting, Trystan pressed his head to the door for a second, thankful that he made it away without getting hit, when something slammed into it and shook the frame. The plaster on the ceiling cracked and sprinkled on his bare shoulders like baby powder. Looking up, he saw thin lines spidering away from the doorframe.</p><p>Trystan stepped back before the second blow came. That shot was harder and shook the wall. A picture frame crashed to the floor and shattered. His father was cracking the doorframe. Trystan turned to run. He thought he was safe for a second, but he wasn\u2019t. From the look of it, Trystan only had one more hit to get himself out of harm\u2019s way. That door was coming down.</p><p>Trystan ran for the front of the apartment, cutting down the narrow hall as fast as he could. A loud cracking noise came from behind, as Trystan reached for the front doorknob. His father bellowed and fell through the rubble. He stumbled to his feet fast for a drunk guy. The expression on Dad\u2019s face was beyond livid, more like psychotically angry. Trystan never pushed his dad that far before. He never fought back, he never intended to. Locking the door didn\u2019t count, but the expression on his father\u2019s face said otherwise.</p><p>Fear snaked through Trystan, strangling him. This was something he couldn\u2019t undo. What happened tonight couldn\u2019t be changed. Trystan didn\u2019t mean for it to happen. He wished he never came home. Before Trystan could think another thought, his dad came barreling down the hall like a rabid bear, practically foaming at the mouth, with a thirst for blood in his eyes. Part of him wanted this to be a nightmare, to believe that his father wouldn\u2019t hurt him, but he\u2019d been alive too long to think that.</p><p>Trystan yanked the door open, intending to run through and escape into the cold night air, but when he jerked the door open someone was there.</p><p>\u201cMari?\u201d he gasped, taken by surprise.</p><p>Mari stood there with a red nose and eyes like she\u2019d been crying. Huffing like she\u2019d run to him, she looked past him and then back at his eyes, \u201cTrystan, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d The look on Trystan\u2019s face said everything was wrong. He couldn\u2019t believe she was at the door. Now.</p><p>\u201cRun, Mari. Go. Don\u2019t come back.\u201d Trystan turned away from her just as his dad barreled into him. Their bodies collided smashing the door shut before Mari could blink. A bloodcurdling scream erupted from her throat, shattering the still night. </p> </body></html>"]
