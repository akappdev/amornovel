Seize them. Feel them. Love them.\u201d Every time I screamed and stomped my feet in anger, or bawled my eyes out in frustration, or turned green with anxiety, she\u2019d calmly recite those same words. Every single time. Exactly the same. She should have tattooed the damn mantra to her forehead. \u201cThat makes no sense!\u201d I\u2019d yell. I never understood. What the hell does a tiny breath do? Why not a deep breath? Why ten? Why not three or five or twenty? I\u2019d scream and she\u2019d simply smile her little smile. I didn\u2019t understand it then.</p><p>I do now.</p><p>Stage One ~ Comfortably Numb</p> <p>Chapter One</p><p>A soft hiss ... my heart thumping in my ears. I hear nothing else. I\u2019m sure my mouth is moving, calling out their names ... Mom? ...Dad? ... but I can\u2019t hear my voice. Worse, I can\u2019t hear theirs. I turn to my right to see Jenny\u2019s silhouette, but her limbs look awkward and unnatural and she\u2019s pressed up against me. The car door opposite her is closer than it\u2019s supposed to be. Jenny? I\u2019m sure I say. She doesn\u2019t respond. I turn to my left to see only black. Too dark to see Billy, but I know he\u2019s there because I can feel his hand. It\u2019s big and strong and it envelops my fingers. But it\u2019s not moving ... I try to squeeze it but I can\u2019t will my muscles to flex. I can\u2019t do anything except turn my head and listen to my heart pound like an anvil against my chest for what feels like an eternity.</p><p>Dim lights ... voices ...</p><p>I see them. I hear them. They\u2019re all around, closing in. I open my mouth to scream, but I can\u2019t find the energy. The voices get louder, the lights brighter. A reedy gasp sets my hairs on end. Like a person struggling for their dying breath.</p><p>I hear a loud snap, snap, snap, like someone pulling stage light levers; light suddenly pours in from all angles, illuminating the car with blinding power.</p> <p>The smashed windshield.</p><p>The twisted metal.</p><p>Dark smears.</p><p>Liquid pools.</p><p>Blood. Everywhere.</p><p>It all suddenly disappears and I\u2019m falling backward, crashing into cold water, sinking further into the darkness, picking up speed as the weight of an ocean swallows me whole. I open my mouth to search for air. A lungs worth of cold water greets me in a rush, filling me inside. The pressure in my chest is unbearable. It\u2019s ready to explode. I can\u2019t breathe ... I can\u2019t breathe. Tiny breaths, I hear my mom instruct, but I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t get even one. My body\u2019s shaking ... shaking ... shaking ...</p> <p>\u201cWake up, Dear.\u201d</p><p>My eyes fly open to find a faded headrest in front of me. It takes me a moment to find my bearings, to calm my hammering heart.</p><p>\u201cYou were gaspin\u2019 for air somethin\u2019 fierce,\u201d the voice says.</p><p>I turn to find a lady stooped in the aisle, concern on her deeply wrinkled face, her twisted, old fingers on my shoulder. My body curls into itself before I can stop the knee-jerk response to her touch.</p><p>She removes her hand with a gentle smile. \u201cSorry, Dear. Just thought you should be woken up.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing, I manage to croak out, \u201cthank you.\u201d</p><p>She nods and shifts back to take her seat on the bus. \u201cMust have been some kind a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answer, my usual calm, vacant voice returning. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to wake up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d I give Livie\u2019s arm a gentle shake. She grumbles and nuzzles her head against the window. I don\u2019t know how she can sleep like that, but she\u2019s managed to, snoring softly for the past six hours. A line of flaky, dry spit snakes down her chin. Super attractive. \u201cLivie,\u201d I call again with an impatient bite in my tone. I need off this tin can. Now.</p><p>I get a clumsy wave and pouty \u201cdon\u2019t bug me, I\u2019m sleeping\u201d lip.</p><p>\u201cOlivia Cleary!\u201d I snap as passengers rustle through the overhead compartments and gather their belongings. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ve got to get out of here before I lose my shit!\u201d I don\u2019t mean to bark, but I can\u2019t help it. I don\u2019t do well in confined spaces. After twenty-two hours on this damn bus, pulling the emergency hatch and jumping through the window sounds appealing.</p><p>My words finally sink in. Livie\u2019s eyelids flutter open and half-dazed blue irises stare out at the Miami bus terminal for a moment. \u201cWe made it?\u201d She asks through a yawn, sitting up to stretch and scope out the scenery. \u201cOh, look! A palm tree!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already standing in the aisle, readying our backpacks. \u201cYay, palm trees! Come on, let\u2019s go. Unless you want to spend another day going back to Michigan.\u201d That idea gets her body moving.</p><p>By the time we step off the bus, the driver has unloaded the luggage from the undercarriage. I quickly spot our matching hot pink suitcases. Our lives, all of our belongings, have been reduced to one suitcase each. It\u2019s all we managed to throw together in our rush out of Uncle Raymond and Aunt Darla\u2019s house. No matter, I tell myself as I throw an arm over my sister\u2019s shoulders in a side hug. We have each other. That\u2019s all that matters.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot as Hell,\u201d Livie exclaims at the same time that I sense a trickle of sweat run down my back. It\u2019s late morning and the sun already blazes down on us like a fireball in the sky. So different from the autumn chill we left in Grand Rapids. She pulls off her red hoody, earning a string of catcalls from a group of guys on skateboards, ignorant to the \u2018do not enter\u2019 sign in that part of the covered parking lot.</p><p>\u201cPicking up already, Livie?\u201d I tease.</p><p>Her cheeks explode with pink as she slinks over to hide behind a concrete pillar, out of view.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize you\u2019re not a chameleon, right? ... Oh! The one in the red shirt is coming over here right now.\u201d I stretch my neck expectantly toward the group.</p><p>Livie\u2019s eyes flash wide with terror for a second before she realizes I\u2019m only joking. \u201cShut up, Kacey!\u201d she hisses, smacking my shoulder. Livie can\u2019t handle being center stage to any guy. The fact that she\u2019s turned into a raven haired knock-out over the last year hasn\u2019t helped her avoid that.</p><p>I smirk as I watch her fumble with her sweater. She has no idea how striking she is, and I\u2019m okay with that if I\u2019m going to be her guardian. \u201cStay clueless, Livie. My life will be so much easier if you\u2019re oblivious for the next, say, five years.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cOkay, Miss Sports Illustrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d In truth, some of the attention from those asshats probably is directed at me. Two years of intense kick-boxing has given me a rock-hard body. That, topped with my deep auburn hair and watery blue eyes garners loads of unwanted attention.</p><p>Livie is a fifteen year old version of me. Same light blue eyes, same slender nose, same pale Irish skin. There\u2019s only one big difference, and that\u2019s the color of our hair. If you put towels over our hair, you\u2019d think we were twins. She gets her shiny black color from our mother. She\u2019s also two inches taller than at me, even though I\u2019m five years older.</p><p>Yup, to look at us, anyone with half a brain can tell we\u2019re sisters. But that\u2019s where our similarities end. Livie\u2019s an angel. She tears up when children cry, she apologizes when someone bumps into her, she volunteers in soup kitchens and libraries. She makes excuses for people when they do stupid things. If she was old enough to drive, she\u2019d slam on the brakes for crickets. I\u2019m ... I\u2019m not Livie. I might have been more like her before. But not now. Where I\u2019m a looming thundercloud, she\u2019s the sunshine breaking through. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKacey!\u201d I turn to find Livie holding a taxi cab door wide open, her brows raised.</p><p>\u201cI hear dumpster diving for food isn\u2019t as fun as it\u2019s cracked up to be.\u201d</p><p>She slams the cab door, her face twisting. \u201cAnother bus it is.\u201d She gives her suitcase an irritated tug over the curb.</p><p>\u201cReally? Five minutes in Miami and you\u2019re already starting with the attitude? Do you want to eat garbage, Livie? I\u2019ve got sweet f**k all left in my wallet to get us past Sunday.\u201d I hold out my wallet for her to inspect.</p> <p>She flushes. \u201cSorry, Kace. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m just out of sorts.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and immediately feel bad for snapping. Livie doesn\u2019t have an attitude-riddled bone in her body. Yeah, we bicker, but I\u2019m always to blame and I know it. Livie\u2019s a good kid. She\u2019s always been a good kid. Straight-laced, even tempered. Mom and Dad never had to tell her anything twice. When they died and Mom\u2019s sister took us in, Livie went out of her way to be an even better kid. I went in the opposite direction. Hard.</p><p>\u201cCome on, this way.\u201d I link arms with her and squeeze her as I unfold the piece of paper with the address. After a long and laborious conversation with the elderly man behind the glass partition\u2014complete with a game of charades and a pencil diagram on a city map circling three transfers\u2014we\u2019re on a city bus and I hope we\u2019re not heading toward Alaska.</p><p>I\u2019m glad, because I\u2019m beat. Aside from my twenty minute catnap on the bus, I haven\u2019t slept in thirty-six hours. I\u2019m tired and worried and I\u2019d much rather ride in silence, but Livie\u2019s fidgety hands in her lap kill that idea quickly. \u201cWhat is it, Livie?\u201d</p><p>She hesitates, furrowing her brow.</p> <p>\u201dLivie ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Aunt Darla called the cops?\u201d</p><p>I reach down to squeeze her knee. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019ll be fine. They won\u2019t find us and if they do, the cops will hear what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t do anything, Kace. He was probably too drunk to know which room was his.\u201d</p><p>I glare at her. \u201cDidn\u2019t do anything? Did you forget about that disgusting old-man hard-on that pushed up against your thigh?\u201d</p><p>Livie's mouth puckers like she\u2019s about to vomit.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything, because you bolted out of there and came to my room. Don\u2019t defend that ass**le.\u201d I\u2019d seen the looks Uncle Raymond gave a maturing Livie over the last year. Sweet, innocent Livie. I\u2019d crush his nuts if he stepped foot inside my room and he knew that. Livie though ...</p><p>\u201cWell, I just hope they don\u2019t come get us and bring us back.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. I\u2019m your guardian now, and I don\u2019t care about stupid legal paperwork. You\u2019re not leaving my side. Besides, Aunt Darla hates Miami, remember?\u201d Hate is an understatement. Aunt Darla is a born-again Christian, who spends all of her free time praying and making sure everyone else is praying or knowing that they should be praying to avoid Hell, syphilis, and unplanned pregnancy. She\u2019s certain that major cities are the breeding ground for all evil in the world. To say she\u2019s fanatical would be an understatement. She won\u2019t come to Miami unless Jesus himself is holding a convention.</p><p>Livie nods her head. She lowers her voice to a whisper. \u201cDo you think Uncle Raymond figured out what happened? We could get in real trouble for that.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cDo you care if he does?\u201d Part of me wishes I ignored Livie\u2019s pleading and called the cops over Uncle Raymond\u2019s little \u201cvisit\u201d to her room. But Livie didn\u2019t want to deal with police reports and lawyers and Children\u2019s Aid and we\u2019d certainly deal with the full gamut. Maybe even the local news. Neither of us wanted that. We\u2019d had enough of that after the accident. Who knows what they\u2019d do with Livie, since she\u2019s a minor? Probably stick her in foster care. They wouldn\u2019t give her to me. I\u2019ve been classified as \u201cunstable\u201d by too many professional reports to trust with someone\u2019s life.</p><p>So Livie and I struck a deal. I wouldn\u2019t report him if she left with me. Last night turned out to be the perfect night to run. Aunt Darla was away at an all-night religious retreat so I crushed three sleeping pills and dumped them into Uncle Raymond\u2019s beer after dinner. I can\u2019t believe the idiot took the glass I poured for him and handed to him so sweetly. I haven\u2019t said ten words to him in the last two years, since I found out he lost our inheritance at a black jack table. He didn\u2019t clue in to the deception though. By seven o\u2019clock, he was sprawled and snoring on the couch, giving us enough time to grab our suitcases, clean out his wallet and Aunt Darla\u2019s secret money box under the sink, and catch the bus out that night. Maybe drugging him and stealing their money was a little excessive. Then again, maybe Uncle Raymond shouldn\u2019t have gone all creepy pedophile.</p><p>\u201cOne-twenty-four,\u201d I read the numbers on the building out loud. \u201cThis is it.\u201d This is real. We stand side-by-side on the sidewalk outside of our new home\u2014a three-story apartment building on Jackson Drive with white stucco walls and small windows. It\u2019s a neat-looking place with a beach house feel to it, though we\u2019re half an hour from the beach. If I inhale deeply, I can almost catch a whiff of sunscreen and seaweed.</p><p>Livie runs a hand through her wild dark mane. \u201cWhere\u2019d you find this place again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cwww.desperateforanapartment.com?\u201d I joke. After Livie stormed into my room in tears that night, I knew we needed out of Grand Rapids. One internet search led to another and I was emailing the landlord, offering him six months\u2019 of rent in cash. Two years of pouring over-priced Starbucks coffee, gone.</p><p>And it\u2019s worth every drop of coffee poured.</p><p>We climb the steps and walk up to a gated archway. \u201cThe picture with the ad looked great,\u201d I say as I grab and pull the gate handle to find that it\u2019s locked. \u201cGood security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Livie pushes on a cracked, round doorbell to the right. It makes no sound and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s broken. I stifle back a yawn as we wait for someone to pass through.</p><p>Three minutes later, my hands are cupped around my mouth and I\u2019m about to yell the landlord\u2019s name when I hear shoes dragging across concrete. A middle-aged man with rumpled clothes and a scruffy face appears. His eyes are uneven, he\u2019s mostly bald on top, and I swear one ear is bigger than the other. He reminds me of Sloth from that old eighties movie my father made us watch, Goonies. A classic, my dad used to say.</p><p>Sloth scratches his protruding gut and says nothing. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s as intelligent as his movie twin.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Kacey Cleary,\u201d I introduce myself. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for Mr. Tanner. We\u2019re the new renters from Michigan.\u201d His shrewd gaze lingers on me for a while, sizing me up. I silently praise myself for wearing jeans to cover the sizeable tattoo on my thigh in case he dare judge me on my appearance. His focus then shifts to Livie, where it rests too long for my liking.</p><p>\u201cYou gals\u2019 sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur matching suitcases give it away?\u201d I answer before I can stop myself. Get inside the gates before you let them know what a smart-ass you can be, Kace.</p><p>Luckily, Sloth\u2019s lips curve upward. \u201cCall me Tanner. This way.\u201d</p><p>Livie and I share a shocked look. Sloth is our new landlord? With a loud clank and creak, he ushers us through the gate. Almost as an afterthought, he turns to me and extends his hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I freeze, staring at those meaty fingers, but not moving to take them. How am I unprepared for this?</p><p>Livie deftly swoops in and grabs hold of it with a smile, and I ease back a few steps so there\u2019s no illusion that I\u2019m having anything to do with this guy\u2019s hand. Or anyone\u2019s hand. Livie\u2019s great at saving me.</p><p>If Tanner notices the maneuver, he says nothing, leading us through a courtyard with mangy shrubs and dehydrated plants surrounding a rusted hibachi. \u201cThis here\u2019s the commons.\u201d He waves his hand dismissively. \u201cIf you wanna grill, sun tan, relax, whatever, this here\u2019s the spot.\u201d I take in the foot-high thistles and desiccated flowers along the borders and wonder how many people actually find this space relaxing. It could be nice, if someone tended to it.</p><p>\u201cThere must be a full moon or something,\u201d Tanner mutters as we trail behind him toward a row of dark red doors. Each has a small window next to it and all three floors are identical.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah? Why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the second apartment I\u2019ve rented this past week through email. Same situation\u2014desperate for a place, don\u2019t wanna wait, will pay in cash. Strange. I guess everyone\u2019s got somethin\u2019 to run from.\u201d</p><p>Well. How about that? Maybe Tanner is smarter than his movie twin.</p><p>\u201cThis one here just arrived this morning.\u201d He thumbs a stubby finger at Apartment 1D before leading us to the apartment next to it with a gold \u20181C\u2019 sign on it. His huge set of keys jangles as he searches for one in particular. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll tell you what I tell all my tenants. I\u2019ve only got one rule but it\u2019s a deal breaker. Keep thy peace! Don\u2019t be throwin\u2019 no wild parties with drugs and orgies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, can you specify\u2014what qualifies as an orgy in the State of Florida? Are threesomes okay? What if blow ups are involved, \u2019cause, you know ...\u201d I interject, earning a pause and a scowl from Tanner and a sharp jab to the shoulder blade from Livie.</p> <p>After clearing his throat, he goes on as if I didn\u2019t speak. \u201cNo feuds, family or otherwise. I don\u2019t have patience for that crap and I\u2019ll boot you out faster than you can lie to me. Understand?\u201d</p><p>I nod and bite my tongue, fighting the urge to hum the Family Feud theme song as Tanner pushes the door open.</p><p>\u201cCleaned and painted it myself. It\u2019s not new, but it should give you what you asked for.\u201d</p><p>The apartment\u2019s small and meagerly furnished, with a green and white tiled kitchenette area lining the back. The white walls only enhance the hideous puce and orange floral couch. Cheap forest green carpet and the faint scent of moth balls pulls together the 70\u2019s white trash look nicely. More importantly, it\u2019s nothing like the picture in the ad. Surprise, surprise.</p><p>Tanner scratches the back of his graying head. \u201cNot much to it, I know. There are two bedrooms over there and a bathroom between them. Put in a new toilet last year so ...\u201d His lop-sided gaze shifts to me. \u201cIf that\u2019s all ...\u201d</p><p>He wants his money. With a tight smile, I reach into the front pocket of my backpack and slide out a thick envelope. Livie ventures further into the apartment while I pay him. Tanner watches her go, biting his lip as if he wants to say something. \u201cShe seems a bit young to be out on her own. Do your parents know you two are here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur parents are dead.\u201d It comes out as harsh as I intend and it does the trick. Mind your own damn business, Tanner.</p><p>His face turns ashen. \u201cOh, um, sorry to hear that.\u201d We stand uncomfortably for all of three seconds. I fold my hands under my armpits, making it clear that I have no intention of shaking any hands. When he spins on his heels and heads out the door, I release a small sigh. He can\u2019t wait to get away from me, either. Over his shoulder, he hollers, \u201claundromat\u2019s underground. I clean it once a week and expect all tenants to help out with keeping it tidy. I\u2019m in 3F if you need anything.\u201d He disappears, leaving the key sitting in the lock.</p><p>I find Livie investigating the medicine cabinet in a bathroom made for hobbits. I try to step in but there isn\u2019t enough room for both of us. \u201cNew toilet. Old, repulsive shower,\u201d I mutter, my foot tracing the grungy, cracked tile floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take this room,\u201d Livie offers, squeezing past me to head to the bedroom on the right. It\u2019s empty except for a dresser and a twin bed with a peach crocheted spread over it. Black bars line the single window that faces the exterior of the building.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? It\u2019s small.\u201d I know without looking at the other room that this one is the smaller of the two. That\u2019s how Livie is. Selfless.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s okay. I like small spaces.\u201d She grins. She\u2019s trying to make the best of it, I can tell.</p><p>\u201cWell, when we throw those all-night ragers, you won\u2019t be able to fit more than three guys in here at once. You do realize that, right?\u201d</p><p>Livie tosses a pillow at me. \u201cFunny.\u201d</p> <p>My bedroom is the same except it\u2019s slightly bigger and has a double bed with an ugly-ass green knit blanket. I sigh, my nose scrunching with disappointment. \u201cSorry, Livie. This place looks nothing like the ad. Damn Tanner and his false advertising.\u201d I tilt my head. \u201cI wonder if we can sue him.\u201d</p><p>Livie snorts. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad, Kace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that now, but when we\u2019re fighting roaches for our bread ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? Fighting? Big shocker.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. Few things make me laugh anymore. Livie, trying to be sarcastic is one of them. She tries to pull off airy and cool. She ends up sounding like one of those radio announcers doing a dramatic rendition of a cheesy murder mystery.</p><p>\u201cThis place sucks, Livie. Admit it. But we\u2019re here and it\u2019s all we can afford right now. Miami\u2019s freakin\u2019 expensive.\u201d</p><p>Her hand slides into mine and I squeeze it. It\u2019s the only one I can handle touching. It\u2019s the only one that doesn\u2019t feel dead. Sometimes I have a hard time letting it go. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect, Kace. Just a little small and mothbally and green, but we\u2019re not that far from the beach! That\u2019s really what we wanted, right?\u201d Livie stretches her arms above her head and groans. \u201cSo, now what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for starters, let\u2019s get you enrolled in the high school this afternoon so that big brain of yours doesn\u2019t shrink,\u201d I say, popping open my suitcase to empty its contents. \u201cAfter all, when you\u2019re making a bazillion dollars and curing cancer, you\u2019ll need to send money my way.\u201d I rifle through my clothes. \u201cI need to enroll at a gym. Then I\u2019ll go see how much Spam and creamed corn I can buy for an hour with my sweaty, hot body on the corner.\u201d Livie shakes her head. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t appreciate my sense of humor. Sometimes I think she wonders if I\u2019m serious. I stoop to yank the covers from my bed. \u201cAnd I definitely need to bleach the shit out of this entire place.\u201d</p><p>The building\u2019s laundromat beneath our apartment is nothing to write home about. Panels of fluorescent lights cast a harsh light over faded robin\u2019s egg blue concrete floors. A floral scent barely masks the musky odor lingering in the air. The machines are at least fifteen years old, and they\u2019ll probably do more damage than good to our clothes. But there\u2019s not a cob web or a piece of lint anywhere.</p><p>I shove all our sheets and blankets into two machines, cursing the world for making us sleep in secondhand bedding in the first place. I\u2019m buying new bedding with my first pay check, I commit to myself. Dumping in a mixture of bleach and detergent, I set the water to its hottest setting, wishing it was labeled, \u201cboil the hell out of any living organism.\u201d That would make me feel marginally better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The machines need six quarters per load. I hate paid laundry machines. Earlier, Livie and I accosted strangers at the mall with our dimes and nickels, asking for a trade. I have just enough in my stash, I realize, as I begin sliding them into their designated slots.</p><p>\u201cAny free machines?\u201d A deep male voice calls out directly behind me, surprising me enough that I yelp and throw the last three quarters in the air. Luckily, I have cat-like reflexes and I catch two coins midair. My eyeballs glue on to the last one as it hits the ground and rolls toward the washer. Dropping to my hands and knees, I dive for it.</p><p>But I\u2019m too slow.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d The side of my face hits the cold pavement as I peer under the machine, searching for a glint of silver. My fingers can just fit underneath ...</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Now I\u2019m pissed. Who sneaks up on a female in an underground laundromat, other than a psycho or a ra**st? Maybe he is one of the two. Maybe I\u2019m supposed to be quivering in my sandals right now. I\u2019m not though. I don\u2019t scare easily and, frankly, I\u2019m too damn annoyed right now to be anything else. Let him try to attack me. He\u2019ll be in for the shock of a lifetime. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d I force out between clenched teeth, trying to remain calm. Keep thy peace, Tanner warned us. No doubt he sensed something about me.</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re in a cool, damp underground laundromat in Miami. Creepy eight-legged things and things that slither and crawl hide out in places like this.</p><p>I recoil as I fight the shiver from running through my body, envisioning my hand re-emerging from underneath with a quarter and a bonus snake. Few things freak me out. Beady eyeballs and a writhing body is one of them. \u201cFunny, I\u2019ve heard creepy two-legged things lurk in these places too. They\u2019re called Creeps. A plague, one might say.\u201d Leaning far over in my short black shorts, he\u2019s got to be getting a nice view of my ass right about now. Go ahead, perv. Enjoy it \u2019cause that\u2019s all you\u2019re getting. And if I sense so much as a brush against my skin, I\u2019ll take you out at the knee caps.</p><p>He answers with a throaty laugh. \u201cWell played. How about you get up off your knees?\u201d The hairs on my neck prickle with his words. There\u2019s something decidedly sexual in his tone. I hear the sound of metal against metal as he adds, \u201cthis creep has an extra quarter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, then, you\u2019re my favorite kind of\u2014\u201d I start to say, reaching for the top of the machine as I stand to meet this ass**le face to face. Of course the open bottle of detergent is right there. Of course my hand knocks it clean off. Of course it splatters all over the machine and the floor.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d I curse, dropping to my knees again as I watch the sticky green soap ooze everywhere. \u201cTanner\u2019s gonna evict me.\u201d</p><p>Creep\u2019s voice drops low. \u201cWhat\u2019s it worth to you for me to keep quiet?\u201d Footsteps approach.</p><p>On instinct, I adjust my position so I can dislocate his joint with a kick and make him crumble in agony, just like I\u2019d learned in my sparring sessions. My spine tingles as a white sheet sails down to cover the floor in front of me. Sucking in a breath, I wait patiently as Creep passes my left side and crouches.</p><p>The air leaves my lungs in a swoosh, and I\u2019m left staring at a set of deep dimples and the bluest eyes I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014cobalt rings with light blue on the inside. I squint. Do they have turquoise flecks inside them? Yes! My God! The blue floors, the rusty old machines, the walls, everything around me vanishes under the weight of his gaze as it strips me of my protective bitch coat, yanking it clean off my body, leaving me bare and vulnerable in seconds.</p><p>\u201cWe can soak it up with this. I needed detergent anyway,\u201d he murmurs with a boyish amused grin as he drags his sheet around to saturate the spilled liquid.</p> <p>\u201cWait, you don\u2019t have to ...\u201d My voice fades, the weakness in it making me nauseous. Suddenly I\u2019m feeling all kinds of wrong for labeling him creepy. He can\u2019t be a creep. He\u2019s too beautiful and too nice. I\u2019m the idiot throwing quarters all over the place and now he\u2019s sopping up my detergent off this dirty floor with his sheets to help me!</p><p>I can\u2019t seem to form words. Not while I\u2019m gawking at Not Creep\u2019s ripped forearms, feeling heat ripple into my lower belly. In a button down shirt with the sleeves rolled and the top buttons undone, he\u2019s exposing the beginnings of a killer upper body to me.</p><p>\u201cSee something that interests you?\u201d he asks, his taunt snapping my eyes back to his smirking face, blood rushing to my cheeks. Damn this guy. He seems to flip flop from Good Samaritan to Evil Tempter with each new sentence out of his mouth. Worse, he caught me ogling his body. Me! Ogling! I\u2019m around first-class bodies every day at the gym and they don\u2019t faze me. Somehow, I\u2019m not immune to him.</p><p>\u201cI just moved in. 1D. My name\u2019s Trent.\u201d He looks up at me from under impossibly long lashes, his shaggy, golden brown hair framing his face beautifully.</p><p>\u201cKacey,\u201d I force out. So, this guy is the new tenant; our neighbor. He lives on the other side of my living room wall! Gah!</p><p>\u201cKacey,\u201d he repeats. I love the shape of his lips when he says my name. My attention lingers there, staring at that mouth, at his set of perfectly straight, white teeth, until I feel my face explode with a third wave of heat. Dammit! Kacey Cleary blushes for no one!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d shake your hand, Kacey, but\u2014\u201d Trent says with a teasing smile, holding up detergent covered palms.</p><p>There. That does it. The idea of touching those hands slaps me across the cheek, breaking whatever temporary haze this Trent man has confused me with, pushing me back to reality.</p> <p>I can think straight again. With a deep inhale, I struggle to reactivate my shields, to form a barrier from this Godlike creature, to end all reaction to him so I can just live my life and keep it untangled from his issues. It\u2019s so much easier. And that\u2019s all this is, Kacey. A reaction. A strange, uncharacteristic reaction because of a guy. An incredibly hot guy but, in the end, nothing you want to get mixed up in.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the quarter,\u201d I say coolly, standing and sliding the pro-offered coin into the slot. I start the washer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I could do for scaring the crap out of you.\u201d He\u2019s up and shoving his sheets into the machine beside mine. \u201cIf Tanner says anything, I\u2019ll tell him I did it. It\u2019s partially my fault anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartially?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles as he shakes his head. We\u2019re standing close now, so close that our shoulders almost touch. Too close.</p><p>I take a few steps back to give myself space. I end up staring at his back, admiring how his blue checkered shirt stretches across his broad shoulders, how his dark blue jeans fit his ass perfectly.</p><p>He stops what he\u2019s doing to glance over his shoulder, blazing eyes leveling me with a look that makes me want to do things to him, for him, with him. His attention drags down the length of my body, unashamed. This guy is a contradiction. One second sweet, the next second brazen. A mind-blowing hot contradiction.</p><p>A warning siren goes off in my head. I promised Livie that the random one-night hook ups would stop. And they have. For two years, I haven\u2019t given anyone the time of day. Now, here I am, day one in our new life, and I\u2019m ready to straddle this guy on the washer.</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m writhing in my own skin, uncomfortable. Breathe, Kacey, I hear my mom\u2019s voice in my head. Count to ten, Kace. Ten tiny breaths. As usual, her advice doesn\u2019t help me because it makes no sense. All that makes sense is getting away from this two-legged trap. Immediately. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I move backward toward the door.</p><p>I don\u2019t want these thoughts. I don\u2019t need them.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are you ...?\u201d</p><p>I run up the stairs to safety before I hear Trent finish his sentence. Not until I\u2019m above ground do I search for a breath. I lean against the wall and close my eyes, welcoming that protective coat back as it slides back over my skin, and takes back control of my body.</p> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>A hissing sound ...</p><p>Bright lights ...</p><p>Blood ...</p><p>Water, rushing over my head. I\u2019m drowning.</p> <p>\u201cKacey, wake up!\u201d Livie\u2019s voice pulls me out of that suffocating darkness and back into my bedroom. It\u2019s three a.m. and I\u2019m drenched with sweat.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Livie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d she answers softly, laying down beside me. Livie\u2019s used to my nightmares. I rarely go a night without one. Sometimes I wake up on my own. Sometimes I start hyperventilating and she has to dump a glass of cold water over my head to bring me back. She didn\u2019t have to do that tonight.</p><p>Tonight is a good night.</p><p>I stay quiet and still until I hear her slow, rhythmic breathing again, and I thank God for not taking her from me too. He took everyone else, but he left me Livie. I like to think he gave her the flu that night to keep her from coming to my rugby game. Congested lungs and a runny nose saved her.</p><p>Saved my one ray of light.</p> <p>I get up early to say bye to Livie on her first day at her new high school. \u201cYou have all the paperwork?\u201d I remind her. I signed everything as Livie\u2019s legal guardian and made her swear to that if anyone asks.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLivie, just stick to the story and everything will go smoothly.\u201d To be honest, I\u2019m a little worried. Depending on Livie to lie is like expecting a house of cards to stay up in a windstorm. Impossible. Livie can\u2019t lie if her life depends on it. It kind of does in this case.</p><p>I watch her finish her Cheerios and grab her school bag, pushing her hair back behind her ear a dozen times. That\u2019s one of her many tells. A tell that she\u2019s panicking.</p><p>\u201cJust think, Livie. You can be anyone you want to be,\u201d I offer, rubbing her biceps as she\u2019s about to head out the door. I recall finding one shred of solace when we moved to Aunt Darla and Uncle Raymond\u2019s\u2014a new school and new people who knew nothing about me. I was dumb enough to believe the break from pitying eyes would last. But news travels fast around small towns, and soon I found myself eating lunches in the bathroom or skipping school altogether to avoid the whispers. Now though, we\u2019re worlds away from Michigan. We really do have a chance to start over fresh.</p><p>Livie stops and turns to stare at me blankly. \u201cI\u2019m Olivia Cleary. I\u2019m not trying to be anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just mean, no one knows anything about our past here.\u201d That was another one of our negotiating points coming here. My requirement\u2014no sharing our past with anyone.</p><p>\u201cOur past isn\u2019t who we are. I\u2019m me and you\u2019re you and that\u2019s who we need to be,\u201d Livie reminds me. She leaves and I know exactly what she\u2019s thinking. I\u2019m not Kacey Cleary anymore. I\u2019m an empty shell who cracks inappropriate jokes and feels nothing. I\u2019m a Kacey imposter.</p> <p>When I searched for our apartment, not only was I looking for a decent school for Livie. I needed a gym. Not one where pencil-thin girls prance around in new outfits and stand near the weights, talking on their phone. A fighter\u2019s gym.</p><p>That\u2019s how I found The Breaking Point.</p><p>The Breaking Point is the same size as the O\u2019Malleys in Michigan and I instantly feel at home when I step inside. It\u2019s complete with dim lighting, a fighting ring and a dozen bags of various sizes and weights, hung from the rafters. The air is infused with that familiar stench of sweat and aggression\u2014a bi-product of the fifty to one male to female ratio.</p><p>As I step into the main room, I inhale deeply, welcoming the security it brings with it. Three years ago, after the hospital released me from long term care\u2014after extensive physiotherapy to strengthen the right side of my body, shattered in the accident\u2014I joined a gym. I spent hours there each day, lifting weights, doing cardio, all the things that strengthened my shattered body, but did nothing to help my devastated soul.</p><p>Then one day, a ripped guy named Jeff with more piercings and tattoos than a jaded rock star introduced himself. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty intense in your workouts,\u201d he said. I nodded, uninterested in any direction the conversation could go. Until he handed me his card. \u201cHave you tried O\u2019Malleys down the road? I teach kick boxing down there a few nights a week.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a natural, apparently. I quickly excelled as his star pupil, probably because I trained seven days a week without fail. It has turned out to be the perfect coping mechanism for me. With each kick and each hit, I\u2019m able to channel my anger, my frustration, and my hurt into one solid blow. All the emotions I work hard to bury in my life, I can release here in a non-destructive way.</p><p>Thankfully, The Breaking Point is cheap and they let you pay month to month with no enrollment fees. I have enough cash set aside for one month. I know it should be going toward food but not working out is not an option for me. Society is better off with me in a gym.</p><p>After I enroll and get the grand tour, I drop my gear by an available sand bag. And I feel their eyes on me, the questioning stares. Who\u2019s the redhead? Doesn\u2019t she realize what kind of gym this is? They\u2019re wondering if I can throw a punch worth shit. They\u2019re probably taking bets already on who gets me in the shower first.</p><p>Let them try.</p><p>I ignore the attention, the flagrant comments and snickers, as I stretch my muscles, afraid I\u2019ll strain something after missing three days. And I smirk. Cocky ass**les.</p><p>Taking several breaths to sooth my nerves, I focus on this bag, this gracious thing that will absorb all my pain, my suffering, my hatred without protest.</p><p>And then I release it all.</p><p>The sun isn\u2019t even up yet, and the worst kind of old man heavy metal blasts through my room. My alarm clock reads six a.m. Yup. Right on schedule. It\u2019s the third day in a row that my neighbor wakes me up to this racket. \u201cKeep thy peace,\u201d I mutter as I jerk my covers over my head, replaying Tanner\u2019s words. I guess keeping thy peace means not kicking down thy neighbor\u2019s door and smashing thy electronics against the wall.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t exact thy revenge.</p><p>I grab my iPod\u2014one of the few non-clothes possessions I grabbed in our dash\u2014and scroll through the playlists. There it is. Hannah Montana. My best friend, Jenny, loaded all this tween shit as a joke years ago. Looks like it\u2019s finally going to come in handy. I push away the ache that goes along with the memories tied to it as I hit play and crank the volume to max. The contorted sound bounces off the walls of my confined space. The speakers will likely blow but this is worth it.</p><p>And then I dance.</p><p>Like a maniac, I bop around my room, waving my arms, hoping this person hates Hannah Montana as much as I do.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Livie yells, barreling into my room in rumpled PJs, her hair untamed. She leaps onto my iPod to slam the power button off.</p><p>\u201cJust teaching our neighbor a lesson about waking me up. He\u2019s some kind of dickhole.\u201d</p><p>She frowns. \u201cHave you met him? How do you know it\u2019s a guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause no chick blasts that shit at six in the morning, Livie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh. I guess I can\u2019t hear it in my room.\u201d Her brow puckers as she studies the adjoining wall. \u201cThat\u2019s dreadful.\u201d</p><p>I give her a quirked brow. \u201cYa think? Especially when I worked until eleven last night!\u201d I started my first shift at a Starbucks in a nearby neighborhood. They were desperate and I have a stellar reference letter thanks to my old manager, a twenty-four year old mama\u2019s boy named Jake with a crush on the bad ass redhead. I was smart enough to play nice with him. It paid off.</p><p>With a pause and then a shrug, Livie shouts, \u201cDance party!\u201d and cranks up the volume.</p><p>The two of us jump around my room in a giggling fit until we hear the pounding on our front door.</p> <p>Livie\u2019s face drains of all color. She\u2019s like that\u2014all bark, no bite. Me? I\u2019m not worried. I throw on my ratty purple house coat and proudly strut over. Let\u2019s see what he has to say about that.</p><p>My hand is on the lock, about to throw the door open, when Livie whispers harshly, \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>I pause and turn back to find Livie\u2019s waggling index finger, like my mother used to do when she was scolding. \u201cRemember, you promised! That was the deal. We\u2019re starting fresh here, right? New life? New Kacey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, can you please try not to be an ice queen? Try to be more like the Before Kacey? You know, the one who doesn\u2019t stone-wall everyone who comes close? Who knows, maybe we can make some friends here. Just try.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to make friends with old men, Livie? If that\u2019s the case, we could have stayed home,\u201d I say coolly. But her words sting like a long needle inserted straight into my heart. From anyone else, they would slide off my tough Teflon exterior. The problem is I don\u2019t know who Before Kacey is. I don\u2019t remember her. I hear her irises shined when she laughed, her rendition of \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d on the piano made her dad tear up. She had hordes of friends, and she snuck in hugs and kisses and handholding with her boyfriend whenever she could.</p><p>Before Kacey died four years ago and all that\u2019s left is a mess. A mess who spent a year in physical rehabilitation to repair her shattered body, only to be released with a shattered soul. A mess whose grades did a nose dive into the bottom of the class. Who sunk into a world of drugs and alcohol for a year as a way of coping. After Kacey doesn\u2019t cry, not a single tear. I\u2019m not sure she knows how. She doesn\u2019t open up about anything; she can\u2019t stand the feel of hands because they remind her of death. She doesn\u2019t let people in, because pain trails closely. The sight of a piano sends her into a dizzying haze. Her only solace is to beat the crap out of giant sand bags until her knuckles are red and her feet are raw and her body\u2014held together with countless metal rods and pins\u2014feels like it\u2019s going to crumble. I know After Kacey well. For better or for worse, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m stuck with her.</p><p>But Livie remembers Before Kacey and for Livie, I\u2019ll try anything. I push the corners of my mouth out to form a smile. It feels awkward and foreign and, by the wince on Livie\u2019s face, probably looks a little bit menacing. \u201cOkay.\u201d I go to turn the handle.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Livie! What now?\u201d I sigh with exasperation.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She hands me her pink and black polka-dot umbrella. \u201cHe could be a serial killer.\u201d</p> <p>Now I tip my head back and laugh. Such an odd, rare sound because I don\u2019t do it often but it\u2019s genuine. \u201cAnd what should I do with this? Poke him?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cBetter than beating the snot out of him like you\u2019ll want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, let\u2019s see what we\u2019re dealing with here.\u201d I lean over to the window beside the door and push back the gossamer curtain, looking for a graying man with a faded too-small t-shirt and black socks. A tiny part of me sparks at the idea that it\u2019s that Trent guy from the laundromat. Those smoldering eyes invaded my thoughts several times without invitation over the past few days, and I\u2019ve had a hard time kicking him out when he\u2019s there. I\u2019ve even caught myself staring at the adjoining wall between our apartments like a creeper, wondering what he\u2019s doing. But the music is coming from the other side so it can\u2019t be him.</p><p>A corn silk blonde ponytail wags back and forth outside our door instead. \u201cSeriously?\u201d I snort, fumbling with the lock.</p><p>Barbie\u2019s standing outside. No joke. A real life five-foot-nine, highly toned, blonde bombshell with plump lips and giant periwinkle blue irises. I find myself speechless, taking in her tiny cotton shorts and the way the \u201cPlay Boy\u201d logo distorts as it stretches across the front of her tank top. Those are so not real. They\u2019re the size of hot air balloons.</p><p>A soft drawl breaks my trance. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Nora Matthews, from next door. Everyone calls me Storm.\u201d</p><p>Storm? Storm from next door with giant balloons sewn on to her chest?</p><p>A throat clears and I realize I\u2019m still staring at them. I quickly avert my gaze back to her face.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. The doctor gave me a free upsize while I was asleep,\u201d she jokes with a nervous giggle, earning a choking cough of shock from Livie.</p><p>Our new neighbor, Nora, a.k.a 'Storm,\u2019 with giant, fake boobs. I wonder if Tanner gave her a \u201cno orgies, keep thy peace\u201d speech when he handed her the keys.</p><p>She extends a toned arm and I immediately tense up, fighting not to visibly recoil. This is why I hate meeting new people. In this diseased day and age, can\u2019t we all just wave at each other and move along?</p><p>A raven black head pops into my view as Livie dives to grab Storm\u2019s outstretched hand. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Livie.\u201d I silently thank my sister for saving me yet again. \u201cThis is my sister, Kacey. We\u2019re new to Miami.\u201d</p><p>Storm offers Livie a perfect smile and turns back to me. \u201cLook, I\u2019m so sorry about the music.\u201d So she can tell I\u2019m the instigator. \u201cI had no idea someone moved in next door. I work nights and my five year old has me up early in the morning. It\u2019s all I can do to stay awake.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s then that I notice the whites of her eyes are bloodshot. Guilt stabs me, knowing there\u2019s a kid involved. Dammit. I hate feeling guilt, especially for strangers.</p><p>Livie clears her throat and settles a \u201cremember not to be a bitch,\u201d gaze on me.</p><p>\u201cNo big deal. Just maybe, not quite so loud? Or so 1980\u2019s?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u201cMy dad got me hooked on AC/DC. I know, not cool.\u201d She grins. \u201cI\u2019m taking requests. Anything but Hannah Montana, please!\u201d She holds her hands in front of her in sign of surrender, earning a giggle from Livie.</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d A tiny version of Storm in striped pajamas appears, tucking herself behind her mother\u2019s shapely long legs as she peers up to examine us with her thumb in her mouth. She\u2019s about the most gorgeous little kid I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>\u201cThese are our new neighbors, Kacey and Livie. This is Mia,\u201d Storm introduces, her hand stroking the little girl\u2019s dark blonde waves.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Livie hollers with that tone reserved for little kids. \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>No matter what kind of mess I\u2019ve turned into, little kids have the power to temporarily melt the layer of protective ice coating my heart. Them and pot-bellied puppies. \u201cHello, Mia,\u201d I offer softly.</p><p>Mia ducks back with hesitation, glancing up at Storm.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s shy around strangers,\u201d Storm apologizes then looks down to address Mia. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Maybe these girls will be your new friends.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The words \u2018new friends\u2019 is all it takes. Mia steps out from behind her mother\u2019s legs and wanders into our apartment, dragging a faded yellow fleece blanket behind her. At first she simply takes in our place, likely investigating for hints about her new \u2018friends.\u2019 When her eyes finally rest on Livie, they don\u2019t shift again.</p><p>Livie drops to her knees to meet Mia face to face, a giant grin stretching her lips. \u201cI\u2019m Livie.\u201d</p><p>Mia holds up her blanket, her face serious. \u201cThis is Mr. Magoo. He\u2019s my friend.\u201d Now that she\u2019s talking, I can see a giant gap where she\u2019s lost her two front teeth. She\u2019s instantly that much cuter.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Mr. Magoo.\u201d Livie squeezes the fabric between her thumb and index finger, mock-shaking its hand. Livie must have passed the Mr. Magoo test because Mia grabs her arm and tugs her out the door. \u201cCome meet my other friends.\u201d They disappear into Storm\u2019s apartment, leaving Storm and I alone.</p> <p>\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t from around these parts.\u201d It\u2019s a statement, not a question. I hope she leaves it at that. \u201cHave you been here long?\u201d Storm\u2019s evaluating eyes float over our sparse living room, much like her daughter\u2019s had, hanging over a framed picture of us with my parents on the living room wall. Livie pulled it off Aunt Darla\u2019s family room wall as we ran out the door.</p><p>I silently admonish Livie for hanging it up there for all to see, to ask questions, even though I have no right to. There are a few times when Livie digs her heels in. That\u2019s one of them. If it were up to me, it\u2019d be in Livie\u2019s room where I can work up to visiting it occasionally.</p><p>It\u2019s just too hard for me to look at their faces.</p><p>\u201cJust a few days. Isn\u2019t it homey?\u201d</p><p>Storm\u2019s mouth curves into a smirk at my attempt at humor. Livie and I ransacked the local Dollarama for some basic necessities. Aside from that and the family picture, the only thing we\u2019ve added is the scent of bleach in place of mothballs.</p> <p>Storm nods, folding her arms over her chest as if to ward off a chill. There is no chill. Miami is hot, even at six a.m. \u201cIt\u2019s what works for now, right? That\u2019s all we can ask for,\u201d she says softly. Somehow I get the feeling she\u2019s talking about more than the apartment.</p><p>There\u2019s a squeal of delight next door and Storm laughs. \u201cYour sister\u2019s good with kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Livie has some sort of magnetic power over them. No kid can resist her. Back home she volunteered at our local daycare a lot. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll have at least twelve of her own.\u201d I lean in for a mock whisper behind my hand. \u201cWait \u2019til she learns what she needs to do with boys for that to happen.\u201d</p><p>Storm chuckles softly. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll learn soon enough. She\u2019s striking. How old is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen.\u201d</p><p>She nods slowly. \u201cAnd you? You in college?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d I heave a sigh, fighting the urge to clam up. She\u2019s asking a lot of personal questions about us. I hear Livie's voice inside my head. Try ... \u201cNo, I\u2019m working right now. School will come later. Maybe in another year or two.\u201d Or ten. I\u2019ll make sure Livie\u2019s set up before me, that\u2019s for sure. She\u2019s the one with a bright future ahead of her.</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause as we\u2019re both lost in our own thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s what works for now, right?\u201d I echo her earlier words and I see an understanding in those blue eyes, thinly veiling her own dark closet of skeletons.</p><p>Stage Two ~ Denial</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>I wander half-asleep into the kitchen to find Livie and Mia at the little dining table, playing Go Fish.</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d Livie sings.</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d Mia mimics.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like eight a.m.\u201d I mutter as I grab the cheap jug of OJ I splurged on the other day from the fridge.</p> <p>\u201cHow was work?\u201d Livie asked.</p><p>I take a giant gulp right from the jug. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a sharp gasp and I find Mia\u2019s short finger stabbing the air in my direction. \u201cKacey just said a naughty word!\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I cringe as I catch Livie\u2019s unimpressed glare. \u201cI get one, okay?\u201d I say, looking for a way to excuse myself. I\u2019ll have to watch my language if Mia\u2019s going to be hanging around.</p><p>Mia\u2019s head cocks to one side, likely considering my logic. Then, like any good five year old\u2019s limited attention span, my heinous infraction is quickly forgotten. She smiles and announces, \u201cYou guys are coming over for brunch. Not breakfast and not lunch.\u201d</p><p>Now it\u2019s my turn to glare at Livie. \u201cAre we now?\u201d</p><p>Lowering her brow, Livie gets up and comes to my side. \u201cYou said you\u2019d try,\u201d she reminds me in a low whisper so Mia doesn\u2019t overhear.</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d be nice. I didn\u2019t say I\u2019d swap muffin recipes with the neighbors,\u201d I respond, trying hard not to growl.</p><p>I get an eye roll. \u201cStop being dramatic. Storm\u2019s cool. I think you\u2019ll like her if you\u2019d stop avoiding her. And all other living creatures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know I\u2019ve graciously served over a thousand cups of coffee this week to living creatures. Some questionable ones too.\u201d</p><p>Crossing her arms, Livie\u2019s glare flattens, but she doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not avoiding people.\u201d Yes, I am. Everyone, including Barbie. And Dimples next door. Definitely him. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve spotted his lean frame watching out the window as I came home at night a few times, but I ducked my head and sped past, my insides constricting at the thought of seeing him face to face again.</p><p>\u201cReally? \u2019Cause Storm sure thinks you are. She came out to talk to you the other day, and you rushed into the apartment like lightning before she could say \u2018hi.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I hide behind another sip of juice. Busted. I totally did that. I heard her door unlock and the beginnings of a \u201cHello, Kacey,\u201d and I hurried to shut our apartment door.</p><p>\u201cI am like lightning. Lightning Girl has a nice ring to it,\u201d I say.</p><p>Livie watches as I scan the meager contents of our fridge and my stomach protests with a perfectly-timed growl. We agreed to spend as little as possible until I had a pay check or two in the bank so we\u2019ve been living off no-name Cheerios and bologna sandwiches for more than a week. Given I need more calories than the average twenty year old to function, it\u2019s left me sluggish. I guess offering to feed us earns Storm at least five points in the potential friend bank.</p><p>My tongue slides over my top teeth. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Livie\u2019s face brightens. \u201cThat\u2019s a yes?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, acting nonchalant. Inside, panic is rising. Livie\u2019s getting too attached to these people. Attachments are bad. Attachments lead to hurt. I make a face. \u201cAs long as she\u2019s not making bologna.\u201d</p><p>She giggles and I know it\u2019s more than my lame joke. She knows I\u2019m trying, and that makes her happy.</p><p>I change the subject. \u201cHow\u2019s your new school, by the way?\u201d I\u2019d worked the afternoon shift all week so we haven\u2019t talked once, besides a few kitchen counter notes.</p><p>\u201cOh ... right.\u201d Livie\u2019s face pales like she\u2019s seen a ghost. She reaches for her backpack, with a glance back to see Mia busy playing her own card game at the table. \u201cI checked my email account at school,\u201d she explains as she hands me a piece of paper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My back stiffens. I knew this was coming.</p><p>Dearest Olivia,</p><p>I assume that sister of yours has convinced you to run off. I can\u2019t possibly understand why but I hope you are safe. Please send me a message to let me know where you are. I will come get you and bring you home, where your parents want you to be. That will make them happy.</p><p>I am not upset with you. You are a sheep led astray by a wolf.</p> <p>Please let me bring you home. Your uncle and I miss you terribly.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Aunt Darla</p><p>Heat erupts like a volcano inside as my blood boils. Not about the wolf comment. I don\u2019t care about that. She\u2019s called me worse. What I do care about is her using our parents as a guilt trip, knowing full well it\u2019d hurt Livie. \u201cYou didn\u2019t respond, did you?\u201d</p><p>Livie shakes her head solemnly.</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d I push through clenched teeth, crumpling the note into a tight ball. \u201cDelete your account. Get a new one. Don\u2019t ever respond to her. Not once, Livie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Kacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it!\u201d I hear Mia\u2019s tiny gasp and I quickly temper my tone. \u201cWe don\u2019t need them in our lives.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause. \u201cShe\u2019s not a bad person. She means well.\u201d Livie\u2019s voice turns soft. \u201cYou didn\u2019t exactly make things easy for her.\u201d</p><p>I push down the lump of guilt forming at the back of my throat, rivaling to take over my anger. \u201cI know that, Livie. I do, really. But Aunt Darla\u2019s way of \u2018meaning well\u2019 doesn\u2019t work for us.\u201d My hands move to rub my forehead. I\u2019m no idiot. For the first year after the accident, I put all my effort, focus, and thought into fixing my body so I could move again. Once released, my focus moved on to shoving the memories of my former life into a bottomless well. There were impossible days though\u2014holidays, birthday, and the like\u2014and I quickly learned that alcohol and drugs, while capable of destroying lives, also had magical powers; the power to dull pain. More and more I relied on those weapons against the constant and overwhelming rush of water swelling over my head, threatening to drown me.</p><p>That and sex. Meaningless, mindless \u201ctake what I want\u201d sex with strangers who I didn\u2019t care about, and who didn\u2019t care about me. No expectations, at least not on my part. Guys from parties, guys from school. If it was awkward for them after, I didn\u2019t care. I never let them get close enough to me to find out. It was the perfect coping mechanism.</p> <p>Aunt Darla knew what was going on. She didn\u2019t know how to handle it. At first she tried connecting me with her priest so he could confront and rid me of the demons within. This all had to be the work of demons, after all, according to her. But when the demons proved resilient to her church\u2019s powers, I think she decided ignorance was best. \u201cIt\u2019s just a phase,\u201d I\u2019d hear her whisper to Livie with a comforting pat. A disgusting, self-deprecating phase that she wanted no part of. From that point on, she put all of her focus on her non-broken niece.</p><p>I was fine with that.</p><p>Until I woke up to Livie smacking my back to keep me from choking on my own vomit, tears streaming down her cheeks, sobbing hysterically, saying over and over again, \u201cPromise you won\u2019t leave me!\u201d her words a knife stabbing through my heart.</p><p>I stopped everything that night. The drinking. The drugs. The random sex. The sex, period. I haven\u2019t so much as looked at a guy since. I\u2019m not sure why. I guess it\u2019s all linked together in my mind. Luckily, I found a new release with kick boxing soon after. Livie\u2019s never completely approved or supported me in this newest addiction but she happily takes it over the other stuff.</p><p>I slam the fridge door, not wanting to think about Aunt Darla or the depths of my self-destructive past anymore. \u201cWhat time\u2019s breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrunch!\u201d Mia corrects me with a loud sigh of exasperation.</p><p>The delicious smells of bacon and coffee sparks hunger pangs as we follow Mia into her place. I mentally pat myself on the back for making the right choice. If nothing else, I\u2019ll have loads of energy for the gym today.</p><p>My attention drifts over Storm\u2019s apartment with a degree of awe. It\u2019s a mirror of ours except it\u2019s nice. She\u2019s filled the living room with a dove gray sectional, sparkly throw cushions, and little glass tables with pretty crystal lamps. A flat screen television sits on a stylish teak armoire. The hideous green carpet peeks out beneath a cream shag rug. Her walls are a light gray and splashed with candid black and white photos of Mia. Where our apartment looks like a cheap rental, Storm\u2019s looks like a trendy girlish boutique.</p> <p>I have to admit, as I sit at the table and quietly listen to Storm, Livie, and Mia banter back and forth, I\u2019m starting to like Storm whether I want to or not. Though one would never know by looking at her, what with those distracting inflatables on her chest, Storm\u2019s street smart and she acts a lot older than her twenty-three years. It takes no time to see that. She\u2019s laid back and she cracks a witty joke here and there in that soft, but husky voice of hers. She fumbles with her hair a lot, and laughs easily, and I see nothing but sincerity and interest in her eyes. For someone so beautiful, she doesn\u2019t come across as vain or self-absorbed. Mostly she listens though. And watches. Those shrewd orbs take everything in. I catch her studying the tattoo on my thigh, narrowing slightly as I\u2019m sure she zeroes in on the hideous scar beneath. It\u2019s the one major scar that\u2019s not caused by surgery on my body but from a jagged chunk of flying glass.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t ask about it, though, and that makes me like her even more.</p><p>\u201cOh, man!\u201d Storm exclaims through a yawn, eyes red and lined with dark purple bags. Leaning on her elbows, she rubs her face fiercely. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until Mia learns how to sleep in. At least during the week I can sneak in a mid-morning nap while she\u2019s at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I was going to ask you. Do you mind if I take Mia to the park down the street?\u201d Livie offers as if she\u2019s been thinking about it and genuinely forgot. I instantly see what she\u2019s doing. That\u2019s so Livie. \u201cI won\u2019t let her out of my sight. Not for a sec, I promise. I\u2019ve got my CPR certification, my junior lifeguard designation, a thousand hours at a private day care.\u201d Livie starts rhyming off her impressive resume. \u201cI even have a printed copy of my resume in our apartment if you want to have a copy. And references!\u201d Of course you do, Livie. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in, say, four hours, if that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mommy! Say yes!\u201d Mia bounces up and down on the couch, waving her arms frantically. \u201cSay yes! Yes! Yes! Mommy, say yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Calm down.\u201d Storm laughs, patting the air. \u201cOf course you can, Livie. You spend so much time with her as it is, I\u2019m not worried about your credentials. I should be paying you, though!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Absolutely not.\u201d Livie brushes her words away, earning my sharp glare. Is she nuts? Does she enjoy eating bologna? Must we move on to Spam?</p><p>Livie helps Mia with her shoes. \u201cBye, Mommy!\u201d Mia shouts on her way out. Livie avoids making eye contact with me. It\u2019s like she has a line to my brain and can read my scathing thoughts.</p><p>As soon as the door closes, Storm\u2019s forehead drops to the table. \u201cI thought I was going to die today. Oh, Kacey. I swear, your sister\u2019s like an angel fluttering around with little satin wings and a magical wand. I\u2019ve never met someone like her. Mia\u2019s already so in love with her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The layer of ice over my heart melts.

Livie\u2019s gulp fills the silence in the apartment and I know something\u2019s bothering her.</p><p>\u201cUgh, Livie!\u201d I roll my head back. \u201cSpit it out. I don\u2019t want to be late for my stellar job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I should have stayed in Grand Rapids.\u201d</p><p>That freezes my feet.

Of course you shouldn\u2019t have stayed in Grand Rapids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we going to survive though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith ten hours of prostitution for each of us. Maximum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKacey!\u201d</p> <p>I sigh, turning serious. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to concentrate on school, Livie. But ...\u201d I waggle my finger at her. \u201cIf Storm offers you money again, take it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s already shaking her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not taking money to hang out with Mia. She\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be having fun with people your own age, Livie. Like boys.\u201d</p><p>She sets her jaw stubbornly. \u201cWhen they\u2019re not idiots, I\u2019ll do that. Until then, five years olds make more sense.\u201d</p> <p>I stifle a laugh. That\u2019s part of Livie\u2019s problem. She\u2019s too smart. Genius smart. She\u2019s never related to kids her own age. I think she was born with the maturity of a twenty-five year old. Losing my parents only exacerbated that problem. She\u2019s grown up too fast.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? It\u2019s never too late for the Princeton dream,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>An unattractive snort escapes me. \u201cThat dream died years ago for me, Livie, and you know that. You\u2019ll go, on that full scholarship you\u2019re going to earn. I\u2019ll apply somewhere local as soon as I have the money.\u201d And somehow forge my transcript to make up two years of appalling grades.</p><p>Her brow creases in that worried Livie way. \u201cLocal, Kacey? Dad would hate that.\u201d She\u2019s right, he would. Our dad went to Princeton. His dad when to Princeton. In his view, I may as well enroll in a school with golden arches for a crest and take \u201cFlipping Burgers 1-0-1\u201d if I\u2019m not going to Princeton. But Mom and Dad are gone and Uncle Raymond blew our entire inheritance on a black jack table.</p><p>I remember the night I found out about that like it was yesterday. It was my nineteenth birthday and I asked Aunt Darla and Uncle Raymond for our money so we could move out. I wanted to become Livie\u2019s legal guardian. I knew something was up when Aunt Darla couldn\u2019t meet my eyes. Uncle Raymond stumbled over his words before blurting out that there was nothing left.</p><p>After smashing almost every dish on the kitchen counter and jamming my foot into Uncle Raymond\u2019s jugular so hard his face turned purple, I dialed the cops, ready to charge them with theft. Livie grabbed the phone from me and hung up before the call went through. We wouldn\u2019t win. I\u2019d likely be the one arrested. As smart as Mom and Dad were, they didn\u2019t plan on dying. All the money left after the debts were paid went to Uncle Raymond and Aunt Darla to \u201ccare\u201d for us. Secretly, I\u2019m kind of glad Uncle Raymond did all that he did. It gave me another legitimate excuse to take my sister and leave that part of our lives behind for good.</p><p>I pat Livie\u2019s back, trying to appease her guilt. \u201cDad would be happy that we\u2019re safe. End of story.\u201d</p><p>The next day I\u2019m in the laundromat, when Storm skips down the steps, smiling but sallow-eyed. Livie took Mia to the park again and I\u2019m giving serious consideration to smacking her upside the head for refusing to take money.</p> <p>\u201cTanner must have his panties in a bunch over this.\u201d Storm slides her foot across the sticky green stain left by my detergent. I duck my head, silently reminding myself to come back and scrub the floor. The thought of Tanner in any kind of underwear makes bile rise in my throat.</p><p>I quietly continue my sorting until I notice Storm\u2019s standing there idly, watching me. It\u2019s obvious she wants to talk to me, but she probably doesn\u2019t know where to start.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you lived here?\u201d I finally ask.</p><p>I think my voice startles her because she jumps and begins tossing in Mia\u2019s little t-shirts and tiny pairs of undies. \u201cOh, three years, I think? It\u2019s a pretty safe building, but I still wouldn\u2019t come down here at night.\u201d</p><p>Her words bring me back to thoughts of Trent and the unwanted feelings he elicited so effortlessly. We\u2019ve been here weeks and I haven\u2019t run into him since. If I dig deep inside, if I care to pay attention to what I\u2019m trying to bury, I catch a glimpse of disappointment over that fact. But I quickly crush it with a hammer and throw it into the well with all other unwanted feelings.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the other people like in the building?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cA lot of people move in and out. Rent\u2019s cheap so we get a lot of college kids. They\u2019ve all been nice, especially to Mia. Mrs. Potterage on the third floor helps babysit after school and when I work. Oh,\u201d she waggles a finger. \u201cAvoid 2B like the plague. That\u2019s Pervie Pete.\u201d</p><p>My head tilts back with a groan. \u201cFantastic. No building is complete without a resident perv.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and a new guy moved in next to you. 1D.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t control the bit of heat from crawling up my neck. \u201cYeah, Trent,\u201d I say casually as I set the machine. Even his name out loud sounds hot. Trent. Trent. Trent. Stop it, Kace.</p><p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t talked to this Trent but I saw him and ... wowza.\u201d Her eyebrows waggle suggestively.</p><p>Great. My gorgeous Barbie neighbor thinks Trent is hot. All she has to do is adjust her shirt and she\u2019ll have him on his knees. I realize my teeth are clenched painfully and I focus on releasing my muscles. She can have him and all the trouble he comes with. Why do you care, Kace?</p><p>Slamming the doors shut and hitting the on switch, Storm exhales deeply, blowing her long bangs off her face. \u201cAre you going to be here for a while?\u201d She glances at the newspaper and marker I\u2019ve brought down with me. \u201cWould you mind just turning my stuff over when it goes off? I mean, if you\u2019re around and it\u2019s not too much trouble.\u201d</p><p>I look at her again, at her drawn skin and the purplish lines marring her pretty blue eyes and see just how worn she is. Young, single mom with a five year old and she works six days a week, up until three a.m. every night?</p><p>\u201cYeah, no problem.\u201d That sounds like something a nice, normal person would do, I tell myself. Livie will be proud of me.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I don\u2019t want to impose.\u201d</p><p>I notice that she\u2019s biting her lip and her shoulders are pinched together and it dawns on me that she\u2019s nervous. Asking for my help likely took her a ton of courage and she must be desperate enough to do it. Realizing that makes me want to slam my head into a wall. Clearly, I haven\u2019t tried very hard to be approachable, like I promised Livie I would. And Storm\u2019s nice. Really, genuinely nice.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Ma\u2019am, I reckon it\u2019d be my honor to wash your drawers,\u201d I drawl in a fake southern accent, picking up the paper to fan myself with it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her face lights up with surprise as she giggles. She opens her mouth to answer, but nothing comes out. Me having a sense of humor has floored her. Dammit, Livie\u2019s right. I am an ice queen.</p><p>I quickly add, \u201cBesides, I owe you for last week. It\u2019s the least I can do after pulling out Hannah\u2014the dirtiest of all weapons.\u201d I smile and it\u2019s not forced. \u201cI\u2019ll just be going through the jobs section so I may as well do that in this paradise.\u201d</p><p>She frowns. \u201cStarbucks not working out?\u201d Livie must have told her because I sure didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, but the pay\u2019s shit. If I want to live of Spam and scrape blue spots off of bread for the rest of my life, I can make it work.\u201d</p> <p>She nods, thinking. \u201cYou guys should come over for dinner tonight.\u201d I open my mouth to decline the charity and she adds, \u201cas my thanks to Livie for taking care of Mia today.\u201d There\u2019s something in that tone, a mixture of forced bravery, but also a level of natural authority that makes me slam my mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cAnd ...\u201d she shifts her feet a bit hesitantly, like she\u2019s not sure if she should say what\u2019s on her mind, \u201c... do you know how to mix drinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh ...\u201d I blink rapidly at the sudden change in topic. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a little early in the day for that?\u201d</p><p>She smiles, her perfect teeth gleaming. \u201cLike martinis and Long Islands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pour a mean tequila shot.\u201d I offer half-heartedly.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I can talk to my boss and see if he\u2019ll hire you, if you\u2019re interested. I bartend at a club. The money\u2019s good.\u201d Her eyes widen with those last words. \u201cLike, really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBartender, huh?\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cSo, what do ya think?\u201d</p><p>Could I handle it? I don\u2019t say anything, trying to picture myself behind a bar. The visual ends with me smashing a bottle and kicking a grabby customer in the head.</p><p>\u201cI should probably warn you, though.\u201d She hesitates. \u201cIt\u2019s an adult club.\u201d</p><p>I feel the frown line zip across my forehead. \u201cAdult like ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStrippers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ...\u201d Of course. I look down at myself. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m a \u2018keep clothes on in crowds\u2019 kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>Storm\u2019s hands wave my words away. \u201cNo, don\u2019t worry. You wouldn\u2019t have to strip. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Me? Work in a strip club? \u201cYou think I\u2019d fit in, Storm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you handle being surrounded by sex, booze, and loads of cash?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cSounds like my teenage years, minus the cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you learn how to smile a bit more?\u201d she asks with a nervous giggle.</p><p>I flash her my best fake grin.</p> <p>She nods with approval. \u201cGood. I think you\u2019ll do well behind the bar. You have a look they\u2019ll like.\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cWhat look? The \u2018I just got off a bus from Michigan and I\u2019ll do anything for money so I don\u2019t have to eat Spam\u2019 look?\u201d</p><p>The corners of her eyes crinkle as she giggles. \u201cThink about it and let me talk to my boss. It\u2019s really good money. You wouldn\u2019t have to eat Spam again. Ever.\u201d With that, she skips up the stairs.</p><p>I think about it. I think about it as I watch Storm and Mia\u2019s clothes spin around in circles. I think about it as the timer goes off and I flip the clothes over into the dryer and start two new loads. I think about it as I sort and fold their freshly clean clothes into neat piles and reload the hamper, paying a little too much attention to the skimpy outfits in Storm\u2019s pile. Like a tiny black top that looks like a cross between a sequined sports bra and something a wild animal mangled. I hold it up. Does she serve drinks or her body in this? That would explain her ridiculous boobs. Wow. I might be making friends with a stripper. That\u2019s sounds weird. And then I acknowledge that I\u2019m going through her underwear. That sounds way weirder.</p><p>\u201cTell me where you wear that so I can be there to witness it.\u201d His deep voice startles me again.</p><p>I gasp as my head whips around to see Trent strolling toward me with a laundry bag slung over his shoulder. My breath hitches at the sight of him and those deep dimples he flashes shamelessly. It\u2019s been more than two weeks since I bumped into him here, yet seeing him instantly ignites a fire within me.</p><p>Again, with the laundromat? What are the chances? Inhaling deeply, I force myself to relax. I\u2019m better prepared this time. I won\u2019t act like a space cadet. I won\u2019t let his beautiful face disarm me. I won\u2019t ... \u201cWell, well. The Laundromat Lurker strikes again.\u201d</p><p>Trent smirks as his attention grazes over my body, stopping to survey the tattoo on my thigh for a moment before flittering back up to my face. By the time they get there, my pulse is racing and I think I may need to change my underwear. Dammit. Here we go again. \u201cRound two,\u201d I mutter before I can stop myself.</p><p>His eyebrow quirks with surprise as he moves toward the open washer.</p><p>I try not to ogle his body through his fitted white t-shirt, watching him dump a set of white sheets into the wash. \u201cYou wash your sheets a lot,\u201d I observe coolly, thinking that\u2019s a fairly innocuous comment.</p><p>Trent\u2019s hands pause for a second and then he continues, chuckling and shaking his head but saying nothing. He doesn\u2019t need to. I\u2019ve clued into what my observation could imply and I groan inwardly, fighting the urge to smack myself in the forehead, my face growing even warmer. Any upper hand I thought I had when he walked in just dissolved into a hot mess at my feet.</p><p>I\u2019m sure his sheets see a lot of action. He\u2019s got to have a girlfriend. Someone like him must have a girlfriend. Or a string of f**k buddies. Either way, now I want to crawl into a hole and hide until he leaves.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? It\u2019s hot in Miami without A/C,\u201d he offers after a moment as if to ease the awkwardness. That\u2019s what I fool myself into thinking anyways, until he throws in, \u201ceven without clothes, I wake up boiling,\u201d and deftly layers on to my mortification.</p><p>Trent sleeps naked. My mouth dries as my focus unavoidably latches onto his frame again. On the other side of my living room wall is this god, in a bed, lying naked. Though I thought impossible, my pulse quickens even further.</p><p>I open my mouth to change topics, but I can\u2019t grasp onto anything coherent. Words swim inside my head, stringing into gibberish. I can\u2019t come up with one damn remotely intelligent answer. Not one. Me, who can crack orgy jokes and crush arrogant ball sacks with the best of them, is floored. He has smoothly splintered my defensive shield with nothing but bed sheets and a naked visual.</p><p>And those damn dimples.</p><p>I watch the muscles in his shoulders shift as he pours detergent into the machine. Who knew doing laundry could be sexy. When he turns to me and winks, I jump.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod and try to make an affirmative sound but it comes out sounding like a strangled cat and I\u2019m sure my entire head has caught on fire now.</p><p>He slams the lid on the washer and pushes the coins in to start the wash, then turns to me, leaning in. \u201cTo be honest, I saw you walking past me with your laundry and I grabbed the first thing I could think to wash.\u201d</p><p>Wait ... what\u2019s he saying? I shake my head to kick the haze out. I think he\u2019s telling me something important.</p><p>He grins as he pushes a hand back through his unkempt hair. I want to do that, I think, involuntarily flexing my fingers. Please let me do that. In fact, I want to do all kinds of things to him. Right here in this dingy basement. On the washer. On the floor. Anywhere. I battle the urge to lunge at him like a rabid animal. Hell, I\u2019m panting like one right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, what do people do for fun around here?\u201d he asks, leaning back at bit to give me space, like he can read that I\u2019m about to pass out from his proximity.</p><p>\u201cUh ...\u201d It takes me a moment to find my voice. And my wits. \u201cHang out in laundromats?\u201d My words come out shaky. Dammit\u2014what is wrong with me?</p><p>He laughs, his gaze settling on my lips. The feel of his eyes there makes me spew out words that my brain hasn\u2019t approved yet. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just moved here. I haven\u2019t had any fun yet.\u201d Ohmigod Kacey. Shut up! Just shut up! Now you sound like an airhead and a loser!</p><p>With a lopsided grin, he leans against the washer and crosses buff arms over his chest. And then he stares at me. That stare lasts an eternity, until sweat starts to trickle down my back. \u201cWell, we need to change that, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I croak, heat igniting in my lower belly. He has effectively stripped me bare of my titanium cover again. He\u2019s tossed it to another planet where I have no hope of ever finding it. I am naked and vulnerable and his eyes are boring into my core.</p><p>His body slides across his washer until he\u2019s leaning on mine, his hip nudged up against me, his arm stretched out to the opposite corner of the machine in front of me, effectively invading all personal space. \u201cChange the fact that you\u2019re not having any fun,\u201d he murmurs. My breath snags. I feel like he\u2019s reached into my body and seized my pounding heart. Does he have any idea what he\u2019s doing to me? Am I that obvious?</p><p>His index finger reaches up and runs down my temple, down my cheek, to join the rest of his hand to cup my jaw. He rubs my hanging bottom lip with the pad of his thumb as I gawk up at him. I can\u2019t move. Not a muscle, like his touch has the power to paralyze. \u201cYou are so very beautiful.\u201d</p><p>My nerves are a ball of contradictions. His fingertip feels so damn good against my lip and yet that voice is screaming, No! Stop! Danger!</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d I hear myself whisper and I instantly curse the traitor within.</p> <p>Do. Not. Let.This. Happen.</p><p>He leans in closer and closer until his breath caresses my mouth. I\u2019m paralyzed. I swear he\u2019s going to kiss me.</p><p>I swear I\u2019m going to let him.</p><p>But then he stands up straight, as if remembering something. Clearing his throat, he says with a wink, \u201cSee you around, Kacey.\u201d He turns and vanishes up the stairs, his long legs taking two steps at a time.</p><p>\u201cYe ... Yeah. Fo ... for sure,\u201d I stutter, leaning against the machine for support as my legs turn to jelly. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m two seconds away from melting into a puddle on the concrete floor. I fight the urge to chase after him. One ... two ... three ... I struggle to shake off the uncomfortable edge that has slinked into my body. Hunching over, I lay my cheek against the machine, my flushed skin reveling in the feel of the cool metal.</p><p>He\u2019s one hell of a player. I\u2019m usually so good at shutting them down. Being a female in a male-dominated gym, I dealt with those juiced up egomaniacs at O\u2019Malleys every day. Hold my bag for me ... Dominate me ... The comments were never-ending and uncreative. Then, when the lot of them decided that I must be a lesbian because I hadn\u2019t dropped my shorts for anyone, the stupid comments increased tenfold.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never had issues resisting the hottest of them. None of them have broken though this masterful wall of self-preservation I\u2019ve constructed around myself. I enjoyed sparring with them. I loved knocking them to their knees. But never had they stirred any interest from me, physical or otherwise.</p><p>But Trent ... there\u2019s something different about him, and I don\u2019t have to think hard to see it. Something about the way he takes over a room, the way he looks at me, like he has already identified and can disarm every one of my defense mechanisms with no effort, like he sees through them to the disaster lying beneath.</p><p>And he wants it.</p><p>\u201cFucking player,\u201d I mutter as I run to the sink. A splash of water temporarily douses the flames in my chest. He\u2019s smooth. Oh so smooth. Way more sophisticated than the asshats I normally deal with. \u201cYou\u2019re so very beautiful,\u201d I repeat, followed by a harsh mock of myself saying \u201cso are you.\u201d I\u2019m sure he tells everyone that. Watch, he\u2019ll meet Storm and say the exact same thing. Oh God. My gut spasms, my fists clenching so tight that my knuckles go white. What\u2019ll happen when he meets Storm? He\u2019ll fall in love with her, that\u2019s what. He\u2019s a guy. What guy wouldn\u2019t fall in love with Sweet Stripper Barbie? And then I\u2019ll become nothing other than that head case in 1C and I\u2019ll have to watch them cuddle on the couch, and listen to them have wild-stripper sex on the other side of my bedroom wall, and I\u2019ll want to rip Storm\u2019s arms off. Dammit. I crank up the cold water and splash my face again. In no time, this guy has created permanent fissures in my carefully constructed suit of sanity, and I don\u2019t know how to fight against it, to protect myself, to keep him out.</p><p>To keep all of them out.</p><p>Ninety-nine percent of me knows I need to keep him at arm\u2019s length. There\u2019s no point considering him. He\u2019ll get one look at my shit and he\u2019ll run, leaving a bigger mess behind. And yet, as I eye the washer where he just stood, where his bed sheets swirl, I give serious consideration to stealing them and leaving a \u201ccome and get it\u201d note in its place. No. I shove angry hands through my thick mane, gripping the back of my head as if to keep it from exploding. I need to stay away from him. He\u2019s going to ruin everything I\u2019ve worked so hard to put in place.</p><p>Suddenly, I can\u2019t get out of that laundromat fast enough.</p><p>Mia and Livie sit cross-legged on the living room floor with a Chutes and Ladders board game between them. A freshly showered Storm dumps a pot of spaghetti noodles into a pot of boiling water. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind veal in your sauce,\u201d she says as I step in without knocking. I figure we\u2019re past the knocking stage. I just touched her thongs, after all.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great. Your clothes are all here.\u201d</p><p>She looks over her shoulder at the hamper and shock twists her face. \u201cDid you fold my underwear for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh ... No?\u201d</p><p>Turning a bit more to see my face, still drenched from the tap water, she frowns. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>How do I explain I had to have a mini-cold shower in the laundromat because that damn smooth-talking neighbor of ours cornered me? I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt was Stephen King\u2019s Maximum Overdrive all over again. The washing machine came to life and attacked me. Laundry and I are officially on no-speaking terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never read that book,\u201d Storm says at the same time that I hear a tiny frightful gasp.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d I mumble as I head toward the kitchen, catching a scathing glare from Livie for scaring Mia. Our dad made us watch all the movies from his era as a way of keeping the classics alive. Most of the time, no one in my generation has a clue what I\u2019m talking about.</p><p>Storm turns to face me wearing an apron that reads, How\u2019s the sauce? Has anyone seen my Band-Aid? and a big grin. \u201cHey, so I spoke to my boss. Job\u2019s yours if you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStorm!\u201d My eyes bug out.</p><p>Her long blond locks sway as she tips her head back to laugh, my surprise apparently amusing. I can tell she\u2019s happy to give me the news. I get the impression that she genuinely wants to help us and for no reason other than because she\u2019s just that nice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d Liar, yes you have. Good money is good money and as long as I don\u2019t have to strip, I can handle standing in the middle of a vagina circus.</p><p>\u201cWhat job is this?\u201d Livie pipes up, her curiosity peaked.</p><p>\u201cA job with me, where I work,\u201d Storm explains.</p><p>\u201cMy mommy gets paid to give people drinks, in a restaurant. Like this!\u201d Mia scrambles to her feet and runs over to grab an empty cup from the counter. \u201cWould you like a glass of lemonade, Madam?\u201d She carries it to Livie with the utmost care and bows.</p> <p>\u201cWhy, thank you, kind waitress,\u201d Livie gushes theatrically and proceeds to gulp back the imaginary drink like she\u2019s just crossed the Sahara desert, finishing with a wink for Mia. But, when she turns to me, her brow is furrowed with unease. \u201cServing more than lemonade, I take it?\u201d</p><p>I nod, dropping my focus to re-arrange the cutlery on the table before I can meet her worried gaze again. Her bottom lip is sucked into her mouth. She\u2019s trying hard to stop it from quivering and I know what she\u2019s thinking. She\u2019s afraid I\u2019ll spiral back into that dark place where the tequila is flowing and the one-night-stands are frequent. Even though I\u2019ve promised her a hundred times that that phase is over, she\u2019s still terrified of losing me to it again. I can\u2019t blame her.</p><p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m surprised by her next words. \u201cYou should take it, Kacey.\u201d</p><p>My head cocks to the side as I regard her.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cIf you\u2019re serving them, you can cut them off, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod slowly, processing that logic. Livie always finds the good in things. I steal a glance at Storm to see her intently focused on stirring her tomato sauce. I know she must have heard that. She\u2019s got to be wondering what dark skeletons these two neighbors of hers have in their closet. As usual, she has the decency not to pry.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s good money in tips from what I hear,\u201d Livie adds. \u201cMaybe I can get fake ID and get a job there too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Storm and I shout in unison and share a silent look. A look that says this is good enough for us, but not for Livie. She\u2019s too good for this world.</p><p>\u201cMommy? Are you working tonight?\u201d Mia\u2019s tiny voice chirps up, delaying more of Livie\u2019s questions.</p><p>Storm smiles sadly at her daughter. \u201cYes, honey bear.\u201d It has to be hard, leaving her six nights in a row.</p><p>\u201cCan I stay with Livie? Please, Mommy?\u201d Mia holds her hands together in front of her as if she\u2019s praying.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Mia. I think you\u2019ve monopolized enough of Livie\u2019s time today, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, noooo ... Mommy!\u2019 Mia whines and stomps around the room in a circle, reminding everyone that she is only five years old. She stops in a huff, throwing her arms around herself, and scowls. \u201cI don\u2019t like Mrs. Potterage!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a nice lady, Mia,\u201d Storm says with a sigh, like she\u2019s said it a hundred times before. To me she leans in and whispers, \u201cI don\u2019t blame the poor kid. Potterage smokes like a burning oil field. But I can usually rely on her for at least four nights a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind at all,\u201d Livie jumps in with a pat on Mia\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cSee Mommy? Livie says, yes!\u201d</p><p>Storm cringes. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. In fact, I\u2019m more than happy to watch her every night if you want,\u201d Livie offers with complete seriousness.</p><p>\u201cOh, Livie. I work six days a week. That\u2019s a lot to ask of a fifteen year old. You deserve to go out and party or, whatever fifteen year olds are doing these days.\u201d</p> <p>Livie\u2019s already shaking her head. \u201cNo it\u2019s not and I don\u2019t mind.\u201d She pinches Mia\u2019s cheek, as taken by the child as Mia is of her. \u201cI\u2019d love it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause and Storm swallows, considering it. \u201cYou\u2019d have to let me pay you for your time. No more arguing.\u201d</p><p>Livie\u2019s hand waves dismissively. \u201cYeah, fine. Whatever. She\u2019ll be asleep most of the time anyway and Kacey will be at work with you, right? So at least I won\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p><p>All three turn to look at me hopefully.</p><p>I heave a loud sigh. \u201cJust drinks, right? I\u2019m not serving anyone ... anything else.\u201d</p><p>Storm\u2019s irises twinkle. \u201cNot unless you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t have to wear anything revealing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ...\u201d</p><p>My head drops back and rolls from one side to the other. \u201cHere we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just going to say that you\u2019ll make more money showing a bit of cle**age than you will dressed as a Mormon. A lot more money. I\u2019d show a teensy tiny bit of skin, if I were you.\u201d</p><p>I sigh again. \u201cAnd I can quit if I don\u2019t like it? No hard feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, Kacey. No hard feelings,\u201d Storm asserts, holding a wooden spoon in front of her face as if she\u2019s pledging.</p><p>A long pause, just enough to make Storm squirm. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Storm throws her toned arms around me, oblivious that the contact is making my insides churn and the voice in my head scream. She breaks away just as quickly and moves back to her pot of sauce, allowing me a chance to exhale. \u201cYou start tonight, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight. Fun.\u201d I can\u2019t keep the sarcasm from my voice as butterflies start their mad dash around my belly, killing my appetite. I hug my arms tight to my body, acknowledging that a club\u2019s worth of new people means handshakes and questions about personal shit that are none of anyone\u2019s business. I\u2019m not ready for this. I haven\u2019t prepared ... One ... two... three ... four... By the time I reach ten, I\u2019m freaking out.</p><p>Stage Three ~ Resistance</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>We pull up to Penny\u2019s Palace in Storm\u2019s Jeep just as the sun is dropping over the horizon. Storm doesn\u2019t even have the thing in park before I jump out. When she walks around to meet me on my side, it\u2019s with a look I\u2019m long since used to\u2014a mixture of surprise and concern. She doesn\u2019t comment though.</p><p>She does comment on me tugging at the short black skirt I borrowed from her. \u201cStop fidgeting.\u201d She swats my hand away. \u201cI never would have taken you for the nervous type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say. You\u2019re ass isn\u2019t hanging out. I can\u2019t believe I agreed to wear this Band-Aid. I\u2019m going to bend over and show everyone my girl bits.\u201d</p><p>Storm laughs. \u201cOf course you should wear that Band-Aid. It shows those awesome legs of yours off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s showing more than my legs,\u201d I mutter, giving it another tug to cover the bottom of my tattoo. I\u2019m not ashamed of that. I just don\u2019t want to draw more attention to myself than necessary.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord! For such a tough act, you really are a big sissy girl, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. I guess I\u2019m just out of my element here and it\u2019s causing me to second-guess everything. If this were the gym, I\u2019d have no problem in tiny shorts that hug my ass. But this isn\u2019t the gym and I\u2019m not allowed to kick the crap out of anything here.</p><p>I c**k my head to the side as I take in Storm. \u201cDid you just call me a sissy girl?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cDid you just say \u2018girl bits\u2019? This is an adult club, not a day care.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to remember that,\u201d I chuckle as we approach the solid black metal door with a tiny peep hole in it.</p><p>\u201cYou look great, Kacey. Seriously.\u201d I try not to flinch as she pats my shoulder.</p><p>Secretly, I have to admit that I do. Aside from the mini skirt, I\u2019m also wearing a charcoal striped halter top and several silver jewelry pieces, courtesy of Storm\u2019s collection. She also helped me with my hair and make-up. I look more than decent. Not a knock out standing next to Storm with her turquoise dress and tanned skin and Barbie doll curves, but decent all the same. Decent enough that I caught myself swaggering extra slow past 1D on my way out, hoping to catch Trent\u2019s face in the window. Then I realized what I was doing, and I ran the rest of the way to Storm\u2019s Jeep, the voice inside my head scolding the snot out of me the entire way.</p><p>Storm raps against the heavy door four times. It flies open and my insides flip. Not many people intimidate me anymore. The giant man with dark skin and bulging muscles who fills the doorway, as wide as he is tall, though ... I don\u2019t care that I\u2019m cowering. By the look of him, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s never smiled a day in his life. He\u2019s certainly never been a cute baby. I\u2019m sure he simply materialized out of nothingness into the beast standing before me.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Nate. He\u2019s the head bouncer and Cain\u2019s right hand man. Hey Nate! This is my friend, Kacey.\u201d Storm doesn\u2019t wait for him to respond. She simply pushes past him, her hand giving his solid abdomen a soft punch on the way in.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says. The tiny word rumbles deep inside me, his voice like thunder and I nod, temporarily mute.</p><p>He steps back to give me more space. \u201cCome in, please.\u201d</p><p>Forcing bravado that I don\u2019t feel, I jack my chin up and step inside. Storm leads me down a narrow hallway lined with liquor cases and silver kegs, smelling faintly of beer yeast. Dark memories rise with the scent. Memories of clubs and tequila shots off guys\u2019 abdomens and white powder lines on tables in dark corners. I quickly cram them back where they belong. In the past.</p><p>\u201cHere are the dressing rooms for the dancers ...\u201d Storm\u2019s index finger points to two closed doors. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go in there unless you want to see all kinds of \u2018girl bits.\u2019\u201d With a teasing laugh, she continues.</p> <p>We pass by a broad-shouldered, towering blond guy in a tight black t-shirt and black pants. Definitely another bouncer by his outfit but not as ominous-looking at Nate. He\u2019s cute in that \u201cI\u2019m from Wisconsin and I play football\u201d kind of way. He reminds me of Billy ...</p><p>\u201cKacey, this is Ben,\u201d Storm introduces us.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kacey,\u201d he grins and then his head cocks as if he suddenly recognizes me. \u201cHey, weren\u2019t you at The Breaking Point the other day?\u201d</p><p>I look him over. I don\u2019t remember him, but, then again, I don\u2019t pay any heed to the guys there. \u201cMaybe. I just joined.\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly. \u201cYeah, that was definitely you.\u201d His eyes do a full shameless intake of my body. \u201cYou\u2019re incredible. Do you compete?\u201d</p><p>I brush off the compliment. \u201cNah, it\u2019s just for fun.\u201d The truth is I\u2019d love to complete, but it\u2019s too dangerous for me, given my injuries. One hit to the wrong place will cause serious damage to all the work those surgeons did years ago to put me back together. I\u2019m not about to tell Ben any of that though.</p> <p>\u201cFirst night at Penny\u2019s?\u201d he asks, leaning one forearm against a door frame.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>A lusty gaze wanders over my frame again.</p><p>\u201cBartending only,\u201d I add, crossing my arms over my chest, emphasizing the \u2018only.\u2019</p><p>His attention skates back up to my face and he smirks. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll hear it again from me every time you ask,\u201d I throw back coolly. What a pompous ass. He needs a good kick to the head to wipe that smirk off his mouth. Maybe I\u2019ll ask him to spar next time I\u2019m at the gym.</p><p>Storm ushers me forward past him, hollering over her shoulder, \u201cSee ya later, Ben.\u201d She knocks on a door with a sign that reads Bossman. There\u2019s a caricature of a naked woman sitting spread eagle and a pair of black lace thong underwear tacked on beside. How fitting.</p><p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s Cain\u2019s office. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll fit in here,\u201d she whispers as she pushes through the door. I give the back of her head an arched brow. She thinks she knows me. She thinks I\u2019ll fit in with silicone and booze and vajayjays or whatever I\u2019m supposed to call them. I\u2019m second-guessing how smart Storm really is.</p> <p>\u201cCome in!\u201d A harsh voice calls out and my back tenses up.</p><p>Inside is a small office with floor to ceiling shelves on all four walls, lined with more cases of booze. Tons and tons of booze. On the back wall is something that looks like a weird chemistry experiment\u2014a bunch of upside down liquor bottles with a mess of hoses flowing from their spouts, down into the floor. My nose catches a faint scent of cigar smoke, cedar, and whiskey lingering in the air.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the bar well,\u201d Storm explains in a whisper. \u201cAll the basic liquor. It controls how much goes out. You hit a button behind the bar and it gives you one ounce. You hit it twice, two ounces, not rocket science.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can\u2019t reenact my favorite scenes from Cocktail?\u201d I mumble, picturing twirling bottles like a baton.</p><p>Storm chuckles. \u201cYou can, but it will be with the pricey bottles on the shelf and they cost a lot when you break them.\u201d</p><p>A man with slick black hair and a navy dress shirt sits behind a giant mahogany desk with his back to us. Cain, I presume. He\u2019s on the phone with what sounds like the beer distributor. By the way he barks out \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no,\u2019 I\u2019d say he\u2019s not happy. He slams the phone down and spins around and I prepare myself for a painful conversation.</p><p>But then his coffee-colored irises settle on Storm and they instantly warm. He\u2019s a younger man\u2014early thirties\u2014with attractive features and a sense of style. Definitely good-looking by anyone\u2019s standards. But he\u2019s a strip club owner and that equals dirt bag in my book.</p><p>\u201cHello, Angel,\u201d he drawls, giving Storm a slow once-over. The hairs on the back of my neck prickle. I\u2019m not going to like this guy. Not. One. Bit.</p><p>Storm ignores the leer. Or maybe she enjoys it. Frankly, I have no idea. I don\u2019t know her well enough either. \u201cHey, Cain.\u201d She cocks her head toward me. \u201cThis is my friend, Kacey. For the bartender position?\u201d</p><p>My gut tenses as those dark irises turn to appraise me but it only lasts for half a second. He bolts out of his chair and strides around the desk, extending his hand with a professional air. \u201cHi Kacey. I\u2019m Cain, the owner of Penny\u2019s. Pleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>And here\u2019s where my little phobia makes life so damn awkward. I can\u2019t get around shaking the boss\u2019s hand when he offers it to me. Not unless I tear out of here right now but then I\u2019m out of a job. One I\u2019m not sure I want, but a job nonetheless. My only real choice is to grit my teeth and hope I don\u2019t pass out from an anxiety attack when his fingers curl around my own, shoving me back into that dark place I keep trying to crawl out from.</p><p>I look at him, I look at his hand, I look at Storm. But most of all, I hear Livie\u2019s voice saying try.</p><p>I reach out ...</p><p>Black spots fill my vision as his bones and muscles and gristle wrap around my hand and squeezes. My other hand blindly paws the air for support and I make contact with Storm\u2019s elbow. I grab onto it. I\u2019m going to pass out. I\u2019m going to keel over right here on this floor and do the funky chicken like an idiot. Nate the gargantuan will drag me out while Cain hollers, \u201cthanks, but no thanks, nut job\u201d and then I\u2019ll be back to Starbucks and Livie will have to eat cat food and ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStorm\u2019s told me a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>With a start, I realize Cain has let go of my hand. My lungs deflate. \u201cHas she now?\u201d I say in a shaky voice, stealing a glance at Storm</p><p>He smiles warmly. \u201cYes. She said you\u2019ve helped her out a lot. You\u2019re smart and you\u2019re in need of a job. You\u2019re stunningly beautiful. I can see that now, firsthand.\u201d</p><p>I choke, my tongue disappearing into the back of my throat.</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever worked in an adult establishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh ... no ... sir,\u201d I answer and silently pray to God that Storm hasn\u2019t told him otherwise. I don\u2019t know why, but I find suddenly that I want to impress Cain. He carries an authoritative air to him, like he\u2019s much older and wiser than his appearance suggests, like he\u2019s a caring human rather than unscrupulous strip club owner.</p><p>My answer doesn\u2019t seem to bother him. \u201cOne of my bartenders is pregnant. She and I both agree that a gentleman\u2019s club isn\u2019t the best place for her so ... how many nights can you commit to?\u201d</p><p>I look at Storm and shrug. \u201cAll of them?\u201d</p><p>Cain\u2019s head tips back as he laughs whole-heartedly, revealing a tattoo beneath his left ear. It reads, \u2019Penny.\u2019 She must be someone special if he named his club after her and tattooed her name on himself. \u201cDon\u2019t sign your life away, Sweetheart. Five or six nights will do.\u201d His eyes skim my arms now, skittering over the white scar snaking down the outside of my shoulder, and I silently chastise myself for not covering them. They probably frown upon disfigured women working in adult clubs. \u201cYou have a fighter\u2019s body,\u201d he says instead.</p> <p>\u201cNo fighting. Just staying fit,\u201d I answer quickly.</p><p>He nods slowly. That seems to impress him. \u201cGood. I like a woman who can take care of herself.\u201d He settles behind his desk again, saying, \u201cyou\u2019ll train Kacey, right, Storm?\u201d</p><p>Storm is grinning ear to ear. \u201cYes, Cain.\u201d</p><p>He looks up at her again, and I see the look for what it truly is. Adoration, not lusty animalism. Like he worships her. I wonder if they\u2019ve slept together. I wonder if he sleeps with all his staff. I\u2019m sure he could if he wanted to. Will he try to sleep with me? I don\u2019t have time to think about it anymore because Storm leads me out the door in a daze.</p><p>\u201cCome on. We\u2019re opening soon. I need to get you comfortable.\u201d</p><p>The night goes by in a blur. Storm and I work the main bar together\u2014Storm on the more complicated drinks, me on beer and straight shots while she teaches me the basics. The place is nothing like I expected. It\u2019s huge and three stories high in the center with a low ceiling around the perimeter, allowing sleek alcoves for the bars, shiny black high top tables, and a hallway to the V.I.P. rooms. Apparently Cain is strict about what happens back there. Nothing illegal, he tells all the girls. \u201cI don\u2019t go back there,\u201d Storm says with a serious look that says \u201cdon\u2019t go back there, Kacey.\u201d</p> <p>On a raised stage in the center, the girls dance. There are three dancing at all times, each with their own little stage jutting off the main one to accommodate the group of leering men in front row. A blue light shines down over the entire space, creating a mystical ambience. The rest of the place is dark, the air heady with booze and testosterone and lust. Music throbs through my body, its beat guiding the dancers every move on stage.</p><p>Storm and I joke and chatter casually back and forth as we serve, and I can\u2019t help but start to relax around her. The place is busy, but people aren\u2019t climbing over each other at the bar to get a drink like the night clubs I\u2019ve been to. She introduces me to three girls who she promises me I\u2019ll like. Ginger, Layla, and Penelope. They\u2019re all drop dead gorgeous, giggly, and friendly. Everyone there seems to be gorgeous, giggly, and friendly, and I can\u2019t help but wonder for the hundredth time why Storm would think I\u2019ll fit in here. But I say nothing, nodding to them all, making sure I\u2019ve got two full hands so I avoid all contact. No one seems to notice.</p><p>I get a bunch of \u201cnew girl\u201d comments from customers who are obviously regulars, but I ignore them. I keep my head down and I work hard so Cain doesn\u2019t have any reason to expand my job description to lap dances and V.I.P. room customer support. I take orders, I make drinks, I collect money without touching anyone\u2019s hand. In that order. Still, I feel eyes on me\u2014drifting over my curves, sizing me up, even with plenty of flesh to look at in this place. Asshats.</p><p>The bar is my fortress. I am safe behind this half wall.</p><p>\u201cSo, how are you making out so far?\u201d Storm asks during a two minute lull late in the night. \u201cThink you can handle bartending in a strip club six nights a week?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYeah, no big deal. Just a lot of boobs and ass cheeks and I avoid the stage so I don\u2019t see ...\u201d My attention drifts to the stage where an Asian girl wearing nothing but a piece of silver floss wraps her legs around her neck. \u201cThat!\u201d I jerk my head away. \u201cHow can she do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Cherry. She\u2019s into hot yoga.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean how. I mean ... how!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their price,\u201d is Storm\u2019s only response as she dispenses another round of Jim Beam.</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d I mutter, silently wondering if Storm has set a price.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so now that you\u2019re familiar with the bar, Kacey,\u201d Storm begins, \u201cyou can start smiling any time. You do know that if you smile at the customers, you\u2019re likely to get bigger tips, right?\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cWhy would me smiling make them give me more money when they can save it for the person humping their leg? Are they idiots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ... trust me.\u201d She sighs patiently, moving back to serve a customer, hollering over her shoulder, \u201cYou\u2019re the shiny new red-haired toy and you\u2019re forcing them to use their imagination.\u201d</p><p>Great. That\u2019s what I want to be. Some guy\u2019s wet dream.</p><p>To prove her wrong, I give the next three customers the widest grin my face can handle without splitting in half. I even wink at one. Low and behold, the tips double. Hmmm. Maybe we\u2019re on to something. If only smiling wasn\u2019t such a drain.</p><p>A middle-aged cowboy with an oversized hat and Wrangler jeans leans forward over the bar, his mouth twisted like he\u2019s chewing on a piece of straw, but there\u2019s nothing there. \u201cAin\u2019t you a pretty sight, all toned and natural,\u201d he says, lingering too long on my cle**age. Why, I don\u2019t know. I look like a ten year old boy next to every other female in this place. When he sneers, I see that his teeth are stained yellowish brown by years of tobacco.</p><p>I swallow my revulsion and force a smile. \u201cWhat can I get you tonight, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow \u2019bout a Tom Collins and a private show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne Tom Collins coming up. I\u2019m fresh out of private shows.\u201d I keep my smile, all the while my level of annoyance climbs, anxious to get rid of this guy. When I slide the drink across the bar to him, and reach for the twenty dollar bill, his paw closes over my forearm, his fingers coarse and impolite. He leans in and I catch a whiff of stale tobacco and booze on his breath. \u201cHow \u2019bout you take your break now and show me that tight ass of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just bartend here, sir,\u201d I force through gritted teeth, my body shifting into defensive mode. \u201cThere are plenty of girls here who can give you what you want.\u201d And I\u2019m not exaggerating. Everywhere I look I find ass cheeks and ni**les and worse. I played a lot of sports in high school so I\u2019ve seen my share of naked bodies in showers after games. Heck, I labeled Jenny the \u201cGrand Rapids Exhibitionist\u201d because she had no qualms with stripping down to buck in front of me. This place is different though. They\u2019re wandering around, peddling their wares. Selling their bodies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI got money! Name your price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have enough, trust me,\u201d I growl back, but I can tell he\u2019s not listening, his other hand disappearing below the bar, likely to adjust his growing arousal. I want to gag. I imagine he\u2019ll be rough when he finally corners a poor, desperate, and obviously blind woman. \u201cI\u2019d let go if I were you ... sir.\u201d</p><p>From my peripherals, I see Nate and Ben\u2019s looming frames moving in to save me. The idea of that bothers me for some reason. I don\u2019t need them to protect me.</p><p>I don\u2019t need anyone.</p> <p>And I want to hurt this guy.</p><p>I half-lean, half-jump forward to hook my free hand around the cowboy\u2019s sweaty neck. I yank down hard and fast. He grunts as his face slams against the bar. I hold it there, my fingers digging into the base of his spine. My heart is hammering against my ribs as blood rushes to my ears. This feels good. I feel alive. \u201cHow do ya like this tight ass now?\u201d I hiss.</p><p>Nate\u2019s hands slam over his shoulders and I hear his low rumble over the music as he drags the cowboy away, bleeding from a cut to his bottom lip. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to leave now, sir.\u201d The guy\u2019s also got a bright red mark on his forehead. Definitely a bruise tomorrow. He doesn\u2019t resist though. I doubt even the Incredible Hulk would resist Nate.</p><p>Ben hangs back to ask,\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I assure him as Storm sidles up to my side with a worried look. My attention trails after Nate and I cross glances with Cain sitting at a table off to the side. A sinking feeling settles over me. He must have watched the entire scene unfold. It dawns on me that maybe he doesn\u2019t want his customers\u2019 heads slammed against the bar. Maybe I just got my ass fired.</p> <p>Cain gives me a thumbs-up sign, and I release a huge sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cI told you to smile, not get yourself into a bar fight,\u201d Storm jokes, nudging me in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted a private show,\u201d I explain, my adrenaline still pumping blood through my body. \u201cI gave him a public one instead.\u201d</p><p>Ben leans forward, elbows resting over the bar, an impressed smirk on his face. \u201cYou sure know how to handle yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was raised by wolves. Had to fight for my food.\u201d</p><p>His head tilts back and a throaty laugh escapes. \u201cSorry if I was a douche bag earlier. I\u2019m just used to seeing pretty, fresh girls come in here and leave worn and jaded. I hate it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell then it\u2019s your lucky day. I\u2019m already jaded.\u201d I give him the once over. \u201cAnd maybe you shouldn\u2019t work in a strip club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what they tell me. But the money\u2019s too good and I\u2019m putting myself through law school.\u201d He catches my raised brow and his grin widens. \u201cDidn\u2019t expect that, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t give off lawyerly vibes.\u201d</p><p>Ben turns his body and rests his elbows on the bar so he faces out into the crowd while he talks to me. \u201cSo I hear you just moved here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I busy myself with wiping the counter down and stacking freshly washed glasses.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a big talker, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs fully-dressed girls have to work extra hard for our money.\u201d</p><p>His head falls back to look at me. \u201cFair enough. Listen\u2014next time you\u2019re at the gym and I\u2019m there, come get me. We can go a few rounds.\u201d He saunters away, not waiting for my response.</p> <p>Oh, I\u2019ll go a few rounds with you, but probably not the kind your crotch brain is offering. I follow his movements, about to holler, \u201cYou got it, Lawyer Boy!\u201d but the words die on my lips.</p><p>Trent is sitting at a single top bar height table.</p><p>And he\u2019s not watching the naked pretzel on the stage. He\u2019s watching me.</p><p>Check that. Staring at me.</p><p>Trent is here and he\u2019s staring at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell ...\u201d I grumble to no one in particular, ducking my head. I can\u2019t deal with him and what he does to me now. Here. Tonight. Fuck!</p><p>I sense a form step up to the bar and I cautiously look up. It\u2019s Nate, thank God. He\u2019s back from the cowboy eviction already. \u201cIs that guy bothering you, Kacey?\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cNah.\u201d Yes, but not for the reasons you think.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d He pivots his massive body to check the table. Trent\u2019s still there, leaning his long body back into his chair, sipping on his straw, his focus now on Cherry. \u201cHe\u2019s been there for half an hour. He\u2019s been watching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has?\u201d I squeak and then quickly add in a normal tone, \u201che\u2019s my neighbor. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Nate\u2019s dark orbs wander the rest of the room, looking for grabby guys that he can toss out the door, no doubt. \u201cYou make sure you tell me if he bothers you, okay, Kacey?\u201d</p><p>When I don\u2019t answer, he looks down at me again, that thunderous voice of his a little softer. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYup, you got it, Nate.\u201d</p><p>With a curt bob of his head, he wanders back to stand at his post like a sentry. One who could rip a guy\u2019s legs right out of their sockets if he sneezes too hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Storm sneaks up behind me.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing.\u201d My voice is still shaky and I can\u2019t get my tongue to work properly. I hazard another glance over at Trent. He\u2019s leaning into the table, toying with his straw, while Mediterranean Barbie\u2014Bella, I think she goes by\u2014presses her scantily clad body against his thigh. I watch as she gestures toward the V.I.P. room, her hand slipping over the back of his neck affectionately.</p><p>\u201cYou okay? You look like you\u2019re trying to choke someone.\u201d She\u2019s right, I realize, as I notice my fists wringing the dish cloth in my hand like it\u2019s a neck. It is someone\u2019s neck right about now. Bella\u2019s ...</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I toss the cloth down and hazard one more peek at Trent, the same second his gorgeous blue eyes dart back to touch mine. I jump. He gives me that teasing smile that peels away my defenses, leaving me as naked as the dancers on stage. Why does he affect me so? It\u2019s unnerving!</p><p>\u201cUh, that\u2019s not \u2018nothing,\u2019 Kacey. Are you looking at that guy? Who is that?\u201d She leans over my shoulder to catch my line of sight. \u201cIsn\u2019t that\u2014\u201d</p><p>My hand goes up to gently shove her face back. \u201cTurnaround! Now he knows we\u2019re talking about him.\u201d</p><p>Storm doubles over, laughing. \u201cKacey\u2019s got a crush,\u201d she sings. \u201cOur neighbor\u2019s eye-humping you. Go and talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I growl back, throwing my best set of icy eye daggers at her.</p><p>She ducks her head and busies herself by clearing glasses off the bar. I can tell she\u2019s stung by the venom in my tone. Guilt instantly swells inside me. Dammit, Storm!</p><p>I struggle to ignore Trent\u2019s table, but it\u2019s like passing a train wreck. It\u2019s impossible not to look. By the end of the night, I\u2019m exhausted and annoyed by the seismic waves of jealousy crashing into me as the parade of strippers visit his table, touching him, giggling, one of them sliding up onto his lap to talk. My only relief comes from the fact that Trent politely declines them all.</p><p>Reaching into her purse that sits between us in the console, Storm tosses a thick envelope on my lap.</p><p>Without much thought, I tear it open and flip through the bills. \u201cHoly shit! There\u2019s got to be, like ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told you so!\u201d She sings, adding with a wink, \u201cnow imagine what you\u2019d make if you got up on stage.\u201d</p><p>There had to be five hundred dollars in here! Easy! \u201cYou\u2019ve been working at Penny\u2019s for ... four years you said? Why are you still on Jackson Drive? You could have bought a house!\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cI was married for a year to Mia\u2019s father. I had to claim bankruptcy after I left him because he racked up so much debt. No bank\u2019s going to give me a mortgage now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounds like a real ... jackhole.\u201d I shift in my seat, uncomfortable for more than the fact that we\u2019re in her Jeep. Storm is getting into her private life and my defenses naturally go up. When people share, they expect you to reciprocate.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it,\u201d she murmurs, her voice drifting off. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad in the beginning. I was sixteen when I met Damon. I got pregnant and he got into drugs. We needed money bad so I started working for Cain after Mia was born. Damon said I had to get these if I wanted to make any real money,\u201d she gestures at her br**sts. \u201cOf course I was stupid enough to agree.\u201d A rare spike of bitterness laces her words. \u201cIt hurt like hell. That\u2019s the only reason I haven\u2019t gone back to get them reduced. I swear, the thing girls will do when they\u2019re blind to love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when did you finally decide to leave him?\u201d I ask before I can stop myself.</p><p>\u201cThe second time he kicked the crap out of me.\u201d</p><p>She says it so matter of fact that I\u2019m sure I misheard her. \u201cOh ... I\u2019m sorry, Storm.\u201d And I am. The idea of someone hitting Storm instantly gets my hackles raised.</p><p>\u201cThe first time, I lied to everyone. Told them I ran into a wall.\u201d She snorts. \u201cThey didn\u2019t buy it, but they let me live in my little delusion. But the second time ...\u201d She exhales heavily. \u201cI came in to work with a fat lip and a bloody nose. Cain and Nate drove me right back home and stood over me while I packed Mia\u2019s and my things. Damon came in as we were walking out the door. Nate roughed him up a bit. Warned him if he ever comes near me or Mia again, he\u2019ll be peeing through a straw. And you\u2019ve seen Nate.\u201d Storm gives me a wide-eyed look. \u201cHe can do it.\u201d She pulls into her parking spot outside our building and shuts the Jeep off.</p> <p>\u201cCain set me up with the apartment and I\u2019ve been here ever since, hoarding all my money until I have enough to buy a house with cash. If all goes well, I\u2019ll be out of the club scene for good in another two or three years.\u201d She adds softly, \u201cand my parents don\u2019t have to be ashamed of me anymore.\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cTell me about it. My parents would be rolling in their graves if they knew where I\u2019m working ...\u201d My voice drifts off into an awkward silence, mentally chastising myself for bringing them up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kacey?\u201d There\u2019s that cautious, nervous Storm voice again and my shoulders tense. I know exactly where this is going. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve pieced together a few things\u2014your parents are dead, I think it has something to do with alcohol ... you have a lot of scars. You don\u2019t like people touching your hands ...\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t let her finish. I open the door and rush out.</p><p>I decide that Storm is brilliant. A regular f**king rocket scientist.</p><p>Chapter Five</p> <p>\u201cAir conditioning!\u201d I moan, peeling my sheets from my sweaty body. We need real friggin\u2019 curtains, I think to myself, as I glare at the airy scraps hanging in front of the window. They do nothing to stop the sun from beating in. We haven\u2019t had air conditioning since before my parents died. Aunt Darla didn\u2019t believe in paying for cool air when there are starving kids in the world. Or husbands with gambling problems. Now that we live in Miami, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s not illegal.</p><p>Livie and Mia are in the kitchen, humming \u2018pop goes the weasel\u2019 as they empty a brown bags\u2019 worth of groceries. \u201cGood afternoon!\u201d Livie sings when she sees me.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon!\u201d Mia echoes.</p><p>I check the clock. Almost one. They\u2019re right. It is afternoon. I haven\u2019t slept in that late in forever.</p><p>\u201cI picked up food. There\u2019s money on the counter there.\u201d Livie\u2019s chin directs me to a small pile of bills. \u201cI had to argue Storm down to half of what she wanted to pay me.\u201d</p><p>I smile. Storm swears she\u2019s found her angels. I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ve found ours. I need to cut my bullshit with her, I decide, then and there. I don\u2019t know how, but I need to. Strolling over to grab the money from my purse, I slap the thick envelope onto the table. \u201cBam! Take that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly Sh ...\u201d Livie\u2019s wide eyes pass from the stack of money to Mia\u2019s curious face \u201c... shnikies! You just served drinks ... right?\u201d</p><p>So Livie figured it out on her own. I c**k my head and narrow my eyes, pausing for effect as if I'm in deep thought. \u201cDefine serving drinks.\u201d I chuckle as I pull out the OJ from the fridge and chug straight from the bottle, feeling her glower at my back. \u201cI\u2019m kidding! Yes, just drinks. And an ass sandwich for one lucky grabber.\u201d Mia\u2019s brows spike and I wince, mouthing \u201csorry\u201d to a scowling Livie. It\u2019s quickly forgotten though as she flips through the wad of money with her thumb. \u201cHoly cow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d I know I have a stupid grin on my face and I don\u2019t care. This might work. We might survive. We might not have to eat cat food.</p><p>Livie looks up with a secretive smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She pauses, then, \u201cNothing I just ... you\u2019re giddy.\u201d She bites into a baby carrot. \u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>Mia mimics her, scrunching her nose like a rabbit as she chews. \u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d she parrots.</p><p>I steal one from the bag, smash a giant kiss on Livie\u2019s cheek, and then swagger toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the shower while you count all our money. And remind me to phone Starbucks and quit, okay?\u201d There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going back to minimum wage. No way in Hell.</p><p>I don\u2019t care that there\u2019s no pressure. I don\u2019t care that the water has a funky chlorinated scent to it. I simply close my eyes and massage a thick layer of shampoo into my scalp, inhaling its rosy fragrance. For the first time since stealing off into the night with Livie, I think I can do this. I can take care of us. I\u2019m old enough, strong enough, smart enough. My issues won\u2019t hold us back. Everything will be alright. We\u2019ll come out of it clean and strong and ...</p><p>An odd soft rattling sound pulls me from my revelry. Cracking a lid, I spot red, black, and white stripes coiled around the pipe above the shower head. Two beady little eyes stare intently at me.</p><p>It takes a whole second for me to scream. Once I do, I can\u2019t stop. Scrambling backward to slam against the opposite wall, I don\u2019t know how I manage to stay upright, but I do. The snake doesn\u2019t move. It sits in the exact same spot, shaking its tail and staring at me. Like its deciding how it\u2019ll fit its jaws around my head to swallow me whole. I continue shrieking as I hear Livie\u2019s panicked voice behind the door, but it doesn\u2019t register. Her pounding doesn\u2019t register.</p><p>Nothing registers.</p><p>Suddenly there\u2019s a loud crack and sound of wood splintering. \u201cKacey!\u201d Livie shrieks as a set of strong arms swoop in to pull me out. A towel quickly lands on me and I\u2019m being whisked out of the bathroom and into my bedroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hate snakes. I hate snakes. Fuck! I hate snakes!\u201d I repeat over and over again to no one and everyone. A hand smooths my hair. Not until my heart rate slows to a semi-normal range and I stop shaking am I able to focus on my surroundings.</p><p>On Trent\u2019s furrowed brow and the flecks of turquoise in his irises.</p><p>I\u2019m in his arms.</p><p>Naked and sitting on Trent\u2019s lap, in his arms.</p> <p>My heart rate ramps back up to a dangerous level as I appreciate this new situation. His shirt is soaked and covered in my shampoo. I can feel the warm skin of his forearms against my bare back and under my knees as he holds me tight to him. All vital body parts are completely covered from view with a towel, but I can\u2019t be any more naked than I am at that moment.</p><p>Livie storms in, eyes blazing. \u201cWho do you think you are, barging in here?\u201d she screams, her face as red as my hair, looking ready to claw Trent\u2019s face off.</p><p>\u201cTrent. This is Trent.\u201d I answer. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Livie. There\u2019s ... there\u2019s a rattlesnake in the shower.\u201d I shudder involuntarily. \u201cGet Mia out of here before it eats her. And get Tanner here. Now Livie!\u201d</p><p>Livie\u2019s attention passes from me to Trent and back to me, drifting down to my bed. She doesn\u2019t want to leave me, I can see that. But finally she decides something and nods. She closes the door behind her.</p><p>Trent pulls me tight against him until I feel his chest\u2019s hard ridges pressed against my arm. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he whispers, his mouth so close that his bottom lip grazes my ear. I shudder again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fantastic,\u201d I whisper, adding, \u201caside from almost dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you screaming from next door. I thought someone was killing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot someone. Something! Did you see it?\u201d One arm flies out, gesturing toward the bathroom, while the other fusses to keep my towel up to cover my br**sts. \u201cI was two seconds away from behind eaten alive!\u201d</p><p>Now Trent starts to chuckle\u2014a soft, beautiful sound that vibrates through my body and warms my core. \u201cI think that\u2019s Lenny. 2B\u2019s pet snake. I saw a little bald man checking the bushes in the commons this morning, calling its name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPet?\u201d I spit out the word as I sit up straight. \u201cThat man eater is someone\u2019s pet? Isn\u2019t there a law against owning rattlers?\u201d</p><p>Trent\u2019s blue eyes roam my face as he smirks, settling on my lips. \u201cIt\u2019s a milk snake. From what I know, the only thing it\u2019s going to eat is a mouse.\u201d He\u2019s so close to me now that his breath caresses my cheek. With my body pressed to him, I feel his heart beat hammering fast against my shoulder, rivaling my own. He can feel this too. It\u2019s not just me. He lifts a hand to cup my chin. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to hurt you, Kacey.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the stress of the situation, or this sizzling burn inside my belly that flares whenever Trent\u2019s around, or an uncontainable internal beast repressed for too long, but this whole situation has gone from terrifying to freaking hot in a split second.</p><p>I can't help myself.</p><p>I crash into Trent\u2019s mouth, my hand fisting the front of his shirt, snapping several buttons with no effort as I force myself onto him. There\u2019s a second of resistance\u2014just a second where his mouth and body doesn\u2019t respond\u2014but it quickly dissolves. His arm slides out from my knees to grip my side, scorching my bare skin. It\u2019s him that deepens the kiss, slipping his tongue into my mouth, one hand working its way through my shampoo-coated hair, gripping a handful at the nap of my neck tightly. He forces my head back as his tongue connects with mine, his mouth sweet and fresh. He\u2019s strong, that much I can sense. If I wanted to, I don\u2019t think I could fight him off. But I don\u2019t want to. Not one bit.</p><p>Without breaking his connection to my mouth, Trent somehow shifts me onto my back and now he\u2019s hovering over me on my bed, our torsos flattened against each other, my inner thighs hugging his hips while his forearms keep his full weight off my body. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, what I\u2019m doing, what has taken over all rational thought, but I know I don\u2019t want it to stop. Every fiber of my body is craving it.</p><p>Craving Trent.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019ve come up for my first gasp of air after being under water for years.</p><p>Unfortunately, it does stop. Abruptly. He breaks free and pulls away, panting as he gazes down at me with an incredulous look. His eyes never leave mine, not to wander for even a second. If they did, he'd see that my towel has slid off and I\u2019m lying underneath him, stark naked. Body and soul.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t why I pulled you out of the shower,\u201d he whispers.</p> <p>I swallow, searching for my voice. The one I find is hoarse. \u201cNo, but it\u2019s worked out rather well for you, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He gives me that lop-sided smile that makes my body heat up like someone\u2019s taken a blowtorch to it. But then his eyes cool, searching my face. \u201cIsn\u2019t it exhausting?\u201d The pad of his thumb strokes my neck softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeping people out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I deny quickly, my voice faltering in betrayal as his words punch me in the gut. How can he see what I don\u2019t want him to see, what I work so hard to conceal? He\u2019s found a way in, that\u2019s how. Like a trespasser, he\u2019s invaded my space, breaching security and sliding in to take what I haven\u2019t offered to him.</p><p>The fire he\u2019s able to elicit in my body so easily still burns, only now I find the need to battle against the consuming flames. \u201cI don\u2019t want this. I don\u2019t want you.\u201d The words taste acrid in my mouth because I know I don\u2019t mean them. I do want this. I do want you, Trent.</p><p>Trent crashes in to my mouth, and my treacherous body leans forward, exposing me for the liar that I am. But he keeps his hands on either side of my head now, clenching my pillow tightly as if he\u2019s trying to maintain control. I, on the other hand, have lost all control, I realize, as my fingers slide under his shirt to claw at his back, as my legs wrap around him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want this, Kacey?\u201d he growls in my ear, pressing his erection against me.</p><p>\u201cNo ...\u201d I whisper, my lips trailing his neck. Then I begin to laugh at myself, at my stubbornness. At how ridiculous I must look right now, my body writhing against his. That little bit of laugher is like a lifeline thrown out to me. I seize it and let it drag me back from the brink. Tearing my mouth from his neck, I growl, \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>He lays three more light kisses on my jawline and then softly grazes my cheek with his knuckles. \u201cOkay, Kacey.\u201d He climbs off me and stands. I inhale sharply as his eyes draw in the length of my body with a hungry, dark look. It only lasts a second, but it unleashes a need deep in my lower belly. He turns around and heads to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll take the heat for the doors from Tanner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoors?\u201d Plural?</p><p>He still hasn\u2019t turned around. \u201cYeah. Your front door and the bathroom door. If he\u2019s going to boot someone out, I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>And then he\u2019s gone.</p><p>Dammit! That guy is the dictionary definition of a contradiction. He skates between nice guy and bad boy so fluidly, I never seem to catch the transition. It would be easier if he was a pigheaded player, but here he is, breaking down doors to save me from snakes. I, on the other hand, go from bitch to sexual attacker and back to bitch in three heart beats and he just flashes those damn dimples. I guess I\u2019m not much better in terms of a contradiction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I finally emerge from my room fifteen minutes later, our apartment has been invaded. Livie\u2019s in the kitchen, standing next to a sexy disheveled Storm with a crying five year old in her arms. Clearly my screams yanked Storm out of a dead sleep because she's wearing nothing but a tank and thong.</p><p>A police officer is interviewing a short balding man with the perpetrator coiled around his wrist. I shiver. Lenny, I presume. Trent\u2019s right. Now that I see the thing, it\u2019s not nearly as big as I first thought. Still, I fold my arms across my chest protectively, feeling its beady little eyes sizing me up.</p><p>Tanner hovers beside the busted front door, scratching the back of his head as if confused by the splinters of wood. I have to admit, I\u2019m more than a little impressed. Trent\u2019s a big guy, but I wouldn\u2019t bet money that he could break through not one, but two doors to save me. That little bit of knowledge makes the guilt over kicking him out of my room churn faster.</p><p>Trent stands quietly beside him, his hands in his back pockets as he looks down at the mess. His shirt is half undone where I tore the buttons, drenched and clinging to a sculpted chest. Even with present company, that sight makes my mouth dry up.</p> <p>Storm\u2019s the first to run to me after handing Mia off to Livie. She throws her arms around my neck. I still flinch, but not as bad as I did the first time she did it. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d If my leaving her in the car last night bothers her, I can\u2019t tell.</p><p>Over her shoulder, I watch the officer and the little bald man\u2019s eyes bug out, riveted to Storm\u2019s ass. The officer, at least, has the decency to flush and avert his attention to a worn spot on the linoleum. The bald man, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t; his grin widening. \u201cI\u2019ll be better after I go punch that guy in the nose,\u201d I say loudly enough for him to hear me. He looks away, caught red-handed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Pervie Pete,\u201d she whispers, cringing as she stretches the back of her shirt down to cover her bare backside. It\u2019s futile. The shirt\u2019s too short and her thong is too revealing. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She scurries out.</p><p>Tanner looks up from the splintered mess. \u201cOh, hey, Kerry.\u201d</p><p>Kerry? My brow arches severely. \u201cHey ... Larry! How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p> <p>Livie tries to muffle her snort with her hand. At first Tanner looks confused, but then a toothy grin stretches across his face. \u201cKacey,\u201d he corrects himself. \u201cSorry ... Kacey.\u201d</p><p>The police officer patiently scratches down notes on a pad as we replay the entire incident while taking frequent breaks to stare at Storm now that she\u2019s dressed. At the end, he gives Mia a sheriff badge sticker which makes her grin from ear to ear. Pervie Pete apologizes profusely and takes Lenny back to his cage, swearing to a stern Tanner that he\u2019ll double check to make sure the cage is secured well. The officer asks me if I want to press charges against Trent and I glare at him like he\u2019s grown an arm out of his ass.</p><p>When the officer leaves\u2014not before giving Storm a long, appreciative smile\u2014Tanner and Trent are still staring at the two broken doors. \u201cI understand that this was an emergency, but ... er ... I need to get this fixed and Perv-\u201d Tanner clears his voice, \u201cPeter will take a while to come up with the money. I doubt these gals have insurance ...\u201d Tanner reaches into his back pocket to pull out his wallet. \u201cI\u2019ve got, um, a hundred bucks I can throw in.\u201d</p><p>My jaw drops. What? I\u2019m expecting a tirade and eviction notice and here Tanner is, offering to pay for our door? Livie, Storm, and I share a look of shock. Before I can get a word in though, Trent\u2019s handing Tanner a fistful of money from his wallet. \u201cHere. This should cover it.\u201d Tanner takes it with a nod, and then exits without another word, leaving us all speechless.</p><p>Trent walks over to Livie and thrusts out a hand. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Trent. We haven\u2019t met formally.\u201d</p><p>Whatever rage Livie had running through her veins has extinguished, leaving her blushing and as awkward as a tittering twelve year old. She shakes his hand quickly before recoiling as if she might get pregnant with the touch, her eyes avoiding anything to do with his half-open shirt and that gorgeous toned body underneath. I grin inwardly. My chaste Livie.</p> <p>Trent introduces himself to Storm next. She blushes sweetly and an unwarranted stab of jealousy pricks me. When he moves on to Mia hiding behind Storm\u2019s legs, I catch Storm\u2019s exaggerated wink of approval. I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd you must be Princess Mia? I\u2019ve heard about you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pucker and she leans out just a bit further from Storm\u2019s cover. \u201cYou have?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cWell, I heard about a Princess Mia who likes ice cream. That must be you, right?\u201d</p><p>She nods slowly and whispers, \u201cDid you hear that, Mommy? People know I\u2019m a princess!\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughs. Everyone but me. I\u2019m too busy fighting this internal battle inside that tells me I must resist this charm. It\u2019s all an act. He\u2019s no good for me.</p><p>Actually, that\u2019s not it at all, I hate to admit.</p><p>The problem is that I know he\u2019s too good for me.</p> <p>Trent stands up to face me. \u201cYou going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>Always so concerned about me. I nod, my arms folding over my chest as I look down at my robe, fidgeting awkwardly under that scrutinizing gaze of his, remembering the feel of his body pressed against mine. And that he pulled me from the shower, buck naked and cowering.</p><p>All kinds of humiliation roils through me now.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if my discomfort registers with Trent, but he takes a few steps back, his hand pushing back through his hair. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you guys around.\u201d He winks at me. \u201cNeed to wash off all this soap. I hope my shower isn\u2019t as eventful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah ...\u201d I mumble, feeling stupid, following his body move, quickly plotting how I can plant something in his shower so I have an excuse to bust down his door and jump in to save him. Not a snake. He doesn\u2019t seem to be afraid of snakes. Maybe a gator. Yeah, there\u2019re lots of those in Florida. Just a quick trip to the Everglades, I\u2019ll find one, trap it, bring it back\u2014</p><p>\u201cKacey?\u201d</p><p>I snap back to the present with Storm\u2019s voice, her brow arched as she looks at me, smirking. I\u2019ve obviously missed a question. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Trent would love to have dinner with us as a thank you.\u201d I see the gleam in her eye. She\u2019s playing match maker.</p><p>I don\u2019t like it.</p><p>Trent doesn\u2019t want this mess.</p><p>\u201cDo whatever you want. I\u2019ll be at the gym,\u201d I answer and my tone is an arctic breeze, freezing any mirth in the room. I spin on my heels and stalk back into my room before anyone can get a word in edgewise.</p><p>And I hate myself.</p><p>The Breaking Point is quieter than usual for late-afternoon, but I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019m still reeling from today\u2019s snake excitement. And Trent. I need my nice, quiet routine. I quickly stretch and get ready to start my rounds on the bag.</p><p>\u201cHey, Red!\u201d Ben\u2019s voice booms from behind.</p><p>Dammit. I turn to catch him just as his attention shifts up from my ass. \u201cBen.\u201d</p><p>He strides around and grabs my bag for me. \u201cYou need a spotter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m getting one either way, aren\u2019t I?\u201d I grumble. But then his sly smirk makes me laugh for some reason, releasing the tension in my body. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can teach me.\u201d Then he flashes that grin again, as he adds, \u201cI prefer being in control but for you I can ...\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s jabbering away with layers of innuendos and I stop listening. Just to teach him a lesson, I surprise him with a roundhouse kick. He grunts as the bag slams into his hip. \u201cConsider that your first lesson. Shut up. Don\u2019t talk to me while I\u2019m working out.\u201d</p><p>For the next fifteen minutes, I pound away at the bag with jabs and kicks and Ben does a half-decent job of shifting with the impact. If he talks, I don\u2019t hear him. I\u2019m zoned in on the sequence that propels me forward, hammering again and again, releasing all that anger with each hit.</p><p>Three idiots getting drunk one night.</p> <p>Three murderers taking my life from me.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>Finally spent, I lean forward and support myself against my knees with my hands to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cJeez, Kace.\u201d I look up to see astonishment on Ben\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone so completely dialed during rounds. You were like Ivan Drago. He\u2019s this Russian who\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off, reciting the line from Rocky IV with a mock Russian accent. \u201cIf he dies, he dies.\u201d Another of my dad\u2019s favs.</p> <p>Ben\u2019s head is bobbing, his brows arched with surprise. \u201cYou know that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d I can\u2019t help but chuckle again. Soon we\u2019re both laughing and I\u2019m thinking Ben isn\u2019t such a pompous ass after all.</p><p>That\u2019s when a tall form walks past us and drops a sledge hammer down on my shields.</p><p>Trent.</p><p>My laughter dies, all traces of ease vanishing. Grabbing my water bottle, I try to hide my reaction from Ben by drawing a long swig, all the while watching Trent as he drops his stuff to the ground beside a speed bag and tugs his sweatshirt over his head by the back collar.</p><p>What the f**k is he doing here? In my gym? This is my ... Holy ... A dribble of water runs down my chin and I wipe it away with my forearm, trying hard not to gape at the defined body that has emerged, covered only by a white tank. He keeps his back to me without a glance in my direction and begins punching the speed bag with precision that surprises me. As if he\u2019s well-trained. I watch for a moment, mesmerized and a little disappointed that he hasn\u2019t acknowledged me, even though I don\u2019t deserve his attention.</p> <p>Maybe he doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here.</p><p>I doubt that.</p><p>Black ink curls peek out from the edges of his tank. Whatever the tattoo is, it spans the width of his upper back from shoulder blade to shoulder blade. I\u2019d love to peel that shirt off and study his ink while he\u2019s stretched out on my bed.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve seen that guy at Penny\u2019s,\u201d Ben notes. So he\u2019s caught me staring at Trent. Great.</p><p>\u201cYou got something for him?\u201d I tease coolly.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I hear someone does.\u201d I can\u2019t miss the suggestive tone in his voice.</p><p>Bloody Storm. \u201cHe\u2019s my neighbor. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYup. I don\u2019t have a thing for anyone. Including you.\u201d I take a swing at my bag.</p><p>He smirks secretly. \u201cAren\u2019t you gonna go over and say \u2018hi\u2019 to your neighbor then?\u201d</p><p>I answer with roundhouse kick. Ben finally takes the hint, diving in to secure the bag. He doesn\u2019t mention Trent again.</p><p>I do my best to complete a second round but my head\u2019s not in it anymore and it\u2019s all because of that smexy guy on the other side of the room, pounding away on the punching bag. As much as I try not to look, I find myself glancing over frequently.</p><p>This last time, I catch Trent wiping the sweat from his brow with the bottom of his shirt, pulled up to reveal a perfect eight-pack. I suck in a breath, temporarily paralyzed, my heart rate shoots through the roof, staring ...</p><p>Something sharp snaps across my ass. \u201cOw!\u201d I scream and spin around to find Ben with his towel and a devilish grin.</p><p>\u201cDid you just snap my ass with your towel?\u201d I growl.</p><p>My anger doesn\u2019t seem to faze him. My punch to his ribs does. He doubles over in pain, moaning. \u201cHope it was worth it, ass**le.\u201d I stoop down to grab my things. When I stand, I meet Trent\u2019s gaze head on. His face is blank but his eyes ... Even from this distance, I see a world of determination, hurt, and anger in them.</p><p>He knew I was here. He knew all along.</p><p>After a long stare, Trent turns his back to me and starts pounding on the bag again and suddenly I feel like I\u2019m the bag, that someone is pummeling me with guilt. And pain. I\u2019m actually hurting over Trent.</p><p>I\u2019ve had enough.</p><p>I storm out to the women\u2019s locker room without another word to Ben. For half an hour I sit on the wooden bench in that room\u2014a tiny, dark dungeon with two shower stalls and little room to maneuver\u2014and I fight to bury all these unwanted emotions clawing their way up the well. Why does he have to be out there? Why this gym? Is he stalking me? In reality, I know that this is the only specialized gym on this side of Miami so if he\u2019s a trained fighter, it makes sense that he ends up here. Still ...</p><p>I\u2019m used to having things in control. I fight to stay numb. That\u2019s how I get through each day and it\u2019s worked well for me. Until now. Now Trent has edged into my life and I can\u2019t focus. My body is going haywire, I\u2019m battling this internal urge to push him away and hold him close, I\u2019m thinking about him far too often. Even the thought of him now kindles desire inside me that I haven\u2019t felt since my last random encounter more than two years ago. Only now it\u2019s a million times more acute, more needy. I rock forward and back, my forehead in my hands. I don\u2019t want this. I don\u2019t want this. I don\u2019t want this ...</p><p>I hear a soft knock on the door. Hope gushes like water through a busted dam and I realize it\u2019s because I want it to be Trent. I can\u2019t help myself. I want it. I want him. Please be ...</p><p>A contrite-looking Ben stands on the other side of the door, bowling me over with disappointment. \u201cAre you okay? I\u2019m sorry. I probably hit you harder than I should have but you were off in Lala Land.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer, adrenaline racing through my limbs, my heart racing, frustration pounding. I look up into that face and see a sweet, genuine guy. One that\u2019s become appealing in this very moment. Right or wrong, destructive or not, I grab hold of Ben\u2019s shirt with two fists and haul him into the change room. He doesn\u2019t resist, though by his sluggish movements he\u2019s not entirely sure what\u2019s happening. I shove him into the shower stall and snap the lock on the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cTake your clothes off. Don\u2019t touch my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I can tell this isn\u2019t what Ben expected. Hell, this isn\u2019t what I expected. But I need to dislodge this Trent problem and mindless sex with someone else ought to do it.</p><p>When Ben doesn\u2019t move, I seize his shirt and yank him down to my mouth. He finally gets a clue. His hands tug at the back of my tank as he pulls me against him, his tongue sliding into my mouth. His kiss is sweet, but it\u2019s not like ... no, stop it Kacey. You\u2019re doing this to forget about Trent.</p><p>Just his name sets fireworks off inside my body.</p><p>\u201cKacey,\u201d Ben moans, his hands travelling up to my shoulders and down, over my br**sts, squeezing them as they pass. He breaks long enough to yank my tank top over my head before he covers my mouth with his again. It\u2019s a confined space but he makes the most of it, lifting me onto the little bench against the wall so I\u2019m towering over him. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were in to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop talking,\u201d I command as I shimmy my shorts and panties down. His hand is instantly on my inner thigh and sliding up. Up. Until it\u2019s exactly where I want it to be.</p><p>I lean back and close my eyes.</p><p>And imagine Trent doing that.</p><p>Ben doesn\u2019t waste any time, dropping to his knees to following his hand with his mouth. \u201cGod, you're sweet,\u201d he moans. I briefly imagine fitting him with a muzzle to stop him from talking. But then he\u2019d be no use to me. And he really is of use to me right now. Right or wrong, it\u2019s been so long since I allowed this or even wanted it. I lean back and relax, taking from Ben what I need.</p> <p>It\u2019s all working out well.</p><p>But then Ben has to go and ruin it. He does exactly what I told him not to. He slides his hand into mine.</p><p>It\u2019s instant shock, like I\u2019ve been plunged into a bath of ice water after sitting in a hot tub for an hour. All pleasure disintegrates and I recoil from his mouth and his touch, shoving his face away from me.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Ben. Just go. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Confusion fills his face as he looks up at me, like I just admitted to a triple homicide while whisking a bowl of cake batter.</p> <p>\u201cYou touched my hands. I told you not to. Leave.\u201d</p><p>He still doesn\u2019t move, an incredulous smirk touching his mouth. \u201cAre you for real?\u201d</p><p>I lean forward, unlatch the lock and shove Ben out of the stall with the most prominent hard on through his shorts I\u2019ve seen in a while. With him out, I latch the door again and crumble to the ground, hugging my knees to my body.</p><p>That didn\u2019t help after all.</p><p>In fact, that made things a thousand times worse.</p><p>Nausea churns inside me. How could I be so selfish? Ben\u2019s going to hate me now. What\u2019s more, now that that intense sex haze has worn off, I actually feel embarrassed for doing that to him. I\u2019ve never felt guilty over my exploits. And ... I gasp out loud. What if Trent hears about this? Ohmigod. My forehead drops against my knees.</p> <p>I care. I care what Trent thinks. I care if it bothers him. I just ... care. And no matter what I do, I\u2019m not going to be able to shake that. Not with random sex, or being a bitch, or any of the other dozen cruel methods I use to try and push him away. Somehow he\u2019s managed to slide a finger in under my titanium coat and touch me in a way that no one else has ever touched me.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Bar well shots are two for one at Penny\u2019s tonight so the place is hopping, keeping Storm and I on our toes all night to the point where my body wears a thin sheen of sweat. Cain has managed to find Nate\u2019s twin\u2014another dark gargantuan brute\u2014to guard our bar like a grim-faced sentry, ready to toss grabby patrons to the curb in the blink of an eye. In fact, the place has almost as many bouncers as it does dancers, tonight. Including Ben. He hasn\u2019t said two words to me since that afternoon at the gym, and that suits me fine. I\u2019d prefer to hang my head in shame without the constant reminder.</p><p>Cain leans over the bar as I line up ten shots of vodka. \u201cHow do you like Penny\u2019s so far, Kacey?\u201d he asks over the music.</p><p>I offer him a nod and smile. \u201cIt\u2019s great, Cain. Money\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Saving that for college I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Just likely not for me.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you interested in?\u201d</p> <p>I pause, deciding how to answer that one. I choose honesty versus a smart ass remark. This is my boss, after all. \u201cNot sure. Don\u2019t have a lot of direction right now.\u201d For some reason, Cain\u2019s question doesn\u2019t bother me. It doesn\u2019t feel intrusive. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about getting my little sister into pre-med.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. This famous raven-haired angel that Storm has praised.\u201d Cain\u2019s shrewd eyes narrow. \u201cYou\u2019re a hard worker and you\u2019re welcome here as long as you need the job, but make sure you find that direction soon. You can do better than slinging drinks. Keep up the good work.\u201d He pats the bar and continues on, leaving me staring at his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his story?\u201d I ask Storm.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think he may be one of the most interesting people I\u2019ve ever met. A paradox to the strip club owner persona. I haven\u2019t seen him so much as squeeze an ass. He takes the time to say hi. Now he\u2019s encouraging me not to work here because I\u2019m too good for the place.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s definitely special. He had a hard upbringing. It had to do with clubs and the women in his life being abused.\u201d She grabs the bottle of JD from in front of me. \u201cSpeaking of Trent ...\u201d</p><p>What? The sudden change of topic sends me reeling. With a smug grin, Storm jerks her chin over to a table not far from us. Sure enough, there\u2019s Trent. He\u2019s shown up for the last three nights at eleven by himself. He doesn\u2019t approach me. He just orders his drinks and sits at a safe distance. I know he\u2019s watching me, though. My skin prickles under his gaze. It\u2019s beginning to get on my nerves.</p><p>\u201cKace.\u201d Storm leans in. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I grab a knife and a lime and begin slicing it into eighths.</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. \u201cWhy do you keep ignoring him? He stops by every night to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, in a strip club. Every night. By himself. That\u2019s what we call a freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hardly looks at the dancers, Kace,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen you looking at him all night, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not!\u201d I claim too quickly, my voice shrill. I\u2019ve tried not to, I tell myself. Apparently I\u2019ve failed miserably.</p><p>She ignores me. \u201cI think Trent really likes you and he seems like a nice guy. There\u2019s nothing wrong with going to talk to him, at least. I know you\u2019re not a mean person, deep down.\u201d</p><p>I fight back the guilt that\u2019s swelling inside. Yes I am, Storm. I am mean. I do it intentionally. It\u2019s safer that way. For everyone. \u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d I set my jaw as I keep cutting.</p><p>She lets out a huge exhale. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that. I\u2019m going to ask him out then \u2018cause he is fine.\u201d</p><p>My jaw drops as my eyes fly to Storm\u2019s face and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s outright murder shining in them. How can she betray me like that? And she calls herself a friend?</p><p>\u201cHa! Gotcha!\u201d Storm holds up a finger. \u201cI knew it. Admit it. Admit you want to go over and talk to that sex on a stick.\u201d She slides away with a teasing grin, singing, \u201cTrent and Kacey ... sittin\u2019 in a tree ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Right now my face feels like a burning hot forest fire. I try to ignore Storm, Trent, and the ever-looming Nate as a customer comes up order a drink. \u201cTwo Whiskey Sours, coming right up!\u201d I announce, slamming two tumbler glasses onto the counter. I have no clue what goes in a Whisky Sour and I doubt this guy wants me experimenting. I raise an expectant brow to Storm.</p><p>She responds by crossing her arms over her chest. \u201cNot unless you go talk to him.\u201d</p><p>I purse my lips. \u201cFine,\u201d I hiss. \u201cAfter. Now would you help me with the drinks before I poison this fine gentleman?\u201d</p><p>With a victorious smirk, Storm tosses two drinks together and slides them over the bar.</p><p>\u201cThat sweet southern bell thing is all an act, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The smirk morphs into an innocent pout. \u201cI reckon I don\u2019t know what you could possibly mean,\u201d she drawls, fanning herself with a dish cloth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Somehow, whether it\u2019s her teasing or her obvious ecstatic mood over wearing me down, my face splits into a grin.</p><p>\u201cHalleluiah! Look at that! Miss Kacey is smilin\u2019 again!\u201d She presses the back of her hand against her forehead. \u201cAin\u2019t it a blessed sight?\u201d</p><p>She flinches as the piece of lime I pelt at her hits her thigh. But then I follow up with a deep bow. \u201cTeach me, you must. Become great, I will.\u201d</p><p>Storm gives me a playful shove and then goes back to serve the next guy, while a sudden flurry of nervous activity erupts inside me. Oh God, what have I agreed to? My hands go to my abdomen. One ... two... three ... I concentrate on inhaling and exhaling. I\u2019m not used to this feeling. It\u2019s awful and stressful and if I accept it, exhilarating. I lean down to put the knife back in its safety drawer and stand to move toward the bar exit.</p> <p>A deep set of dimples meets me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t seem to get a drink at the table without being accosted,\u201d Trent murmurs with a crooked smirk, leaning across the bar. \u201cI have no idea why.\u201d</p><p>I pull in a slow and wobbly breath. Don\u2019t lose your cool around him, Kacey. For once! \u201cSome people must find you very ... accostable,\u201d I respond as my insides liquefy. Christ! Even my ni**les are hardening. Worse, through this thin black satin sheath dress, Trent will see them if he looks down.</p><p>\u201cIs that even a word?\u201d His eyes twinkle and I have to pace my breathing as my heart starts hammering against my ribs. Now that I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that the bastard is going to affect me whether I like it or not, he\u2019s even hotter than before. Breathe, Kace.</p><p>\u201cSo, no more snake incidents?\u201d he asks. If my cruelty the other day bothered him, either he\u2019s gotten over it or he never cared to begin with. It\u2019s a relief to my conscience in any case.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Superman Tanner is on it.\u201d In reality, Tanner has transformed into my mini-hero. While I showered at Storm\u2019s and headed off to the gym that day, he secured our apartment like a dutiful pot-bellied guard dog, not leaving until the doors were in place and locked. And then Storm heard through the apartment\u2019s grapevine that Tanner went to Pervie Pete\u2019s apartment and tore a strip out of him, threatening to make a bowtie out of his balls if there\u2019s ever another incident like that again. Tanner is turning out to be a mud-covered gem.</p><p>Trent places his drink on the counter. \u201cSo, would you mind accosting ... er ... pouring me a drink?\u201d</p><p>My focus drops to the limes in front of me as I work to regain my composure. He\u2019s flirting with me. I don\u2019t remember how to do that. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s all the flesh or music around us or the fact that, Storm\u2019s right, he is sex on a stick, but suddenly I feel the urge to try. \u201cThat depends. Do you have I.D.?\u201d</p><p>His elbows support him as he leans onto the bar, frowning playfully. \u201cFor a club soda?\u201d</p><p>That catches me off guard. He sat in a strip club all night and he\u2019s not drinking? I quickly gain my composure and shrug. \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d I pull the knife out of the drawer again and I begin slicing limes, my movements focused and slow so I don\u2019t chop my shaking fingers off in his intense presence.</p><p>\u201cStubborn,\u201d I hear him mutter as he slides his I.D. across the bar. With a curious grin, I pick it up. It\u2019s hard to read it under the dim light, but I exaggerate with one closed lid as if I\u2019m straining to read. \u201cTrent Emerson. Six foot-three.\u201d My gaze drives up and down the length of that gorgeous, hard torso, stopping at his belt. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s about right. Blue eyes.\u201d I don\u2019t even have to look at them to know, but I do anyway, staring intently until I feel a blush creep in. \u201cYup. Born December thirty-first?\u201d Two weeks after my birthday.</p> <p>He smiles. \u201cAlmost a New Years baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201c1987. That makes you almost twenty-five?\u201d Five years older than me. Not too old. Though if his I.D. said 1887 and he looked like that, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d care.</p><p>\u201cOld enough for a club soda, I think,\u201d he smirks, holding his hand out. I don\u2019t give the I.D. back right away. Not before noting his address in Rochester. \u201cYou\u2019re a long way from New York State,\u201d I say as I slide it back across the bar and leave it for him to pick up.</p><p>\u201cI needed a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d I pour his drink. From my peripherals, I notice his eyes linger on my shoulder, and I self-consciously re-angle my body. I\u2019m sure the scars all over my body would gross him out. Then again, he did see some of them already. Scratch that. All of them. This guy has seen me naked. Plenty of guys have seen me naked and I didn\u2019t care. Trent seeing me naked though? My hand starts to shake.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better tonight, Kace?\u201d</p><p>I jolt at the voice, the blood draining from my face as Ben leans up against the bar next to me with a knowing smirk. He sticks his hand out. \u201cHey, I\u2019m Ben. I saw you at the gym the other day when I was working out with Kacey.\u201d The way he said \u201cworking out\u201d makes my tongue slide back into my throat.</p><p>\u201cTrent.\u201d Trent is cordial enough, but I notice he stands up to his full height and the corners of his mouth flatten slightly. He\u2019s big. Bigger than Ben even, though not as bulky.</p> <p>\u201cSo who are you here for tonight, Trent? And last night? And the night before? Can\u2019t be the dancers since you\u2019re busy staring at Kacey the entire time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen!\u201d I bark, imagining poison daggers shooting from my pupils to stab him in the tongue.</p><p>He ignores me. \u201cYeah, Kacey talks about you all the time. She won\u2019t shut up. It\u2019s getting annoying.\u201d</p><p>I slam the drink down onto the counter with a shaky hand, all the while mentally tearing Ben\u2019s tongue out of his mouth and shoving it up his ass so he can get a firsthand taste of what an ass**le he is.</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt that.\u201d With a soft chuckle, Trent takes his glass and steps away, a strange smirk on his face. \u201cBetter let you get back to work. Thanks for the drink.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he\u2019s turned, my hand rushes to Ben\u2019s bicep to grab the muscle bulge and twist.</p><p>He howls and jumps back, but he\u2019s grinning a split second later as he rubs the sore spot.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d I hiss.</p><p>He leans in close. \u201cLife\u2019s too short to play whatever stupid game you\u2019re playing at, Kace. You guys are both into each other so stop screwing around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind your own damn business, Ben.\u201d</p><p>He leans in even closer, until his face is inches from mine. \u201cI would if you hadn\u2019t dragged me into the middle of this. Literally. And then kicked me out. Literally.\u201d A pause. \u201cHas he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, knowing exactly what he\u2019s getting at.</p><p>\u201cThen get help for whatever issues you have and move on.\u201d He grins mischievously. \u201cPlus, I owed you. You gave me the worst case of blue balls I\u2019ve ever had. That should be your stage name.\u201d Lewd eyes drift over my chest and back up. \u201cThough I have to say it was worth it. Gave me plenty of mental images for when I\u2019m alone.\u201d</p><p>I throw a towel at him as he walks away, howling with laughter.</p><p>If only it were that simple, Ben.</p><p>At midnight, Trent is still there, sipping on his club sodas, and Storm is hounding me like a hyena around a carcass. \u201cGo talk to him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so difficult, Kacey?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a difficult person.\u201d I wipe the counter as I mutter quietly, \u201cit can\u2019t happen anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, my brow furrowing deeply. \u201cIt just can\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t deserve to get shoved out of a shower stall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I hear Storm exclaim, but I\u2019m not listening. I don\u2019t need Ben and Storm prodding me forward. My own internal urges are doing just fine battling with my will power. I really want to go talk to Trent. Stand next to him. Kiss him ... Whatever switch I\u2019ve relied on these past few years to block all appeal and make my life easy has failed me miserably, opening the doors to a flood of desire and emotions that I don\u2019t know how to deal with.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s too ... good. And nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re nice too. Once you stop trying to be a bitch.\u201d The way she adds that last part, it\u2019s as if she wasn\u2019t planning on saying it out loud. I catch her eyes widen in a flash.</p><p>\u201cNicely done, Storm,\u201d I commend her genuinely.</p><p>She sticks her tongue out at me. \u201cHe\u2019s been sitting in a strip club all night, waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the horror,\u201d I mutter as I point to the stage where Skyla and Candy grind against each other.</p> <p>\u201cWho are you guys talking about?\u201d A Greek goddess with br**sts to rival Storm\u2019s calls out as she places an order of drinks on her tray.</p><p>\u201cTable thirty-two,\u201d Storm says.</p><p>With a roll of her eyes, she ascertains, \u201cThat dude\u2019s g*y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s he doing in Penny\u2019s, Pepper?\u201d Storm asks in a sweet tone.</p><p>Pepper. Pshhh! Stupid name.</p><p>Pepper gives a lazy shrug. \u201cChina\u2019s been workin\u2019 him hard for a private dance, half off, and he won\u2019t give. He\u2019s keepin\u2019 a close eye on Ben though.\u201d</p> <p>I bite my tongue before I explain that he won\u2019t give because he doesn\u2019t like dirty-ass sluts. I don\u2019t know who this China is, but I want to rip her guts out. I\u2019m not too fond of Pepper either. I should stalk over there and pee around his table to stake my claim. Wait ... what? Jeez, Kacey.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just waiting for his private show with Kacey later,\u201d Storm offers and spins on her heels. I catch Pepper\u2019s eyes narrow as she studies what she must see as cash-competition. I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on in that mind of hers. I doubt it can be much. I glare back at her all the same.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Storm shoves a filled glass into my hand. \u201cGo and talk to him again. You need a break anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I hiss. \u201cBut when we come back, we need to discuss my stage name. Maybe something like \u2018Salt,\u2019 or \u2018Lollipop\u2019 or \u2018Pomegranate.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear \u2018Blue Balls\u2019 might fit better,\u201d Storm throws in with a sly wink.</p><p>I gasp, my finger jabbing the air pointedly at her and then searching the crowd for Ben, ready to cleave his tongue out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he just wanted to make sure you were okay,\u201d she whispers, all hints of joking gone. \u201cI don\u2019t judge. Your secret\u2019s safe with me, you vixen.\u201d I head toward the exit when Storm shouts, \u201cHey! How about Vixen as your stage name?\u201d</p><p>I ignore her, sucking in a lungs worth of air as I lift the counter panel and walk through. I try not to fuss too much with my dress, but I do it all the same. Hell, just admit it, Kacey. Trent intimidates you. Just looking at him perched on his chair, leaning against the table, butterflies slam around inside my stomach. When it\u2019s obvious that I\u2019m heading straight for Trent, I notice him sit up straighter, like he might be a bit anxious too. That brings me small relief.</p> <p>I place his club soda down on the table with a small smile. \u201cWhat are the chances that you\u2019re still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are the chances, indeed.\u201d He offers me a wry smile in return.</p><p>\u201cA guy moves into a new town and spends every night at the local strip club. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Trent doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201c... and finds two of his neighbors working behind the bar.\u201d</p><p>I pick up his empty glass. \u201cStorm has convinced me it will be a life-altering experience.\u201d</p><p>His gaze skims the stage floor suggestively and I catch a flicker of disapproval in them. \u201cI guess that depends on what you\u2019re doing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I quickly throw out. \u201cClothes on at all times. It\u2019s mandatory.\u201d I bite my lip. A little too eager to announce that, Kacey.</p><p>Trent considers my face for a moment and then he nods. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but drift to Trent\u2019s lips when he says that, how they remain parted after, how soft they look. \u201cUm ...\u201d I shake my head, trying to uncloud my thoughts. \u201cSo you\u2019re not holding back on the strong stuff tonight, I see?\u201d</p><p>He gives his drink a long, hard look. Another small smile. \u201cYeah, you better watch out. I get crazy when I drink this shit straight.\u201d</p><p>I giggle. I giggle! \u201cWhat do you drink when you\u2019re not downing soda like a fiend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilk, water. The occasional Coke.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cNo beer? JD? Tequila?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head as he takes the straw between his lips, a flash of seriousness smoothing his grin. \u201cDon\u2019t touch the stuff anymore.\u201d His eyes slide up to meet mine and they stay there for a moment. \u201cI like being fully aware of everything that\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Fully aware. Really, Trent? You want to know that my thong is drenched right now? I lick my lips without thinking, attracting his attention to my mouth. Heat rises through my body, crawling up my neck, down my back, along my thighs. \u201cI ... um ...\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, he breaks the awkwardness. \u201cSo what brings you to Miami?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange of scenery?\u201d I offer his earlier excuse, silently praying that he won\u2019t press me with any personal questions. Right now, I think I\u2019d sing like a canary. Anything to keep him talking to me. Mercifully, Trent doesn\u2019t press.</p><p>\u201cHave you changed your mind, sweetheart?\u201d A lusty voice says behind me, interrupting us. I turn to find a fake redhead moving in. She\u2019s just tall enough to prop her voluptuous br**sts onto the table in front of Trent. I watch as a red claw runs down the length of Trent\u2019s muscular forearm. This must be China.</p><p>A part of me wants to spin around and slam the bottom of my heel into her head. In kickboxing, we\u2019d call that a Spinning Back Kick. Here, it\u2019s called, \u201chow to get my crazy jealous ass fired.\u201d There\u2019s no way I\u2019d get a thumbs up from Cain on that one.</p><p>The other part of me is curious about how Trent\u2019s going to handle this \u201caccosting.\u201d After the constant parade that first night, things had been fairly tame. I have to think it\u2019s because, like Pepper, they presume he\u2019s waiting for Ben to start batting for the other team.</p><p>To my pleasant surprise, Trent pulls his arm off the table and adjusts himself in his chair so his body is angled toward me. \u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d</p><p>With a slight pout, she purrs, \u201cYou sure? You\u2019ll regret it. I\u2019m quite entertaining.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lock on my face and he doesn\u2019t attempt to conceal the smolder in them. \u201cNot as much as I\u2019ll regret leaving my present company. I think she could entertain me for a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>My heart skips three beats and my breath hitches. If there was ever any doubt about Trent\u2019s interest, he\u2019s crushed it with that look, with those words. I don\u2019t notice China\u2019s scowl, which I\u2019m sure is stripping the skin from my bones right now. I don\u2019t notice her walk away. I don\u2019t notice anything around me anymore. Trent and I are suddenly the only two people in the bar and that same uncontrollable urge I felt the day he saved me from the snake now gets a hold of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I close my fists into tiny balls and keep them glued to my side.

Because the most you\u2019re getting out of me are club sodas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with that,\u201d I hear him whisper. \u201cFor now.\u201d His bottom lip slides in between his teeth, and the temperature in the room instantly rises by twenty degrees. Penny\u2019s has turned into a bloody sauna and my mind has scattered into oblivion as I struggle to stand.</p><p>But I do manage to stand and stare at Trent as the grating announcer\u2019s voice comes over the microphone. \u201cGentleman ...\u201d The next dancer is on her way out. I\u2019ve learned how to drown that voice out, and have no trouble doing it now as I lose myself in Trent\u2019s presence.</p> <p>That is until I hear:</p><p>\u201c... A special feature performance of the night ... Storm!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be f**king shitting me!\u201d I spin around, checking the bar to find Ginger and Penelope behind it. All attention is transfixed to the stage in anticipation as a mystical green glow hangs over the stage, like they\u2019re waiting for a life-altering performance and not another naked girl in a strip club. My naked friend. \u201cOhmigod. This is going to be so awkward. She didn\u2019t even warn me!\u201d I don\u2019t realize I\u2019m moving back until I bump into Trent\u2019s inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to watch, you know,\u201d he whispers into my ear.</p><p>The slow throb of a dance beat starts pounding through the club, and a spotlight lifts above the stage to illuminate a scantily clad female body, sitting in silver hoop, suspended. I can\u2019t look away, even if I want to.</p> <p>It\u2019s Storm in a sequined bikini that leaves nothing to the imagination, floating in the air on this metal hoop. When the music picks up, she flips backward, every muscle in her arm straining as she dangles by one hand. With no visible effort, she folds her legs back over and fluidly slides her body through the hoop to hold another impressive pose. The music picks up tempo and she kicks her legs out, gaining momentum until the hoop swings back and forth like a pendulum. Then suddenly she\u2019s hanging by her arms, spinning fast, her hair flying through the air, her body contorting and diving into various graceful poses. She\u2019s like one of those people in Cirque du Soleil\u2014beautiful, poised, doing things I never believed humanly possible.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I hear myself murmur, mesmerized.</p><p>Storm is an acrobat.</p><p>The scrap of material covering her br**sts somehow flies off.</p><p>Storm is a stripper acrobat.</p><p>Something brushes against my fingers and I flinch. My head jerks down to see Trent\u2019s hand resting on his knee, his fingertips an inch away from mine. So close. Too close, and yet I don\u2019t pull away. Something deep inside me spurs me forward. I wonder if there\u2019s any chance ... what if ... Inhaling, I look up into his face and see a world of calm and possibilities. For the first time in four years, the thought of a hand covering mine doesn\u2019t send me into a dizzying spiral down.</p> <p>And I realize that I want Trent to touch me.</p><p>Trent doesn\u2019t move though. He stares at me, but he doesn\u2019t push. It\u2019s like he knows this is a bridge I\u2019ve all but torched and turned away from. How does he know? Storm must have told him. Keeping my focus locked on those gorgeous blue eyes, I force my hand to close the distance. My fingers are trembling, and that voice screams at me to stop. She screams that this is a mistake; that the waves are waiting to crash down over my head, to drown me.</p><p>I shove the voice aside.</p><p>So slow, so light, my fingertip skims his index finger.</p><p>He still doesn\u2019t move his hand. He remains completely frozen, as if waiting for me to make my move.</p><p>Swallowing hard, I let my entire hand skate over his. I hear a sharp intake of air as he gasps, his jaw clenching. His eyes are locked on mine and they\u2019re unreadable. Finally, his hand shifts and covers mine, his fingers gently slipping in between. Not forceful, not rushed.</p><p>A load roar of approval erupts on the fringe of my eardrums, but I barely hear it over the rush of blood in my ears. One ... two... three ... I began taking those ten little breaths.</p><p>I can\u2019t contain the euphoria swelling inside me.</p> <p>Trent\u2019s touch is full of life.</p><p>I\u2019m sure I hear glass shattering somewhere nearby, but I\u2019m too stunned for anything to register. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d he whispers, his brow pulled together before I can process his question, his hand is wrenched out of mine as a pair of giant mitts land on his shoulders, tearing the warmth and life with it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to leave, sir,\u201d Nate\u2019s voice thunders. \u201cNo touching the ladies.\u201d</p><p>My peripherals catch motion beneath me. Looking down, I find a bus boy sweeping up the shards of Trent\u2019s empty glass. I guess it slipped out of my free hand.</p><p>\u201cIs it okay?\u201d Trent asks again earnestly, like he knows it might not be okay to touch my hand. Like that\u2019s a perfectly acceptable fear to have. Like I\u2019m not a head case.</p><p>Try as I might, I can\u2019t open my mouth or move my tongue. I\u2019m suddenly like a statue. Petrified.</p><p>\u201cKacey!\u201d</p><p>Nate yanks Trent back and out the door and I do nothing but watch him go, that intense pleading gaze riveted to my face until it\u2019s out of sight.</p><p>Everything seems wobbly as I wander back to the bar in a daze. The walls, the people, the dancers, my legs. I mumble an apology to Ginger for taking more than fifteen minutes. She waves it away with a smile as she pours someone a drink. With wooden movements, I turn back to see that a shapely native woman has taken center stage, doing some sort of rain dance reenactment in a scant feather costume. Storm is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The world moves forward, oblivious to this significant shift in my tiny universe.</p><p>Stage Four ~ Acceptance</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019d ya think?\u201d Storm interrupts the silence in the car on the ride home.</p><p>I frown, not understanding her question. My mind\u2019s still stuck on Trent, on the feel of his hand; on me, standing there like an idiot, not saying a thing. I\u2019m so wound up over Trent and that pivotal moment that I\u2019m for once not fazed by the confines of Storm\u2019s Jeep. He held my hand. Trent held my hand and I didn\u2019t drown.</p><p>I notice Storm\u2019s small fists curled tightly around her steering wheel and she\u2019s looking everywhere but at me. She\u2019s nervous. \u201cWhat do I think about what?\u201d I ask slowly.</p><p>\u201cAbout ... my show?\u201d</p><p>Oh! Right. \u201cI don\u2019t know how those boobs of yours don\u2019t throw your balance off.\u201d</p><p>Her head tips back and she laughs. \u201cIt took some getting used to, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, that was the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever seen. What the hell are you doing in a strip club? You could be in Cirque du Soleil or some shit like that.\u201d</p><p>I catch a hint of sadness in her giggle. \u201cNot a lifestyle I can handle anymore. That means training all day and shows all night. I can\u2019t do that with Mia to care for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is this the first show I\u2019ve seen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that every night. It\u2019s hard enough to stay upright and get a bit of a work out in everyday.\u201d</p><p>Huh. Storm works out. I had no idea. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cWe all have our secrets.\u201d</p><p>My eyes drift out the window. \u201cWell, that\u2019s one hell of a way to reveal a secret.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She chuckles, nodding in agreement. There\u2019s a pause. \u201cHow was your little chat with Trent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, life altering.\u201d His touch still lingers on my fingers and I can\u2019t shake the pleading sound of his voice. Raw shame has settled on my shoulders. I should have answered him. Instead, I let Nate toss him out like a drunken ass.</p><p>I hate the feel of being in my skin right now.</p><p>We drive a few more minutes without talking. Then Storm breaks the silence with a full frontal assault. \u201cKace, what happened to you?\u201d My jaw instantly clenches, unprepared, but she rushes on. \u201cI still don\u2019t know you at all. Given I\u2019ve pretty much bared all. Literally. I was hoping you\u2019d trust me to do the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to spin around on a hoop and take my top off?\u201d I joke, my voice flat. I know that\u2019s not what she means.</p><p>\u201cI asked Livie and she wouldn\u2019t tell me. She said you needed to.\u201d She says that in a low voice, like she knows she wasn't supposed to ask Livie in the first place.</p><p>My gut sinks to the floor. \u201cLivie knows better than to tell anyone my secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to start talking to someone, Kacey. That\u2019s the only way to get better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no getting better, Storm. This is it.\u201d There\u2019s no coming back from the dead. I try to keep the coldness from my voice, but I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s there.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m your friend, Kacey. Whether you like it or not. I may have only known you for a few weeks, but I\u2019ve trusted you. I\u2019ve trusted your sister with my five year old, invited you into my home, and got you a job. Not to mention that you\u2019ve folded my underwear and seen me naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll that without giving you my number. Oh, the guys at my gym would be so proud of me.\u201d</p><p>We pull into the parking lot outside our apartment as my hand works fretfully over the door handle, the confines of Storm\u2019s Jeep as it morphs into a confessional tin can overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that I\u2019m not an idiot. I don\u2019t do that with everyone. But there\u2019s something about you. I could see it from day one. It\u2019s like you\u2019re fighting against being yourself. Every time a little bit of the real you escapes, you shut it down. Cover it up.\u201d Her voice is so soft and yet it makes me break out in a cold sweat.</p><p>The real me. Who is that? All I know is that since moving to Miami, my carefully crafted defenses have been attacked from all angles. Even Mia and her gapped tooth grins have managed to worm their way into the cracks in my armor. No matter how many times I tell myself I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m starting to find my heart beating a little bit faster and my shoulders lift a little bit higher when I make them laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me everything, Kace. Not all at once. Why not just one little thing every day?\u201d</p> <p>I rub my brow as I try to find a way out of this. After the last time I blew her off, I thought she\u2019d give up. But she\u2019s just been biding her time. What if I bolt out of this car right now? Maybe this is a turning point in our friendship. Maybe she\u2019ll write me off if I do something like that again. A sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach tells me that will bother me. And Livie. That will outright crush her and I can\u2019t do that. I hear Livie\u2019s voice in my head. Try. I know I have to. For Livie.</p><p>\u201cFour years ago, my parents, my boyfriend, and my best friend died in a drunk driving accident.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause. I don\u2019t even have to look to know that tears run down Storm\u2019s cheeks. People crying over it doesn\u2019t faze me anymore. I\u2019ve permanently shut off that tear-jerking switch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kacey.\u201d</p><p>I nod. Everyone apologizes and I don\u2019t know why. They weren\u2019t the douche bags in the other car.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember any of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I lie. Storm doesn\u2019t need to hear how I remember every single moment trapped in the mangled Audi. She doesn\u2019t need to hear how I listened to the hissing sound of my mother\u2019s last breath, the noise that haunts me every night. Or how on one side my friend Jenny\u2019s broken body molded itself against the car and how on the other, my hand lay trapped in my boyfriend\u2019s hand, sensing every degree drop as heat left his corpse. How I had to sit in that car, unmoving, surrounded by the bodies of those I loved for hours while the emergency crew struggled to cut me out. I shouldn\u2019t have survived.</p><p>I don\u2019t know who let me live.</p> <p>Storm\u2019s soft voice pulls me from my thoughts. \u201cWere you driving?\u201d</p><p>I turn to glare at her. \u201cDo you think I\u2019d be sitting here now if I had been?\u201d</p><p>She flinches. \u201cSorry. What happened to the drunk driver?\u201d</p><p>I shrug noncommittally, staring straight ahead again. \u201cHe died. He had two friends in his car. One died. One walked away. That guy\u2019s out there, living his life right now,\u201d I answer, my words oozing with bitterness.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever met him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d I whisper. The truth is I went out of my way to know nothing about him. About any of them. I wanted them to not exist. Unfortunately, I saw their names in the insurance papers they made me sign. Those names made them real, searing into my mind so I couldn\u2019t possibly ever forget. They were three real people. Real people who murdered my family.</p><p>\u201cGod, Kacey.\u201d She sniffles. \u201cHave you had therapy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, the Spanish Inquisition?\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The car is filled with Storm\u2019s muffled sobs. She\u2019s trying to contain them, to be strong, I can tell by the way she keeps sucking in her breaths.</p><p>My anger morphs into guilt and I bite my lip. Hard. The coppery taste of blood coats my tongue. Storm\u2019s been nothing but kind to me and I\u2019m nothing but a bitch to her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Storm,\u201d I force out the words. Even though I mean them, they\u2019re still hard to get out.</p><p>She reaches for my hand but, remembering, places her palm on my forearm.</p><p>That little gesture is enough to melt my icy defenses and I start rambling. \u201cI was in the hospital and rehab for almost a year. Doctors visited me there. Not much after that though. Apparently zombie drugs and daily rounds of Kumbaya will solve all my problems. When I got out, my aunt insisted I talk to the counselors at her church. They suggested she put me in a serious rehabilitation program because I\u2019m a broken young woman full of rage and hatred who could become harmful to herself and others if let loose.\u201d That last part is almost word for word what they said. My aunt\u2019s answer to that was leaving a bible on my nightstand. In her view, reading the bible fixes everything.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s this aunt now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in Michigan with her disgusting husband who tried to molest Livie.\u201d Silence. \u201cIs that what you wanted to hear, Storm? That you have a walking head case living next to you?\u201d</p><p>She turns to look at me, wiping tears from her cheeks with her palms. \u201cYou\u2019re not a head case, Kacey. But you do need help. Thank you for telling me. It means a lot. One day it will get easier. One day this hatred won\u2019t confine you anymore. You\u2019ll be free. You\u2019ll be able to forgive.\u201d</p><p>I vaguely notice my head nodding. I don\u2019t believe her. Not a word.</p><p>The atmosphere of the Jeep has dropped seven levels below unpleasant. I\u2019ve bared more to Storm than I ever have to anyone else and its left me drained. \u201cLook at you\u2014Stripper Acrobat by night, Deep Thought Provoker by ... later night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Storm snorts. \u201cI prefer just \u2018Acrobat.\u2019 My clothes happen to fall off sometimes, unexpectedly.\u201d She nudges my arm. \u201cCome on. That\u2019s enough exposing for one night. For both of us.\u201d</p><p>Now that I\u2019ve survived the conversation with Storm, my thoughts move back to Trent with a vengeance, the need to feel that intoxicating life trumping all other desires. I didn\u2019t answer him. I should have answered him. I need to tell him that I\u2019m better than okay. That I think I might need him.</p><p>The faint sound of laughter carries through the commons as Storm and I walk through the shadows. Some of the college students in the building still up, partying. I wonder what that would be like\u2014hanging out with friends, drinking, having a normal life\u2014as we round the corner to our apartments.</p><p>A silhouette moves past the curtain in 1D.</p> <p>I stumble, my pulse quickening. Then, without thinking, I walk up to the door and stand in front of it.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d I hear Storm call out as she continues on and I can tell she\u2019s smiling.</p><p>Inhaling deeply, gathering all the courage I can muster, I lift my hand to knock, but the door flies opens before my knuckles make contact. Trent steps into the doorway, shirtless and expressionless and my mouth instantly dries. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to tell me to go to Hell. I wait for it. I\u2019m terrified to hear it.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t say anything. He\u2019s waiting for me, I realize. There\u2019s just one word I need to give him. Yes. It might make this all better. Yes, Trent. Yes, it\u2019s okay. I open my mouth and find that I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t form a single word that will impress upon him the gravity of the situation.</p><p>With wooden movements, I step forward. He doesn\u2019t back away. He just watches me, his bare sculpted chest and pants hanging low off his hips taunting me. He\u2019s as hot as he ever could be. I could spend days with that body. For once, I hope that I will.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not what I need right now.</p><p>I cautiously reach out, my stomach muscles coiled into a tight ball, suddenly panicked that whatever I felt earlier might be temporary, that I\u2019ve lost it again. When my fingertips graze his and warmth spreads through me, that dread evaporates.</p><p>His warmth. His life.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I slide my hand further in, slipping my fingers between his and curling them around. My lips part in a small gasp when his grip tightens over mine. He doesn\u2019t move closer though. He doesn\u2019t try anything or say anything. We stand like that, in the doorway, our hands entwined, for what feels like forever.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I finally whisper breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m vaguely aware that my head is bobbing. So intense is this high that nothing else matters. I let him gently pull me in. The door clicks closed behind me and he smoothly guides me into his dark apartment with a hand pressed against the small of my back. Down the hall, and into his bed, his sheets cool and crisp and smelling of fabric softener. I sense, rather than see, Trent\u2019s body slide in behind me, pressing up against me from toes to shoulder, never once letting go of my hand. Not once. I snuggle against him, reveling in his warmth.</p><p>And in that heavenly peace, I fall asleep.</p><p>A hissing sound ...</p><p>Bright lights ...</p><p>Blood ...</p><p>I\u2019m gasping.</p><p>Slow rhythmic breathing next to me helps regulate my own heart rate as I wake up from my nightmare. At first, I assume it\u2019s Livie, but then I feel my hand wound into someone\u2019s large, hot hand\u2014not Livie\u2019s hand.</p><p>I roll my head to see Trent\u2019s perfect form, the peaks and ripples of his chest, his face relaxed and boyish. I could lay here and stare at him forever. I don\u2019t want to let go. Ever.</p> <p>That\u2019s why I have to.</p><p>I slip my hand out carefully and slide from the comfort of Trent\u2019s bed, closing the door softly behind me as I exit his apartment.</p><p>Livie\u2019s waiting for me in the kitchen, getting breakfast before heading off to school, her eyes wide with worry. \u201cYou stayed at Trent\u2019s?\u201d Her tone is half-accusatory, half astonished.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened, Livie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d She glares at me. There\u2019s one thing Livie can do well. Glare until you squirm when you\u2019ve lied.</p><p>\u201cI held his hand,\u201d I whisper finally. To anyone outside listening in, we\u2019d sound like a bunch of nine year olds. But to Livie, who understands the impact of this, this is huge.</p><p>She\u2019s speechless for a moment, sputtering gurgles and half-words. \u201cIs this ... do you think this could be something more?\u201d she finally asks.</p><p>I shrug indifferently but the heat creep to my cheeks, giving away my excitement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blushing!\u201d</p><p>I pick up a Cheerio and toss it at her head.</p><p>She dodges it deftly, smiling. \u201cI think this could be it. I think Trent could finally bring Kacey back to me.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if she\u2019s right. But I just snuck out of his apartment without a note or anything. He might not appreciate that. A twinge of worry jabs me but I supress it. I had no choice. If I had stayed, I know exactly what we\u2019d be doing right now and it isn\u2019t thinking. I need time to think and adjust to this new reality.</p><p>I feel Livie\u2019s excitement right down to my bones. For three years, my baby sister has begged me to let go of Billy and move on. The thing is, my issue hasn\u2019t been about moving on from my feelings for Billy. Of course, I cared about him. Did I think he was \u201cthe one?\u201d I\u2019ll never know. At sixteen, everyone is \u201cthe one.\u201d</p><p>No, my issue has been that, because of those last moments with Billy, the very idea of my hands wrapped in someone else\u2019s has plagued me, making my heart stop, my stomach drop, my vision blurry, my muscles spasm, and sweat pour down my back all at once.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>This is different. This feels ... right again.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cYou look fabulous!\u201d Mia drawls, impersonating her mother and making us all laugh. Storm\u2019s making veal parmesan and I\u2019m modeling my new outfits. I\u2019d exhausted Storm\u2019s closet and needed a few things of my own, so we spent the afternoon at the mall buying clothes. I let Storm coordinate the outfits. I don\u2019t have the first clue how to dress appropriately for a job at a strip club, even after weeks working there. In any case, the ordeal gave me good distraction from Trent.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll wear this tonight,\u201d I announce, coming out in a short emerald green tunic dress that falls off one shoulder and nude heels.</p><p>\u201cGood choice! Can you set the table, Kace?\u201d Storm asks as she bends down to check the oven.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re going to have to let me cook one day, right?\u201d We\u2019ve spent every night at Storm\u2019s for dinner for weeks.</p><p>\u201cI like to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I do too,\u201d I throw back, placing the plates on the table, earning a derisive snort from Livie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re short one setting,\u201d Storm says with a peek at the table.</p><p>I frown. \u201cUh, no? Four people, four places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need five,\u201d she says without making eye contact.</p><p>\u201cStorm?\u201d</p><p>Someone knocks on the door.</p><p>\u201cStorm?\u201d</p><p>Mia hops to her feet and runs to it, throwing it open with a dramatic bow.</p><p>I suck air into my lungs as Trent steps in and I can\u2019t help but gawk. He\u2019s in dark blue jeans again, but he\u2019s wearing a button down white shirt, untucked. I manage to peel my eyes from him long enough to flash a look of \u201cyou\u2019re going to pay for this\u201d surprise Storm\u2019s way before turning back to focus on him, all kinds of nervousness and excitement and guilt churning inside me. I don\u2019t know why. Trent and I held hands while watching my friend dance naked. Trent rescued me in the apartment building\u2019s now-infamous snake-attack, and then I jumped him. I spent a night in his bed with him. Eating dinner with him\u2014and my sister and neighbors\u2014hardly qualifies as an intimate encounter that justifies thrashing butterflies. And yet, here I am, ready to pass out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mia bows dramatically. \u201cWelcome, kind Sir.

He kneels on one knee to present it to her. I hear the collective sigh from all the grown women in the group, including myself.</p><p>\u201cThank you for inviting me,\u201d he says. She clutches the flowers in both her tiny hands, and then gazes at Trent with wide, starry eyes that don\u2019t blink for far too long. Her cheeks flush and I can tell this is the moment where Mia falls in love with him. This tall stranger has just become her life-long prince.</p> <p>The moment passes rapidly, and then she turns around and runs toward Storm. \u201cMommy! Mommy! Look what that man gave me!\u201d</p><p>Trent winks as he shuts the door behind him, closing the distance to where I\u2019m standing. \u201cYou disappeared this morning,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>This is so awkward. Thanks, Storm. \u201cI ... I know ... I\u2019m ...\u201d I\u2019m about to say I\u2019m sorry, but he winks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I figured it was all a bit too much, too fast.\u201d One finger hooks into mine, buckling my knees with waves of excitement.</p><p>I think I\u2019m going to fall in love with this man.</p> <p>Trent\u2019s gaze drifts over my outfit and I catch the heat in it. Probably the exact same heat as in mine when I look at him. \u201cYou look ... nice.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re still staring awkwardly at each other, when Livie clears her throat. \u201cDinner\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Storm\u2019s tiny apartment pulses with a warm current as the five of us devour Storm\u2019s cooking. Somehow the snake fiasco comes up and I become the butt of everyone\u2019s jokes. Even Mia joins in, nibbling on my shoulder like a mock- monster. Except she has no front teeth so it\u2019s more like gumming. And through it all, I can\u2019t help but constantly touch Trent\u2019s face with my eyes to find his on mine just as frequently.</p><p>By the time dinner is done, and we\u2019re saying our good-byes so Storm and I can head off to work, every fiber of my being craves Trent and I have no interest in pretending otherwise.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Penny? Clearly someone important.\u201d I gesture to the sign as we pull up in front of the club.</p><p>Storm\u2019s fingers tap her steering wheel and her perma-smile falters. \u201cPenny was a really nice girl who met a really bad guy.\u201d She turns to look at me. \u201cFive years ago, Cain ran a club downtown. It was a dive compared to this place. Penny was his star attraction. I hear she brought guys in from all over the state and into Alabama. She started dating this guy, and things got serious. He proposed. Everyone was happy for her. He\u2019d come watch her dance sometimes. He\u2019d give her little kisses and hugs throughout the night. Watch over her a bit. You know, really sweet stuff. Of course, he said once they were married, she\u2019d have to quit. She was fine with that.\u201d Storm\u2019s voice turns somber.</p> <p>\u201cOne night, something happened. No one knows what exactly. One second this guy has his arm around Penny, the next, he\u2019s dragging her to the backroom by her throat. Nate couldn\u2019t get there in time. He found her on the ground with a cracked skull.\u201d</p><p>I clutch my throat.</p><p>\u201cI know. Terrible, right? Cain shut down that place. There was a whole murder investigation. He bought this location and opened under the new name, in honor of her.\u201d We exit the car and head toward the back door. \u201cThat\u2019s why the bouncers are so strict about patrons touching the staff. It doesn\u2019t matter if the guy\u2019s your husband. If he touches you, he\u2019s out. More than once, and he\u2019s barred for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh ...\u201d My thoughts drift back to last night, when Nate kicked Trent out for holding my hand. I thought he was being an ass**le. Now, I want to hug him. Or a part of him, given I\u2019d need a ladder and extendable arms to get around his mammoth size.</p><p>I follow Storm\u2019s black-clad form to the door. Just before she knocks, she turns and smiles, like she can read my mind. \u201cThey\u2019re genuinely good guys, Kacey. I know it\u2019s hard to believe, but it\u2019s true. Cain\u2019s been nothing but amazing with me. He lets me bartend, he set the stage and equipment up for me to do my act once in a while, and that\u2019s all. No rounds, no lap dances, no private stuff. The bouncers collect my tips from my show so I don\u2019t have to crawl around on the ground, collecting it myself. They\u2019ll take care of you. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>When Trent shows up at half past eleven and takes a seat at the bar, my brain instantly scatters. The fact that I slept in his bed last night, and had dinner with him earlier doesn\u2019t help me relax around him. I think it\u2019s actually made me more nervous. One ... two ... three ...Ugh! As usual, my mother\u2019s advice doesn\u2019t help.</p><p>I stroll over, trying to regulate my heart rate as I take in his beautiful features. They really are beautiful. He could grace the cover of any magazine. And that mouth ... I bite my lip, trying not to get all flustered. \u201cTriple scotch on the rocks?\u201d I quirk my brow.</p><p>He flashes those disarming dimples at me. \u201cHold the scotch and add some soda to the rocks, and you\u2019ve got a deal.\u201d</p> <p>I smile as I throw together his drink, and slide it toward him, our fingertips brushing for a millisecond. With a nervous glance over at Nate, I see his focus elsewhere, and I sigh in relief.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know the rules at these places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrequent much?\u201d I ask dryly.</p><p>He shakes his head with a wry grin. \u201cStandard protocol. Some places are more strict than others, but they\u2019re all the same. I have no interest in getting kicked out again. Once was enough.\u201d</p><p>I feel a twinge of guilt over that, knowing it was my fault. Trent\u2019s wink dissolves it instantly. I want to stay and talk to him but there\u2019s a gaggle of customers waiting. I\u2019m forced to leave him with a disappointed shrug. I spend the next hour pouring drinks for customers while my nerves prickle under Trent\u2019s undivided attention.</p><p>\u201cToo bad it\u2019s so busy here,\u201d he says when I get back to where he\u2019s sitting.</p><p>\u201cYeah well, some of us have to work to survive,\u201d I quip and I realize I have no clue what he does. I know nothing about him.</p><p>\u201cAnd when are you off next?\u201d he asks casually, sliding a coaster around under his index finger.</p><p>\u201cMonday.\u201d</p><p>Trent gets to his feet and throws a twenty on the counter. \u201cSo you\u2019re free Monday night, say around five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>His grin widens. \u201cGreat.\u201d With a wink, he turns around. I watch him leave the bar, frustration that he\u2019s gone weighing me down.</p><p>Storm leans in. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, the lingering feel of his eyes still on my body. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I think he just asked me on a date.\u201d A rush of adrenaline bursts through me. That sure as hell better be what he just did or I\u2019m going to lose my shit tomorrow.</p><p>Storm gives my shoulder an affectionate squeeze, and I don\u2019t flinch. I smile at her. I smile at the guy across the bar, waiting for his drink. Heck, I even give Nate a goofy wide grin. I\u2019m not sure, but I think I catch the corner of his mouth twitch upward for a second.</p><p>I feel like a lightning bolt struck me the second I wake up Monday morning. Not because I had another nightmare.</p><p>Because I didn\u2019t.</p><p>That never happens. In the last four years, that has never happened. I don\u2019t know what to make of it, but I feel ... free. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then I remember that I have a date tonight with Trent. All else is forgotten.</p><p>\u201cNice nails,\u201d Livie notices two seconds after stepping through the door. She drops her backpack on the couch, her eyes widening with surprise for just a second. I spread my fingers out in front of me, admiring the black polish. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that done?\u201d Her voice is slightly higher than normal and she\u2019s trying not to make a big deal, I can tell.</p><p>But it is a big deal.</p><p>Today, I let a complete stranger touch my hands. And I didn\u2019t flinch.</p> <p>It\u2019s like Trent has broken my curse.</p><p>\u201cA spa down the street. They have a two-for-one manicure special on Thursdays. We should go together next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh, and what\u2019s the occasion?\u201d Livie strolls toward the cupboard to grab a glass, pacing her steps as if she\u2019s a bridesmaid walking down a church aisle. I want to laugh. She\u2019s trying so hard not to freak out.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing.\u201d I wait until she tips the Brita to her glass \u201cI\u2019m going out with Trent tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her head shoots up to meet me and she misses the cup, spilling water all over the floor. \u201cLike ... on a date?\u201d</p> <p>I tuck my hair behind my ear. \u201cMaybe. I guess you could ...\u201d</p><p>Livie\u2019s irises flash with delight. \u201cWhere are you guys going?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cProbably the beach. Isn\u2019t that what people do on first dates?\u201d I have no idea. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve done anything remotely date-like.</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause as Livie\u2019s thoughts wander somewhere, likely trying to process this new Kacey, the one who goes on dates and gets manicures. And cares. \u201cYou know, we don\u2019t know much about Trent, do we?\u201d Her head tilts to the side curiously. \u201cWhat does he do for a living?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cNo idea.\u201d</p><p>A darkness passes over Livie\u2019s pretty face. I wait patiently for her to bite her lip for all of two seconds before she blurts out, \u201cwhat if he\u2019s a psychopath who tries to stuff kittens in ATMs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA hot psychopath,\u201d I correct her and she scowls at me. \u201cCome on, Livie. I didn\u2019t get you away from Darla soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should find out more about Trent before agreeing to go out with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t agree to go out with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She pauses. \u201cWell then ...\u201d</p><p>I cut her off. \u201cWe know nothing about each other. More importantly, he knows nothing about me. Just the way I like it.\u201d</p><p>Her lips press together tightly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Livie, stop acting like the mature one here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to.\u201d She stoops to wipe the water with a dish towel. \u201cI\u2019ll be at Storm\u2019s for dinner. Can you at least phone her later to let us know he didn\u2019t stuff you into an ATM? And we need to get cell phones if you\u2019re going to start going out with strange men.\u201d</p> <p>I chuckle and nod.</p><p>She stops and appraises me again with a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you like this ... again. What time do you think you\u2019ll be home?\u201d</p><p>I wink.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kacey.\u201d she mutters, tossing the dish towel into the sink.</p><p>By the time five rolls around, I\u2019m pacing in my living room like a caged bear, counting to ten under my breath, over and over. Waves of excitement, nervousness, and fear chuck my insides back and forth, until I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll toss the contents of my lunch onto the hideous carpet.</p><p>Right on cue, a soft knock sounds on the door. I open it to find Trent standing outside in jeans and a blue and white checkered shirt and aviator sunglasses, leaning against the door frame with one arm above his head. My entire body breaks out in a light sweat.</p><p>\u201cNice door,\u201d he says, sliding off his sunglasses. I catch myself staring into those gorgeous blue irises a tad too long before I make a sound.</p><p>He\u2019s being playful. I like playful. \u201cThanks. It\u2019s new. We had to replace it after a crazed maniac busted through.\u201d I smirk, proud of myself for managing that, even in Trent\u2019s intensely hot presence.</p><p>He laughs as he reaches in to hook his index finger around mine. Electricity streams through my limbs with that small amount of contact. He pulls me out into the open, into his chest, so that he towers over me, and I have to tilt my head back to meet his face. \u201cI heard about that. Terrible situation. Did they finally catch that madman?\u201d he murmurs, smirking.</p><p>I pause to inhale. He smells likes the ocean and the woods. And raw desire. \u201cThe last I heard he was lurking around a gentleman\u2019s establishment. Clearly he has deep-seeded issues. I think they\u2019re closing in.\u201d I add breathlessly, \u201cI think they\u2019ll catch him tonight.\u201d</p><p>Trent\u2019s head tips back and he laughs. \u201cMaybe they will.\u201d He drapes his arm around my shoulder as he leads me out toward the parking lot. \u201cThat color looks incredible on you,\u201d he says, gazing down at my emerald green shirt, . \u201cCompliments your hair nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smile, silently praising myself for buying it today, for the very reason that I know it looks nice against my dark red hair and ivory skin. People think I dye my hair to make it so dark and rich, but I don\u2019t. That\u2019s one way in which I\u2019m lucky, I guess.</p><p>Trent leads me to a red and orange Harley in the parking lot. \u201cHave you ever ridden on one of these?\u201d He holds out a helmet. So Trent\u2019s a bike guy. Inspecting the thing, I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that. I think he may have just climbed a few notches in the hot bad boy department.</p><p>I shake my head as I look down at the bike with hesitation. \u201cNot a lot of protection between me and three tons of moving metal when I\u2019m on this,\u201d I say. Who am I kidding? I\u2019m not safe riding in three tons of metal. I\u2019ve learned that firsthand.</p><p>A gentle fingertip pushes my chin up until I\u2019m looking at Trent\u2019s earnest eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe, Kacey. Just hold on to me. Tight.\u201d I let him place the helmet on my head and gently fasten the strap around my chin, his deft fingers brushing my skin in a way that sends shivers through my body. A ghost of a smile passes his lips. \u201cOr are you too scared?\u201d</p><p>Now he\u2019s challenging me. Like he knows I\u2019ll react to that. I can\u2019t help but react. I\u2019m like one of those idiots in the movies who slams on their gas pedal and attempts to sail over a two hundred foot gap in the road because someone said the word dare. My dad got hours of entertainment at my expense for that reason.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared of anything,\u201d I lie smoothly. I climb on behind Trent and shimmy up until my thighs hug either side of his hips. Heat explodes through the lower half of my body, but I do my best to ignore it, wrapping my arms around his torso.</p><p>\u201cNothing, at all? Not even a bit nervous?\u201d his brow quirks as he glances over his shoulder at me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can admit it. Most girls are nervous about riding on bikes.\u201d</p><p>A flash of jealousy sparks inside of me at the thought of him with another girl. I quickly quell it. \u201cDo I seem like most girls?\u201d My hands slide around his chest, running along the contours of his body, my fingers slipping through the seam of his shirt to graze the smooth ridges of his muscles underneath. For added effect, I lean forward and press my teeth against his shoulder.</p><p>Trent\u2019s chest rises with a quick inhale as his hands lift to grab mine and pull them out, placing them with a pat on the outside of his shirt. \u201cOkay, you win. But don\u2019t do that while I\u2019m driving or we\u2019ll end up in a ditch.\u201d He looks over his shoulder again, adding in a soft, solemn tone, \u201cI\u2019m serious, Kacey. I can\u2019t handle it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Another burst of warmth erupts through my thighs but I take his warning to heart and lace my fingers around each other at his waist, pressing my body against his. \u201cWhere\u2019re we going?\u201d</p><p>The low rumble of Trent\u2019s bike is the only answer I get and then we\u2019re moving.</p><p>Without thought, I hug his body tight as we weave in and out of traffic. Trent turns out to be a cautious driver, giving everyone a wide berth, following all the laws. I like that. I feel safe with him. And that scares the shit out of me. It makes me want to jump off this moving bike and run home to hide under my covers because he\u2019s just too damn perfect. I squeeze him tightly instead.</p><p>It\u2019s not until Trent turns onto the interstate and heads south that I realize we\u2019re not going to the beach. He\u2019s taking me away, somewhere far.</p> <p>In so many ways, I think he already has.</p><p>\u201cYou know my sister thinks you like to shove kittens in ATMs,\u201d I say as Trent cuts the engine in an Everglades National Park parking lot. \u201cYou know, like from American Psycho.\u201d</p><p>His forehead creases. \u201cReally? I thought she liked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she does, I can tell.\u201d I make sure my voice sounds casual as I slide off the bike and take off my helmet. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. \u201d Trent\u2019s long leg swings around the seat. \u201cHow old is Livie again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s smart, that one.\u201d I catch the sly smile as he grabs a little cooler bag from a compartment on the bike. \u201cCome on. Let me lead you into the dark, secluded wilderness over there.\u201d He jerks his head toward a bunch of hiking signs, flashing me a set of dark eyes and deep dimples. The signs come with warnings of wildlife dangers. I can\u2019t help but wonder if they should also have warnings of idiot girls who follow guys they hardly know into the swamp.</p><p>The sun is beginning to sink toward the horizon as we walk down the paved pathway. The trail looks well maintained but it\u2019s quiet. As we move further and further in, as the eeriness closes in around us and the air grows thick and heady with the unknown, I can\u2019t help but wonder what Trent\u2019s plan is. \u201cSo why are we in the Everglades?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, looking over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve never been. Have you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cWell, we live in Miami so I figured we should go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s a good reason,\u201d I mumble as we edge along the trail, lined with tall grasses wrapped in shadows from the late day sun. The perfect place to get rid of a body. \u201cSo is this going to be a reenactment of a CSI Miami episode?\u201d I blurt out. Damn you for freaking me out, Livie.</p><p>Trent stops and turns to study me with a furrowed brow and an amused smile. \u201cAre you seriously worried?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen this episode before. Guy takes girl to remote shack in the Everglades, has his way with her for a few days, and then leaves her body to the alligators so there\u2019s no evidence.\u201d</p><p>He opens his mouth to answer, but then pauses as if in thought. \u201cWell, probably only twenty-four hours. I have a deadline for work tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I c**k my head, weighing his movements.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kacey!\u201d he bursts out with amazed laughter. \u201cI have never, nor will I ever stuff a kitten into an ATM! I\u2019m more of a dog person, anyway.\u201d</p><p>My arms fold over my chest, my brow arching. \u201cYou know I can handle myself pretty well, right?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, blue irises sliding over my body, shooting tremors through me. \u201cOh, believe me. I know you can. You could probably have me flat on my back in under five seconds.\u201d I wish. \u201cCome on.\u201d He grabs hold of my elbow and pulls me forward so we\u2019re walking side by side. On impulse, I unfold my arms and grab his hand, pulling it up to my mouth to kiss his knuckles.</p> <p>Pleasant surprise flickers in his eyes. With a lop-sided grin, he switches hands so he can haul me into his body, tossing his arm around my shoulder. He lifts my hand and holds it against his chest. We walk like that in silence, allowing me to feel his heartbeat. It\u2019s fast and hard and so damn alive.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you wanna know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I frown.</p><p>\u201cWell, you said Livie thinks you should know more about me so what do you wanna know?\u201d His tone softens, his face somber, as he stares forward, and I sense a shift in the air. A hint of tension, like we\u2019re encroaching on a topic he\u2019s not comfortable with either.</p><p>\u201cUmm ...\u201d The less we talk about each other\u2019s lives, the better. But secretly, I have to admit I want to know everything about him. Right down to the type of soap he uses in the shower. \u201cWell, you already know what I do for a living. What do you do?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders slump a little as if relieved by the topic. \u201cGraphic design.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? A computer geek? Never would have guessed.\u201d Seriously, I look at his perfect body and I never would have guessed. He smiles at my jibe. \u201cAnd who do you work for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMyself. It\u2019s great. I don\u2019t have to go anywhere or report to anyone except my clients. I can pick up and move if I want, which is what I did. I can design, naked in my living room all day and no one has a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ... uh ...\u201d Trent crushes my shoulder and hand to keep me upright as I trip over my own two feet. Swirls of light and dark fill my vision at the mental image Trent\u2019s just painted. Dammit! By the smirk on his face, he knows what saying things like that does to me. I decide I\u2019ll be breaking down his front door one day soon, alligator or not. I also decide I need to change the topic of conversation before my body drops to the ground and flops around like a fish out of water.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you learn how to hit a bag?\u201d</p><p>He laughs again. \u201cI was into sports a lot, back in high school and college. It\u2019s a good stress reliever, that\u2019s all.\u201d His thumb rubs my shoulder as we walk on and my heart swells.</p><p>\u201cAre both of your parents in Rochester?\u201d I ask, shocking even myself. Now that I\u2019ve started prying, it\u2019s like I can\u2019t stop. Worse, I\u2019m asking all the questions I can\u2019t answer about myself. \u201cSorry,\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI ... it\u2019s none of my\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trent\u2019s soft chuckle stops my sputtering. \u201cMy dad\u2019s in Manhattan, my mom\u2019s in Rochester. Divorced, obviously.\u201d He offers the information but I can\u2019t help notice his shoulders tense, like it\u2019s not something he\u2019s comfortable talking about.</p><p>I bite my tongue and we continue in silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you want to know, Kace?\u201d He looks down at me. \u201cAsk me whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shaking my head. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019re things you want to keep to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, some things are hard to talk about. But I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d His hand squeezes mine. \u201cI want you to know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d My voice is soft and weak now and I feel that I have to lay my cards on the table. \u201cSo you know, I\u2019m not big on talking about some things.\u201d</p><p>I hear the soft exhale of air. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed. Can you at least tell me what\u2019s off limits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy past. My family.\u201d</p><p>Trent\u2019s jaw tenses but, after a moment, he nods. \u201cThat\u2019s a big part of you, Kacey. But, okay. We won\u2019t talk about that stuff until you\u2019re ready.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look up and see Trent\u2019s blue eyes crinkle with sincerity, and I\u2019m filled with sadness. I\u2019ll never be ready to talk about those things. Ever. I don\u2019t say that though. I just nod and say, \u201cthank you.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me closer to him, his lips parting as he lays an intimate kiss on my forehead.</p><p>After touring the lengthy boardwalk that stretches out over the water\u2014bumping into a small group of park rangers patrolling the area\u2014we find a seat on a stone wall. Trent unzips the cooler bag and hands me a cold bottle of water. It\u2019s only then that I realize how parched I am, having been distracted with watching Trent\u2019s relaxed stride up until now. \u201cI figured it\u2019d be hot out. I just really want to see a gator. Then we can grab a bite to eat,\u201d he promises.</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect, Trent. Really.\u201d And it is. Absolutely perfect. We\u2019re overlooking the marshlands as a golden sun sinks into the water, painting the sky in hues of pink and purple. The sounds of soft water ripples and strange bird squawks float through the air. It\u2019s just about the most peaceful place I\u2019ve ever been. Of course, anywhere would be perfect with Trent.</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He rests his hand on the back of my neck, his fingers lingering along the collar of my shirt, slipping under to graze along my bare skin. I shiver in response.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d he teases.</p><p>I give him a crooked smile. \u201cNo. Distracted. You\u2019re going to make me choke on my water.\u201d</p><p>He dips his head in assent as he pulls his hand away, earning a blip of disappointment inside me. It\u2019s quickly squashed with concern.</p><p>\u201cLook! Do you see that?\u201d Trent\u2019s voice raises an octave and his hand moves back to my shoulder as he leans in. He stretches his other arm out to point out the long narrow head peeking out from the water\u2019s surface no more than twenty feet from us.</p> <p>My appetite vanishes instantly. \u201cOhmigod. Is he watching us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Hard to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t those things move ridiculously fast?\u201d I swallow repeatedly, more than a little freaked out. Gators in enclosures at a zoo are one thing. There aren\u2019t any walls separating us here.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I did some research before we came. This trail is popular for seeing alligators up close. The park rangers are just down that way, in any case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d I murmur, noting how close Trent\u2019s mouth is next to me. So close, I could just lean in and ...</p><p>My lips graze the corner of his mouth, catching him off guard. Turning to face me, he regards me with a momentary flicker of surprise. But only a moment, and then he leans in to cover my lips with his. He kisses me tenderly, his hand finding its way to my chin to turn my head, his thumb gripping my jaw as he pulls my knees close to him with his other hand. My breath hitches as his tongue runs along the edge of my lips before sweeping into my mouth, sending a shock through my body. I can\u2019t help but reach for him, my fingers settling on the curves of his chest.</p> <p>He releases the lightest growl as he breaks free. His biceps flex as he scoops my body up onto his lap, and burrows his head into my neck, taking my lobe into his mouth, nipping it painlessly. My hand skates over his throat, reveling in the thickness of it, of its muscles. As my thumb slides over his Adam\u2019s apple, and his mouth trails kisses all along my neck, I close my eyes and let my head rest against his, weightless and floating in his midst, under his control. Under his touch.</p><p>\u201cKace,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I make a strange half moan, half gurgle noise in response.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d</p><p>Afraid? Peeking out of one eye, I check the marsh to see our observer in the same spot. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t moved yet, but I have to tell you, I doubt I can drive that bike back if you lose a leg tonight.\u201d</p><p>Trent bursts out laughing and I feel the vibrations right down into my ni**les, he\u2019s so close. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine for tonight. I still need to have my way with you. The shack\u2019s back that way.\u201d His head jerks behind us.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ve put fresh sheets down at least.\u201d</p><p>With another chuckle, Trent settles his head against my shoulder as I sit in anxious silence, watching the alligator drift away to join his little friends. I wonder if it can sense the hold that Trent has placed on me. With little effort, within weeks, Trent has torn down my self-preservative defenses and fear, quickly earning himself a place of necessity in my life. And then it dawns on me what Trent was asking. Am I afraid of this.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified,\u201d I whisper. At first I don\u2019t think he heard me. But then he turns to study the contours of my face, his brows drawn together, and I know that he did. \u201cI ... um ... I ... it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done this,\u201d I go on to say. I've never done this. Ever. Nothing close to this. \u201cAnd this ...\u201d I hold up my hand within his. \u201cJust this alone is kind of a big deal for me.\u201d</p><p>He lifts my hand to press against his lips. Then he clears his throat. \u201cLook, Kacey. What happened in your room that day...\u201d</p><p>I feel my brow furrow, searching. My room?</p><p>\u201cThe snake in your shower?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah. My heart jolts like a thousand watt current just zapped it with the reminder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... uh,\u201d he stretches his long legs out in front of him but holds me tight on his lap. \u201cI\u2019m trying hard not to let that happen again. For now.\u201d</p><p>He must be able to read the disappointment that smashes into me because he quickly explains himself, his eyes wide and earnest. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want it or you.\u201d His Adam\u2019s apple bobs up and down as he swallows. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m sure you know exactly how much I do want that right now.\u201d</p><p>I smile, wiggling in his lap.</p><p>He chuckles, my actions breaking his serious note. But it comes back quickly. \u201cI have a hard time\u2014a really hard time\u2014controlling myself around you, Kacey. You\u2019re unbelievably attractive and I\u2019m a guy. It doesn\u2019t take much for you to dissolve my will power. But I think we need to move slow. Take our time.\u201d He gives me a meaningful look, like he understands more about me than I\u2019ve told him. \u201cI think that\u2019s important, for both of us.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to speak, but I\u2019m not sure how to respond yet. He\u2019s right. Slow is good. Slow is safe. But right now, with his fingertips back on my collar, feeling his excitement digging into me, I don\u2019t want slow. I want a sudsy hot mess.</p><p>I allow myself a moment for a deep breath to try and regulate my spastic heart. \u201cWho says I want anything with you? You assume a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I do.\u201d With a crooked smile, his hand slips up under the back of my shirt, moving painstakingly slow up along my spine, earning a slight gasp from me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s slow alright,\u201d I croak.</p><p>\u201cAm I assuming too much right now?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head lightly to let him know that he\u2019s not assuming anything. I\u2019ll happily take anything from Trent that I can get. Slow or fast.</p><p>His fingers fan out as they skate over my bare skin, sliding to my rib cage to graze the various scar ridges. His thumb strokes back and forth. \u201cCouldn\u2019t help but notice you have a few of these.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m used to people questioning my scars. I\u2019ve learned to shrug them off smoothly. \u201cOh yeah? When\u2019d you see those?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cPervert.\u201d I try to push off my embarrassment, but I feel my cheeks flush anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His face smooths away to seriousness. \u201cIs that part of the past you don\u2019t want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan-eating snake attack in a shower. It\u2019s a reoccurring problem for me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles softly, but the mirth never reaches his eyes. Sliding his hand out from under my shirt, he pushes my sleeve up to expose the thin white line on my shoulder. Leaning in, his bottom lip grazes over it. \u201cSometimes it helps to talk, Kace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we please just stick to the here and now?\u201d I beg softly, confused by the conflicting reaction in my body, both rigid and liquefying under his attention. \u201cI don\u2019t want to spoil this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, for now.\u201d He lifts his head to look at me again, tucking a strand of my hair back behind my ear. \u201cYou don\u2019t smile enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smile tons. From eight p.m. until one a.m. from Tuesday until Sunday. Wouldn\u2019t you know? It doubles my tips.\u201d</p><p>His dimples are in full force now. \u201cI want to make you smile. For real. Always. We\u2019re going to go for dinners, and see movies, and walk on the beach. We\u2019ll go hang-gliding, or bungee jumping, or whatever you want to do. Whatever makes you smile and laugh more.\u201d His fingers toy with my bottom lip. \u201cLet me make you smile.\u201d</p><p>Trent doesn\u2019t have his way with me that night. In fact, he handles me like I\u2019m a porcelain doll that is two seconds from shattering. Instead, he talks. He talks and talks and talks. I listen, mostly. He talks about the Everglades, and about how a human can hold an alligator\u2019s jaws closed with his bare hands and I ask him if he\u2019s one of those Jeopardy freaks. He talks about how Tanner isn\u2019t such a bad guy and our apartment building kind of has a Melrose Place feel to it, and I chuckle. I don\u2019t remember hibachis and shriveled weeds in Melrose Place. He smiles when he mentions Mia\u2019s name and how cute she is.</p><p>He talks and I listen to the low seductive hum of his voice and, although my hormones are planning a full assault to highjack my brain and take over all rational thought, I can\u2019t help but get distracted by the shred of life flowing through my soul again.</p> <p>I revel in the feel of my arms around Trent\u2019s warm, strong body for the entire ride home, feeling no need to speak, wishing the night would last forever. When he walks me to my apartment door, I\u2019m bowled over by the sudden tornado of emotion inside me\u2014bliss and disappointment, excitement and fear, all converging, ready to knock me off my feet. I also sense a growing awkwardness in the air between us. Maybe because I\u2019m silently wishing he\u2019d invite me back to his apartment and disheartened that I know he won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSo, thanks for showing me my first alligator and not having your way with me.\u201d I busy myself with searching my purse for my keys. \u201cI\u2019m glad I still have all my limbs and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trent\u2019s soft lips cut my rambling short. His arms enclose around me, one hand skimming the small of my back while the other cups the back of my neck. He pulls me close against him, his mouth working slowly and controlled against mine, like he\u2019s restraining himself from doing what he wants to do. That sense shoots jittery waves of heat through me. My arms lose all strength and drop to my sides, my purse and keys tumbling to the ground along with them.</p><p>Trent breaks free and crouches down in front of me to pick my things up. When he\u2019s up again, he hands everything to me with a challenging smirk. \u201cYou going to survive?\u201d</p><p>I hate that he can level me so completely and joke about it. Bastard. But I do love a challenge. I step forward and press my full body against his, chest to knees, hooking my hand around his back so I can jerk him forward against me, close enough that I can feel him in his jeans. He\u2019s not unaffected. I look up into that perfect face and smile sweetly. \u201cNothing a long, hot, shower can\u2019t fix.\u201d</p><p>That did it. I feel him getting harder.</p> <p>Trent smirks, no doubt fully aware of what I\u2019m up to. What I would do to know what he\u2019s thinking right now.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a cell phone?\u201d he asks abruptly.</p><p>I frown with the sudden change of conversation. \u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>He breaks away from me and takes five giant steps back to get himself to his apartment door. He slides his key into his lock. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t trust myself around you for more than a minute sometimes.\u201d When he turns to size me up, it\u2019s with a smoldering look. \u201cTexting is good. It\u2019s safer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right on it,\u201d I purr, adding with mock innocence, \u201cleaving so soon? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be,\u201d he calls over his shoulder as he disappears into his apartment, leaving my mouth dry and my body on fire.</p><p>Stage Five ~ Dependence</p><p>Chapter Nine</p> <p>I\u2019m at the mall at nine a.m. on Tuesday morning to buy two cell phones. One for Livie and one for me. They\u2019re nothing fancy but I can text easily and that\u2019s all I care about after lying wide-eyed in bed all night, contemplating Trent.</p><p>At noon, as I\u2019m heading out of my apartment door with my gym gear, I bump into him. With a grin, I decide that I really do love living next door to him. I really do.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you sleep?\u201d He asks, stepping just inside my personal space. I note that I don\u2019t mind a bit. In fact I thrive on Trent Emerson being in my personal space.</p><p>\u201cLike someone slipped Rohypnol into my drink,\u201d I lie, giving him my full-tooth smile. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to the gym. You interested?\u201d</p><p>Blue irises take in my black tank top shamelessly. \u201cI could burn some energy.\u201d</p><p>My heart skips three beats. \u201cThen go get your things,\u201d I say and bite my tongue before I offer him a better way to burn energy.</p><p>With a smile, he leans in to kiss my cheek. \u201cGive me two minutes.\u201d</p><p>I wait in the commons area, no doubt with a stupid grin on my face, while Trent runs into his apartment. When he comes out, he\u2019s in track pants and a fitted white t-shirt. I may not be able to see his tattoo, but I can see every ridge of his sculpted chest and flat abdomen. How the hell am I going to get through my rounds with that to look at?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive?\u201d he offers with a smile, as if he can read my mind.</p><p>I can only muster a nod.</p><p>\u201cYou need a hand with the bag?\u201d Trent offers.</p><p>\u201cThis way, Jeeves.\u201d I stroll over to a free spot and toss my stuff to the wall behind it. I begin to stretch my body, feeling each muscle expand and loosen. I always marvel at how far I\u2019ve come every time I\u2019m about to work out. It took me so long to even move my foot after the accident. At one point, my muscles had deteriorated to nothing, and I was sure I\u2019d never walk again. At the time, I didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>Trent mimics my stretches, his arms lifting over his head, one arm bent and pulling against the other to stretch his triceps. His shirt rises, exposing the contours of his abdomen and the dark trail of hair running down below his navel.</p><p>\u201cHoly f**k,\u201d I mutter under my breath, turning around to finish my stretching in blissful ignorance of the god behind me.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Ready?\u201d I hear Trent call out. He swings his arms back and forth, clapping as they come in front of him. \u201cLet\u2019s show \u2019em what we\u2019ve got!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how to hold a kick bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d He leans against it, his arms circling the entire circumference.</p><p>I don\u2019t think Trent\u2019s ever held a kick bag. \u201cI said \u2018hold\u2019 not \u2018hump.\u2019 You want your ribs cracked?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His arms drop and he moves away from the bag, gesturing at it. \u201cAlright then, smart ass. Teach me.\u201d</p><p>I grin as I tie my hair back into a ponytail, aware of the small crowd behind us in my peripherals. Ben\u2019s with them and he\u2019s got that smirk on his face. I still want to slap it off his face, even though he\u2019s turning out to be an alright guy.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what you need to do ...\u201d I step in front of Trent and slip my hands into his. I start explaining how he needs to distribute his weight and the best height to position his hands, all the while I\u2019m in awe of the fact that holding his hands doesn\u2019t bother me. In fact, I\u2019d happily hold them through movies, long walks on the beach, and anything else that involves hand holding. And touching in general. I want to touch Trent for the rest of my life. \u201cPut this leg here ...\u201d My fingers slide to his thigh to reposition his leg and I feel the corded muscle as he shifts. Hot, strong legs. \u201c... and turn your body this way.\u201d Now my hands are on his waist, gripping his sides as I turn him slightly. I notice my breathing is speeding up. Damn, how the hell am I going to work out with him here? \u201cMost important is your balance. Got it?\u201d</p><p>He nods as I begrudgingly drop my hands and step over to my side, getting ready for a kick. \u201cSeriously? You\u2019ve never done this for your friends before?\u201d</p> <p>Trent shrugs. He manages to stay straight-faced for another three seconds before a sly smile betrays him. \u201cYeah, tons of times. But I liked letting you feel me up.\u201d</p><p>A loud chorus of snickers and laughter erupts. They all knew he was playing me. How did they all know and I have no clue? Probably because I\u2019m too busy drooling over his body to notice his practiced movements. Suddenly feeling the fool, I give the bag a soft kick. Okay, maybe not so soft. It flies back under the impact and hits Trent, eliciting a low grunt as he stumbles backward and hunches over, balancing himself with his hands just above his knees.</p><p>\u201cI thought you knew how to hold a bag?\u201d I murmur, walking over. I get no answer. With a bit of hesitation, I rest my hand on his back as I bite my lip. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKace! You really have a thing against balls, don\u2019t you!\u201d Ben hollers through cupped hands so the entire place can hear.</p><p>I flush, shooting daggers at Ben as I apologize to Trent. \u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry. I figured I\u2019d get your shoulder.\u201d</p> <p>He cranes his neck to look up at me while still hunched over. \u201cIf you\u2019re not interested in me, just tell me. You don\u2019t have to ruin me for all women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more about action than words.\u201d I\u2019m glad he\u2019s making jokes, but I still wince. I drop to a crouch in front of Trent and ask in a low voice, \u201cAre you okay? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll live. And by live, I mean curl up in the fetal position on my couch with a bag of ice on my nuts for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold the ice,\u201d I offer in a soft whisper.</p><p>When he turns his head, I see fire alight in his eyes, and I can\u2019t help but smile at his own frustration, which must match mine. The smile is quickly followed by a wince. \u201cJust give me a minute. I\u2019ll be over there, healing.\u201d</p><p>Trent stays leaned against the wall, protecting his injured body parts while watching me run through a full set of kicks and punches, not fully into it. As I\u2019m finishing, I sense him approach behind me. I squeal in surprise as he grips either side of my hips, pulling me back into him, into all of him. \u201cWhen you said hold the ice ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were near death over there,\u201d I answer, breathless. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t feel fatal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, but you are one hot chick when you pound on the right bag.\u201d He jerks me back against him hard and I yelp. Not in pain. No, definitely not pain.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wanted to take it slow?\u201d I remind him.</p><p>He chuckles darkly. \u201cYeah, and I also said I have a hard time doing that when you\u2019re around.\u201d He leans forward and whispers in my ear, \u201cSo what do you say? I\u2019m ready to go a few more rounds with you.\u201d</p><p>Nothing but a strangled sound escapes my lips. I don\u2019t know where this side of Trent is coming from. It has to be all the testosterone in the air. Or maybe this is the real Trent and he\u2019s been adept at restraining himself. Or it\u2019s his way of claiming his territory as the flock of guys watch me intermittently, including Ben. Whatever it is, I\u2019d willingly hand over full possession of my body to this Trent to do with what he will.</p><p>I swallow, trying to focus on the bag of sand taunting me as all that bottled up fighting anger deflates and a new emotion rises. Desire. Raw, uninhibited desire for Trent. I\u2019m two seconds from dragging him into the women\u2019s locker room and ripping that shirt off. Hell, I\u2019m ready to take him right here, on the pad, spectators be damned.</p><p>His hands slide from my hips, but not before one hand squeezes my ass and then he strolls over to take his position on the other side of the bag. His dark gaze leaves me unnerved. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m ready for you this time.\u201d</p><p>Trent hands my phone back to me with his number programmed into it as we stand in front of my apartment again, the sun\u2019s afternoon rays beating down on us. Whatever heat scorched the air back at the gym has evaporated with a mysterious phone call on our way out of the gym. Fun, forceful Trent is gone. This Trent looks agitated and distracted. I soon learn why.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta head out tonight, Kace. Work and mom stuff. I don\u2019t have a choice. If I don\u2019t show up, she\u2019ll know I\u2019m not in New York.\u201d His voice fades away and I catch his eyes widen momentarily, as if surprised. Why would that matter? He rushes on. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone until Friday, but you\u2019ll hear from me, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod, hoping for another one of his blazing kisses. That or for him to throw me over his shoulder caveman style and carry me to his bed. Either one would work. But I get a peck on my forehead instead. With a lazy salute and a frown, he spins on his heels and takes off for his apartment.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Serve drinks.</p><p>Smile.</p><p>Take money.</p><p>I repeat that mantra all night at Penny\u2019s. The place is as packed and sordid as ever and yet it feels empty and boring without Trent there.</p><p>It isn\u2019t until I\u2019m back home at three a.m. that my phone vibrates in my pocket, sending a thrill through my body. There\u2019re only two people who could be calling and one of them is unconscious next door.</p><p>Trent: In New York. Surrounded by sky scrapers. Miss you. How was your night?</p><p>My heart surges with joy as I type back.</p><p>Me: Full of bare flesh and indecent propositions.</p><p>I can\u2019t bring myself to add that last little piece. That I miss him like crazy. That I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve wasted weeks keeping him away.</p><p>A full minute later.</p><p>Trent: Was any of that bare flesh yours?</p><p>Me: Not yet.</p><p>I crawl into bed and rest my phone on my chest, waiting for his response. It\u2019s a while before I get one.</p><p>Trent: A cold shower is calling. Sweet dreams. Good night. xox</p><p>I cover my mouth as I laugh out loud, afraid I\u2019ll wake Livie or Mia up, who\u2019s staying at our place with Livie tonight. Setting my phone onto my nightstand, it\u2019s a while before I fall asleep.</p><p>Three days without Trent is unpredictably tough. We exchange a few messages in the late evenings. Whatever work and family stuff he\u2019s doing during the day must keep him busy because the texts don\u2019t start coming until after midnight. When they do, when I feel the vibration in my pocket, it\u2019s like Christmas has come. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019re all fairly innocuous, \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d and \u201cI miss you,\u201d and \u201cBagged any guys at the gym, lately?\u201d messages. Several times, I catch myself typing something a little more provocative only to delete it before hitting \u2018send.\u2019 Something tells me it\u2019s too soon for sexts, especially given we haven\u2019t gotten past first base.</p><p>God, I can\u2019t wait until we get past first base.</p><p>Trent comes back today. That\u2019s the first thought that comes to my mind when I wake up on Friday. Not carnage, not blood, not the miserable scraps left of my life. For once, the first thought that comes to my mind is the future and what it may bring.</p><p>For such a perfect wake up, the day sure ends like shit.</p> <p>I have no idea what time Trent\u2019s arriving into Miami. I\u2019ve sent a few messages to him to find out, but I haven\u2019t heard back. It\u2019s making me incredibly anxious. Awful visuals of planes crashing plague my thoughts all day and into my shift at Penny\u2019s.</p><p>So when Nate tugs me from the bar and into the back office where Cain holds a phone up for me, my stomach plummets to the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent,\u201d is all he says, his brows pulled together tightly. I stand and stare at Cain and the black receiver for a long moment, unable to bring myself to face it. It isn't until I hear a child\u2019s cry on the other end that I snap out of my daze and grab it from his hands. \u201cHello?\u201d My voice wobbles.</p><p>\u201cKacey! I tried your cell but you didn\u2019t answer!\u201d I can barely understand Livie between her sobs and Mia\u2019s wails. \u201cPlease come home! Some crazy man is trying to break down the door! He\u2019s screaming Mia\u2019s name! I think he\u2019s on drugs. I called the police!\u201d That\u2019s all I get out of her. That\u2019s all I need. \u201cLock yourselves in the bathroom. I\u2019m coming Livie. Stay there!\u201d I hang up the phone. My words tumble out in short, clipped fragments and they don\u2019t sound like me. To Cain I say, \u201cThere\u2019s an emergency. It\u2019s Mia. Storm\u2019s Mia. And my sister.\u201d</p><p>Cain is already grabbing his car keys and a jacket. \u201cNate\u2014get Storm off the stage. Now. And have Georgia and Lily cover the bar.\u201d He hooks his arm around me, pulling me gently. \u201cLet\u2019s get to the bottom of this, okay, Kacey?\u201d</p><p>I feel like someone\u2019s kicked me in the gut. My head bobs up and down, all the while an internal torrent of screams and wails assault my senses. Storm and I are in Cain\u2019s Navigator and on the freeway in under thirty seconds. Nate\u2019s hulking body fills up the passenger seat. Storm, in nothing but her silver bikini from her acrobat act, drills me with the same questions over and over again and all I can do is shake my head. Breathe, I hear my mother\u2019s voice say. Ten tiny breaths. Over and over again. It doesn\u2019t help. It never f**king helps, dammit! I\u2019m shaking all over as I sink further and further into the dark abyss where I go when people I care about die. I can\u2019t seem to get out of it. I\u2019m drowning under the weight of it.</p> <p>I can\u2019t bear to lose Livie. Or Mia.</p><p>Finally Storm stops asking me questions. She instead grabs hold of my hand and holds it to her chest. And I let her, finding solace in her racing heart beat. It tells me that I\u2019m not alone in this.</p><p>A circus of police and ambulance lights greet us when we arrive at the apartment. The four of us run past the opened gate, past an anxious Tanner who\u2019s talking to a police officer, past the wrangle of curious neighbors, all the way to Storm\u2019s apartment to find the door half-hanging off its hinges, split in two by someone\u2019s fist or head or both. Three police officers hover over a hunched male form. I can\u2019t see his face. All I see are tattoos and hand cuffs.</p><p>\u201cI live here,\u201d Storm announces as she breezes past them and through the door, not batting an eye at the guy. I follow her steps to find a puffy-eyed Livie sitting on the couch with a form curled up on her lap, sucking her thumb and choking on ragged sobs, well past the point of hysterical crying. An officer stands over them, reviewing notes. The table lamp that sits next to the door is in pieces and Storm\u2019s giant stainless steel frying pan rests on the ground beside Livie.</p><p>Storm is on her knees in front of Mia in a second. \u201cOh, baby girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d Two scrawny arms fly out to wrap around Storm\u2019s neck. Storm scoops Mia up and into her arms and begins to sway. Tears run down her cheeks as she hums a song.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s unharmed,\u201d the police officer assures us, his words releasing the lungs worth of air I\u2019ve been holding. I rush to Livie, throwing my arms around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to panic you. It was so scary!\u201d she cries.</p><p>Her words hardly register. I\u2019m too busy fumbling with her arms and legs, grabbing her chin, rotating her head this way and that, checking for wounds.</p><p>Livie laughs, grabbing hold of my hands and holding them together in hers. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I got him good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat .... what do you mean, \u2018you got him good?\u2019\u201d I give my head a shake.</p><p>Livie shrugs. \u201cHe got his head through the door so I slammed Storm\u2019s gargantuan frying pan over it. That slowed him down.\u201d</p><p>What? I look at the pan lying on the floor. I look at my dainty fifteen year old sister. I look at the pan again. And then, whether in relief, in fear, in madness\u2014likely all three\u2014I burst out laughing. Suddenly we\u2019re both doubled over, falling against each other as we laugh and snort hysterically. I clutch my middle in pain, the muscles tested in a way they haven\u2019t been for too long.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the crazy in handcuffs?\u201d I whisper between fits.</p> <p>Livie\u2019s laughter cuts short, her eyes widening expressively. \u201cMia\u2019s dad.\u201d</p><p>I gasp as I glance back at the busted door and then over at Mia and Storm, my imagination running wild. He wanted to get to his daughter. \u201cWhat was he doing here?\u201d I can\u2019t keep the horror from my voice, all urge to laugh evaporating. Dread ripples through me like an aftershock, permanently detaching the unstable plates I\u2019ve balanced myself on all these years. Just the thought of something bad happening to Mia sends me reeling. Or Storm, for that matter.</p><p>Because I love them.</p><p>Mia\u2019s not just that gap-toothed kid who Livie babysits. Storm\u2019s not just my stripper neighbor who got me a job. As hard as I\u2019ve tried to keep everyone at arm\u2019s length, just like Trent, those two have found a way in. A different way, but one that has inevitably led to a place in a heart I thought long since frozen and incapable of feeling.</p><p>Livie wraps her arms around her body as she watches Mia and Storm and I see fear envelop her thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m just so glad Trent came when he did.\u201d</p><p>Another gasp. \u201cTrent?\u201d I jump to my feet and spin around, my heart leaping into my throat as I scan the apartment. \u201cWhere? Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I turn to find him passing through the entry way. I\u2019m on my feet and colliding into him in seconds. His arms tighten around me instantly, protecting me with their strength. He buries his face into my hair and we stay like that for a long time before he pulls back to rest his forehead against mine. My hands slip around his sides to his back, my fingers crawling up to dig into his shoulder blades and yank him back close to me. His muscles tense beneath me. All the fear and nerves and terror of the day is suddenly morphing into some animalistic need. I need to hold him. I need Trent. We stay like that, as I press my nose against his chest, inhaling the wonderful mix of woodsy and ocean scents. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d I hear myself whisper, surprising even me. Kacey Cleary doesn\u2019t admit to missing people out loud. But Trent feels like something valuable misplaced and then found again and I\u2019m overwhelmed with relief.</p><p>Trent leans in and kisses my jaw line, near my earlobe. \u201cMissed you too, babe,\u201d he whispers into my ear, sending shivers through my core.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, sir. Are you sure you don\u2019t want to press charges?\u201d A voice asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. It\u2019s just a bruise,\u201d Trent answers, not releasing me from his grip, like he\u2019s as in need of me as I am of him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat bruise?\u201d I pull away and look up to see Trent\u2019s bottom lip swollen. My hand flies to it, but he grabs it and holds it away. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really. It\u2019s nothing. Completely worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to ask this young lady a few questions. Are you her guardian?\u201d I hear the cop ask and I assume he\u2019s talking to Storm so I continue staring up at Trent\u2019s face, unable to peel away. He\u2019s equally unwavering in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d I hear Livie say and I snap out of it. He\u2019s talking to me. \u201cYes, yes ...\u201d Turning, I find Officer Stares-A-Lot standing behind me. My frown tells him that I recognize him.</p><p>He shrugs noncommittally. \u201cYou ladies sure are keeping us busy these days.\u201d His gaze drifts over to Storm, ever so quickly taking in her body before averting his eyes to the ground as he pushes a hand through his short blonde hair. He\u2019s a decent-looking guy in a Ken doll, mama\u2019s boy sort of way. And he\u2019s got the hots for Storm. That much is obvious. Then again, who doesn\u2019t?</p> <p>\u201cNo one can accuse us of being boring.\u201d I smile to myself. \u201cI\u2019m Kacey. That\u2019s Storm, but it looks like you remember her, Officer ...?\u201d I watch with morbid fascination as blood rushes right to his hair line.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cOfficer Ryder. Dan.\u201d</p><p>Storm is oblivious, still holding her daughter tightly as she sways her hips, her eyes half-closed and dreamy.</p><p>Another throat clears. We turn to find a second officer poking his head into the doorway. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, we should get this guy to the station for booking.\u201d His attention coasts to Storm and lingers.</p><p>\u201cThen get him to the car. Now!\u201d The officer catches Officer Dan\u2019s lethal glare and growl and ducks out. To Storm, Officer Dan says in a soft voice, \u201cI\u2019d find another place to stay for the night until you can get this door fixed. My shift will be over in a few hours. I can come back and watch over the place until morning if you want?\u201d</p><p>Storm breaks free of her spell then and turns to look at Officer Dan like she\u2019s seeing him for the first time, her irises twinkling. \u201cOh, thank you. I don\u2019t have much, but I\u2019d feel safer if someone were watching over it.\u201d</p> <p>Officer Dan flushes for the third time and I have to say I\u2019m impressed with him, his eyes locked on her face the entire time when even Gandhi would have a hard time not wandering over her barely clad frame.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch over the place until you get here,\u201d Trent offers.</p><p>Officer Dan sizes Trent up, looks at me in his arms, and likely decides Trent isn\u2019t competition. He nods. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have somewhere to stay for the night, Angel?\u201d Cain asks, stepping through the doorway. Nate looms behind him.</p><p>\u201cShe can stay with us,\u201d I answer before Storm has a chance to say a word. She nods silently, her hand still cradling Mia\u2019s head whose lids are drooping closed now.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. I\u2019ve got to get back to the club to close up. I\u2019ll put your earnings from tonight in my safe. You can pick them up tomorrow.\u201d Cain offers with a sincere smile, adding, \u201cTake tomorrow night off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Cain,\u201d I hear myself say. Storm\u2019s right. They really are nice guys. \u201cThanks, Nate.\u201d I get a grunt in return. But then Nate takes three mammoth steps to close the distance between himself and Storm. Like watching a bear paw at a newborn\u2019s head, I cringe as Nate\u2019s hand reaches out to cover Mia\u2019s head. He\u2019s gentle though, giving her a soft pat. \u201cSweet dreams, Mia,\u201d he rumbles. Sleepy blue eyes look up at him. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s two seconds away from screaming. I know I would be. But I watch her little hand lift up to squeeze his one finger, the gesture yanking on my heart strings. With that, Cain and Nate leave.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get Mia to bed,\u201d Livie puts her hand around Storm and gently ushers her toward the door, just as Tanner steps in. \u201cNot now, Tanner,\u201d Livie murmurs, leading them out and next door.</p> <p>He scratches his head in that \u2018Tanner way\u2019 but nods, stepping aside. I bury my mouth in Trent\u2019s chest again, this time to keep from laughing. I never noticed coming in, so zoned in to getting to Livie and Mia, but Tanner\u2019s wearing Batman pajamas.</p><p>Tanner runs his hand up and down the doorway and I know what he\u2019s thinking. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t Storm\u2019s fault, Tanner,\u201d I start to say, afraid he\u2019s going to throw down his one coveted rule. This would definitely be classified as disturbing thy peace. But he waves my words away, mumbling, \u201cnever seen people with such bad door luck.\u201d</p><p>Trent peels himself away from me and steps forward, pulling out his wallet and another wad of cash. \u201cThis should cover it. Can you get your guy in first thing in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that, Trent,\u201d I say as Tanner\u2019s meaty paw wraps around the money.</p><p>He comes back to grab hold of me again, shaking his head dismissively. \u201cWe\u2019ll sort it out tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Tanner lifts his hand to wave the money in thanks and moves for the doorway.</p><p>Officer Dan stops him. \u201cSir, I suggest you speak to the building owner about replacing those entrance gates immediately and with a better system, given how easily these can be forced open, as demonstrated tonight.\u201d</p><p>Tanner appraises the cop with shrewd eyes. \u201cI agree, Officer, but the owner of this building is a scrooge whose purse strings are tighter than a\u2014\u201d he glances at me and ducks his head. \u201cHe\u2019s cheap, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it help if he received a formal order from the Miami Police Department and the City of Miami indicating he\u2019s liable for a multi-million dollar lawsuit if he doesn\u2019t provide adequate security for his residents?\u201d</p><p>Tanner\u2019s brow arches in surprise. \u201cYou can do that? I mean ...\u201d He clears his throat and that wry smile stretches over his face. \u201cI do believe that would influence him, Officer.\u201d</p><p>Dan nods curtly, a thinly concealed smile touching his lips. \u201cGreat. I\u2019ll come up with something and have it to you first thing tomorrow.\u201d Turning to Trent, he says, \u201cI can cut out from my shift early. Can you make it until four?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>With that, Dan exits, stooping slightly to pass through the doorway. Tanner and his Batman pajamas follow closely, leaving Trent and I alone.</p><p>I peer up at Trent\u2019s looming form to admire that gorgeous face. \u201cI feel like I haven\u2019t seen you in months,\u201d I murmur, lifting to my tip toes to lay a gentle kiss on the uninjured side of his mouth.</p><p>His hand lifts to brush my cheek as he smiles down at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be tired. Why don\u2019t you get some sleep? I\u2019ll stay and watch over things.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I fight to hide the disappointment from my face. Being near him feels so good, so right, so comforting. Adrenaline and attraction rush through my limbs. The last thing I am right now is tired. But I also don\u2019t want to appear needy. I give him my best suspicious once-over. \u201cAnd who\u2019s going to watch over you to make sure you don\u2019t steal anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? The guy who keeps buying strange girls front doors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange girls!\u201d I gasp, my hands flying to cross my chest in mock horror. \u201cI take offense to that. Besides, how do I know you\u2019re not some batshit crazy stiletto-wearing kleptomaniac who\u2019ll steal Storm\u2019s underwear and drink all the mustard?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cIt was ketchup and that was only once. It did nothing for me, I swear it.\u201d I giggle as Trent\u2019s arms lift to settle on my shoulders. He looks down the length of my body before settling on my face. \u201cI do have an appreciation for women\u2019s underwear. Just, not on me.\u201d</p> <p>I struggle to swallow as my heart leaps into my throat, the blood pulsing against my ear drum as this electric pulse channels between us, rousing every nerve in my body. But then he breaks off, taking three large steps back and exhaling deeply. I smile to myself. At least I\u2019 m not the only one who feels it.</p><p>\u201cWe should do something about this door. The police tape doesn\u2019t exactly keep prying eyes out.\u201d</p><p>Another wave of heat roils through me. What would prying eyes see? Trent rifles through the closets until he pulls out an old blanket. \u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>I help Trent secure the blanket against the opening with an array of tape, tacks, and other adhesive things I find in the kitchen drawers. It\u2019s after one o\u2019clock in the morning when we finally finish and my adrenaline rush is crashing, leaving me exhausted. I flop down on the sectional. \u201cI haven\u2019t been off my feet for more than ten minutes tonight.\u201d Trent takes a seat at the end of the couch. Gently lifting my feet, he slides first one heel off and then another.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I moan. \u201cYou can stay.\u201d He grins, but says nothing as his skilled hands rub the bottom of my feet in smooth, circular motions. Around and around, slowly, deftly. I groan and lie my head back, enjoying his strength, his undivided attention. \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve earned at least one underwear strut. Go,\u201d I fling my arm lazily toward Storm\u2019s room. \u201cPick your weapon. Storm has quite the collection.\u201d</p> <p>Trent chuckles. \u201cDepends on who\u2019s strutting.\u201d</p><p>I open one eye to find heat in his light blue eyes as they gaze at me. Again, I see this mercurial switch from the cautious, responsible Trent to the one who seems willing to have me on my back, and I don\u2019t know what to think of it except that I know I want the latter version right now. His hand begins moving a little faster, a little more ardently, his breathing heavier. And then his hands are sliding to my calves and with a grip, pulling me toward him. As I slide, my dress slips higher up, revealing more leg. Luckily it stops at the height of my thighs, just as my butt reaches the side of his thigh. My bare legs are now stretched over his lap. One of his hands rests on the inside of my thigh, shooting lightning bolts through my entire body. The index finger on his other hand traces along my right outer thigh\u2014up, up, further ...</p><p>It stops on my tattoo, on the edge of my scar and strokes back and forth along the ridge. \u201cDid you get the tat to cover this scar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did that, my entire right side would be one big tattoo,\u201d I lie.</p><p>\u201cWhy five ravens?\u201d He asks as his fingers trail along the tails.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I pray he\u2019ll leave it at that.</p> <p>But he doesn\u2019t. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>When I don\u2019t answer, he says, \u201cPlease talk to me, Kacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I didn\u2019t have to.\u201d My voice turns bitter. Trent has effectively tossed a bucket of ice water over my body, dousing the heat from a moment ago.</p><p>His hand leaves my leg to rub his forehead. \u201cI know. I know I did say that. I\u2019m sorry. I just want you to trust me, Kace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it have to do with then?\u201d</p><p>I stare up at the ceiling. \u201cThe past. Stuff I don\u2019t want to talk about. Stuff you promised me we wouldn\u2019t have to talk about.\u201d</p><p>His hand finds its way back to my thigh, his eyes focused on it as he gently squeezes. \u201cI know I said that, but I need to know you\u2019re okay, Kacey.\u201d There\u2019s a twinge of something in his voice that I can\u2019t quite identify. Worry? Fear? What is it?</p> <p>\u201cWhat, are you afraid you\u2019ll wake up duct taped to your mattress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I catch a hint of anger in Trent\u2019s voice. The first, ever. It vanishes with the softness in his next words. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll hurt you.\u201d The air in the room grows somber as Trent lifts his eyes to my face and I see they\u2019re full of grief. He leans over enough that he can reach my cheek, brushing a thumb against it.</p><p>His words\u2014or more his tone and the pain in his eyes\u2014stirs a need to ease whatever is upsetting him.</p><p>I want to make Trent happy.</p><p>And I realize that I want him to know me. All of me.</p><p>I swallow, my mouth suddenly going bone dry. \u201cI was in a bad car accident a few years ago. A drunk driver hit my dad\u2019s car. The right side of my body was crushed. I have dozens of steal pins and rods through my body, holding me together.\u201d Physically. Nothing but ten tiny breaths holds the rest of me together.</p><p>Trent exhales loudly, falling back into the couch. \u201cDid anyone die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I manage to say. A sudden explosion of panic inside curls my tongue, preventing me from saying more. My hands start trembling uncontrollably. Too much, too soon, my psyche is saying.</p><p>\u201cWow, Kacey. That\u2019s ... that\u2019s ...\u201d His hand smooths over the length of my leg again however it\u2019s lost that intimate feel. Now, it\u2019s comforting. I don\u2019t want comforting. Nothing he can do will comfort me.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d I demand, glaring at him.</p><p>Disbelief widens his eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you what you wanted. Now give me what I want.\u201d He doesn\u2019t move. He just stares at me like I\u2019ve set myself on fire. I seize his bicep and squeeze tightly, using it as leverage to pull my body up and onto his, shifting one leg over a stunned Trent\u2019s lap to straddle him. \u201cKiss me. Now,\u201d I growl. His jaw clenches and I know my persistence is wearing on him. It\u2019s only more obvious a second later when he squeezes his lids shut. \u201cTrent\u2014\u201d</p><p>He hunches forward, his head slumping into my shoulder. \u201cYou know it\u2019s taking every ounce of me to keep in control, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Forget control. You don\u2019t need it,\u201d I whisper into his ear.</p><p>He groans, flopping back. \u201cYou\u2019re making this so hard, Kacey,\u201d he murmurs, a pained look on his face.</p><p>With my hands on the back of Trent\u2019s broad shoulders, I shimmy forward until I\u2019m right on him, feeling his need for me so acutely. I lean in and let my lips brush over Trent\u2019s neck. \u201cWhat exactly am I making hard, Trent?\u201d My voice is breathless, an intentional move to entice him.</p><p>It works.</p><p>Trent\u2019s hands grab me from behind as he pulls my body flush against his, his mouth devouring mine with a new level of hunger. He forces my mouth open and his tongue slides in, entwining with mine. Gripping the back of my head with one hand, he pushes my mouth closer against his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m no less forceful, my hands fisting piles of his shirt, fumbling with the buttons, sliding them through eyelets to expose a smooth hard chest as I edge myself closer. His hands push at the bottom of my dress and find their way underneath to clutch my bare hips. I release a small gasp as his fingers skate up and around my thighs to my pelvic bone, fitting under the elastic of my thong and sliding forward and down.</p><p>I\u2019m sure this entire \u2018going slow\u2019 plan of his is effectively quashed, but then his finger grazes the ridge of another scar and his hand freezes. His lips break free of mine and he pushes my body to the edge of his lap.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already are,\u201d I mumble, grappling with hands so I can resume my position against him.</p> <p>But it\u2019s too late. He\u2019s already ducking his head, looping his arms around my legs to lift and reposition me, pulling me to him in a protective embrace. We stay silent for a long moment, his forehead pressed against my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019d fix it all for you if I could. You know that, right?\u201d He whispers. I wonder if he\u2019s talking about my scars or the last four years of my life.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d is all I say. Yes to all of it.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>I wake up to silver curtains and an early dawn sky peeking in. I\u2019m in Storm\u2019s bed, still wearing my dress. Rolling over, I find Trent laying on his back, bare-chested and in boxers, sound asleep. One arm is tossed over his head while the other rests across his torso. I guess I fell asleep on him last night and he carried me in here.</p><p>There\u2019s just enough light that I can study Trent\u2019s body unabashed and see that it is as gorgeous as I expected. It\u2019s long and muscular and flawless, with just a thin line of dark hair trailing down a sculpted abdomen. A tiny silver line along his collar bone catches my eye. It\u2019s so faint and narrow that I never saw it before. Peering closer, I look for stitch marks to identify it as a surgical scar, but I don\u2019t see any.</p> <p>\u201cSee something you like?\u201d Trent\u2019s low teasing voice startles me and I jump. Grinning, I look up to see a sexy, crooked smile. His mood has switched back to playful.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I murmur, but my cheeks flush, giving me away.</p><p>His hand cups my face. \u201cYou blush a lot. I\u2019d never have taken you for the blushing kind.\u201d After a pause, he offers, \u201cgo ahead. I\u2019ve got nothing to hide.\u201d</p><p>I feel my eyebrow arch. \u201cCarte blanche?\u201d</p><p>His other arm stretches back to nestle under his head. \u201cLike I said ...\u201d</p><p>I decide that Trent really doesn\u2019t get the meaning of taking it slow, but I\u2019m not going to argue. \u201cOkay.\u201d An idea strikes me. Curiosity, actually. \u201cRoll over.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes narrow slightly, but he obliges, smoothly flipping over so I can admire the ripples in his back, his broad strong shoulder, and the span of script that stretches from blade to blade.</p><p>My finger trails it softly, spiking goose bumps across his skin. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>He starts to answer, but then he pauses, like he\u2019s hesitant about telling me. That makes me want to know a hundred times more. I wait quietly, tracing it back and forth with my fingernail. \u201cIgnoscentia. It\u2019s Latin,\u201d he finally whispers.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have five ravens on your leg?\u201d he throws back at me, a rare hint of annoyance in his tone.</p><p>Dammit. Of course he\u2019d ask that. I\u2019d do the same if I were him. I bite my bottom lip as I weigh my options. Do I shut him down again or do I give him a bit to get a bit? My interest in Trent outweighs my need to keep everything hidden.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re for all the important people in my life who I\u2019ve lost,\u201d I finally whisper, hoping to God he doesn\u2019t ask me to name them. I don\u2019t want to name the one that represents me.</p><p>I hear his sharp intake of breath. \u201cForgiveness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d That word hits me like a punch to the chest. Just the sound of it\u2014so impossible\u2014leaves me nauseous. How many times had the counselors pushed me to forgive those guys for killing my family?</p><p>\u201cMy ink. That\u2019s what it says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I exhale slowly, my fists balling up to stop my hands from trembling. \u201cWhy do you have that on your back?\u201d</p><p>Trent rolls over and spends a long moment gazing at me with a grim mask, eyes full of grief. When he answers, his voice has turned husky. \u201cBecause forgiveness has the power to heal.\u201d</p><p>If only that were true, Trent. I struggle hard to keep from frowning. I wonder how different our pasts must be for him to have a tattoo promoting forgiveness when I\u2019m wearing one symbolizing the very reason why I can\u2019t forgive.</p><p>There\u2019s another long pause and then Trent\u2019s sly grin is back, his arms nestling his head again. \u201cClock\u2019s ticking here ...\u201d</p><p>I shake the seriousness away. Propping myself up onto my knees to get a better view, my eyes drift over his lips, his jaw line, his Adam\u2019s apple. They roll leisurely down his chest and I make a point of leaning in and parting my lips near his nipple. I hear his breath hitch, and I\u2019m sure he can feel my breath against his skin. I pull back as I continue further down, checking once to see if he\u2019s watching me. He sure is.</p><p>A nervous twinge stirs in my stomach and I focus on the feeling for a second to realize that I adore it. It makes me feel alive. And I decide I want more than just a twinge so I push it, sending it into overdrive as I reach up and skim the elastic band of Trent\u2019s briefs with my index finger. It\u2019s not hard to see that he\u2019s aroused. I curl my finger underneath the elastic band ...</p><p>And find myself on my back in a split second, with both my arms over my head, my wrists pinned beneath one of Trent\u2019s strong hands. He\u2019s hovering over me, holding all of his weight up by that one arm, grinning. \u201cMy turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done yet,\u201d I fake pout.</p><p>He smirks. \u201cTell you what, if you can last five minutes with the same level of scrutiny\u2014without moving at all\u2014I\u2019ll let you finish.\u201d</p><p>I make a tsking sound but inside I\u2019m screaming. \u201cFive minutes. Easy.\u201d</p><p>Trent cocks his head, his arched brow telling me he can see through my bullish exterior to the melting pile of goo beneath. \u201cYou think you can handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d I ask, twisting my mouth to fight the stupid nervous grin ready to expose itself. Just those heated blue eyes boring into my face is enough to unravel me. \u201cWhat if I lose?\u201d I realize this might work to my advantage either way.</p><p>Somber eyes flash and I sense the shift in the atmosphere. \u201cIf you lose, you agree to talk to someone about the accident.\u201d</p><p>Sexual blackmail. That\u2019s what Trent has up his sleeve. He\u2019s breaking his going slow rule in hopes of making me talk. My teeth grind in response. No way in hell I\u2019m agreeing to this. \u201cYou\u2019re a natural at ruining the mood,\u201d I force out, squirming beneath him.</p><p>But he grips me tightly. He leans forward, his lips grazing mine as he begs, \u201cPlease, Kacey?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes, trying not to let that gorgeous face glamour me. Too late. \u201cOnly if I lose, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>My competitive side answers for me before I can think this through. \u201cFair enough.\u201d I. Will. Not. Lose.</p><p>I see the wide grin stretch across Trent\u2019s beautiful face and my body tenses up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to play fair right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. One hundred percent fair.\u201d There\u2019s a teasing darkness in his stare, and I realize I\u2019m in trouble. I watch as he sits back on his haunches, towering over me on the bed, those blue eyes leaving my face to drift over the length of my body, in no obvious rush. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair yet,\u201d he murmurs. Leaning forward, two hands settle on the edges of my dress on my shoulder. He pushes down.</p><p>I gasp as my dress\u2014a stretchy tunic style\u2014slides off with a little bit of tugging on Trent\u2019s part to get it out from under me. Trent\u2019s thumb runs along the scar on my shoulder as his hands move down the length of my body, taking my dress with him. I\u2019m left in nothing but my strapless bra and a thong. I hold my breath as Trent soaks up every square inch of my body\u2014every curve, every detail.</p><p>He leans forward, his hand sliding beneath my back. \u201cStill not quite fair.\u201d I feel his fingers play with my bra hook and I suck in a gasp. He wouldn\u2019t. The supporting tension in my bra gives way as Trent unhooks it. When his hand moves away, it comes with all covering of my br**sts. \u201cThere. That\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>I. Will. Not. Lose.</p> <p>I\u2019m determined not to move, even as I lay all but bared to Trent\u2019s prying eyes and evil smirk. I\u2019m mulish enough to believe I can do it too. But then Trent leans forward, his mouth only inches from my br**sts as I had done to him, and I\u2019m fighting tooth and nail against the urge to squirm. I gasp as his breath coasts over my skin and my ni**les instantly harden. When he peers up at my face, I have to close my eyes. I can\u2019t handle the look in his. It\u2019s full of heat and desire and intentions. He chuckles softly as his attention shifts further down. Cool air skates down my abdomen. \u201cYou have an incredible body, Kacey. Mind-boggling.\u201d</p><p>I make an unintelligible sound of acknowledgement.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I could just stare at it. And touch it. All day long.\u201d I don\u2019t know what it is about Trent right now\u2014his smooth voice, his actions, his proximity to my body\u2014 but desire is tearing through my will power and congregating in my lower abdomen, planning an insurgence.</p><p>And he hasn\u2019t even touched me.</p><p>I peek through one eye to see the tops of Trent\u2019s shoulders, straining with muscle as he shifts further down, stopping below my belly button. I struggle to see the clock. Another three minutes. I can last three minutes. I can ... I can ... Trent\u2019s index finger runs along the front of my panties just as I had done to him and I let out a soft moan before I can stop myself. Looking down, I see him watching me now, biting his bottom lip, his arrogant smirk gone.</p> <p>His eyes stay locked on mine as his index finger curls under the elastic band and begins to slide down.</p><p>Like a violent wave crashing into me, I come completely undone. Swirls of haze and light fill my vision and I\u2019m floating on seven layers of clouds, my muscles gone from rigid as a pole to pliable putty, and I don't ever want to lose this high.</p><p>With deep ragged pants, I faintly notice Trent hovering above me again a moment later. Hot lips touch my collar bone as he grazes it.</p><p>\u201cYou lose,\u201d he whispers in my ear with a soft chuckle. Then he\u2019s off the bed and pulling his jeans on. \u201cTanner\u2019s outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I didn\u2019t.\u201d I mumble as an afterthought, breathless. How the hell can he call that losing?</p><p>\u201cYou okay here alone?\u201d Trent whispers as I sip a glass of orange juice and watch the sweaty man work on the door. When I raise an eyebrow, he chuckles. \u201cOf course you are. I forgot you kicked my ass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA bag of sand kicked your ass, remember? Where you off to?\u201d</p><p>His hand touches the small of my back and he presses me against his body as he whispers in my ear. \u201cCold shower.\u201d Shivers run down my spine and I\u2019m ready to drag him back into Storm\u2019s room, but he makes a beeline out of the apartment before I can get my claws into him.</p><p>\u201cWho lost, again?\u201d I call out in a high-pitched voice, smiling.</p><p>I quietly watch Sweaty Door Guy work as I read through a magazine, still glowing from the morning with Trent; enough that this guy\u2019s hairy ass crack peeking out from loose faded blue jeans doesn\u2019t faze me. Livie has staggered through, half asleep and on her way to school. When I suggest she skip the day, she looks at me like I suggested she marries the repair man. Livie doesn\u2019t miss school for anything.</p><p>I\u2019m reading an article on Ten Ways to Say You\u2019re Sorry without Saying the Word when Storm\u2019s soft voice calls out, \u201cCan I please get by?\u201d</p><p>Sweaty Door Guy cranes his neck, sees Storm, and fumbles with his hammer as he clears a path for her curvy frame. She stalks through, matching my smile, two tall Starbucks in her hands. \u201cDo I need to change my sheets?\u201d She winks.</p><p>\u201cOhmigod, Storm!\u201d Fire burns my face as I see Sweaty Door Guy eyes widen. Storm can be inappropriate sometimes after all. I quickly change the topic. \u201cHow\u2019s Mia?\u201d</p><p>The reminder of last night dashes her humor and I regret asking. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. I just hope she doesn\u2019t remember any of it. She doesn\u2019t need to remember her father like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, apparently he broke parole. That added to the \u2018break and enter\u2019 should give him at least five years in prison. That\u2019s what Dan thinks, anyway. I hope he\u2019ll clean himself up by then.\u201d She takes a long draw of her coffee and I notice her hand shaking. She\u2019s still rattled by it all. Rightfully so. If I pull my head out of this distractive Trent sex cloud I\u2019m stuck in, last night is still deep under my skin.</p><p>\u201cI swear, I wasn\u2019t sure Nate wasn\u2019t going to throw the cops out of the way and rip his head off.\u201d Storm adds and I nod in agreement.</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause. \u201cSo ... Dan, huh?\u201d</p><p>Storm blushes. \u201cI was up early. I couldn\u2019t sleep so I brought him a coffee. Needed to thank him for everything. He\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA coffee? That\u2019s all?\u201d My brow arches.</p><p>\u201cOf course that\u2019s all. What do you think I\u2019m going to do? Give the guy a blow job outside my apartment door?\u201d</p><p>A harsh coughing erupts behind us. Sweaty Door Guy, covering up a gasp.</p><p>It\u2019s Storm\u2019s turn to flush, and I smile with satisfaction. Clearly she forgot we had an audience. \u201cAre you saying you\u2019re not interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that, but ...\u201d she toys with the lid of her cup.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Dan\u2019s voice interrupts us and we both jump.</p><p>\u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d I murmur, covering my smile with another sip of coffee. Storm\u2019s face has turned purple. I know what she\u2019s thinking. She\u2019s wondering how long he\u2019s been listening.</p><p>Dan steps over the remnant door frame. \u201cSorry to bother you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo bother,\u201d I chirp, grinning.</p><p>He nods appreciatively and I\u2019m sure I see a faint blush creep into his cheeks. \u201cJust wanted to let you know that I got that safety order to your landlord. The gates should be fixed shortly.\u201d</p><p>Storm\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cI know a guy who knows a guy, who knows a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much, Officer Dan,\u201d she says and I\u2019m hit with a weird visual of them in a sex scene with her addressing him in the exact same way. I give my head a shake. Too many hours at the club. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They stare at each other for an awkward length of time, until Dan scratches the back of his head, his cheeks flushing. \u201cSo, um, if there\u2019s nothing else I can do for you, I\u2019m going to grab some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay,\u201d Storm nods.</p><p>I roll my eyes.

See you then.\u201d He walks out, his pace picking up as I holler. \u201cCan\u2019t wait!\u201d</p> <p>I turn back to find Storm glaring at me. \u201cYou enjoyed tormenting that poor man, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think he\u2019s okay with a little torment if the end result is a date with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to work tonight though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try.

Well ...\u201d Storm sputters, struggling for a valid excuse. \u201cLook at the last guy I brought home.\u201d She gestures at the broken door.</p><p>\u201cStorm, I don\u2019t think you can compare Officer Dan to that strung out asshat of an ex-husband. They\u2019re kind of on opposite ends of the spectrum. I\u2019m not sure that guy last night was even human.\u201d My brow quirks. \u201cDo they need to make a \u2018So I Married an Alien\u2019 movie starring you?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cOh, come on, Kacey. Don\u2019t be na\u00efve. He\u2019s a guy. He knows what I do for a living. There\u2019s only one thing he\u2019s interested in and it\u2019s not my cooking.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. I might do you for more of that veal parmesan.\u201d</p><p>Sweaty Door Guy breaks out into another coughing fit, harsh enough that I think he may bring up a lung. Storm\u2019s hand flies to her mouth, trying not to laugh. She tosses a pillow at my head, but I duck, sending us into an explosion of titters as we scurry to her bedroom and close the door.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you gonna wear tonight?\u201d I mock in a bubbly Valley girl voice.</p><p>She sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Kace. What if he only wants me for ... this?\u201d her hands gesture to her body.</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019s the biggest idiot on the face of the earth because you\u2019re so much more than a pair of giant boobs and a pretty face.\u201d</p> <p>A tiny smile blossoms to dissolve her worry. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right, Kacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also have a killer ass.\u201d</p><p>She tosses another pillow at my head.</p><p>\u201cAll kidding aside, Storm. I see how he looks at you. Trust me, that\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><p>She worries her bottom lip as if she wants to believe me, but can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAnd if that\u2019s all he\u2019s looking for then we\u2019ll set fire to his balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Storm\u2019s face twists in a mixture of shock and amusement.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWhat can I say, Storm? I\u2019m into some weird shit.\u201d</p><p>Storm\u2019s head falls back as she howls with laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy but I love you, Kacey Cleary.\u201d She shrieks, throwing her arms around my neck. I can only imagine what Sweaty Door Man is thinking right about now.</p><p>Trent shows up to my door at noon in his leather jacket. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I ask, memories of the morning, of what he\u2019s capable of doing with barely a touch, still fresh. Part of me wonders if he\u2019s here to collect his side. That part is extremely excited.</p><p>He smirks, holding up a helmet. \u201cNice try.\u201d Walking over, he grabs my hand and pulls me from my chair. \u201cWe made a deal and you lost.\u201d A sinking feeling settles in the pit of my stomach as he leads me toward the door. \u201cThere\u2019s a support group nearby. I figured I\u2019d take you.\u201d</p><p>Support group. That\u2019s when my legs freeze. Trent turns around and studies my expression. By the way my insides are reacting, it can\u2019t be a pretty one.</p><p>\u201cYou promised, Kacey,\u201d he whispers softly, stepping forward to cup my elbows. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk. Just listen. Please. It\u2019ll be good for you, Kace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now you\u2019re a computer geek and a shrink?\u201d I bite my tongue, not meaning to be that harsh. Gritting my teeth against the urge to scream, I close my eyes. One ... Two ... Three ... Four ... I don\u2019t know why I keep following my mom\u2019s stupid advice. It never brings me relief. I guess it\u2019s become more like a security blanket that I\u2019ve dragged from my old life into my new. Useless, but comforting.</p><p>Trent waits patiently, his hand never leaving my elbow.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I hiss, shaking away from him. I grab my purse from the couch and stalk out the door. \u201cBut if they break out in a f**king round of Kumbaya, I\u2019m so gone.\u201d</p><p>The group therapy session is in a church basement, complete with ugly yellow walls and dark gray school-grade carpet. The smell of burnt coffee permeates the air. There\u2019s a small table set up in the back with cups and tea biscuits. I\u2019m not interested in any of that. I\u2019m not interested in the group sitting in a circle in the center of the room, participating in idle chatter, or the middle-aged skinny man with faded blue jeans and feathered hair standing in the center.</p><p>None of it.</p><p>With a hand against my back, Trent gently prods my stiff body forward and I feel the air shift as I move closer. It thickens in my lungs, until I have to work to draw it in and push it out. When the man standing in the center looks up at me and smiles, the air gets even thicker. It\u2019s a warm enough smile, but I don\u2019t return it. I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t know how.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d he says, pro-offering two empty chairs to our right.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Trent murmurs behind me, shaking the guy\u2019s hand as I somehow get my body to bend into the frame. I nudge it back a bit and stare straight ahead, distancing myself from the circle. So I\u2019m not part of it. Exactly how I prefer things. And I avoid all eye contact. People think they\u2019re allowed to talk to you and ask who died when you make eye contact.</p><p>Outside the circle is a sign that reads, \u201cPost Traumatic Stress Disorder\u2014therapy session.\u201d I sigh. Good ol\u2019 P.T.S.D. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve heard that term. The doctors in the hospital warned my aunt and uncle about it, saying they thought I suffered from it. Saying it would likely work itself out with time and counseling. I never understood how they believed that night could ever possibly work itself out of my thoughts, my memories, and my nightmares.</p><p>The man in the circle claps his hands. \u201cEveryone, let\u2019s get started. For those of you who don\u2019t know me, my name is Mark. I\u2019m sharing my name, but there\u2019s no need for you to share yours. Names are not important. What\u2019s important is that you all know you\u2019re not alone in the world with your grief, and that talking about it, when you\u2019re ready, will help you heal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Heal. There\u2019s another word I never understood as it related to the accident.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but peer around the group now, careful that I don\u2019t seem interested as I take in their faces. Luckily, all eyes are riveted to Mark, watching him with fascination, like he\u2019s a god with curative powers. There\u2019s a mix of people\u2014old, young, female, male, the well-dressed, the disheveled. If it tells me anything, it\u2019s that suffering knows no boundaries.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll share my story,\u201d Mark begins, pulling his chair forward as he sits down. \u201cTen years ago I was driving home from work with my girlfriend. It was raining hard and we got T-boned in an intersection. Beth died in my arms before the ambulance came.\u201d</p><p>Like a vacuous pull, my lungs constrict. I see, rather than feel, Trent\u2019s hand on my knee, squeezing gently. I can\u2019t feel anything.</p> <p>Mark continues, but I struggle to focus on his words, my heart rate climbing like it\u2019s on its way to Mount Everest. I fight the urge to stand and run, to leave Trent here. Let him listen to this horror. Let him see the kind of pain these people have experienced. I have enough of my own to deal with.</p><p>Maybe he gets some sick fascination with this shit.</p><p>I barely hear Mark as he talks about drugs and rehab, as words like \u201cdepression\u201d and \u201csuicide\u201d float around. Mark\u2019s so calm and collected as he lists the after affects. How? How is he so calm? How can he throw out his own personal tragedy in front of these people like he\u2019s talking about the weather?</p><p>\u201c... Tonya and I just celebrated our second wedding anniversary, but I still think about Beth every day. I still suffer through moments of sadness. But I\u2019ve learned to cherish the happy memories. I\u2019ve learned to move on. Beth would have wanted me to live my life.\u201d</p><p>One by one, they go around the circle, airing their dirty laundry to all as if it takes no effort to talk about it. I pull short, hard breaths through the second tale\u2014one of a man who lost his four year old son to a freak farming accident. By the fourth, the coils around my insides have stopped tightening. By the fifth, all the emotions that Trent has managed to coax out from hiding over the last few weeks have fled back as tragedy upon tragedy beats me over the head. All I can do to avoid reliving the pain of that night four years ago, right here in this church basement, is to bottle everything human inside of me up.</p> <p>I\u2019m dead inside.</p><p>Not everyone shares their stories, but most do. No one pressures me to speak. I don\u2019t offer, even when Mark asks if anyone else wants to share and Trent squeezes my knee. I make not a sound. I stare straight forward, anesthetized.</p><p>I hear murmurs of \u201cgoodbye\u201d and I stand. With robotic movements, I climb the stairs and walk out to the street.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Trent calls out from behind. I don\u2019t answer. I don\u2019t stop. I just start walking down the street toward my apartment.</p><p>\u201cHey! Wait up!\u201d Trent jumps in front of me, forcing me to stop. \u201cLook at me, Kacey!\u201d</p><p>I follow his order and look up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me, Kace. Please talk to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m scaring you?\u201d The protective numbing coat I pulled over my body for the session falls away as rage suddenly fires through. \u201cWhy would you do that to me, Trent? Why? Why do I have to sit and listen to ten people recant their horror stories? How does that help?\u201d</p><p>Trent\u2019s hands push through his hair. \u201cCalm down, Kace. I just thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What did you think? You don\u2019t know the first thing about what I\u2019ve gone through and you ... what, think you can swoop in, give me an orgasm, and follow it up with a survivor\u2019s group full of f**king cyborgs who talk about their supposed loved ones like everything\u2019s alright?\u201d I\u2019m screaming on the side of the street now and I don\u2019t care.</p><p>Trent\u2019s hands move to touch my arms as he shushes me, glancing around. \u201cYou think that wasn\u2019t hard for them, Kacey? Can\u2019t you see the torture in their faces as they relive their stories?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not listening to him anymore. I throw his hands away with a shove and take a step back. \u201cYou think you can fix me? What am I to you, some pet project?\u201d</p><p>He flinches as if I slapped him across the face and I grit my teeth. He has no right to be hurt. He made me sit through that. He hurt me. \u201cStay away from me.\u201d I spin around and stalk down the sidewalk.</p><p>I don\u2019t look back.</p><p>Trent doesn\u2019t chase.</p> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Storm\u2019s hands fidget with a bead bracelet as seven o\u2019clock rolls around. It\u2019s bizarre that she\u2019s so nervous considering she can swing over a stage topless in front of a room full of strangers. I don\u2019t remind her of that though. I just help her pick out a classy yellow dress that flatters her skin tone and accentuates her curves but not too much. I help her clasp her necklace and pin her hair back on one side. Mainly, I try my damndest to smile when all I want to do is curl up into a ball and hide under my covers, alone.</p><p>\u201cTen tiny breaths,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>She frowns into her mirror. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake ten tiny breaths. Seize them. Feel them. Love them.\u201d My mother\u2019s voice rings in my ear as I repeat her words and fight off a choke. That stupid session today has left me bothered, my defenses wavering, my ability to bury the pain challenged.</p><p>Storm\u2019s frown dips further.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI dunno. That\u2019s what my mom always used to say. If you figure it out, let me know, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods slowly and then I watch as she breathes in and out slowly, and I imagine she\u2019s counting in her head. That makes me smile. Like I\u2019m passing on a little bit of my mother to Storm.</p><p>We hear the knock on the new front door and, a moment later, Mia\u2019s little hands fumbling with the lock. All is quiet, and then Mia approaches, her bare feet slapping hard against the floor as she runs down the hall, yelling, \u201cMommy! The police officer is here to take you away!\u201d</p><p>I snort and shove Storm toward the door. \u201cStop fussing. You look great.\u201d</p><p>Officer Dan is in the living room, putting his hands into his jean pockets and pulling them out, and then putting one in, and taking it out. I can\u2019t help but smile just a bit as I watch him. He\u2019s as uneasy as Storm. Though when he sees her, his face brightens.</p><p>\u201cHi, Nora.\u201d</p><p>Nora? His blond hair is styled in that messy, spiky way. He\u2019s wearing a fitted black golf shirt that shows off a solid body. I catch a faint whiff of men\u2019s cologne. Not too much. Just enough. All in all, Officer Dan cleans up really well.</p><p>She smiles back politely. \u201cHi, Officer Dan.\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cJust Dan is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Just Dan,\u201d she repeats and then the room fills with awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cOfficer Dan brought you flowers, Mommy! Tigers!\u201d Mia runs to the kitchen where Livie is arranging a beautiful bouquet of deep red Tiger Lilies in a milk jug. Mia reaches up to grab one and knocks the jug over. Water and flowers splash everywhere. \u201cShit!\u201d She exclaims.</p><p>\u201cMia!\u201d Storm and Livie scold at the same time through gasps.</p><p>Mia\u2019s eyes turn big and round as she looks between the two, realizing what she\u2019s done. \u201cI get one. Right, Kacey?\u201d</p><p>My hand flies to my mouth to contain my laughter as Livie\u2019s eyes shoot daggers at me.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful, Dan.\u201d Storm rushes over and scrambles to pick them all up. I take this as my chance to wave down his attention. \u201cShe\u2019s really nervous,\u201d I mouth without making a sound. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Surprise flashes in his eyes. He knows what she does for a living. He\u2019s likely made the same wrong assumption as me\u2014that Storm is made of steel. That\u2019s not the case though. Far from it.</p><p>He nods and gives me a wink. Clearing his throat, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve made reservations for seven-thirty.\u201d Stepping forward, he offers Storm his arm. \u201cWe should head out now, Nora. The place is down by the water. It\u2019ll take a while to get there with traffic.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at him and smiles, all fuss over flowers vanishing.</p><p>Good. Take the lead. Smart, Dan. Two points.</p> <p>\u201cHave fun. We won\u2019t wait up!\u201d I catch a flash of Storm\u2019s crimson cheeks before the door is shut and locked, bringing back my dour mood.</p><p>I end up working that night without Storm. I need the distraction. When last call sounds and Trent doesn\u2019t show up or text, my disappointment is paralyzing. Why would he come, though, I remind myself. I screamed like a lunatic at him on the sidewalk and told him to stay away.</p><p>Trent doesn\u2019t come visit me at Penny\u2019s the next night. Or the night after that. Three days later, I think I might lose my mind. Whatever rage coursed through me the day of the grief session is overshadowed by a new void. A Trent void. It throbs like a deep ache through every fiber of my being. I crave his presence, his body, his voice, his laugh, his touch, his everything.</p><p>I need him.</p><p>I need Trent.</p> <p>On Thursday at noon, I sit at our kitchenette in my short shorts and tank, shoveling Cheerios into my mouth and staring at my phone as if willing a text to come through. Finally, I suck back a mouths\u2019 worth of air and force my thumbs to work out a message.</p><p>Me: Any interest in a matinee?</p><p>I sit at my table and gawk at the stupid thing, wondering if he\u2019s already deleted my text, or if he\u2019s even bothered to read it. I consider pressing my ear up against the wall between our apartments to see if I can catch any \u201ccrazy bitch\u201d comments out of him. But that doesn\u2019t sound like something Trent would say, even if it were true. Which is it.</p><p>A whole five minutes later, after sinking every last one of my Cheerios into my milk, my phone beeps. I drop everything and grab it.</p><p>Trent: What do you have in mind?</p><p>Flutters stir in my chest. Damn flutters! I hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead. I have no idea what\u2019s playing. I decide to be lighthearted.</p> <p>Me: Depends. You okay with nudity?</p><p>This time, Trent\u2019s response comes right away.</p><p>Trent: Define nudity.</p><p>Okay, good. He\u2019s playing along.</p><p>Me: Well ... first I take my top off ...</p><p>I nibble on my fingernail, waiting to see what he comes back with. I don\u2019t get a response. Maybe I went too far, too soon. Maybe he\u2019s still annoyed with me. Maybe ... I hear a door slam shut. A shadow passes by our window and a second later, someone is pounding on my apartment door.</p><p>It has to be Trent.</p><p>I run to the door and throw it open, struggling to conceal my eagerness. There he is, in a pair of jeans and a loose t-shirt, his hair slightly mussed, bright blue eyes spilling over my body, settling on my chest for a long moment. I\u2019m not wearing a bra and there's no doubt he can see my ni**les\u2019 reaction to him. When that gaze lifts back to my face ... whoa ... it\u2019s just the right mixture of anger, frustration, and smoldering hot to make me bite my bottom lip. And that\u2019s all it takes to push him over the brink.</p> <p>\u201cGod, Kacey,\u201d he growls and takes two quick steps in to slam against my body, his hands quickly seizing my biceps as his mouth claims mine. Dipping my head back, he forces his tongue into my mouth, demolishing me with a depth of need I\u2019ve never experienced before. This is the real Trent, I realize.</p><p>Unleashed.</p><p>I struggle to stay upright as my body slackens under his intensity. Leading me backward, Trent sandwiches me between himself and the back of the couch and I quickly become aware of how turned on he is.</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m off my feet and perched on the headrest, Trent\u2019s hips fitting snug between my thighs. His arms fold around me. One hand clutches the back of my neck, while the other sweeps my hair to the side to expose my neck. His lips slide first to my throat, and then along my jaw line, up to my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou enjoy torturing me, sending mixed messages, don\u2019t you, Kacey?\u201d It comes out in a growl, pulsating through every single one of my nerves. Then his mouth is back on mine, this time even hungrier, more insistent, and it\u2019s all I can do to get a breath in. He presses harder against me as a hand slips under the hem of my shirt and climbs to cup the swell of my breast, his thumb stroking my nipple, shooting a current through to my depths.</p><p>The sudden Trent onslaught threw me completely off my game\u2014all my senses assaulted. But I finally catch a handle on my wits, enough to will my hands to his chest, my fingers raking along his abs to hook tight around his belt buckle. I yank him hard against me until his erection digs into me. \u201cIs this clear enough?\u201d I growl back. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who wants to take things slow.\u201d</p><p>Trent breaks free, a wild dark look in his eyes, as if he\u2019s shocked. He pulls me down off the couch and then, spinning on his heels, he storms out of our apartment, yelling, \u201cdon\u2019t send any more f**king texts like that!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m left standing there, shocked, speechless, and turned on as hell. He\u2019s angry? He\u2019s angry! He\u2019s f**king angry! I stomp over to the table and snatch my phone.</p><p>Me: What the Hell was that?</p><p>It takes two minutes but my phone beeps with a message:</p><p>Trent: You enjoy testing my will power. Stop torturing me.</p><p>What? Me torturing him? He\u2019s the one with this stupid, \u201cthou shalt go slow\u201d crap!</p><p>Me: One little text hardly qualifies as torture.</p><p>Trent: It\u2019s not just the one text.</p><p>Me: Well then come back here.</p><p>Trent: No, I told you we\u2019re taking this slow.</p><p>Me: I think that ship sailed with your little stare down game the other morning. According to the very wise bible, we\u2019re an old married couple.</p><p>I smirk with my bible comment. Aunt Darla would have a coronary if she knew how I was using it to my advantage. The smile is torn clean off my face when my phone chimes again.</p><p>Trent: You need help.</p><p>I stare at those three words for a long moment, gritting my teeth. It\u2019s not a surprise to me that he says it. He\u2019s said it before. Somehow though, seeing it in twelve point font feels different. Official. I don\u2019t respond.</p><p>A minute later ...</p><p>Trent: You\u2019ve been through a terrible ordeal and you\u2019ve bottled everything up. You\u2019re going to explode one day.</p><p>Here we go. I rub my forehead with frustration. Persistent fool.</p><p>Me: What? You want the gory details about how I lost my parents, best friend AND boyfriend, all in one night? Does that kind of thing get you off?</p><p>That fire inside me rages again, the same one from three days ago when he forced me into that therapy session. I put the phone down and inhale deeply, trying to douse it before it takes control.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop myself from reading the next text when the phone chimes.</p><p>I want you to trust me enough to tell me about it. Or someone, at least.</p><p>Me: This isn\u2019t about trust! I\u2019ve told you that already! My past is my past and I need to bury it where it belongs\u2014In. The. Past.</p><p>Trent: You\u2019re vulnerable and I\u2019m taking advantage of you by letting things like what just happened, happen.</p><p>I groan with exasperation.</p><p>Me: Please, take advantage of me!

I think you\u2019re suffering from a serious case of P.T.S.D.</p><p>I fling the phone against the wall that adjoins our apartment, seething. Metal and plastic sails through the air as the thing shatters.</p> <p>Everyone wants to be my personal f**king shrink.</p><p>I\u2019m astonished when Trent show up at Penny\u2019s that night. More so, I can\u2019t keep my mouth from hanging agape as I watch him sit down by the bar, just like he did before, acting like we hadn\u2019t just had a nuclear-sized fight. I raise my chin a notch. I\u2019m not going to apologize. No damn way.</p><p>A box with a red bow magically appears in front of him. He slides it forward, his dimples forcing a smile on my face whether I like it or not. Dammit! Of course I go over and open it. Who doesn\u2019t love presents?</p><p>Inside is a brand new iPhone.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t hard to figure out what that loud bang was against my wall when you didn\u2019t answer my next text,\u201d Trent murmurs, an amused smirk on his face.</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d I slide my tongue over my teeth, acting all cool and unaffected. Inside, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m so not unaffected by Trent right now. \u201cWhat\u2019d the text say?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, now feigning indifference as well. I know he\u2019s faking it too. That twinkle in his eye is his only tell. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll never know.\u201d He exhales deeply as he holds my stare. It\u2019s like the afternoon tension doesn\u2019t exist anymore, and I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s possible because I still feel it. He\u2019s up to something. I can\u2019t figure out what though.</p><p>\u201cJust think, our afternoon could have gone a completely different direction had you not smashed your phone to smithereens,\u201d he says, sliding a straw into his mouth. His eyes blaze with intentions.</p><p>Inside, it\u2019s all I can do to stop myself from leaping over the bar and into Trent\u2019s lap. That\u2019s inside. Outside, I\u2019m cool as a November chill. \u201cWhat can I say? I have anger management issues.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twists as if in thought. \u201cYou need to find a way to deal with those issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. It\u2019s called pounding on a bag of sand.\u201d</p> <p>His brow arches playfully. \u201cClearly it\u2019s not working well.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward over the bar, resting my body on my elbows. \u201cAnd what would you suggest I pound on instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez! Would you two just give in already?\u201d Storm calls out with mock exasperation, a martini shaker in her hand.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized how loud we were. Glancing to my other side, I see Nate\u2019s smirk, and I instantly flush. I don\u2019t know why, but I do. I\u2019m always flushing lately.</p><p>Trent doesn\u2019t answer Storm or me, taking a long sip of his soda instead, and I delude myself into thinking that maybe he\u2019s finally given up on pushing me to deal with things long since buried. Maybe this can work.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, Trent holds true to his word about making me smile. Unfortunately, he also holds true to his word about taking things slow. Only this time, he actually does. After those few short and hot slip ups, the true unrestrained Trent is chained and the one who occupies my time gives nothing more than guarded kisses and hand-holding.</p><p>It\u2019s enough to drive me insane.</p><p>Each day, I hop onto Trent\u2019s bike, wrap my arms around his chest, and I let him whisk me off. It always starts off with the gym, likely because he doesn\u2019t want to see me smash my phone against the wall again. I\u2019m finding now though that I don\u2019t have as much desire and focus to run through my drills with him around. Those take attention and determination and, let\u2019s face it, bottled up rage. Trent has a dousing effect on my rage. We end up goofing off and play fighting until we get dirty looks and decide to leave. By that point I\u2019m usually so hot and bothered by Trent though that I\u2019m okay with jumping into the shower. I keep hoping he\u2019ll lose his way and stumble in there. He never does.</p> <p>The rest of the days are busy. Paint ball fighting, bike riding along the Miami boardwalk, a Dolphin\u2019s game, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, ice cream shops, a Frisbee league. It\u2019s like Trent\u2019s got a \u201cMake Kacey Smile,\u201d itinerary and it\u2019s jam-packed. By the time I get to work each night, my face hurts from so much smiling.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever work?\u201d I ask him one day as we walk down the sidewalk.</p><p>He shrugs, squeezing my hand. \u201cI\u2019m between contracts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Well, aren\u2019t you worried about paying bills? You\u2019re blowing all your money on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be nice,\u201d I mutter dryly, but I don\u2019t press any further. I just walk down the sidewalk, hand in hand with Trent, letting my body absorb the sun\u2019s warmth.</p><p>And I smile.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay until close?\u201d I murmur quietly.</p><p>Trent\u2019s hand slides across his mouth as if considering how to answer me. \u201cBecause then I\u2019ll have to walk you home.\u201d</p><p>I frown, slightly taken aback. \u201cYeah, I can see how that would be horrific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get it.\u201d His gaze slides to my mouth before lifting back to my eyes. \u201cWhat do you think will happen when I walk you to your door?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, catching his drift but playing dumb, just so I can see what he says. He stands up and leans in, reaching to grab an olive. When he looks at me again, his eyes have that smoldering quality to them that he can\u2019t hide from me completely, the one that makes my knees wobble.</p><p>\u201cAt home, we don\u2019t have Godzilla chaperoning us.\u201d His head jerks toward Nate, who\u2019s ever watchful of Trent\u2019s close proximity.</p><p>I put on my best confused look. \u201cWell Nate\u2019s not there when you walk me to my door during the day.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles softly. Yup, there they are. Those deep dimples that I want to run my tongue against. \u201cYou know you\u2019re shit at playing dumb.\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together to keep from smiling.</p><p>Trent leans further against the bar, close enough that I\u2019m the only one who can hear him. \u201cI have a hard enough time keeping my hands off you all day. I wouldn\u2019t stand a chance, knowing you\u2019re about to get undressed and climb into bed.\u201d</p><p>I brace myself against the counter as I watch him slide an olive in his mouth, his tongue curling around it.</p><p>So he wants to play dirty ...</p><p>For the next week, I scavenge Storm\u2019s closet, picking the shortest, tightest, outfits I can find. I almost take her sequined stage outfits one night. I make a point of leaning over in front of Trent often throughout the night, swaying my hips to the music. When Ben makes a snide comment about me getting ready for my first stage performance, I nail him in the solar plexus and continue on my way, earning a deep roar of laughter from Nate.</p><p>But I can\u2019t seem to break this new resolve Trent has. He only watches, resting on his elbows with his hands folded in front of me. Watching me move. Watching me flirt with him. Watching me turn myself into a hot mess over him.</p><p>Finally, one night, I lose it.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Trent!\u201d I snap, slamming his club soda on the counter in front of him. He looks taken aback. \u201cWhat the hell do I have to do to get your attention? Do I need to get up there?\u201d I throw an arm toward the stage.</p><p>His eyes swell for just a second, in shock. He reaches forward to hold my hands, but he catches himself in time and instead folds them across his chest. \u201cBelieve me, you have my full attention.\u201d He gives me a heated look that makes my mouth dry up instantly. \u201cYou always have my attention. It takes every ounce of my control not to show you how much attention you have.\u201d As quickly as that look came, it slides off. \u201cI want you to get help, Kace,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI\u2019m here for you, every day. Always. I\u2019ll stand by you the entire time, but you need to get help. No human can bury their past indefinitely. It\u2019s only a matter of time before you crack.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is sexual blackmail!\u201d I hiss. First, he tried to force me into talking with that galactic hands free orgasm and that back-fired. Now he\u2019s withholding completely as a means to forcing me. Bastard! I stalk away, refusing to look at him for the rest of the night.</p><p>The next shift at Penny\u2019s, Trent is proven right.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Storm is doing her acrobat thing on stage and I\u2019m watching her, stealing frequent glances at my new phone for a text from Trent. Nothing. He\u2019s not here tonight. It\u2019s the first night he hasn\u2019t been here in a long time and I feel his absence like a missing limb. Maybe he\u2019s finally given up on me. Maybe he realized I\u2019m a lost cause and he won\u2019t be getting laid anytime this century if he waits for me to break down and seek out therapy.</p> <p>Storm\u2019s feet touch down on the stage to a raucous round of applause. She bends down to pick up her top, covering her br**sts as best she can with an arm. I\u2019ve seen Storm topless so many times by now, I don\u2019t bat an eye. In fact, I\u2019m getting used to naked females all around me. I\u2019m starting to feel like the weirdo in the trench coat in the middle of a nudist beach.</p><p>Storm\u2019s amazing, I think for the hundredth time, as the entire place claps and hoots. Everyone except a scrawny guy in the corner. I see him there, shouting at her, waving a fist full of money. He refuses to give it to the bouncer collecting for her. I get the impression that Nate\u2019s about to toss him out on his skinny ass.</p><p>And then I don\u2019t know how it happens, but the guy somehow scampers past the bouncers and onto the stage, screaming, \u201cBitch!\u201d A blade appears. I watch in horror as he grabs hold of Storm\u2019s hair and yanks her head back. Even from my distant vantage point, I see his dilated dark pupils. This guy\u2019s on something.</p><p>My jaw drops to scream, but nothing comes out. Not a sound. With a swing of my arm to clear all the glasses off the bar, I spring over and run, shoving people out of the way, kicking and kneeing and punching as I clear a path through. Blood rushes to my head and my feet pound the ground with each heartbeat and all I can think is that I\u2019m going to lose her. Another friend, dead. Mia will grow up without her mother.</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening again.</p> <p>I reach the stage to find a cluster of tight black shirts hovering. I can\u2019t see Storm. I can\u2019t see anything. I push and shove and claw, but I can\u2019t get past the wall. My hands fly to my throat, assuming the worst possible outcome hidden beneath this horde of bodies.</p><p>And I pray.</p><p>I pray to whoever decided to keep me alive that they grant the same grace for Storm, who deserves it far more than I ever did.</p><p>A giant erupts from the crowd bouncers.</p><p>Nate.</p><p>And he has the guy within his grasp.</p> <p>He stalks past me with a menacing look, the guy dangling by the neck from one of his fists. I hope he squeezes too tight and crushes the man\u2019s larynx. But that hope hasn\u2019t calmed my nerves a bit because Storm is somewhere in there and I still don\u2019t know if she\u2019s alive.</p><p>\u201cStorm!\u201d I scream.</p><p>Finally the wall of bouncers breaks apart. Ben guides me through with a hand on my back to find Storm huddled awkwardly on the floor, her limbs folded into themselves. A pang of alarm stabs me. She looks so much like Jenny did in the car.</p><p>I dive to her side.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kacey!\u201d she cries and throws herself on my shoulder. \u201cAll I could think of was Mia.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shaking. \u201cYou\u2019re alive. You\u2019re alive. Thank God you\u2019re alive,\u201d I mumble over and over as my hands grope her arms, her neck, her shoulders. No blood. No wounds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, Kacey. I\u2019m okay.\u201d Her cheeks are red and tear-stained, her makeup smeared all over her face, but she\u2019s smiling now.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I confirm, swallowing the painful ball in my throat. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to die. You\u2019re okay. I haven\u2019t lost you.\u201d I\u2019m too close to Storm. Too close to getting hurt like I did when I lost Jenny. An avalanche of memories crushes any semblance of relief I should feel right now. Suddenly, I\u2019m trapped in the past, with a best friend who I\u2019d known since we were two, who shared days and nights filled with laughter and tears, anger and excitement. An acute ache blossoms in my chest as I realize they\u2019re all the memories I hope to create with Storm too.</p> <p>All the things that man just tried to steal from me.</p><p>With a hint of trepidation, Storm reaches forward and takes my hand in hers. I hadn\u2019t breathed since I leapt over the bar. Now I let the air out of my lungs. And something snaps inside me. I don\u2019t know how to describe it other than to say it\u2019s like the little needle on my moral compass breaks in half.</p><p>As if a hate bomb detonates inside me.</p><p>He tried to steal my second chance from me. He needs to pay.</p><p>Fluorescent lights now shine down over the inside of Penny\u2019s, casting an unpleasant glow over the spilled drinks, empty bottles and garbage as bouncers usher patrons out. I catch Nate\u2019s broad shoulders as he rounds the corner toward the back exit, the guy still within his grip. My teeth crack against each other.</p><p>I\u2019m faintly aware of Trent standing near the front entrance. He\u2019s pointing toward the stage and arguing with a bouncer to let him pass. My attention lingers over him for a split second, but nothing really registers, driven back to the hall where that vile creature, the one who tried to rob me of my new life, left.</p><p>I\u2019m up and running.</p><p>I\u2019m shoving grown men out of the way as I tear down the hall after Nate. I round a corner in time to see his enormous frame pass through the back door. As I speed to catch up, my heart beat racing, blood rushing to my head, I sense my hand grab an empty glass bottle sitting on a crate. Without a distinct thought or message to my body, my hand smashes it against the wall, sending shards of glass flying.</p><p>My fist squeezes the neck tightly, imagining how sharp the broken edges must be.</p><p>How effective they must be.</p><p>When I plow through the back door, I find Storm\u2019s attacker standing in the parking lot. Alone.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Without uttering a sound, I charge forward, my arm drawing behind my back as I ready my aim. The weasel turns to see me and his beady little eyes widen. Six feet, five feet, four feet ... My arm is just about to catapult around to plunge the broken glass deep into his chest, to let him physically feel the level of pain I would have had to face had he been successful in his attack, when two giant trunks sweep in and lift me off the ground, securing my arms tight against me.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I scream. Now I\u2019m kicking and screaming with everything I\u2019m made of. My teeth clamp down on Nate\u2019s arms and sink in, tasting copper. He grunts, but doesn\u2019t stop, carrying me back inside the doorway. He drops me on the ground and leans forward to meet me eye to eye, his hands still securing my arms.</p><p>\u201cLet the police take care of it, Kacey!\u201d The rumble in his voice vibrates through me.</p><p>\u201cPolice?\u201d I frown and peer out past him. The Weasel isn\u2019t alone. Four cruisers with flashing lights line the parking lot and a dozen officers mill about, scratching notes down as witnesses recount the scene of events. Somehow I hadn\u2019t seen them.</p><p>\u201cOhmigod.\u201d I stumble back, vomit rising into my throat, the bottle slipping from my fingers to tumble to the floor as I clutch my middle.</p><p>\u201cI got you before they saw what you were about to do. No one saw anything and if they did, they\u2019ll let it go,\u201d Nate promises, his dark gaze searing deep into my face as if looking for something. For a demon, lurking, perhaps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKacey!\u201d A breathless Trent yells as he catches up with me. I\u2019m hyperventilating by this point, my chest heaving like I\u2019m fighting for my last breath. The one I can never seem to catch. His attention falls to the broken bottle lying by my feet. \u201cGod, Kacey. What were you about to do?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m swallowing and struggling for air and shaking my head and trembling all at the same time. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know,\u201d I mutter over and over again. But I know. I know what I almost did.</p><p>I almost killed a man.</p><p>Street lights pass by all at once and not at all as Dan drives us home in his police car. I know Trent is somewhere behind us on his bike and all I can think of is the look of horror on his face. What were you about to do? he asked. And he knew. No doubt he knew.</p> <p>Storm helps me out of the car as if it were me attacked, not her. How is she acting so normal?</p><p>One step forward. One step forward. One step forward.</p><p>\u201cKacey, I\u2019m okay. I promise,\u201d I vaguely hear Storm say as she leads me hand in hand toward the apartment.</p><p>I know she\u2019s fine and I\u2019m thankful. But I\u2019m struggling. I\u2019m fighting to keep myself from crumbling into pieces on the sidewalk.</p><p>I almost killed a man tonight.</p> <p>Aunt Darla\u2019s counselors were right all along ... One step forward. One step forward. One step\u2014</p><p>Fingers snap in front of my face and break my trance. I look over to see an ocean of worry in Storm\u2019s blue eyes. \u201cI think she\u2019s in shock,\u201d she says to someone else, clearly not me.</p><p>\u201cNo, good. I\u2019m good. Good,\u201d I mumble and suddenly I\u2019m grasping for Storm\u2019s biceps and squeezing, panic surging. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Livie. Please?\u201d She can\u2019t find out what I almost did.</p><p>Storm nods. I see her exchange worried looks with Trent and Dan.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d The ground disappears as a set of strong arms scoops me up. In seconds Trent has me laying on my bed and he\u2019s pulling the covers over me.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not tired,\u201d I mumble, struggling weakly to get up.</p> <p>\u201cJust ... rest. Please?\u201d Trent says softly. His hand smooths over my cheek and I grab it, holding it tight, pressing my lips against his palm.</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d I hear the desperation in my voice.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Kacey,\u201d he whispers. He kicks off his shoes and climbs into bed next to me.</p><p>I close my eyes and nuzzle in his chest, reveling in the warmth of his body, the pound of his heartbeat, the smell of him. \u201cYou hate me, don\u2019t you? You must hate me. I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m broken.\u201d</p><p>Trent squeezes me close to him. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you. I could never hate you. Give me your heart, Kacey. I\u2019ll take everything that comes with it.\u201d</p><p>I start to cry. Uncontrollably, for the first time in four years.</p><p>\u201cPull my finger.\u201d</p><p>Jenny giggles hysterically. She giggles every time Billy says that.</p> <p>And I roll my eyes, just like I do every time he says that. \u201cSo hot, Billy. Take me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKacey,\u201d my mother admonishes, overhearing me.</p><p>Billy winks and squeezes my hand tight and I squeeze back. Mom and Dad are in the front, talking about next week\u2019s game and how I need to get my license soon so they don\u2019t have to cart my ass around anymore. Of course I know they\u2019re joking. They\u2019d never miss one of my rugby games.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop being so cheap and just buy me that damn Porsche already, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanguage, Kacey,\u201d my dad scolds but looks over his shoulder to throw me a smile. I know he\u2019s beaming inside. I scored the winning try at tonight\u2019s rugby game, after all.</p><p>Everything next happens in a fog. My body jerks violently. Something smacks into it. A weight presses down hard against my right side. I feel myself tossed and turned. And then it all just ... stops.</p><p>And I\u2019m vaguely aware that something is very wrong.</p><p>\u201cMom? Dad?\u201d There\u2019s no answer.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to breathe. Something squeezes my ribs. My right side feels numb. And I hear a strange gurgle. I listen closely. It sounds like someone taking their last breath.</p><p>I bolt upright, my body drenched in sweat, my heart pounding against its confines, racing so fast I don\u2019t know where one beat ends and the next begins. For a moment, I curl up into a tight ball and rock, trying to shake that dreaded knowledge that I had caused the accident. That it was me who distracted my dad with my smart ass remarks. That, if I hadn\u2019t distracted him, he would have seen the car coming and could have avoided it. But I know I can\u2019t change it now anyway. I can\u2019t change anything.</p><p>I\u2019m relieved to find Trent lying next to me, his bare chest rising and falling slowly. He hasn\u2019t abandoned me yet. The street light outside casts a pleasant glow over his body and I sit quietly and take it in, wanting to mold myself to it. I fight against the urge to touch it, to trace my fingers along its perfectly sculpted curves.</p><p>With a sigh, I stand and walk over to my dresser on wobbly legs, wondering how long before this new life falls apart too. Before I lose Trent, and Storm, and Mia. This new life was almost dismantled tonight. Just like that. I should just walk away, I tell myself. Disappear and end all of these relationships that have been forced on me and spare everyone more heart ache. But I know that\u2019s not possible. I\u2019m in too deep. I\u2019ve somehow made room for all of them in my life and my heart. That or they\u2019ve made room for me in theirs. Either way, with each passing day, I won't survive the void that will be left when they\u2019re gone.</p><p>With my back to Trent\u2019s sleeping form, I let my soaked dress drop to the floor. I unsnap my bra and toss it alongside the dress. My panties follow next. Removing a tank top and shorts from my top drawer, I\u2019m considering hopping in the shower to cool off when a soft voice says, \u201cYou have the prettiest red hair.\u201d</p><p>I freeze, my cheeks flaming, acutely aware that I am standing completely naked in front of a guy that can make me climax with the right look. I hear the bed creak and footsteps approach slowly, but I don\u2019t move. Trent edges up behind me and the air in the room grows thicker. I can\u2019t turn around. I can\u2019t face him and I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>I can feel his very existence as if it\u2019s wrapping its hand around my soul, cradling it, trying to protect it from harm and I\u2019m terrified. Terrified because I don\u2019t ever want the feeling to end.</p><p>Every nerve in my body short-circuits. I stiffen as his hand grazes my shoulder before shifting my hair over to one side, exposing one side of my neck as he likes to do. A cool breeze tickles there as he leans down close.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so very beautiful. All of you.\u201d</p><p>He yanks my PJs out of my grasp and lets them drop to the ground as he takes my hand in his. His mouth trails off to my right shoulder and he begins to sweep across my scar line with tiny kisses, sending shivers everywhere. Pushing my arm up so my hand rests on my head, I sense him shifting his body. Down, down, he continues, his mouth moving gently along my rib cage, over my hip, all the way to my outer thigh, kissing each line marking my tragic past. The entire time, my left hand holds his while my other one rests on my head. And my body trembles with anticipation.</p><p>Trent\u2019s hands move to grip the outsides of my thighs securely as he lays a final kiss on my tail bone and I wobble slightly from weakened knees. I sense him standing behind me again, his hands skating back up and around to my belly, pulling my body firmly against him, letting me feel him hard against my back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My head falls back against his chest with a mixture of excitement and frustration\u2014excited that Trent is allowing me close to him again after weeks of keeping me away, frustrated that this will end all too abruptly.</p><p>But he shows no signs of ending this now as his hands continue up to slip over the contours of my br**sts, cupping their fullness. I hear the sharp intake of air in his lungs. Slowly, he turns me around and pins my arms behind my back.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but I can\u2019t bring myself to look at him, so I stare at the tiny scar line along his collar bone instead, and feel his chest rise and fall against mine, my ni**les hardening as they graze against his skin. My breath comes out in short pants as he leans down and whispers, \u201cLook at me, Kacey.\u201d</p><p>I do. I look up and let myself sink into those blue eyes, so full of worry and pain and desire.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you whole again, Kacey. I promise you, I will,\u201d he whispers. And then his mouth covers mine.</p><p>I\u2019m faintly aware of the wall now flattening against my back, of his boxers dropping to the ground, of strong arms lifting me up, of my legs wrapping around his hips, of feeling him against me.</p><p>Pushing inside me.</p><p>Making me whole.</p><p>It\u2019s still dark outside when I wake again. This time my head rests on Trent\u2019s chest, my body entwined with his. His fingers doodling over my back tells me he\u2019s awake. It\u2019s not a nightmare that\u2019s woken me up this time. It\u2019s Storm and Dan\u2019s raised voices through the wall.</p> <p>\u201cHe could have killed you, Nora,\u201d Dan yells. \u201cForget the money. You don\u2019t need the money.\u201d</p><p>Storm\u2019s voice isn\u2019t nearly as loud or booming, but I manage to hear it all the same.</p><p>\u201cYou think I spent all those years training with a place like Penny\u2019s as my goal? I screwed up, Dan. I made bad choices and I have to live with them. For now. For Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia is who I\u2019m thinking about. What if that guy killed you tonight? Who would take care of her? Her father? From prison?\u201d There\u2019s a quiet moment and then Dan starts yelling again. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this, Nora. I can\u2019t be afraid you\u2019re going to die every time you go to work.\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cLook who\u2019s talking,\u201d I mutter to myself, but then I bite my tongue. This is between them.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not making decisions based on what some man wants because when you\u2019re gone and I\u2019m still here, I have to live with the outcome.\u201d I hear her voice crack at the end and I know she\u2019s crying. The yelling dies down and I\u2019m glad. I don\u2019t want to hear Dan and Storm break up.</p> <p>\u201cCan I ask you something without you getting angry, Kacey?\u201d Trent asks into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d I agree without thinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about the driver who hit your car?\u201d</p><p>My body instantly tenses. \u201cHe was drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all? No name, face, anything?\u201d</p><p>I pause, deciding if I want to answer. \u201cName. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember it?\u201d</p><p>I inhale sharply. I\u2019ll never forget. \u201cSasha Daniels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause as Trent continues drawing swirls on my back and I start to believe the conversation is over. Stupid girl. \u201cWas he alone?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate but decide to answer. \u201cHe had two friends. Derek Maynard and Cole Reynolds. Derek and Sasha weren\u2019t wearing seat belts. They were both thrown from their vehicle.\u201d</p><p>My head rises and lowers with Trent\u2019s deep breath. \u201cHas the survivor\u2014this Cole guy\u2014made contact with you?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and enjoy the warmth of Trent\u2019s chest, fighting the dread as he drags me back into the deep, dark place. \u201cHis family tried. I filed restraining orders and told the police that if any of them so much as approach me or Livie, I\u2019d kill them all.\u201d At the time, I was bound to a bed and unable to move, let alone murder. Still, the cops came through with passing the message along.</p><p>Now though, now I know I\u2019m capable of anything.</p><p>Of murder.</p><p>Trent\u2019s fingers stop drawing on my back and he hugs me protectively. \u201cI\u2019m going to suggest something, Kacey. Please don\u2019t get mad.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. I just listen to his heartbeat. I let it consume me. I feel it with every fiber of my body.</p><p>\u201cI think you should meet this Cole guy. Maybe there\u2019d be some sort of closure. You two are the only survivors of a horrific accident. You have something in common.\u201d</p><p>Now I sit up. I sit up and stare at Trent. I stare at him like he\u2019s grown five heads and set three of them on fire and the other two are eating the flaming heads. Pacing my racing heart and calming myself, I speak.</p><p>\u201cI will say this once and never again.\u201d My voice is even. I don\u2019t yell, I don\u2019t cry, I don\u2019t shake. \u201cI do not want to see, or talk to, or know Cole Reynolds.\u201d The name twists my mouth with distain. \u201cIt was his car that plowed into ours. He handed his keys to his friend who then shattered my life to smithereens. I hope wherever he is, he is suffering. I hope everyone he loves has abandoned him. I hope he doesn\u2019t have a dime and has to eat cat food and maggots. I hope he goes to sleep every night and wakes up reliving that terrible night. Reliving what he did to me. To Livie.\u201d I let out a vacuous sigh and lie back down on Trent\u2019s chest as if unloading that sheer magnitude of hatred is somehow liberating. \u201cAnd then I hope his balls catch on fire.\u201d My voice is cold and hard. I don\u2019t bother to conceal the hatred of my words. I unleash full-heartedly. I revel in it. Hatred good. Forgiveness bad.</p><p>Silence takes over as Trent\u2019s arms tighten around me, his chin resting on the top of my head. I feel a new tension in him and I\u2019m not surprised. I stare at the wall and wonder just how screwed up Cole Reynolds\u2019 life really is. I wonder if he\u2019s resorted to working in a strip club to give his sister the life she deserves. I wonder if he had to abandon his dreams of college. I wonder if he winces in pain with every rain fall because his body is held together with metal.</p><p>But most of all, I wonder what Trent thinks of his pretty little f**ked up redhead now.</p><p>I wake up to an empty room and a note on my pillow. Five words.</p><p>Had to go. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>I assume Trent has a new work contract. Still, I\u2019m disappointed. I could use another dose of his body if he\u2019s willing to administer. I roll out of bed and stretch, the horror of last night at Penny\u2019s pushed aside in favor of my memories of a night with Trent. It\u2019s been so long since I felt that. Scratch that. I never felt that. Sex was never like that with Billy. I cared deeply about him, but we were young and inexperienced. Trent\u2019s not inexperienced. Trent knows exactly what he\u2019s doing and he does it very well. And, something\u2019s just different with Trent. He\u2019s like ripe watermelon after a lifetime of thirst. He\u2019s like air after years under water.</p><p>He\u2019s like life.</p><p>Stage Six~ Withdrawal</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>I walk into Storm\u2019s apartment to find Mia waiting expectantly like a wide-mouth bass while Dan, in striped boxers no less, tosses Cheerios into her mouth. I guess Storm and Dan made up. Relief swells inside me. I like seeing Storm with him.</p><p>He stops the game to take me in with a worried look. \u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d I smile as I pop a Cheerio into my mouth. Dan doesn\u2019t know me. He doesn\u2019t know how skilled I am at entombing horrid memories. I\u2019m a master. In only hours, it\u2019s all but forgotten and, as long as no one brings it up, it will stay that way. I walk over to Storm, who\u2019s mixing batter in a big glass bowl. \u201cPancakes?\u201d She holds up a ladle.</p><p>I nod, patting my stomach. \u201cDid you see Livie this morning?\u201d</p><p>Storm nods. \u201cShe left for school not long ago.\u201d She drops a spoonful of pancake mix onto the griddle and the kitchen fills with the sizzling sound. She fixes me with the same worried look that Dan just gave me. \u201cHow are you feeling, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... good. I\u2019m better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sure? Dan knows a guy you can talk to if it\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m good. Seeing you here, alive and well, and serving me pancakes is all I need.\u201d I rub her back with one hand as I grab a plate of food with the other. Yup, this is exactly what I need. Storm and Mia, and Livie and Trent. Even Dan. This all I need right now.</p><p>Me: I have the night off. You coming over?</p><p>I wait and wait but I get no text response from Trent. Impatient, I walk over to his apartment and knock. No answer. His place is pitch black. Then I wander out to the commons on a fake mission to inspect the hibachi. Really, I want to see if Trent\u2019s bike is there. It is. I go and knock on his door again and wait. Still no response.</p><p>Cain won\u2019t let either of us work that night. In fact, he\u2019s forced Storm to take an entire week with danger pay. I\u2019ll bet Dan is happy about that. By the light bounce in Storm\u2019s step, I think she\u2019s okay with it too. I would be happy too. If Trent was here.</p> <p>I don\u2019t hear from Trent the next day.</p><p>Or the next.</p><p>No text. No call. It\u2019s like he\u2019s dropped off the face of the Earth.</p><p>I go back to Penny\u2019s on the third night with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. The music\u2019s dull, the lights are blinding, the customers\u2019 annoying. It\u2019s not the same without Trent and Storm there and I\u2019m miserable. I can\u2019t even force a smile while concentrating. I know Storm will be back in a few days. Trent though, I feel his absence like a knife in the center of my back. It\u2019s painful, I can\u2019t reach it to pull it out, and I\u2019m sure it will be my demise if it stays as is.</p><p>Trent being gone eats at me all week. It makes me grouchy and snappy and generally unpleasant to be around. I\u2019m well aware of it, and I don\u2019t care. It makes me start fights with Livie on my one night off over what to watch on television. It makes her start to cry and call me a bitch. Livie never does that. It makes me lurk through the commons every night, casting furtive glances at 1D. The end result is the same. Darkness. Where ever he went, Trent\u2019s not back.</p><p>What if he\u2019s never coming back?</p> <p>Day Five.</p><p>I scream in horror as I watch my parents\u2019 Audi sink into the river, my eyes locked on the person trapped behind the wheel.</p><p>Trent.</p><p>I\u2019m a sweaty tangled mess in my sheets when I come to, gasping. It was just a dream! Oh, Thank God! It takes me a good fifteen minutes to shake the image scalding my mind. Only now I can\u2019t shake the idea. What if Trent did get into an accident? No one would call me. I\u2019m nobody. I haven\u2019t had a chance to be anybody yet.</p><p>I harass Storm to give me Dan\u2019s number. Then I harass him to check the police reports of a \u2018Trent Emerson\u2019 in an accident. He tells me he can\u2019t abuse his position like that. I snap and slam my phone against the counter. Then I call him back and apologize, and he concedes to bring his laptop so I can search the news, the obits. Anything.</p><p>It\u2019s well into the night before I accept that Trent is probably alive and well. He\u2019s just not with me.</p><p>Day Nine.</p><p>Wandering past Trent\u2019s apartment door on my way to the gym, I freeze. I\u2019m sure I just caught a whiff of something funky.</p> <p>Ohmigod.</p><p>Trent\u2019s dead.</p><p>I run to Tanner\u2019s door and hammer on it until it flies open. Tanner\u2019s standing there with his standard Batman pajama pants and deer-caught-in-the-headlight eyes. \u201cCome on!\u201d I grab his arm and yank him out. \u201cYou need to open 1D right now!\u201d</p><p>Tanner uses his weight to resist me. \u201cWait a minute. I can\u2019t just open\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Trent\u2019s dead!\u201d I shriek.</p><p>That gets him moving. I wait behind him with itchy feet as he fumbles with his giant key ring, his hands shaking. He\u2019s bothered by this. Of course he is.</p><p>When he opens the door, I shove past him, not even considering what I\u2019m rushing in to see. It\u2019s dim and tidy inside. Sparse, even. I wouldn\u2019t know someone lived there had it not been for a laptop sitting on the desk, Trent\u2019s navy sweater hanging over the back of the couch, and the smell of his cologne lingering in the air.</p><p>Tanner moves past me, and does a quick sweep of the bedrooms and bathroom. He even opens the closet door. When he comes back to face me, it\u2019s with a glower. \u201cWhy exactly did you tell me Trent was dead?\u201d</p><p>I swallow, averting my gaze. \u201cOops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, get out of here.\u201d He ushers me toward the door none to gently with a hand on my shoulder. I hear him as he lumbers away, grumbling something about drugs and hormones.</p><p>Day Thirteen.</p><p>Kick. Punch. Spin. Kick.</p><p>The bag takes my punishment without complaint. I slam and pound against it, all my anger and anxiety coming to a head. Trent has another life. That has to be it. A tanned, blonde, unbroken woman. They probably have two perfect little kids together who say \u2018please\u2019 and \u2018thank you\u2019 and haven\u2019t learned to swear like sailors because of their mother\u2019s incessant profanity. He must have run away to Miami and had a quarter-life crisis affair. I am nothing but someone\u2019s quarter-life crisis and I fell for it like a mindless sap.</p><p>Kick Pivot. Spin. Kick.</p><p>This feels good.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m gaining control again.</p><p>Later, at Storm\u2019s house, I sit on the couch and watch an episode of Sponge Bob with Mia. Lying next to me on the cushion is a dark-haired Ken doll. It kind of reminds me of Trent. I give serious consideration to stealing it, painting \u2018Trent\u2019 over its chest, and taking a lighter to where its man parts should be.</p><p>Day Seventeen.</p><p>\u201cWas he real?\u201d I mumble, staring at the phone in my hand. I didn\u2019t buy this for myself, did I?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Livie asks, looking up at me in surprise.</p><p>\u201cTrent, was he real? I mean, I could understand if he wasn\u2019t real. Who could be that beautiful and sweet and perfect and want someone as f**ked up as me?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause and when I look over at Livie, she\u2019s staring at me like I swallowed a bag of broken glass. I can tell she\u2019s worried about me. Storm\u2019s worried about me too. I think even Nate is worried.</p><p>Day Twenty.</p><p>Kick. Punch. Punch. Kick.</p><p>I\u2019m raging against the bag.</p><p>Trent used me. To what sick end, I can\u2019t decide. He obviously has a twisted fetish. He found a damaged woman and targeted her weakness with his dimples and his charm. He broke through my shell, wormed his way in to melt the ice over my heart. Then he abandoned me after uncovering just how f**ked up I really am. But not before getting laid, of course.</p><p>And I let him in. It\u2019s my fault! I\u2019m the idiot.</p><p>I pound away on the twenty pound bag of sand. I love the sand. It absorbs all my emotions without disapproval and lets me use it without expectation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAngry about something?\u201d</p><p>I whip around to find Ben standing behind me with his arms folded over his chest and a knowing smirk on his face. I turn back and execute a perfect kick. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>Ben walks around to catch the bag. He gestures as if to tell me to continue while he holds. \u201cWhere\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>I hoof the bag extra hard, and in a way I know Ben isn\u2019t expecting. I hope it hits him square in the balls, just for bringing up Trent. It doesn\u2019t, but it does earn a grunt. \u201cWhat boyfriend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe one who\u2019s always at the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen him at the bar lately?\u201d Punch.</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause. \u201cNo, suppose I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, Lawyer Boy, what would you deduce from that? Or are you not able to? You\u2019re not going to make a very good lawyer if that\u2019s the case.\u201d</p><p>Another kick to the bag. Another grunt from Ben.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re unattached again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been unattached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, then, how about we go out tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I. Let\u2019s grab an early dinner and head over together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, fine. Whatever,\u201d I say without thinking. I don\u2019t want to think.</p> <p>Ben\u2019s brow arches. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>I stop kicking now and wipe the layer of sweat from my brow with my forearm. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you wanted to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, but I was expecting a \u2018drop dead\u2019 answer instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good for that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d Ben quickly answers, backing away from me. \u201cI\u2019ll come get you at six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, flying through the air with a perfect round house.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I agree to?\u201d I ask myself as I stand under the hot water, staring up at the showerhead, imagining another red serpent there to scare the daylights out of me. If I screamed loud enough, would Trent magically appear? Would he break down the door again? I wouldn\u2019t let him leave this time. Not a chance.</p><p>I run into Livie in the kitchen. We\u2019ve hardly talked since our fight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Livie,\u201d is all I say.</p> <p>She ropes her arm around my waist. \u201cHe\u2019s a jerk, Kacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stupid jerk,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cA big stupid jerk,\u201d she answers. It\u2019s a game we used to play when we were little. It drove our parents batty.</p><p>\u201cA big stupid smelly jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA big stupid smelly jerk with hemorrhoids.\u201d</p><p>I slap my forehead. \u201cOh! And she pulls out the \u2019roids for the win!\u201d</p><p>Livie giggles. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>I slide out from her grip to put my shoes on. \u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike on a date?\u201d Livie\u2019s face lights up.</p><p>I hold my hand up to stall her excitement. \u201cBen\u2019s a meathead from work. We\u2019re grabbing a bite and then he\u2019s driving me to work and I\u2019ll smash his nuts if he tries anything.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a knock on the door. \u201cOne meathead, coming right up!\u201d I joke as I throw open the door, expecting to find Ben\u2019s giant frame and obnoxious grin filling the doorway.</p><p>I stumble back two steps as the air is knocked out of my lungs.</p><p>It\u2019s Trent.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he offers, sliding his aviator glasses off to show me those beautiful two-toned blue eyes that I could lose myself in.</p><p>I stare into those eyes, feeling the blood drain from my body as I watch the full gamut of emotions play across his face\u2014relief, guilt, grief, bitterness, and then guilt again. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an array of reactions showing on my own face but I couldn\u2019t identify any one of them right now. And so I simply stand there, mouth agape, having lost all ability to speak.</p><p>Livie hasn\u2019t though. Far from it. \u201cYou! Stay away from her!\u201d She shrieks, charging forward. Her movement breaks my trance, and I just manage to grab her before she rakes ten layers of Trent\u2019s skin off with flailing claws.</p><p>\u201cGive us a minute, Livie,\u201d I manage to say with complete calm. Inside, a torrent of sensations threaten to sweep me off my feet. The door beside me sways and I fight harder to pull air into my lungs as my heart speeds up. Trent is back. It\u2019s as much a punch to the gut as a swell inside my chest. Like a bad addiction, I know it\u2019s wrong, but, damn, does it leave me satisfied.</p><p>Livie turns and stomps toward her room but not before throwing one last icy glare Trent\u2019s way. \u201cHemorrhoids! Remember that, Kacey!\u201d</p><p>Her sudden outburst and the seriousness of her attitude ruptures my panic attack like a needle to a balloon, and I find myself chuckling. God, I love that girl.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s my laughter that eases Trent, gives him the crazy nerve to touch me, I don\u2019t know. \u201cLet me explain,\u201d he begins, his hands moving to mine.</p><p>I recoil, my mercurial mood snapping back to anger. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch me,\u201d I hiss.</p><p>He holds his hands out in front of him\u2014palms outward\u2014in a sign of peace. \u201cFair enough, Kace. But give me a chance to explain.\u201d</p><p>My arms cross my chest and I hug myself tightly to keep from collapsing. Or reaching out to him, to his warmth. \u201cGo ahead. Explain,\u201d I growl, fighting the overwhelming urge to throw myself at his body, to not listen to any excuse because none of it really matters. It\u2019s the past, and the way he makes me feel when I\u2019m near him is all that matters right now. But I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t weaken.</p><p>His lips part to speak and my knees go wobbly. Oh God. If I have to stand in his presence for one more second, I am going to lose all my fight.</p><p>Ben appears around the corner like a knight in shining armor.</p><p>\u201cTime\u2019s up,\u201d I declare a little too loud. I shoulder pass past Trent, slamming the apartment door shut. \u201cHey, Ben!\u201d It\u2019s obvious to anyone who knows me that this is all an act. I\u2019m never this cheery. I\u2019m never cheery, period.</p><p>Ben looks at me, and then at Trent, and I see the wheels turning. He knows he just interrupted something. He\u2019s a smart meathead. \u201cDo you want me to\u2014\u201d He gestures to the exit, like he\u2019s suggesting he could leave.</p><p>\u201cNope!\u201d I hook my arm through his and tug him forward, holding my head high and Ben\u2019s arm close, letting my anger fuel my steps forward.</p><p>Inside, I feel the walls caving in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve hardly touched your pasta,\u201d Ben notes. We\u2019re at an Italian restaurant five minutes away from Penny\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve touched it plenty,\u201d I grumble as I stab it with my fork. \u201cI\u2019ve touched it so much that your pasta is jealous. I hear talk of a spaghetti smack down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve hardly eaten your pasta,\u201d Ben rephrases but smirks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because of that guy?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve been sitting at this restaurant for forty-five minutes and this is the first question Ben asks me. The rest of the time, I listen to him drone on about the shot knee that kept him from a football scholarship, and about how he wants to be a criminal lawyer in Vegas because that\u2019s where all the rich crooks live. I don\u2019t know if he doesn\u2019t ask me anything because he\u2019s a narcissist or he realizes I don\u2019t like answering questions. Either way, it has suited me just fine.</p><p>I sigh as I pull a twenty out of my purse and toss it on the table. \u201cWe should probably get going soon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He frowns as he hands the money back. \u201cMy treat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having sex with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Who said anything about sex? I\u2019m just here for the meal and the pleasant company.\u201d He acts all offended, but the glimmer in his irises tells me he\u2019s teasing. An unattractive snort escapes me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. Mediocre company.\u201d He shoves a piece of bread into his mouth and adds with a smile, \u201cHot piece of ass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the Ben we know and love,\u201d I confirm with an exaggerated nod and a sugar packet to his forehead.</p><p>\u201cSeriously though,\u201d Ben starts as he scrapes the last mound of pasta from his plate. I wait patiently for him to finish chewing and swallow. \u201cWhy\u2019d you agree to come out with me? You\u2019re obviously not over that other guy and, even if you were, I\u2019m no idiot. I don\u2019t know what that day in the gym was ...\u201d</p><p>Dammit. I am that obvious. I hope I\u2019m not to Trent though. I don\u2019t want him to see through me so easily. He\u2019ll swoop in and melt my defenses with those smoldering baby blues. I shrug. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me, Ben. I\u2019m seven layers of f**ked up with a side of batshit crazy.\u201d</p><p>He grins but I catch the sadness in his eyes as he throws down a few bills to cover the meal. \u201cI already knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then why\u2019d you ask me out? Especially after what I did to you that day in the gym?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugs. \u201cWaiting for your next moment of full on crazy? I\u2019ll be faster next time. In and out.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing, Ben\u2019s shameless honesty a welcome relief.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Kace. I\u2019m around a lot of sluts and airheads. You\u2019re different. You\u2019re smart and funny. And you can shrink a guy\u2019s confidence like no other girl I\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone could shrink that swelled head of yours, Ben.\u201d</p><p>He grins arrogantly. \u201cDepends which head you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear Trent\u2019s back in town?\u201d Storm whispers to me as I pour shots of Patron for a bachelor party.</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d I mutter, pursing my lips. I don\u2019t know what else to say. I haven\u2019t forgotten. I can\u2019t get through a minute without his name popping into my mind, without remembering how incredible his touch feels against my skin, without wanting it all back the way it was for that short, magical period of time before he ripped my heart out of my chest and tossed it to the curb.</p><p>I hate him for making me feel like this. For giving me hope only to yank it all away. For pulling me above the water, helping me breathe again, before shoving my head back under.</p><p>So when I find him staring down at me from the other side of the bar near last call, I have to brace myself against the bar, anger and grief slamming into me with such force that I struggle to stay upright.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I hiss.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Kacey.\u201d That tone, that voice. Already, I felt it probing for my weak spot, a place to wiggle in and win me over. I won\u2019t let it. Not this time.</p><p>\u201cYou had three weeks to talk to me and ... oh wait!\u201d I smack my forehead for effect. \u201cYou disappeared off the face of the f**king earth. That\u2019s right. I almost forgot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust give me five minutes,\u201d he pleads, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cFine! Go ahead. This is the perfect time and place to talk.\u201d My arms fly out, exaggerating how much this is not the perfect time and place to talk.</p><p>Trent\u2019s jaw tenses. \u201cI mean it, Kacey. Five minutes, in private. I need to explain something. I need ... you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you need me? Interesting.\u201d I force the words through clenched teeth. Inside, the glue that holds me together strains against that word. Need. Trent needs me. \u201cFine.\u201d I slap my towel down onto the bar and holler, \u201cback in five, Storm.\u201d</p><p>She looks over, sees Trent, glances at me with concern, but then nods.</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d I stomp past him, acutely aware that Nate and Ben are following close, but I continue. I march past Jeff and Bryan, the two bull dog bouncers who watch over the private rooms. They don\u2019t try to stop me. I\u2019m sure my stiff spine and scowl that says \u201cback the f**k away before I choke you with your own tongue\u201d has something to do with that.</p><p>My leg flies forward to kick open the door to an available room. Spinning on my heels, I stand with arms folded across my chest, watching Trent\u2019s lean body and his apprehensive face come towards me. Jerking my head toward the room, I command, \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKacey ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said private. How much more private can you get than a private room?\u201d I ask, my tone coated with ice.</p><p>With a defeated sigh and a small nod, Trent passes through. Behind him, I see Ben lean in to say something to Nate. It seems to keep the beast at bay. Ben heads toward me with a look of concern. \u201cYou okay, Kacey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Ben?\u201d</p><p>His chin furrows in thought. \u201cI think I\u2019ll stand guard out here. I won\u2019t come in. Not unless I hear something that sounds bad, deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d I offer him a small nod of appreciation. I think, after our sordid past, Ben and I have come to an understanding. I may even call him a friend.</p><p>I storm into the room, slamming the door behind me. Inside is a small dimly lit space with a black lounge chair and mood music, different from what plays out in the main club area. Storm says they have staff to thoroughly clean and sanitize the rooms after each client leaves. Even if that\u2019s not true, right now I don\u2019t care.</p><p>I stalk over to where Trent stands and I shove him backward into the lounge chair. Then my hand fumbles with the side zipper of my skirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you ...\u201d Trent begins to ask but his words die as I unzip my skirt and let it drop to the ground. I step out of the skirt as my hands move to unbutton my gauzy blouse, starting at the top, sliding buttons through eyelets deftly.</p><p>\u201cKacey, no.\u201d Trent leans forward.</p><p>My three inch heel slamming into his chest forces him back into his seat.</p><p>\u201cThis is what you came for, isn\u2019t it? This is what you need?\u201d My tone is as cold as a deep freeze. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve always wanted?\u201d I toss my shirt on the floor and glower back at him in nothing but my bra, panties, and heels. \u201cThis is the part where you tell me I\u2019m so beautiful. So say it. Say it so we can get this over with, and you can disappear again.\u201d My voice wavers a bit at the end and I clam up, not trusting it right now.</p><p>\u201cNo, Kacey. Jeez.\u201d Trent slides off the chair onto his knees, his hands finding their way to my thighs to hold them delicately.</p><p>\u201cNo touching the girls. Did you forget the rules already?\u201d I sneer at him.</p><p>His eyes haven\u2019t left mine, and in them I see a torrent of indescribable emotion that threatens to melt all of my defenses. I have to break his gaze and look away, a lump forming in my throat that I can\u2019t seem to shove down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I never wanted to cause you more pain that you\u2019ve had to endure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Leaving me a vague note the morning after Storm\u2019s attack\u2014after we have sex for the first time\u2014and then disappearing for almost three weeks is your way of not causing me more pain?\u201d My voice cracks and I grit my teeth. I hate my voice.</p><p>His head bows forward against my belly as his hands slide up to my hips before moving back down to my thighs again. They feel so good. I don\u2019t want them to feel good. Damn, traitorous thighs. Fight it, Kacey. Fight it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKacey, I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout pushing you like I did. I thought if you opened up about your past, I could somehow fix it for you. I shouldn\u2019t have kept pushing you like that.\u201d I suck in a gasp as I feel a set of warm lips trail my belly. He knows that\u2019ll melt my defenses. He\u2019s not playing fair. Worse, in this moment I don\u2019t want him to play any other way. \u201cI should have just focused on making you happy. And I will. From now on, Kacey. I will. I will devote every day for the rest of our lives to making you happy. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Will not buy it. Will not buy it. \u201cYou\u2019ve said that before. And then you vanished.\u201d I don\u2019t like the way my tone falters, like I\u2019m about to cry. One ... two ... three... four...</p> <p>Fuck. Useless.</p><p>He leans back on his heels and his hands slide down my thighs again. He doesn\u2019t meet my eyes though, choosing instead to stare at the floor between us. When he speaks, his jaw is set with a hint of anger. \u201cKacey, you\u2019re not the only one with issues. I\u2019m f**ked up, okay? There are things about my past that I don\u2019t know how to tell you. That I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>His admission catches me off guard. Trent with a dark past? I\u2019ve never once even contemplated that. Why have I not contemplated that? I\u2019ve been so wrapped up in my own issues that I haven\u2019t even thought of his, that\u2019s why. But how dark could anything from his past really be? With a shaky finger, I reach out and gently push his chin up so his head tilts back, so those beautiful blue irises can pull me in. He seems so level-headed, so well-adjusted, so perfect.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never once pushed you to divulge your skeletons,\u201d I say, my tone softer, without bitterness.</p><p>\u201cI know. I know, Kace.\u201d Trent\u2019s grip on my thighs tightens as he draws me closer to him. His fingertips slide up to grasp my hips in their entirety, his thumbs sliding along my pelvic bone, lighting a tiny spark of need mixed among these emotional flames already burning bright. My hands instinctively slide down to cover his.</p> <p>He continues. \u201cAfter that night, I ... I thought I pushed you too hard. I thought I caused what happened the night Storm was attacked.\u201d</p><p>I shudder with the reminder. My dark side. My murderous side. \u201cYou didn\u2019t cause that, Trent. That was me, finally coming unhinged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, babe. I know that now. But I had to get away and think. I had to walk away for a while and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have sent me a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I f**ked up. I\u2019m sorry. I just didn\u2019t know how to explain why I ran off. I was scared.\u201d One look up shows me the tears welling in his eyes. All my rage extinguishes, all my defenses shatter.</p><p>I can\u2019t handle seeing Trent like this.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d My hand strokes the back of his head with nothing but compassion while my other one wipes the tear away. Who is this person talking? She\u2019s not the one who ran around the apartment on a tirade, stalking the news, and ready to mutilate Ken dolls.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kacey. I\u2019ll stop pushing you. No more talk of past. None. Just the future. Please? I need you.\u201d</p><p>Again, that need word. I can\u2019t even speak. I only nod.</p><p>But that\u2019s enough for Trent. Strong fingers flexed at my hips tug me down. I willingly drop to my knees. Trent pulls me to him so our bodies hold tight against each other. Warm hands find their way across my bare back to unclasp my bra. He casts it aside and reaches forward to cup my br**sts at the same time that his mouth finally finds mine.</p><p>The feel of his lips sends a wave of irrepressible hunger through my body in a shudder. Three weeks without this. I don\u2019t know how I survived. I reach down and fumble with his shirt. I want it off. Now. I want my bare skin against his. Now.</p><p>As if sensing the urgency, he breaks from my mouth long enough to yank his shirt off over his head and then dives back in, his chest pressing against mine as I slide close to him. \u201cKace,\u201d he whispers, his lips shifting greedily to my neck as one hand moves up my inner thigh to slip under my panties. I gasp as his deft fingers touch me. \u201cI\u2019m never letting you go again. Never.\u201d</p><p>My heart races as I rock back and forth against his hand, as I whisper his name, as I fumble with his zipper, letting the last three weeks disappear into the well of the past.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>\u201cDid I do that?\u201d I frown as my finger touches the side of Trent\u2019s face where a red welt has formed.</p><p>He winces. \u201cLivie\u2019s got a mean left hook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I prop myself up to get a better look at it. And at Trent, in general. At his entire naked body, lying on the carpeted floor of the dimly lit V.I.P. room. I don\u2019t hear the steady pulse of music in the club anymore. That must mean the place is closing up. I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ve been in here. Ben hasn\u2019t bothered us though. Not that I noticed anyway.</p><p>Trent starts to speak and stalls several times. \u201cWhen you left your place with that goon, Livie stormed out and chased me around the commons, screaming at me that I broke your heart. Then she hauled back and punched me, and told me I better go and make you happy again. Forever.\u201d</p><p>My head flops down on Trent\u2019s bare chest as I laugh. \u201cI think my temper may finally be rubbing off on her.\u201d I replay her words in my head as I nuzzle against Trent, inhaling his scent. \u201cForever\u2019s a long time.\u201d</p><p>Trent\u2019s arms squeeze around me. \u201cForever\u2019s not long enough when it\u2019s with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think if I go out there right now, Livie will hit me again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything\u2019s possible. But I do feel pretty happy right about now,\u201d I murmur, stretched out in bed.</p><p>Trent\u2019s arms extend back to cradle his head, a cocky grin curving his lips. \u201cI sure hope so. I tried my best. Five times last night, I think? If that didn\u2019t fix you ...\u201d</p><p>I lift myself up and throw one leg over his body to straddle him, arching my brow. \u201cOh, you fixed me last night. Today\u2019s a different story.\u201d</p><p>Hungry eyes graze the length of my body and then settle on my face with one raised brow. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and then wink secretively.</p><p>He chuckles as his hands push through his hair, sending it into wilder disarray. \u201cI\u2019ve heard redheads were crazy, but man, no one warned me that you were sex fiends.\u201d</p><p>I playfully flick his nose. With a roar, he rolls and pins me down on my back, holding himself up to linger over me, high enough to give me ample view of his entirety. With a wry smile, I throw my legs around his waist and pull him down to meet me.</p><p>The weeks fly by, and Trent stays. He stays in our apartment most nights now. He\u2019s usually at the club late in the evening, sitting and watching me quietly with that intense, teasing stare that makes my knees buckle because I know what\u2019s waiting for me when I get home. He stays, and he makes me happy. Happier than I\u2019ve been in a long time. In many ways, happier than I\u2019ve ever been. He makes me laugh. He makes me giggle. He makes me feel again. And each night, he takes my nightmares away. Not all of them. But they\u2019re not on daily repeat anymore. And when I do wake up, drenched in sweat and gasping for air, Trent\u2019s there to hold me, and stroke my hair, to promise me that it\u2019s over, and what he and I have is real.</p><p>Each day, tiny pieces of Before Kacey fall into place. Or maybe come out from hiding. Maybe Kacey Cleary has been buried somewhere deep inside all this time, just waiting for the right person to pull her from the deep, dark waters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To save her from drowning.</p><p>I don\u2019t notice the pieces at first, but Livie sure does.

When I ask her what\u2019s up, she just shakes her head and says, \u201cKacey\u2019s back.\u201d And she\u2019s happy.</p><p>Storm and Dan are going strong. I think Storm might be in love, though she won\u2019t admit to it for fear of jinxing it. I can tell that Dan is head over heels in love with her and with Mia by the way he watches them, a tiny smile always touching his lips. And Mia?</p><p>Well, one morning, Trent and I wake up to Mia hovering over our bed with a gapped tooth grin and two quarters in the palm of her hand. \u201cLook, Trent! I sold my teeth last night!\u201d All I could do is laugh. Laugh and remind myself to get a lock for the door so Mia doesn\u2019t learn more than cuss words from me. She\u2019s the happiest kid I\u2019ve ever seen because she\u2019s surrounded by people who love her.</p> <p>True to Storm\u2019s promise, I\u2019m making more money at Penny\u2019s than I could ever dream of making elsewhere. My bank statement grows considerably each week. Two more years of this, and I\u2019ll be able to pay for Livie\u2019s first year at Princeton. I\u2019m still banking on that scholarship, which is a good possibility. Livie\u2019s so smart and so good. And so deserving.</p><p>Everything is perfect.</p><p>\u201cWhy do we have to be at Penny\u2019s three hours early?\u201d I moan, pulling my jacket against my body as a light December chill breezes through my body. There\u2019s an unnaturally cool weather front coming through Miami for this time of year, I hear. It\u2019s still balmy compared to Michigan but, all the same, the goose bumps spike on my skin.</p><p>\u201cLiquor license training. We do it every two years. Anyone who serves needs to go through the course,\u201d Storm explains.</p><p>\u201cThree hours of how to pour a drink? Seriously?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says as she bangs on Penny\u2019s back door. \u201cThey let you sample too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll be slurring before our shift starts,\u201d I grumble with a quick nod to Nate as I pass through. It\u2019s dark and quiet inside. I\u2019ve never been at Penny\u2019s when it\u2019s this quiet. \u201cWhere is everyone? This is creeping me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the bar,\u201d Nate rumbles behind me, his hand prodding me forward. I peer over my shoulder and his mouth splits open to reveal gleaming white teeth. I can\u2019t believe I used to be afraid of this giant teddy bear.</p><p>We round the corner into the dimly lit main club area.</p><p>\u201cSurprise! Happy Birthday!\u201d</p><p>I jump back and slam into Nate, who wraps his trunk-of-an-arm loosely around me while his deep laughter reverberates off the ceiling. Everyone\u2019s there, standing on the stage, under the spot lights. Trent, Livie, Dan, Cain, Ben. Even Tanner.</p> <p>And Mia! She\u2019s off to the side, dancing around in circles with Ginger and a bunch of other fully-clothed dancers I don\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cAre you surprised?\u201d Storm giggles as she grabs my arm and tugs me forward. \u201cLivie told us you turn twenty-one soon and we wanted to surprise you. Cain offered to throw you a little party here.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, Cain wanders over and tosses his arm over my shoulder. \u201cHope you\u2019re okay with a birthday party at Penny\u2019s. We figured this would be a guaranteed surprise.\u201d</p><p>I find myself struggling to speak, not sure how to respond as I take in the people. \u201cOf course I am. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He hands me an envelope. \u201cTwenty-one only comes once, Sweetheart. You\u2019re a hard worker and you take care of my Storm. Here\u2019s a little something from everyone. Enjoy the food, the wine. Everything. Take the night off.\u201d He pinches my cheek and then turns to Storm. \u201cKeep that little princess of yours away from the stage, you hear me? Don\u2019t want her getting any ideas.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cOf course, Cain.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as I watch him walk away. He\u2019s an odd duck. Hearing him say that, given this place is his life, and he employs all these dancers to do just that\u2014be on the stage\u2014his words are just plain weird.</p><p>That thought vanishes as I watch Trent find his way over to me with a seductive grin and two champagne flutes in his hands. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t drink, Trent,\u201d I say as I take one.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you know I don\u2019t drink, Kacey.\u201d</p><p>We smile at each other as he curls his free arm around my waist and pulls me into him, kissing my neck. \u201cHas my plan worked? Have I made you happy?\u201d he whispers into my ear.</p><p>My breath hitches. It always does when Trent\u2019s near. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to describe how much.\u201d</p><p>His cool nose grazes my cheek. \u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ...\u201d I lean forward, pressing myself against him. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible, but those electric sparks zap me every time I do like it\u2019s the first time. \u201cBetter yet, how about I show you when we get back home?\u201d</p><p>I feel his response to my implication dig into my stomach and I giggle, still in shock that this gorgeous, sweet, devilish guy is all mine. He clinks his glass against mine. \u201cHere\u2019s to the next eighty years,\u201d he murmurs and then tips his glass back and takes a sip.</p><p>\u201cEighty? God, you\u2019re optimistic. I figured you\u2019re good for another ten, and then I\u2019ll have to trade you in for a younger model.\u201d</p><p>He leans down and kisses my mouth and I taste the champagne\u2019s sweetness on his tongue. \u201cGood luck with that. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>My fingers weave together as I ride back with Trent, the evening breeze nipping at my cheeks. As tempted as I am to let my hands wander, I know better than to distract Trent while he\u2019s driving. I can wait until we get home, but just barely. Livie and Mia are in Dan\u2019s car, following behind us. Storm decided to work. She promised we\u2019d do a girls\u2019 day tomorrow.</p><p>Trent parks the bike and I climb off. I don\u2019t get very far though, before he grabs the front of my jeans at the zipper, and yanks me back to him. \u201cStay in or go out tonight?\u201d His teeth lightly nip my neck.</p><p>\u201cHow about both. First go out, and then stay in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d The sound of his chuckle against my ear sends shivers through my body.</p><p>I giggle. Then I shove him hard and he tumbles to the grass. I start running. \u201cIf you can catch me, you get to choose.\u201d I manage to get the key into the lock before he reaches me. I\u2019m running through the commons toward our apartments, squealing with anticipation, expecting to feel strong hands grab hold of me any second.</p><p>When they don\u2019t, I slow and glance back. Trent is standing in the middle of the commons, frozen, his face ashen like he\u2019s seen a corpse.</p><p>\u201cTrent?\u201d I walk back toward him. Following his riveted gaze, I discover an older well-dressed couple standing ten feet away, watching us. In my mad dash, I\u2019d missed them earlier.</p><p>The man\u2019s appearance strikes me as familiar and I quickly realize what it is. He has Trent\u2019s eyes and mouth. Looking to the woman, her hair pulled into a sophisticated bun, I recognize Trent\u2019s narrow nose.</p><p>\u201cTrent, are these your parents?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>I\u2019ve secretly been dying to meet his parents. His father is a big shot lawyer in Manhattan; his mother runs a creative agency. She funnels a lot of contract work through to Trent. That\u2019s how he gets his clients. I know that they\u2019re divorced and yet here they are. Together. A spike of fear channels through me. There must be bad news if they travelled all the way here together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trent still hasn\u2019t moved, and this is now beyond awkward. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s acting the way he is. It didn\u2019t sound like there was bad blood between them. Someone needs to do something. I step forward with a polite smile and extend my hand. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Kacey.\u201d</p><p>I feel my smile slide off as Trent\u2019s mother\u2019s face lightens five shades. She shuts her eyes and squeezes them shut as if she\u2019s in pain. When they open again, they\u2019re glistening with tears. She turns to Trent and swallows, her words barely above a whisper and full of anguish, \u201cHow could you, Cole!\u201d</p><p>That name.</p><p>My heart stops beating altogether.</p> <p>When it starts up again, it\u2019s a slow, pounding, irregular rhythm. \u201cWhat?\u201d I croak. I turn to find Trent\u2019s face twisted with dread and guilt but I still don\u2019t get it. \u201cWhat ... why did she call you that, Trent?\u201d</p><p>His eyes shine as his lips part to whisper, \u201cI just wanted to make you happy again, Kacey. It\u2019s the only way I can fix it.\u201d</p><p>Stage Seven ~ Breakdown</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>I\u2019m falling.</p> <p>Falling backward into the deep, dark water. It\u2019s pouring over me, into me, through my mouth, up my nose, filling my lungs, seizing my will to breathe, to live.</p><p>I accept it. I welcome it.</p><p>In the distance, I hear voices. I hear people calling my name, but I can\u2019t find them. They\u2019re safe, above water. In another world. The world of the living.</p><p>There\u2019s no place for me there.</p><p>\u201cWhen will she wake up?\u201d I hear Livie ask above the soft rhythmic beeping. I\u2019d heard enough of those machines in my day to recognize it for what it is\u2014a hospital I.V. If that doesn't give me a hint of where I'm at, the sickly sterile hospital odor sure does.</p><p>\u201cWhen her mind is ready,\u201d an unfamiliar male voice explains. \u201cKacey has gone into severe psychological shock. Physically, she\u2019s fine. We\u2019re just ensuring her body stays hydrated and nourished. Now we have to wait.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs this normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, your sister suffered a traumatic experience four years ago and has never recovered emotionally from that.\u201d</p><p>The voices stop long enough that I dare crack open my lids. White and yellow walls fill my hazy vision.</p><p>\u201cKacey!\u201d Livie\u2019s face appears suddenly. Her eyes are puffy and lined with dark rings, like she hasn\u2019t slept in days, her cheeks red and blotchy from crying.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d I ask, my voice coming out raspy.</p><p>\u201cA hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? Why?\u201d</p><p>Livie\u2019s mouth falls open for a second before she pulls it closed again, trying to act calm. For my benefit. I know that. I know my Livie. Always so selfless. Always so caring. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine, Kacey.\u201d Her hands fumble with my blankets to find my fingers. She squeezes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get help. I\u2019ll never let Trent hurt you again.\u201d</p> <p>Trent. That name attacks my body like a thousand pin pricks. I jolt in response.</p><p>Trent is Cole.</p><p>Trent destroyed my life. Twice.</p><p>Suddenly, I\u2019m gasping for air, the reality squeezing my lungs like a vice. \u201cHow ...\u201d I start to say but I can\u2019t speak because I can\u2019t breathe. How is Trent, Cole? How did he find me? Why did he find me?</p><p>\u201cBreathe, Kacey.\u201d Livie tightens her grip on me, crawling in to lie down beside me and I realize I\u2019m hyperventilating.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Livie.\u201d I cry out, tears burning my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m drowning.\u201d</p><p>Her sobs fill the room.</p><p>He knew. All that time he pretended to be caring and sympathetic and unaware of my past, he is the cause of my past. It was his car, his friend, his drunken night that stole my life from me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kacey. You\u2019re safe.\u201d Livie\u2019s arms hug my body to hers, her weight resting against me to stop my body from shaking.</p><p>We stay like that for minutes. Hours. A life time. I don\u2019t know. Nothing changes. Nothing until Storm crashes into the hospital room, panting as if she\u2019s just run a marathon, a wildness in her eyes like I\u2019d never seen before. \u201cI know, Kacey. I know what happened to you. I know everything, now.\u201d Tears spill out over her cheeks. She climbs into the other side of my bed and grabs hold of my hands. The three of us lay like sardines.</p><p>Tangled, sobbing sardines.</p><p>A hissing sound ...</p><p>Bright lights ...</p><p>Blood ...</p><p>Trent\u2019s beautiful face, his hands on the steering wheel.</p><p>Pointing at me.</p><p>Laughing.</p><p>\u201cKacey!\u201d Something sharp smacks my face. \u201cWake up!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still screaming, even as Livie\u2019s bulging eyes comes into focus front of me, and the machines around me. A sharp sting bites my cheek. I raise my hand to test it out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I had to slap you, but you wouldn\u2019t stop screaming,\u201d Livie explains through her tears.</p><p>The nightmares are back, only they\u2019re worse. A million times worse.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t stop screaming, Kacey. You need to stop.\u201d Livie sucks in a sharp sob as she curls up in my bed beside me and begins to rock, muttering to herself, \u201cPlease help her. God, please help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich hospital is this, again?\u201d I\u2019ve been here two days now and Storm and Livie haven\u2019t left my bed except to use the bathroom or get water and food.</p><p>Storm and Livie share a long, edgy glance. \u201cA specialized one.\u201d Livie says slowly.</p><p>\u201cIn Chicago,\u201d Storm adds, setting her chin up a notch.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My voice gathers more strength behind it than I thought possible. I struggle to sit up in bed. I feel like I\u2019ve been run over by a truck.</p><p>Livie rushes to add, \u201cThere\u2019s a P.T.S.D. clinic nearby. It\u2019s supposed to be the best in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... what ... how ...\u201d I finally pull myself upright with the help of the bedrails. \u201cSince when does public health cover the best P.T.S.D. clinic in the country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Kacey.\u201d Storm gently pushes me back down into a lying position. I don\u2019t have the strength to fight her.</p><p>\u201cUh, no, I can\u2019t calm down. We can\u2019t pay for this ...\u201d I fumble with my I.V., cursing to myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Livie asks, panic in her voice.</p><p>\u201cRipping this damn thing out of my arm and getting the hell out of this swanky cuckoo nest.\u201d I swat her hand away as she tries to stop me. \u201cWhat\u2019s it costing, huh? Five thousand per night? Ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, don\u2019t worry about that, Kace.\u201d Storm smooths my hair.</p><p>It\u2019s her turn to get a hand swat. \u201cSomeone has to worry about it! What the hell am I going to do? Take up permanent residence at Penny\u2019s V.I.P. room wearing nothing but knee pads so I can pay the bill!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see our patient is awake?\u201d The unfamiliar soft voice from before interrupts, and stalls my fit. I turn to see a decent looking older man with a receding hair line and kind charcoal eyes hold his hand out toward me. I hadn\u2019t even heard him come in. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Dr. Stayner.\u201d I glare at that hand like it\u2019s covered in spots and oozing puss until he pulls it back. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Your issue with hands.\u201d</p><p>My issue with hands? I scowl at Livie and she averts her gaze.</p><p>If any of this bothers the doctor, I can\u2019t tell. \u201cKacey. Your case was brought to me by\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDan,\u201d Storm cuts in, her eyes shifting between the doctor\u2019s and Livie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cRight. Dan.\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cI think I can help you. I think you can live a normal life again. But I can\u2019t help if you don\u2019t want to be helped. Understand?\u201d I\u2019m left gaping at this man who calls himself a doctor and so clearly can\u2019t be. What kind of doctor walks into a room and says that?</p><p>When I don\u2019t answer, he strolls over to look out the barred window. \u201cDo you want to be happy again, Kacey?\u201d</p><p>Happy. There\u2019s that word. I thought I was happy. And then Trent destroyed me. Again. I fell in love with my family\u2019s murderer. I spent night after night with him next to me, inside me, dreaming of a future with him. Bile rises to my throat with the thought.</p> <p>\u201cA requirement of my therapy session is that my patients talk, Kacey,\u201d Dr. Stayner explains without a hint of sarcasm or annoyance in his voice. \u201cSo I\u2019ll ask you again. Do you want to be happy?\u201d</p><p>God, this guy\u2019s pushy. And he\u2019s going to force me to talk. That\u2019s what this is about. Why does everyone insist on drudging up the past? It\u2019s done. It\u2019s over. No amount of talking will ever change it, will ever bring anyone back. Why am I the only one who sees this?</p><p>That comforting numbness is back and trickling into my limbs and chest, forming a hard icy coating over my heart. My body\u2019s natural defense. Numbness to take away the pain. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as being happy for me.\u201d My voice is cold and hard.</p><p>He turns to me again, those kind eyes tinged with pity. \u201cOh, there is, Miss Cleary. It will be an uphill battle, and I will test you every step of the way. I can be unconventional with my methods. With you, I will do things that are questionable. You may hate me at times, but you and I will get there together. You just have to want to. I will not move you into my clinic until you willingly agree to it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I growl defiantly, the very idea of going anywhere with this new quack outrageous.</p> <p>I hear a choking sound beside me. It\u2019s Livie, struggling to stay calm. \u201cKacey, please,\u201d she pleads.</p><p>I set my jaw stubbornly, even though it pains me to see her like this.</p><p>She sees my knee jerk reaction and sudden rare fury flashes in her eyes. \u201cYou are not the only one who lost their parents, Kacey. This isn\u2019t just about you anymore.\u201d She jumps out of my bed and hovers over me, her fists balled up. And then she rages like I\u2019ve never seen before. \u201cI can\u2019t take it! The nightmares, the fighting, the distance. I\u2019ve had to deal with this for four years, Kacey!\u201d Livie\u2019s hysterical now, tears pouring freely, screaming, and I expect security to stalk in any second. \u201cFour years of watching you come and go in my life, wondering if today\u2019s the day I\u2019m going to find you hanging in a closet or floating in a river. I get that you were in that car. I get that you had to see everything. But what about me?\u201d She chokes, the fury that fueled her forward with that outburst deflating, leaving her looking drained and miserable. \u201cI keep losing you over and over again and I can\u2019t take it anymore!\u201d</p><p>Her words hit me over the head like a sledge hammer.</p><p>I thought my heart was already broken but it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Not completely.</p> <p>Not until now.</p><p>\u201cI know what happened the night Storm was attacked, Kacey. I know,\u201d Livie says, watching me under a meaningful gaze. Storm. I shoot a glare her way, and Livie scolds me with a waggling finger. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare give Storm grief over telling me, Kacey Delyn Cleary. Don\u2019t you dare. Storm told me because she cares about you, and she wants you to get help. You almost attacked a man with a broken beer bottle. We\u2019re not going to help you avoid your shit anymore, understand?\u201d Livie gracelessly wipes the tears away. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it anymore.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve told myself time and time again that this is all for Livie. Everything I've done is to protect Livie. If I watch her now, if I look at what Livie has had to deal with, I wonder if it\u2019s all been about protecting myself? I know Livie lost her parents. I know she lost me too, in a way. But have I ever really considered what she feels like? Tried to put myself in her shoes? I figured no one\u2019s shoes were half as bad as the ones dragging me down like cement blocks. And Livie never let on. She\u2019s always been so strong and level-headed. She\u2019s always been Livie\u2014with or without my parents. I just thought ...</p><p>I didn\u2019t think ... My God! I never really weighed my actions, all my reactions, and what they do to Livie. I just figured if I was upright and breathing, that I was here for her. For Livie. But in a way, I never really have been.</p><p>Suddenly I want to die.</p><p>I feel my head bob up and down, all resistance vanishing as a new level of pain surges. Awareness. All I\u2019ve ever told myself is that I want to protect my little sister from pain, but it hasn\u2019t been about protecting her. It\u2019s been about protecting me. All I keep doing is causing pain for her. For everyone in my life.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Dr. Stayner takes that as an agreement. \u201cI will have your room prepared. The first part of your therapy will begin now.\u201d I\u2019m reeling over how quickly he seems to react. Efficient and business-like, but at the same time like a tornado, swooping in to wreak havoc. He smoothly walks over to the door and motions someone in.</p><p>No. I cower in my bed and squeeze Livie\u2019s hands until she whimpers slightly. Good God, please ... no! He wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>An older version of Trent turns the corner and steps into my room, sorrow marring his handsome features.</p><p>Trent\u2019s father.</p><p>Cole\u2019s father.</p><p>Fuck. I don\u2019t even know what to call him anymore.</p><p>\u201cI want you to listen to what Mr. Reynolds has to say. Nothing more. Just listen. Can you manage that?\u201d Dr. Stayner asks me.</p><p>I think I nod, but I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m too busy staring at this man\u2019s face, how much he reminds me of his face. His eyes that I fell into day after day. Happy. In love. Yes. In love. I was in love with Trent. With my life\u2019s murderer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be here with you the whole time,\u201d Storm says, gripping onto my free hand.</p><p>Trent/Cole\u2019s father clears his throat. \u201cHello, Kacey.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t respond. I just watch him slide his hands into his pockets and hold them there. Just like his son does. \u201cMy name is Carter Reynolds. You can call me Carter.\u201d</p><p>A shiver runs through my body at the sound of that family name.</p><p>\u201cI want to apologize to you for all that my son has put you and your sister through. I tried to do so four years ago, but the police issued the restraining orders. My family and I respected your privacy then. Unfortunately, Cole ... Trent has since harmed you again.\u201d</p><p>He takes a few steps further into the room until he\u2019s at the end of my bed, casting a furtive look at Dr. Stayner, who only smiles at him. \u201cIt was our car ... my car ... that Sasha drove the night of the accident.\u201d A frown flashes across his face. \u201cI think you knew that, though, right? Insurance papers would have specified that.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause as if he\u2019s waiting for me to acknowledge. I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWe lost Cole after the accident. He ceased to exist. He dropped out of Michigan State, quit football, cut off all contact with his friends. He left his girlfriend of four years and stopped drinking altogether. He changed his name from Cole Reynolds to Trent Emerson\u2014his middle name and his mother\u2019s maiden name.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carter pauses, his lips pressing together in a slight scowl. \u201cThat accident tore our family apart. His mother and I divorced a year later.\u201d He waves his hand dismissively. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. What I do want you to know is that Cole ... er ... Trent is a troubled young man. Two years after the accident, I found him in my garage with the car running and a hose connected to the tail pipe. We thought we lost him for good that night.\u201d Carter\u2019s voice cracks with emotion and I feel an unwelcome spike of pain over the image in my head. \u201cSoon after that, we admitted him to Dr. Stayner\u2019s inpatient program for post traumatic stress disorder.\u201d Again, Carter looks to the doctor to see him smiling and nodding him on. \u201cWhen they released Trent, it was with a seal of approval. We were sure he had recovered. He laughed and smiled again. He began calling us regularly. He enrolled in a graphic design school in Rochester. He seemed to have moved on. He even attended outpatient programs and therapy groups to help others get through their grief.</p><p>\u201cThen, six weeks ago, it looked like he was having a relapse. He appeared on his mother\u2019s door step, mumbling something about you and how you\u2019ll never forgive him. We brought him here and admitted him to Dr. Stayner.\u201d</p><p>I fight hard to school the shock from my face. So all the time that Trent was missing, he was here, in Chicago. In a hospital for P.T.S.D., the thing he was insistent on curing me of.</p><p>\u201cA few days after release, Trent was ecstatic again. We couldn\u2019t figure it out. We thought maybe he was manic or on drugs. Dr. Stayner said no to both. He couldn\u2019t tell us what was going on because of patient-doctor privilege.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t know what was going on, to be clear. Trent hid critical information from his sessions with me, knowing I wouldn\u2019t approve,\u201d Dr. Stayner interrupts.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Carter dips his head in assent. \u201cWe figured it out three days ago, when his mother ran into the receptionist here and she asked if Trent and Kacey had worked things out. She didn\u2019t think anything of it, given Trent mentioned he had a girlfriend named Kacey and they were having trouble. I guess he felt telling the receptionist was low risk.\u201d</p><p>Carter sighs. \u201cWhen my son left the inpatient program two years ago, he did so with the belief that if he could fix your life, he would be forgiven for all the pain that he had caused.\u201d He looks down at the floor now, as a shadow of shame crosses his face. \u201cMy son has been watching you from a distance for two years, Kacey. Biding his time until he approached you.\u201d</p><p>I hardly notice Livie\u2019s fingers dig into my forearm. Though I don\u2019t feel much, the knowledge spikes somewhere deep inside. Trent\u2019s been following me? Stalking me? All because he wants to fix what he broke? I want to make you happy. Make you smile. His words play back in my head. It all makes sense now. He truly did. He was on a mission to fix me.</p><p>\u201cHis mother and I had no idea, Kacey. Honestly. But Trent has watched over you for the past two years. He knew someone from school who could hack into your email. That\u2019s how he found out you were moving to Miami. We had no clue that he up and left New York. But he did, leaving his condo and his life to come to follow you with this notion that if he could fix your life, he would be forgiven. We talked daily over email and voice mail. He even came to visit his mother once.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I was a project,\u201d I mutter to myself. A peace project.</p><p>Nauseous. That\u2019s all I feel right now. Thick bile rising up my throat as realization hits. He never cared about me. I was a step in a f**ked up twelve-step program he created in his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d My voice is hollow. It really doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Trent and all the good that he brought to my life is dead. It was never really alive.</p><p>Storm speaks up now, for the first time since Carter stepped in. \u201cKacey, Dan wants you to press charges against Trent. What he did is wrong and illegal and f**ked up on so many levels. He deserves to go to jail.\u201d</p><p>I smirk to myself. Storm never swears. She must be really mad.</p><p>\u201cBut I made him wait to report it until you were feeling better and you could make the call. I thought that should be your call.\u201d She adds with a low growl, \u201ceven though I want to shoot the bastard in the head.\u201d</p> <p>I nod slowly. Report Trent. Charge Trent. Trent goes to jail.</p><p>\u201cHis mother and I understand if you want to press charges,\u201d Carter says calmly, but I see his shoulders droop as he casts away his only son.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word surprises even me as it leaves my lips.</p><p>Carter\u2019s brow curves, surprised. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKacey, are you sure?\u201d Livie asks, her hand squeezing mine.</p><p>I look at her and I nod. I have no idea why, but I know that I don\u2019t want to do that. I\u2019m sure I hate Trent. I\u2019m sure I have to hate him because he\u2019s Cole and hatred for Cole is all that I know.</p><p>I look up at Carter, imagining this man pull his son\u2019s limp body from his car, and it\u2019s not hatred that I feel right now, though. It\u2019s pity. For him, and for Trent, because I\u2019m intimately familiar with the level of pain that would drive a person to do that. It\u2019s an end that has danced through my own thoughts once or twice in the years.</p><p>\u201cNo. No charges. No police. It won\u2019t change anything. It never has.\u201d</p> <p>Carter squeezes his eyelids shut for a moment. \u201cThank you.\u201d The words are hoarse and full of emotion. He clears his throat. With a look at Livie, he adds, \u201cI understand there is a matter of Livie\u2019s custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s no matter. She\u2019s under my custody.\u201d I turn to glare at Livie. Why did she tell him?</p><p>\u201cI called Aunt Darla,\u201d she explained softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you were going to make it for a while. She said she could take me home with her and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No! You can\u2019t leave me,\u201d I yell suddenly, my heart rate spiking.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going anywhere, Kacey,\u201d Carter promises. \u201cExcept back to Miami to go to school. My firm will ensure all the legal custody paperwork is drawn up. Custody may need to go to Ms. Matthews for now, until you\u2019re better or Livie is old enough.\u201d</p><p>I nod numbly. \u201cTh ... thanks.\u201d He\u2019s helping us. Why is he helping us?</p><p>He gives me a firm smile. \u201cI\u2019ve also had a conversation with your uncle.\u201d His eyes turn cold and hard. \u201cThere is still insurance money left, Kacey. He didn\u2019t squander it all. I\u2019ll see to it that it is all transferred into yours and you sister\u2019s name.\u201d He pulls something from his inside coat pocket. \u201cHere\u2019s my business card, should you ever need anything. Ever, Kacey. Livie. Anything. I will help in any way that I can.\u201d He places it on a side table.</p><p>With a nod to Dr. Stayner, he heads toward the door, his shoulders slouched as if carrying a terrible burden. And I suppose he is, after what his son has done. He stops with a hand on the doorknob. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve never seen Trent as happy as he\u2019s been while with you. Never.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the clinic\u2019s large oak doors. They contrast so greatly to the sterile white stucco exterior. Still, it\u2019s a nice building.</p><p>My home for the next little while.</p><p>A tiny hand slips inside mine and I don\u2019t recoil. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not so bad and, if you\u2019re good, when you get out, we\u2019ll go get ice cream,\u201d Mia says with a somber face. She and Dan spent their time visiting Chicago\u2019s zoos and parks while Storm stayed with me. Now, they\u2019re here to see me off. She raises her free hand with two fingers held high. \u201cThree scoops!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Storm slides up behind her with Dan hanging onto her arm, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Mia.\u201d She winks at me.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Livie asks, hooking her arm through mine.</p><p>Inhaling deeply, I look at the place again. \u201cIt looks a little posh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know a guy who knows a guy ... who knows a guy.\u201d Dan grins. For some reason, I don\u2019t believe him. I have a feeling that Carter Reynolds\u2019s manicured hands are somehow in the mix. Maybe I\u2019m a buy one get one free offer for Stayner not curing his son in the first place. For once though, I don\u2019t fight it.</p> <p>Livie and I walk forward, our steps mirroring each other. \u201cThank you for doing this, Kacey,\u201d she whispers, wiping away the tear that rolls down her cheek.</p><p>A man in a light blue uniform opens the door and reaches forward, offering to take my bag.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call as often as they let me,\u201d Livie calls out, giving my forearm one last squeeze before letting go.</p><p>I wink, putting on a brave face for her. \u201cSee you above water.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p> <p>I won\u2019t survive this.</p><p>I can\u2019t survive this.</p><p>All they want me to do is talk. Talk and talk and talk. About my feelings, my nightmares, the almost assault on Storm\u2019s attacker, my dead parents, Jenny, Billy, Trent. Every time I shove it all back into that dark, cramped closet where it belongs, Dr. Stayner barges in and drags it back out like a madman on a mission, with me kicking and screaming as I hang onto his coattails.</p><p>None of this will help me.</p><p>Neither will the anti-anxiety meds. They make me feel tired and nauseous. Dr. Stayner tells me they take time to work.</p><p>I tell him I\u2019m going to punch him in the face.</p> <p>I hate his guts.</p><p>And when I close my eyes at night, Trent is there to greet me, laughing. Always laughing.</p><p>I tell that to Dr. Stayner one day in his office, during my daily private session. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s laughing, Kacey?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I just said, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you told me you had a dream about him laughing at you. But do you believe that he\u2019s laughing?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I glare at him. This conversation has gone on far longer than I expected. This is what I get for opening my big mouth. Normally, I stay quiet and give simple \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d answers. Those have worked well for me so far. I don\u2019t know why I thought this would be an innocuous topic.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s think about this a moment, shall we, Kacey?\u201d He leans back in his chair and he just sits there, watching me. Is he thinking about this? Does he think I\u2019m thinking? This is unnerving. I let my focus roam around his office as a distraction from the awkwardness. It\u2019s small and clinical. He has walls upon walls of books just like any normal shrink should have. But he\u2019s not like any other shrink that I\u2019ve met. I don\u2019t know how to describe him. His voice, his mannerisms, they\u2019re all unusual.</p><p>\u201cTrent is a young college guy who drank too much one night\u2014like most college students. Then he made a horrible, stupid mistake.\u201d</p><p>My hands clench and I lean forward in my chair, imagining myself spurting acid from my teeth to melt Stayner\u2019s skin. \u201cMistake?\u201d I hiss. I hate that word. I hate when they use that word to describe that night. \u201cMy parents are dead.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Stayner\u2019s finger pokes the air. \u201cThat\u2019s the result of his horrible, stupid mistake. That\u2019s not his horrible, stupid mistake, though is it?\u201d When I don\u2019t answer, too busy glaring at the navy blue checker carpet on the ground, I feel something pelt my forehead. I look down to see a paperclip on my lap.</p><p>\u201cDid you just throw a paperclip at me?\u201d I ask with complete sincere shock.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat was Trent\u2019s horrible, stupid, life-altering mistake?\u201d Dr. Stayner pushes.</p><p>\u201cHe drove home,\u201d I grumble.</p><p>Another paperclip pelts my forehead as Dr. Stayner shakes his head frantically, his voice raising a notch. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave his keys to his friend to drive home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo! He made a choice\u2014in his inebriated state\u2014a choice that he shouldn\u2019t ever have made. A very bad and very dangerous choice. And when he sobered up, he learned that that choice killed six people.\u201d There\u2019s a long pause. \u201cPut yourself in his shoes for moment, Kacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dr. Stayner anticipates and cuts my objection off at the knee caps. \u201cYou\u2019ve been drunk before, right?\u201d</p><p>I purse my lips tightly.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A night flashes in my mind without much thought. Six months before the accident, Jenny and I went to a field party and got loaded off Jagger bombs. It was one of the most fun nights I\u2019d ever had. The next morning was another story.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Dr. Stayner continues as if he can read my mind. Maybe he can. Maybe he\u2019s a super-freak quack. \u201cYou probably did a few stupid things, said a few stupid things.\u201d</p><p>I nod begrudgingly.</p><p>\u201cHow drunk were you?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I was ... drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but how drunk?\u201d</p><p>I level him with a glower. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Again, he ignores me. \u201cWould you have driven home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was fifteen at the time, genius!\u201d My fingers are turning white now, gripping onto the chair handles so tightly.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he waves his hand dismissively. But his point hasn\u2019t been made apparently. \u201cWhat about your friend? Friends? Exactly how drunk were they?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it easy to tell? Was it so obvious that they were drunk?\u201d</p><p>I frown as I think back to Jenny dancing and singing on top of a picnic table to Hannah Montana. How drunk was she exactly, I have no clue. Jenny would do that dead sober. Finally I shrug, the memory bringing a painful lump to the back of my throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat if, at the end of the night, that friend told you they had stopped drinking hours ago and could drive home? Would you believe them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answer quickly.</p><p>That finger goes up again, waggling. \u201cThink about that for a minute, now Kacey. We\u2019ve all been there. Out for a good night, had a few drinks. You know you can\u2019t drive, but do you automatically not trust anyone else? I\u2019ve been there, myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you making excuses for drunk driving, Dr. Stayner?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s shaking his head furiously. \u201cAbsolutely not, Kacey. There\u2019s no excuse. Only terrible consequences that people have to live with for the rest of their lives when they make one stupid decision.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re silent for a moment, the doctor no doubt still waiting for my answer.</p><p>I look at my hands. \u201cI guess that could happen,\u201d I begrudgingly admit. Yeah, thinking back, there may have been one or two times that I climbed into a car, assuming the driver was fine because they said so.</p><p>\u201cYes, it could.\u201d Dr. Stayner nods knowingly. \u201cAnd it did happen. To Cole.\u201d</p><p>My rage ignites suddenly. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Are you on his side?\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on no one\u2019s side, Kacey.\u201d His voice has changed to even and calm once again. \u201cWhen I hear your story\u2014the tragic accident\u2014I can\u2019t help but empathize with everyone involved. You. Your family. The boys who died because they didn\u2019t do something as simple as buckle their seat belts. And Cole, the guy who handed someone his keys. When I hear his story, I feel\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I storm out of Dr. Stayner\u2019s office then, with his shouts of, \u201cEmpathy!\u201d following me all the way down the hall, into my room, looking for ways to crawl into my soul and torment me.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going there?\u201d I want to reach into the phone and hug Livie. It\u2019s been seven days and I miss her terribly. I\u2019ve never been away from her for this long. Even while I was in the hospital after the crash, she visited me almost every day.</p><p>\u201cDr. Stayner is definitely unconventional,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>I sigh, exasperated, and then tell her what I know she doesn\u2019t want to hear. \u201cHe\u2019s a nut job, Livie! He yells, he pushes, he tells me what to think. He\u2019s everything that a shrink isn\u2019t supposed to be. I don\u2019t know what quack school he went to, but I can see why Trent came out of here more f**ked up then he went in.\u201d</p><p>Trent. My stomach tightens. Forget about him, Kace. He\u2019s gone. Dead to you.</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. \u201cBut is it working? Are you going to get better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet, Livie. I just don\u2019t know if anything will ever really get better.\u201d</p><p>Jenny laughs hysterically as a car passes us on the road. \u201cDid you see the look on Raileigh\u2019s face when I belted out Super Freak? It was classic.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh along with her. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay to drive?\u201d After I jumped off the hood of George\u2019s truck and tackled one of Billy\u2019s friends to the ground, I knew there was no way I was in any state to get behind the wheel so I gave her my keys.</p><p>She waves her hand dismissively. \u201cOh, yeah. I stopped drinking, like, hours ago! I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>A bright flash of lights distracts us both. They\u2019re headlights and they\u2019re close. Too close.</p><p>My body jerks as Dad\u2019s Audi crashes into something, my seatbelt cutting into my neck from the force as a deafening sound explodes in the air. In seconds it\u2019s over and there\u2019s nothing left but silence and a strange eerie feeling, like all my senses are both paralyzed and working in overdrive.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Nothing. No answer.</p> <p>\u201cJenny?\u201d I look to my side. It\u2019s dark now, but I can see enough to know she\u2019s not sitting behind the wheel anymore. And I know we\u2019re in trouble. \u201cJenny?\u201d I call again, my voice shaky. I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt and open my car door. There\u2019s that saying, scared sober. I know that\u2019s what I am now as walk around the front of the car, keenly aware of the engine\u2019s hiss, and the smoke rising from the mangled hood. It\u2019s totaled. My hands push through my hair as panic rises inside me. \u201cOhmigod, Dad\u2019s going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>A pair of sandals on the ground stop me dead.</p><p>Jenny\u2019s sandals.</p><p>\u201cJenny!\u201d I scream, scrambling over to the patch of grass where she\u2019s lying face down, unmoving. \u201cJenny!\u201d I shake her. She doesn\u2019t respond.</p><p>I need to get help. I need to find my phone. I need to ...</p><p>It\u2019s then that I notice another hunk of metal.</p><p>Another car.</p><p>It\u2019s in far worse shape than the Audi.</p> <p>My stomach sinks. I can faintly make out the outline of people in it. I stand and start waving my arms around frantically, without thought. \u201cHelp!\u201d I scream. There\u2019s no point. We\u2019re on a dark wooded road in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Finally giving up, I creep over to the car, my heart pounding in my ears. \u201cHello?\u201d I whisper. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m more terrified to hear something or nothing at all.</p><p>I get no answer.</p><p>I lean in and squint, trying to get a glimpse through the broken glass. I can\u2019t see ... it\u2019s too dark ...</p><p>Snap. Snap. Snap ... Like stage lights, suddenly a rush of light pours down over the area, illuminating the horrific scene within. An older couple sits hunched over in the front seat and I have to look away, the mess of bloody flesh too gruesome to handle.</p><p>It\u2019s too late for them. I just know it.</p><p>But there\u2019s someone in the back too. I rush over and peer in to see a broken body with raven dark hair cradled in the contorted door.</p><p>\u201cOhmigod.\u201d I gasp, my knees buckling.</p><p>It\u2019s Livie.</p><p>Why the hell is she in this car?</p><p>\u201cKacey.\u201d Icy cold fingers grip my heart at the sound of my name. I peer further in and find a tall dark form sitting next to her. Trent. He\u2019s hurt. Bad. But he\u2019s awake and he\u2019s looking at me with an intense stare.</p><p>\u201cYou murdered my parents, Kacey. You\u2019re a murderer.\u201d</p><p>The night nurse, Sara, rushes into my room just as I\u2019m coming to, screaming at the top of my lungs. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kacey. Shh, it\u2019s okay.\u201d She rubs my back in slow circular motions as a cold sweat breaks out over my body. She continues to do so, even as I curl up in the fetal position, hugging my knees to my chest tightly. \u201cThat one was unusually bad, Kacey.\u201d She\u2019s been in here a few times already, during my night time episodes. \u201cWhat was it about?\u201d I notice she doesn\u2019t ask me if I want to talk about it. She assumes I need to, whether I want to or not. That\u2019s the thing about this place. All they want you to do is talk. And all I want to do is stay quiet.</p><p>\u201cHmm, Kacey?\u201d</p><p>I swallow the prickly lump in my throat. \u201cEmpathy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Stayner\u2019s brow curves up in question. \u201cIs this about the dream you had last night?\u201d</p><p>My scowl tells him it is.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sara told me. She wanted me to know in case there were any concerns. That\u2019s her job. She didn\u2019t betray you.\u201d He says it like it\u2019s a line he\u2019s said time and time again. \u201cWhat happened exactly?\u201d</p><p>For whatever reason, I tell him the entire nightmare, from beginning to end, shivers running over my body as I relive it.</p><p>\u201cAnd what made it so horrible?\u201d</p><p>I c**k my head and glare at the doctor. Clearly he hasn\u2019t been listening to me. \u201cWhat do you mean? Everyone was dead. Jenny was dead, Trent\u2019s parents were dead. I killed Livie. It was just ... so awful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed Livie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm ...\u201d he nods, giving nothing away. \u201cHow did you feel when you saw Jenny lying there, dead?\u201d</p><p>My hands press against my belly button with the thought.</p><p>\u201cSo you mourned her,\u201d he answered for me.</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. She was dead. I\u2019m not a sociopath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she was driving the car that crashed into Trent\u2019s family. Into Livie. How can you possibly mourn her?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m rambling faster than I\u2019m thinking. \u201cBecause it\u2019s Jenny. She\u2019d never want to hurt anyone. She didn\u2019t do it on purpose\u2014\u201d I stop short and glare at him, clueing in. \u201cSasha is not Jenny. I see what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to make me see Sasha and Trent as people who laugh and cry and have families.\u201d</p><p>His know-it-all brows rise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same! I hate them! I hate Trent! He\u2019s a murderer!\u201d</p><p>Dr. Stayner leaps out of his chair and runs over to his book shelf, pulling off the biggest dictionary I\u2019ve ever seen. He storms over and throws it into my lap. \u201cThere. Look up the word, murderer, Kacey. Do it! Look it up!\u201d He doesn\u2019t wait for me to, likely feeling his asinine point made. \u201cYou\u2019re not a stupid girl, Kacey. You can hide behind that word, or you accept it for what it is. Trent is not a murderer, and you don\u2019t hate him. You know both are true, so stop lying to me and, more importantly, stop lying to yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes I do hate him,\u201d I spit back, my voice losing some of its strength.</p><p>I hate Dr. Stayner right now.</p><p>I hate him because in the back of my mind, I know he\u2019s right.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p> <p>Dr. Stayner leads me into a small white room with a window overlooking another small white room. \u201cIs this a one-way mirror?\u201d I knock on it.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is, Kacey. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dr. Dictator,\u201d I grumble, flopping into the pro-offered chair.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Patient Pain in the Ass.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. Sometimes Dr. Stayner\u2019s unconventional methods make this less painful. Mostly not, but sometimes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat punishment do you have in store for me today?\u201d I throw back nonchalantly as the door pushes open. My body goes rigid and I suck in a mouthful of air when I see the face walking through.</p><p>It\u2019s Trent.</p><p>Cole.</p><p>Trent.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>It\u2019s been weeks since I saw him last. With that light brown messy hair of his, striding in with those long, lean muscles, he\u2019s as beautiful as ever. That much I have to admit. And I hate admitting it. Except now I see no smile on his face. No dimples. Nothing that resembles the charming guy I fell in love with.</p> <p>In love with. I clench my teeth to fight the ache that comes with that recognition.</p><p>He takes the chair positioned directly in front of me. I don\u2019t even need to know Trent to read the raw agony alive in his eyes. But because I do know him, or some slice of him, that pain screams out to me.</p><p>And it\u2019s intolerable. Instinctively, I want to reach out and take it away.</p><p>Dr. Stayner\u2019s hands push down on my shoulders a second before I bolt out of the room. \u201cHe can\u2019t see you, Kacey. He can\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d I whisper, my voice shaky. \u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying you hate Trent and we both know you don\u2019t. He\u2019s here so you\u2019ll admit that to yourself once and for all and move on. There\u2019s no room in your recovery to hang onto the idea of hatred.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t pry my eyes away from Trent, even as I deny Dr. Stayner\u2019s words. \u201cYou are one f**ked up, twisted doc\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dr. Stayner cuts me off. \u201cYou know that he\u2019s also my patient, Kacey. And he needs as much help as you do. He also suffers from P.T.S.D. He also deluded himself into thinking he could bury his pain instead of dealing with it appropriately. He just did it in a less conventional way. We won\u2019t talk about that now.\u201d I flinch as he pats my shoulder. \u201cToday, I\u2019m cheating a little. This is a two for one session.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d I shoot an accusatory finger up at him.</p><p>Dr. Stayner smiles as if my reaction is funny. I don\u2019t find any of this funny. I wonder what the medical board will think of this when I report him.</p><p>\u201cThis is as much for Trent\u2019s healing as it is for yours, Kacey. You are going to sit, and you are going to listen to what he has to say. After this, you won\u2019t see him again. He\u2019s leaving after today to go back home. He\u2019s doing well but treating him effectively when he knows you\u2019re in this building has been impossible. I can\u2019t risk the two of you running in to each other. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>An unintelligible grunt is my only answer.</p><p>Dr. Stayner leans over to flip a switch beside a speaker. I could bolt right now. I could. I\u2019d probably get away. But I don\u2019t. I just sit and stare at this guy who I know so well, and not at all, and I wonder what he could possibly have to say. And as much as part of me wants to, I can\u2019t force myself to look away.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t see you. He wanted it that way. There\u2019s a red light to tell him his microphone is now on,\u201d Dr. Stayner explains and I hear a soft click behind me. Glancing back, I see that he\u2019s stepped out of the room, leaving me to face the guy who destroyed me twice.</p><p>I wait with balled fists, and a clenched stomach as Trent shifts in his chair, pulling it forward until his knees touch the glass. He leans forward and rests his elbows on his knees, dropping his focus to his fingers, fidgeting. Those fingers, those hands, they were my salvation not long ago, bringing me remarkable joy. How could things change so quickly?</p><p>With slow almost pained movements, Trent looks up, and he\u2019s level with me, boring into my eyes, those light blue irises flecked with turquoise landing on me with such force that I\u2019m sure he can see me. I panic, shifting to the left and right. His pupils don\u2019t follow. Okay, so maybe Stayner isn\u2019t lying.</p><p>\u201cHey Kacey,\u201d Trent says softly.</p><p>Hi, I mouth back before I can stop myself, the sound of his voice wrenching at my guts.</p><p>Trent clears his voice. \u201cThis is a bit weird, talking to myself in a mirror, but it\u2019s the only way I knew I could get through saying all that I needed to say so ... I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re here, with Dr. Stayner. He\u2019s a great doctor, Kacey. Trust him. I wish I had trusted him fully. Then maybe I wouldn\u2019t have put you through all this.\u201d He presses his lips together and looks away. I\u2019m sure his eyes turn glassy, but they\u2019re normal when he turns back to face me again. \u201cI thought ...\u201d he swallows, his voice husky, \u201cI thought that making you fall in love with me would fix everything else I had done to you. I thought I could make you happy, Kacey. Happy enough that if you ever did find out, you\u2019d be okay with it.\u201d He dips his head into his hands, holding his face for a moment before he lifts it again. A sad smirk touches his lips. \u201cHow f**ked up is that?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause, a chance for me to study him, to remember all those days and nights of laughter and happiness. I can\u2019t believe it was real. It feels like a lifetime ago.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened that night four years ago was the worse decision I\u2019ve ever made, and one that I will live to regret for the rest of my life. If I could turn back time, and save your family, save my family, save Sasha and Derek, I would. I\u2019d do it. I\u2019d do anything to change it.\u201d His Adam\u2019s apple bobs up and down as he swallows. \u201cSasha\u2014\u201d he dips his head again. I close my eyes at the sound of that name. It still hurts, hearing it, but not as much anymore, I find. Not since Dr. Stayner\u2019s lesson on empathy. When I open my eyes, Trent faces me again, unmistakable tears of hurt and loss spilling down his cheek.</p><p>That\u2019s all it takes. My body constricts, the sight of him so upset slashing through any defenses I had left. My hands fly to cover my mouth, tears springing to my eyes before I can stop them. I madly brush them away, but they just keep coming. After everything, seeing Trent in pain still burns me deeply.</p><p>And it\u2019s because I don\u2019t hate him. I can\u2019t. I loved him. If I\u2019m honest with myself, I may still love him. I don\u2019t even care that he basically stalked me. I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t but I know that I don\u2019t.</p><p>There, Dr. Stayner. I admit it. Damn you!</p><p>\u201cSasha was a good guy, Kacey. You won\u2019t believe me, but you would have liked him. I grew up with him.\u201d Trent smiles sadly now, reminiscing. \u201cHe was like a brother to me. He didn\u2019t deserve what happened to him but, in a strange way, it\u2019s better this way. He wouldn\u2019t have lasted ten minutes with that kind of guilt. He\u2014\u201d Trent\u2019s voice cracks as he runs his thumb across his cheeks to wipe away his tears. \u201cHe was a good guy.\u201d</p><p>Trent\u2019s gaze roams the perimeter of the glass window. \u201cI know you must hate me, Kacey. You hated Cole. So much. But I\u2019m not Cole, Kacey. I\u2019m not that guy anymore.\u201d He pauses and inhales deeply. When he speaks again, his voice is steady and even, his irises brighter, his shoulders held a tiny bit higher. \u201cI can\u2019t fix what I did to you. All I can say is that I\u2019m sorry. That and dedicate my life to letting others out there know how much this mistake can cost. How much it can hurt.\u201d His voice drifts off. \u201cThat much I can do. For me and for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a slow, cautious movement, he lifts a shaky hand and presses it against the glass. He holds it there.</p><p>And I can\u2019t help myself.</p><p>I match my fingers perfectly to his, imagining what it would be like to feel his skin again, to have those fingers curl over mine, pull me into him, into his warmth. Into his life.</p><p>We stay like that, hand against hand, tears rolling down my cheeks, for a long moment. Then his hand drops back to his lap and his voice turns soft.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to tell you in person that, even though my intentions were wrong,\u201d now he levels the glass with a gaze full of heat and emotion. One of his Trent stares that buckles my knees. \u201cWhat I felt for you was real, Kacey. It still is real. I just can\u2019t hold onto it anymore. We both need a chance to heal.\u201d</p><p>My heart leaps into my throat. \u201cIt is still real,\u201d I confirm out loud, softly. It is real.</p><p>Fresh tears spill down my cheeks as I realize what\u2019s happening.</p><p>Trent is saying good-bye.</p><p>\u201cI hope that one day you can heal from all of this, and someone can make you laugh. You have such a beautiful laugh, Kacey Cleary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper suddenly, my brow furrowing. \u201cNo!\u2019 Both of my hands fly to the glass to pound on it. I\u2019m not ready for good-bye, I realize. Not like this. Not yet.</p><p>Maybe not ever.</p><p>I can\u2019t explain it. I sure as hell don\u2019t want to feel it. But I do.</p><p>I hold my breath as I watch Trent stand and walk out of the room, stiff-backed. The sight of the door closing\u2014of Trent walking out of my life forever\u2014unleashes a torrent of sobs and I tumble to the ground.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>I study the titles in Dr. Stayner\u2019s library, busying myself so I don\u2019t have to look at the fat lip I gave him after yesterday\u2019s group session. It complements the black eye I gave him in last week\u2019s session. Since the day Trent said good-bye, I feel emptier than ever before. There can be no doubt\u2014Trent or Cole, mistake or murderer\u2014that man had a strong hold on my heart, and he\u2019s taken a chunk of it with him.</p> <p>\u201cSo, my sons have taken to calling Wednesday\u2019s \u201cDad\u2019s Ass Whooping Wednesdays,\u201d Dr. Stayner announces.</p><p>Well, now that the moose is on the table, I can\u2019t very well avoid it. \u201cSorry,\u201d I mumble, hazarding a glance at his face and wincing.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cDon\u2019t be. I know I pushed you a bit harder than I probably should have. Normally I ease my patients into talking about their trauma. I thought a more aggressive approach might work for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gave you that brilliant idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve compartmentalized your emotions and pain so tightly that we might need dy***ite to break through,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI mean, look at you. You\u2019re a trained fighter. You could probably set my sons straight. In fact, I might have you over for dinner to beat the snot out of them soon.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at my unconventional quack of a doctor. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would. You\u2019ve taken all that tragedy and channeled into one hell of a tough defense mechanism.\u201d His voice turns softer. \u201cBut all defense mechanisms can be broken. I think you\u2019ve already learned that.</p><p>\u201cTrent\u2014\u201d His name drifts over my tongue.</p> <p>He nods. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk about the accident today.\u201d My shoulders slump with that news. That\u2019s usually all Dr. Stayner wants to talk about. I wait as he makes himself comfortable in his chair. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about coping. About all the ways that a person can cope. The good, the bad, the ugly.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Stayner goes through a laundry list of coping mechanisms, marking each one off on a finger, cycling through his hands several times. \u201cDrugs, alcohol, sex, anorexia, violence\u2014\u201d I sit and listen, wondering where he\u2019s going with it all. \u201cAn obsession with \u2018saving\u2019 or \u2018fixing\u2019 that which is broken.\u201d I know who he\u2019s talking about.</p><p>I was Trent\u2019s coping mechanism.</p><p>\u201cAll these mechanisms seem like they help at the time, but in the end, they leave you weak and vulnerable. They\u2019re not healthy. They\u2019re not sustainable. No human can lead a healthy fulfilling life with lines of cocaine by their bedside. Make sense so far?\u201d</p><p>I nod. I\u2019m no good for Trent. That\u2019s what Dr. Stayner is saying. That\u2019s why Trent said good-bye. The wound inside is still raw from that day, but I don\u2019t bury the pain. I\u2019m done burying things. There\u2019s no point. Dr. Stayner will drag it right back where it\u2019s impossible to avoid, like a buffalo carcass sprawled out on a one lane highway.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, Kacey, we need to find you a coping method that works for you. Kick boxing is not it. It helps you channel your rage, yes. But let\u2019s find a way to permanently extinguish that rage. I want you to brainstorm with me. What do you think are healthy coping mechanisms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I knew, I\u2019d be doing them, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>I get an eye roll. An eye roll from a professional. \u201cCome on now, you\u2019re a smart girl. Think back to all the things you\u2019ve heard. What other people have suggested. I\u2019ll get you started. Talking to others about the trauma is one.\u201d</p><p>Now it\u2019s my turn to roll my eyes at him.</p><p>Dr. Stayner waves his hands dismissively. \u201cI know, I know. Believe me, you\u2019ve made yourself clear. But talking about your pain and sharing it with others is one of the most powerful ways to cope. It helps you release the hurt, not bottle it up until you explode. Other ways to cope include painting, and reading, setting goals, journaling about your feelings.\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. I could do journaling. It\u2019s still a private activity.</p><p>\u201cYoga\u2019s fantastic too. It helps clear your mind, it makes you focus on your breathing.\u201d</p><p>Breathing. \u201cTen tiny breaths,\u201d I murmur more to myself, feeling my lips curl with the irony.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Dr. Stayner leans forward, pushing his bifocals up with one finger.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, nothing. Something my mother used to say. Take ten tiny breaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did she say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever I was sad or upset or nervous.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Stayner\u2019s fingers rub his chin. \u201cI see, and did she say anything else? Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>I smirk. Of course I remember. It\u2019s firmly emblazoned in my head. \u201cShe would say, \u2018Just breathe, Kacey. Ten tiny breaths. Seize them. Feel them. Love them.\u2019\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause. \u201cAnd what do you think she meant by that?\u201d</p><p>I frown irritably. \u201cShe was telling me to breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d He rolls a pen over the surface of his desk as if in deep thought. \u201cAnd how will tiny breaths help? Why tiny? Why not deep breaths?\u201d</p><p>I slap my hands on his desk. \u201cThat\u2019s what I always asked. Now you see.\u201d</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t see. By the tiny crook of his lips, he sees something different. Something that I don\u2019t see. \u201cDo you think it matters if they\u2019re tiny or deep?\u201d</p><p>I scowl. I don\u2019t like these kinds of games. \u201cWhat do you think she meant by it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think she meant by it?\u201d</p><p>I want to punch Dr. Stayner in the mouth again. I really, really want to punch him again.</p><p>Just breathe, Kacey. Ten tiny breaths. Seize them. Feel them. Love them. I play these words over and over in my head like I have a thousand times before to no avail, as I lie awake in my cell that\u2019s not actually a cell. It\u2019s a nice small room with a private bath and sunny yellow walls, but I feel confined all the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dr. Stayner knew what my mom meant right away.

Eight... Nine ... Ten.</p><p>I try not to fidget with my fingers as they sit folded in my lap. \u201cMy name is Kacey Cleary. Four years ago, my car was hit by a drunk driver. My mother and father, my best friend, and my boyfriend were all killed. I had to sit in the car, holding my dead boyfriend\u2019s hand, listening to my mother take her last breath, until the paramedics could free me.\u201d I pause to swallow. One ... two... three ... I take deep breaths this time. Long, deep breaths. They\u2019re not tiny. They\u2019re huge. They\u2019re monumental.</p><p>\u201cI used alcohol and drugs to drown out the pain at first. Then I moved on to violence and sex. But now,\u201d I look directly at Dr. Stayner, \u201cI just appreciate the fact that I can hug my sister, and laugh with my friends, and walk, and run. That I am alive. That I can breathe.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m above water.</p><p>And this time I\u2019m staying where I belong.</p> <p>A loud rush of clapping greets me at Penny\u2019s as I turn the corner to find everyone waiting for me. Nate\u2019s the first to greet me, stooping down and lifting me up into an enormous bear hug. I don\u2019t even flinch with the contact. I\u2019ve learned to appreciate it fully again.</p><p>\u201cI always knew you were batshit crazy.\u201d Ben hollers from somewhere. I whirl around in time for him to scoop me up and hold me tight to his body. \u201cAnd tough as nails, for surviving all of that,\u201d he adds softly in my ear. \u201cI would have cried like a five year old girl. You okay?\u201d</p><p>I pat his arm as he puts me down. \u201cI\u2019m getting there. I\u2019ve got a really long road ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it hasn\u2019t been the same without you here, I can tell you that much,\u201d he says. His brow suddenly furrows. \u201cHey, so is that your sister over there?\u201d His head nods toward Livie, who\u2019s standing with Storm and Dan. \u201cBecause, I was thinking of asking her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fifteen.\u201d I smack him playfully in the stomach. \u201cHave they not taught you the meaning of statutory rape in school yet, Lawyer Boy?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen in surprise, his hands going up in a sign of surrender. \u201cDammit,\u201d I hear him mutter under his breath, shaking his head as he gives Livie another quick once over.</p><p>It\u2019s just before opening and the girls are in their outfits\u2014or lack thereof\u2014so Mia has stayed home with a sitter.

My unconventional quack is there.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure this constitutes healthy patient-doctor protocol,\u201d I joke, poking him in the ribs.</p><p>He chuckles as he throws his arm around me in a side hug. \u201cNeither does punching your doctor in the face ... twice, but I let that slide so do me a solid.\u201d</p><p>Livie and Storm\u2019s mouths drop open while Dan and Ben double over, laughing.</p><p>\u201cChampagne, anyone?\u201d Cain sweeps through with a pat on the back and a tray of tall, filled flutes. A twinge of familiarity saddens the moment as I remember the last time someone handed me a champagne flute. I was with Trent.</p><p>I miss him. I miss his eyes, his touch, the way he made me feel.</p><p>That\u2019s right. I can admit it to myself now without guilt or anger or resentment.</p><p>I miss Trent. I miss him every day.</p><p>A hand slips under my elbow and squeezes. It\u2019s Storm. She somehow senses the turmoil going on inside me. She understands.</p><p>\u201cTo the toughest nut I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of cracking,\u201d Dr. Stayner announces and we all clink glasses and sip.</p><p>\u201cSo, am I cured, Doc?\u201d I ask, savoring the sweet fizzy liquid pooling in my mouth for more than the taste of it. It reminds me of Trent\u2019s mouth, of the last time that he kissed me.</p><p>He winks. \u201cI\u2019ll never use the word cured, Kacey. Healed is a better word. There\u2019s one last epic step in your recovery before I\u2019d say you\u2019re on your way to healing properly though.\u201d</p><p>My brow quirks. \u201cOh yeah? And what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019ll know when you know. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>I quirk my brow playfully. \u201cTrust a quack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI very expensive quack,\u201d he adds with a wink.</p><p>Speaking of which ... \u201cSo who is this friend of a friend of a friend of Dan\u2019s who got me in to see you? I should probably thank them,\u201d I ask innocently.</p><p>Dr. Stayner\u2019s eyes flash to Storm and then quickly avert to the bar. \u201cOh, look! Caviar!\u201d He slips away to a platter which, no doubt does not have caviar. That pretty much confirms it for me, but I play along anyway. \u201cLivie?\u201d</p><p>She looks like the proverbial cat who swallowed the canary. \u201cDon\u2019t get mad?\u201d</p><p>I wait, smoothing my expression.</p><p>\u201cTrent\u2019s dad paid for it all.\u201d</p><p>I mock gasp and level her with my best glare.</p><p>Livie rushes to explain, all flustered and red-faced. \u201cYou needed help, Kacey and it\u2019s really expensive help. I didn\u2019t want to put you in some government-paid shit because they didn\u2019t help you last time, and the wait lists were too long and\u2014\u201d Tears well up. \u201cCarter had you listed as Dr. Stayner\u2019s patient in under an hour. Dr. Stayner is a friend of theirs and he\u2019s really good and\u2014\u201d The tears are streaming now. \u201cPlease don\u2019t digress. You\u2019re doing so well. Please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLivie!\u201d I grab hold of her shoulders and shake her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I figured it out already. And you did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>She swallows. \u201cI did?\u201d There\u2019s a delay and then she punches my arm, her face twisting in a scowl. \u201cYou knew and you let me freak out?\u201d</p><p>I laugh and pull her to me in a tight hug. \u201cYes, Livie. You always do the right thing. You know, I always think I need to take care of you, but in truth you\u2019re the one who takes care of me. You always have.\u201d</p><p>She laughs softly as she rubs the tears away with the back of her hand.</p><p>I pause, not sure if I should ask, but I do anyway. \u201cHave you talked to Carter about Trent?\u201d</p><p>Livie nods and offers me a gentle smile. I told her about Trent\u2019s goodbye. I\u2019m pretty sure I heard her crying through the phone. Even she can\u2019t hate Trent. \u201cCarter calls me every few weeks to check in. Trent\u2019s doing well, Kacey. Really good,\u201d she whispers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d I nod, smiling. I don\u2019t ask anymore. It\u2019s best that we stay apart, I know that. But it still hurts inside. God it still hurts. But feeling is okay, I tell myself. I won\u2019t hurt forever.</p><p>\u201cSo, girls, I have to tell you something,\u201d Storm interrupts us and looks up at Dan. With a nod from him, she announces, \u201cI\u2019m leaving Penny\u2019s. I\u2019m going to open up an acrobatics school!\u201d</p><p>Livie and I must be mirror images of each other with our jaws hanging open.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not all, Dan just bought a house on the beach and he\u2019s asked Mia and I to move in with him and I said yes. Well,\u201d she rolls her eyes, \u201cMia said yes and what she says goes.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a moment of silence before Livie throws her arms around Storm. \u201cThat\u2019s great, Storm!\u201d She begins to cry again. \u201cOh, these are happy tears, really. I\u2019m going to miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>Bittersweet delight washes over me as Storm and I exchange a glance over Livie\u2019s shoulder. I\u2019m going to miss living next door to her. Everything\u2019s changing. Everyone\u2019s moving on.</p><p>\u201cI was counting on that because,\u201d Storm pushes Livie back for a moment and takes a deep breath, suddenly nervous. \u201cThe house is big. I mean, huge. Dan inherited money from his grandma. We have five bedrooms there. And ... well ... you two have become such an important part of our lives and I want it to stay that way. So we were thinking you guys could move in with us.\u201d</p><p>I look from Livie to Storm to Dan. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t need therapy, Dan?\u201d I ask with all seriousness.He only chuckles, pulling Storm close to him.</p><p>Storm plows on. \u201cLivie, you can concentrate on getting that scholarship to Princeton that I know you\u2019re going to get. Kacey\u2014\u201d she fixes me with a stern look, taking hold of my hands in hers, \u201c\u2014figure out what you want in life and go after it. I\u2019m here for you every step of the way. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>I nod, biting my lip to stop myself from crying. It doesn\u2019t work. Soon, I can\u2019t see her through my tears.</p><p>My happy tears.</p><p>\u201cSure is going to be quiet without you ladies around here,\u201d Tanner says, scratching his head as he sits down beside me on the park bench in the commons. It\u2019s nine at night and dark. The movers are coming in the morning for our things.</p><p>\u201cLike what you\u2019ve done with the place, Tanner,\u201d I say as I take in the tiny white Christmas lights strung through freshly pruned bushes. The gardens are weeded and cut back and there\u2019re a few tiny purple flowers blooming throughout. A new barbeque sits next to a picnic table and, by the lingering scent of grilled meat in the air, I\u2019d say the commons is finally getting some use.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all your sister\u2019s doing,\u201d Tanner mumbles. \u201cKept herself busy while you were away.\u201d He leans back and settles crossed arms on his protruding belly. \u201cSo now I\u2019ve got three apartments to fill. Yours, Storm\u2019s, and 1D.\u201d</p><p>Without meaning to, I peer over my shoulder at the dark window and sadness lingers. \u201cYou haven\u2019t rented it yet? Trent\u2019s been gone for months.\u201d Saying his name makes my mouth dry up and a hollowness blossom inside me.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I know. But he paid for six months. Plus I was hopin\u2019 he might show up again.\u201d He picks at his fingernails in silence for a moment. \u201cI heard the whole story. Livie told me. Tough thing for both of you.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly.</p><p>Tanner stretches his legs out. \u201cDid I ever tell you about my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh ... no ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cName was Bob. He went out one night with his girlfriend. Had one beer too many. Thought he was fine to drive. Hey, it happens. No excuse, but it happens. Wrapped his car around a tree. Killed his girlfriend.\u201d I wait quietly for Tanner to continue, watching his hands fumble and his one leg jitter. \u201cHe was never the same after that. I found him hanging in Dad\u2019s barn six months later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d I swallow as I reach forward tentatively and pat Tanner on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Tanner.\u201d That\u2019s all I can say.</p><p>He nods, accepting my condolences. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible accident on all fronts. The wrong doer. The victims. They all suffer somethin\u2019 fierce, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right,\u201d I answer hoarsely, concentrating on the tiny Christmas lights, wondering if Tanner needed two months of intense therapy to come to that realization.</p> <p>\u201cWell, anyway,\u201d Tanner stands up. \u201cI hope Bob\u2019s at peace now. I like to think he met up with Kimmy in Heaven. Maybe she forgave him for what he did to her.\u201d Tanner walks away with his hands in his pockets, leaving me to stare at the dark window in 1D.</p><p>And suddenly I know what I need to do.</p><p>I can barely dial Dr. Stayner\u2019s number, my hands trembling. He gave it to me in case of emergencies. This is an emergency.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d the smooth voice answers and I picture him sitting in a wing chair by a fire with his glasses sitting on his nose, reading a Shrinks Today magazine.</p><p>\u201cDr. Stayner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Kacey? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. Dr. Stayner, I have a favor to ask of you. I know it\u2019s probably an abuse of our relationship and confidentiality but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Kacey?\u201d I can hear the patient smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cTell him that I forgive him. For everything.\u201d There\u2019s a long pause. \u201cDr. Stayner? Can you do that? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly can, Kacey.\u201d</p><p>Stage Nine \u2013 Forgiveness</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Waves lap at my feet as I walk along the shore line toward home, watching the sun dive below the horizon for the night. When Storm said \u201cthe beach,\u201d I didn\u2019t know she meant a property that backs right onto Miami Beach. And when she said \u201ca big house\u201d I didn\u2019t know she meant a sprawling three story mansion with wrap-around balconies and a separate wing for Livie and I. Apparently, Grandma Ryder had her wrinkly fingers in the oil fields and her only grandchild, Officer Dan, made out like a fox in a henhouse.</p><p>We\u2019ve been here almost five months and I still haven\u2019t quite settled. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because it\u2019s too beautiful to be real, or if it\u2019s missing something.</p><p>Or someone.</p><p>Every night, I walk along the beach, listening to the calm waves lap up onto the shore, appreciating the fact that I can walk, and run, and breathe. And love. And I wonder where Trent is. And how he\u2019s doing. If he\u2019s found a good coping mechanism to help him heal. Dr. Stayner never updated me after that phone call. I trust that he passed on the message. I have no doubt about that. I can only hope that it has brought Trent some level of peace.</p><p>But I haven\u2019t pushed further. I have no right. I\u2019ve asked Livie a few times if she\u2019s heard about Trent from Carter. Carter makes a point of calling Livie every other Sunday to check in on us and ask her how school is going. I think Livie really likes that. It\u2019s like she has a father figure in her life to help fill the vast hole left after the accident. Maybe, in time, I\u2019ll be able to talk to him too. I don't know ...</p><p>Every time I ask about Trent though, she all but pleads with me not to hurt him or myself by reopening those wounds. Of course Livie\u2019s right. Livie always knows what\u2019s best.</p><p>I try not to think about Trent moving on with his life, even though he probably has. Thinking of him with his arms around anyone else only feeds the deep ache in my chest. I need more time before I can face that reality. And my love for him, well, I don\u2019t know that it will ever fade. I\u2019ll just move on with my life, a part of me always wishing he were in it. Moving on ... Something I haven\u2019t done since my parents died. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My feet slow as I gaze out at the sun dropping below the horizon, its last light dancing over thousands of ripples, and I thank God for giving me a second chance.</p><p>\u201cI think I like this meeting place better than the laundromat.\u201d</p><p>The sound of that deep voice stops my heart dead. I gasp and spin around to find blue eyes and a mess of golden brown hair.</p><p>Trent is standing in front of me with his hands in his pockets. Here, in person.</p> <p>I struggle to kick start my breathing as my heart starts up again, only now it\u2019s pounding slow and rhythmic against my chest cavity. A jumble of emotions slam into me and I stand frozen, trying to separate and understand each one so I can deal with them. Not suppress them. No more bottling.</p><p>I feel happiness. Happiness that Trent is here.</p><p>Longing. Longing to feel him against my skin again, his arms protecting me, his mouth on mine.</p><p>Love. Whatever happened between us, it was real. I know it was real. And I love him for letting me experience that.</p><p>Hope. Hope that something beautiful may come from this tragic story.</p> <p>Fear. Fear that it won\u2019t.</p><p>Forgiveness ... forgiveness.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I blurt out without thinking, my body trembling.</p><p>\u201cLivie asked me to come.\u201d</p><p>Livie. Always the surprise. Trent\u2019s voice is so low and smooth. I could close my eyes and listen to it vibrate in my ear drums all night long, but I don\u2019t because I\u2019m terrified he\u2019ll disappear. So I stare at him, at his parted lips, at his blue on blue irises as they roam my face.</p><p>\u201cI guess she\u2019s convinced you don\u2019t stuff kittens into ATMs anymore.\u201d I finally manage to say.</p> <p>He chuckles, his eyes twinkling. \u201cNo, I suppose that\u2019s one less worry for her.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s a mere five feet away, three steps from my arms, and I can\u2019t close the distance. I want to, so badly. But it\u2019s not my right. That lean strong body, that face, that smile, that heart\u2014none of it belongs to me anymore, outside of my dreams. Someone else will enjoy that blessing. Maybe they already are. \u201cDoes Dr. Stayner know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>I watch Trent\u2019s chest rise and fall with a deep inhale. \u201cYeah, I told him. I don\u2019t hide anything from him anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I hug myself tightly. \u201cSo how are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He gazes at me for a long moment before he smiles. \u201cI\u2019m good, Kacey.\u201d There\u2019s a pause. \u201cBut not great.\u201d</p><p>I feel my brow furrow with concern. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong? Is therapy not working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Trent\u2019s brow arches as he takes two steps forward, closing the distance, his hands firmly gripping the sides of my waist. I suck in a gasp of air, his proximity to my body both alarming and intoxicating. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong is that every morning and every night, I lie in bed wondering why you\u2019re not beside me.\u201d</p><p>My legs start to wobble. \u201cYou know why,\u201d I answer in a low, defeated voice. Inside I\u2019m screaming, cursing reality.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I knew why before. But you set me free, Kacey, remember?\u201d</p><p>I forgive you. I nod and swallow. His hand lifts to stroke my cheek with the pad of this thumb.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s nowhere I\u2019d rather be than with you.\u201d His thumb grazes my bottom lip.</p><p>I can\u2019t seem to catch a breath. My hand shakes as I push a lock of hair back behind my ear. \u201cWhat does Dr. Stayner say about this? Isn\u2019t this wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Kace.\u201d Trent\u2019s lips curve and he flashes me the deepest set of dimples I\u2019ve ever seen, buckling my knees. \u201cNothing\u2019s ever been more right.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all I need to hear. I barrel into his arms, my mouth connecting with his.</p><p>Seizing him. Feeling him. Loving him.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>A light breeze ruffles the folds of Storm\u2019s dress as she and Dan stand for pictures with the ocean and a fall sunset as a back drop. She\u2019s the most beautiful bride I\u2019ve ever seen, all the more so with her swollen belly. The baby is due in just three months and Mia has taken to referring to it as \u201cAlien Baby X.\u201d I don\u2019t know where she comes up with this stuff. Dan, probably. The baby is another girl. Dan jokes that he\u2019s doomed, but secretly, I think he misses all the female companionship. The beach house is a little less estrogen-laden these days with Livie in New Jersey and me dividing my time between there, school, and Trent\u2019s condo five minutes away.</p><p>\u201cWho knew there\u2019d be so many hot women at a wedding?\u201d Trent sidles up behind me, hanging his arms around my shoulders. My stomach does a nervous somersault flutter. It always does that when Trent touches me. Even after three years, he can do things to me with a look that I thought impossible. I hope that never fades.</p><p>\u201cBy so many, you mean one, right?\u201d I murmur as I tip my head back and nuzzle my nose against his jaw line.</p><p>He groans. \u201cYou trying to give me an erection in front of my parents?\u201d</p><p>I laugh and roll my gaze over to see Carter and Bonnie watching us from the distance, and they\u2019re beaming. During therapy, I realized that me barring them from my and Livie\u2019s life from the beginning didn\u2019t allow them the chance to heal as a family. After Trent and I reconnected, I made a point of writing a heartfelt note to them as way of apology. First Bonnie appeared at my door in tears, then Carter. One thing led to another and here they are, hand in hand, a family again.</p><p>The wind carries Livie\u2019s soft giggle to us. She\u2019s with Mia, who\u2019s busy showing her all her new grown up teeth. Livie earned that full scholarship to Princeton like we all expected so we don\u2019t see her much anymore. I\u2019m so proud of her. I know Dad would be too.</p><p>But I miss her like crazy.</p><p>And I think she\u2019s dating someone, but I\u2019m not sure. She\u2019s remaining vague about whatever\u2019s going on in Princeton, and that\u2019s usually a sign of a man. I hope she is. Livie deserves that and so much more.</p><p>I look out over the crowd of friendly faces. They\u2019re all there. Cain and Nate\u2014as dashing in suits as any man can be. Tanner, with a lady friend who he met online. Even Ben, arm in arm with a blonde bombshell lawyer from the firm he just joined. He catches me watching him and he winks. I can\u2019t help but chuckle. Oh, Ben.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go to Vegas next week?\u201d Trent whispers, biting my ear playfully.</p><p>I giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve got midterms, remember?\u201d I just finished my first year of psychology at State. I plan on specializing in post-traumatic stress disorder therapy. I already have a killer reference from the renowned and unorthodox Dr. Stayner.</p><p>\u201cJust a quick trip. To the chapel and back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I lean back and look into his eyes to see if he\u2019s joking. I see nothing but love.</p><p>His fingers graze my cheek lovingly. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p><p>Trent has kept his promise. He makes me smile every day. </p> </body></html>"]
