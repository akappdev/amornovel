You know how I love the begging. In fact, you probably know too many things and know them far too well.</p><p>It\u2019s been a long time since Captive in the Dark; today is Friday, February 8th, 2013. In May it will have been four years since I sat in a tinted sedan and contemplated kidnapping Livvie. I\u2019m twenty-nine now and I finally know it for a fact. Sometimes I wish I didn\u2019t because I have to face turning thirty in August. Livvie is eight years my junior, but you wouldn\u2019t know it by the way she talks to me sometimes (I think she just likes getting a spanking). Livvie and I have changed considerably from the people you read about. However, because you begged so nicely, I will endeavor to tell you the story you want to hear.</p><p>Before I move on, a word about names. They were very important in Livvie\u2019s books and it\u2019s worth mentioning. Shakespeare asked, \u201cWhat is in a name?\u201d I can tell you\u2014a whole hell of a lot.</p> <p>Livvie is now named Sophia. She changed her name when she entered the witness protection program in the United States in exchange for her testimony against her kidnapper and ra**st (that\u2019s me).</p><p>However, you know her as Livvie and so I\u2019ll continue to call her that for your benefit, but of course, that would beg the question: Who am I?</p><p>Am I Caleb?</p><p>Am I James?</p><p>I\u2019ve often asked myself this very thing and have always come up with a different answer. Perhaps the only truthful answer is, \u201cI am both.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb will always be a part of me\u2014probably the largest part. I want to be James.</p><p>James is a 29-year-old from Oregon. He was raised by his mother and always wondered about his father. He grew up with respect for women but also a need to display his masculinity to make up for his lack of a father. He went to college but took time off before grad school to go and see the world. He met Sophia at The Paseo de Colon and fell instantly in love.</p><p>James never met anyone named Livvie. He never hurt her.</p><p>We know different. We know the truth. So, for the purposes of this story you begged me to tell\u2014I am Caleb.</p><p>I am the man who kidnapped Livvie. I am the man who held her in a dark room for weeks. I\u2019m the one who tied her to a bedpost and beat her. I\u2019m the one who nearly sold her into sexual slavery. But, most importantly, I am the man she loves.</p><p>She loves me. It\u2019s quite sick, isn\u2019t it?</p> <p>Of course, there\u2019s more to our story than can be surmised in a few short sentences, but I\u2019m at a loss for justifying my behavior back then. I assume if you\u2019re reading this, I don\u2019t need to make those justifications. You\u2019ve already made your own.</p><p>You\u2019re reading this because you want to know about the rest of the story. You want to know what happened that warm summer night in September of 2010, the night I met Livvie at The Paseo. It was the night my life changed all over again.</p><p>It didn\u2019t happen exactly as Livvie said. She\u2019s been very kind to me in the retelling of our story. The truth is far more... complicated.</p><p>Livvie would have you believe we kissed and it was all that needed to be said.</p><p>I wish it had been so simple. The part about the kiss is true. She kissed me. It had been a year since we touched. A year since I\u2019d watched her walk away. An entire year since she killed for me and I repaid her by dropping her off at the Mexican border covered in blood. She kissed me and my head did swim. I can tell you unabashedly, it was probably the happiest I\u2019d ever been before.</p><p>Then she slapped me. Hard. I think my head vibrated.</p><p>I remember holding my face together and thinking, \u201cI\u2019m going to jail now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d Livvie asked. I could hear the pain in her voice and it gutted me.</p> <p>I believed she\u2019d moved on. She\u2019d made a life and I\u2019d come along one last time to f**k it up. It was the minute that would never end. In that single minute, I replayed Livvie\u2019s and my time together in my mind and I berated myself for ever thinking she could forgive me for the things I\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t run, Livvie. I\u2019ll let them take me and you\u2019ll never see me again.\u201d I couldn\u2019t meet her eyes. I\u2019d been dreaming of her for so long, imagining her face smiling at me. I couldn\u2019t bear seeing her disgust toward me. I didn\u2019t want to remember her that way.</p><p>Slowly, the longest minute of my life ticked away. I couldn\u2019t hear any sirens; there weren\u2019t any men slamming me to the ground and putting me in handcuffs. It was strange.</p><p>\u201cNever see you again? How stupid could you be? You can\u2019t just walk into my life and expect to leave me again. I won\u2019t let you, Caleb. Not this time.\u201d</p><p>And if you can believe it... she slapped me again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? Stop hitting me!\u201d Livvie was a blur. She hit me so hard my damn eyes were watering (I was not crying\u2014eyes water. I think we all know I\u2019m a badass and I don\u2019t cry). After I cleared my eyes, I could see the anger in hers, the hurt... but also her longing. She longed for me. I knew it only because I could recognize her face as a mirror of my own.</p><p>\u201cHow could you leave me, Caleb? I thought... I thought you were dead,\u201d she cried. She wrapped her arms around my waist and held me tight. It felt so good to have her in my arms again, I couldn\u2019t think of anything but the feel of her against me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Livvie. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I whispered into her hair. I couldn\u2019t believe I was with her again. I can\u2019t even describe it to you. Suffice to say, if I\u2019d died in that moment, I\u2019d have been fine with it.</p><p>We stood there for a long time. She held on to me. I held on to her. We said things with our silence we couldn\u2019t put into words. I suppose that\u2019s what she meant by, \u201cit was all that needed to be said.\u201d</p><p>I felt all the things I could only have felt with Livvie: hollow, and simultaneously, full to bursting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Livvie. I\u2019ve missed you like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long we stood there holding one another as tourists passed us by. We were simply another couple, enjoying the warm evening together. No one knew who we were or what we had been through to get to that moment. However, even in that elegantly prolonged circumstance, I knew it couldn\u2019t last forever. I had many things to say to Livvie. I was afraid of the things she might have to say to me.</p><p>I felt her shaking in my arms, her shoulders quaking against my chest, and I knew she was crying. I didn\u2019t hold it against her. She was more than entitled to her tears. I, unfortunately, couldn\u2019t express myself in quite the same way. So much had happened to me in my life. I\u2019d cried all the tears I had in me to weep. All I could offer was strength. I could be strong for her. I could hold her, rock her, and shield her from the dozens of eyes around us.</p><p>The women glared at me as they passed. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d their eyes accused.</p><p>The men sent pitying glances or condescending smirks my way. \u201cSucks to be you.\u201d</p><p>I ignored them. They weren\u2019t worth my attention.</p><p>\u201cCan I get us out of here?\u201d I asked. I felt the gentle nod of Livvie\u2019s head against my chest. I pulled back slowly, not sure if I was prepared for what might happen next. Suddenly, it didn\u2019t matter. Livvie looked up at me, and even with tears in her eyes, she smiled. I had been waiting a long time to see her smile. It had been worth every horrible second I\u2019d been without her.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too. So much,\u201d she whispered and wiped her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to cry. It\u2019s just... it\u2019s so f**king good to see you!\u201d</p><p>And then I smiled. I took her hand and we walked. All around me, life seemed surreal. I\u2019d have thought I was in a dream were it not for the way my face stung. I was tempted to mention it, to make a joke of some kind to break up the tension just under the surface of our joy, but I opted to say nothing. Livvie was with me and it was all that mattered to me.</p><p>\u201cDid you drive?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I replied somewhat awkwardly. \u201cIt was optimistic, I guess. I figured either it would be my last opportunity to drive the streets of Barcelona, or I\u2019d be driving you back to my place in style.\u201d I laughed half-heartedly. The longer it took to get to my car, the more awkward the situation became.</p><p>Livvie stopped walking and I jerked to a halt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for that... Caleb.\u201d She looked around as if making sure we weren\u2019t alone. She slipped her hand from mine.</p><p>I tried not to let it bother me. Of course she\u2019d be frightened to go anywhere with me, but it still stung. I tried to smile as sincerely as possible and shoved my hands in my pockets.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go to my place. I\u2019ll take you anywhere you want to go. I just... shit, I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m trying to say.\u201d</p><p>Livvie gave me a weak smile, the kind that didn\u2019t reach her eyes. She looked so beautiful, and so sad. She looked just as I remembered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. I\u2019ve been a wreck for the last four hours, just dying to get here so I could see you and now...\u201d She crossed her arms around her stomach and lifted one hand to pull at her bottom lip. It was one of those gestures she made unconsciously and I remembered it well. It reminded me that no matter how much she\u2019d changed in the last year, there were things about her that would never change. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was only natural for her to wonder about the ways I hadn\u2019t changed. Frankly, it took every ounce of my self-control not to grab her and abscond. I had come so close to having everything I wanted, and in a split second it seemed things between Livvie and me would end before we even got to the car.</p><p>I suddenly didn\u2019t trust myself.</p><p>\u201cMaybe... this was a mistake?\u201d I edged. I wanted to give her the choice, but I wasn\u2019t sure I could bear to hear the answer.</p><p>She closed her eyes and squeezed herself a little tighter. Her brows knit together in what I interpreted as sorrow. Her head shook slightly from side to side.</p> <p>I took it as a good sign. Her tells weren\u2019t choice\u2014they were instinct. It thrilled me to know her instinct was to deny any possibility that meeting me was a mistake.</p><p>\u201cI know what I want, Livvie. I want to be a part of your life again. I know we can\u2019t start over. I know you have every reason in the world to want me dead, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She placed her hand over my mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019m not ready for that either,\u201d she said. She almost seemed angry with me.</p><p>I can never overstate the depth and beauty of Livvie\u2019s eyes. I can stare into them forever, until I forget my own name (which, let\u2019s face it\u2014wouldn\u2019t take me long).</p> <p>I took my left hand out of my pocket and covered her hand over my mouth. I kissed her fingers and nodded. It was as close to supplication as I could come without making a groveling ass of myself. It wasn\u2019t pride\u2014it was stratagem. If I had thought groveling would get Livvie into my car, I would have made a good show of it. I\u2019m shameless.</p><p>Slowly, Livvie pulled her hand away from my mouth and curled her fingers around mine. She shook her head and smiled ruefully.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing either, Caleb. I\u2019ve wanted this for so long. I\u2019ve put certain aspects of my life on hold, thinking\u2014hoping that one day you\u2019d find me again. And now you\u2019re here and I have to be honest... it\u2019s freaking me out.\u201d</p><p>I stepped closer to her. I was elated when she didn\u2019t take a step back. Her hand was warm in mine and her red lips were simply begging to be kissed again. She\u2019d caught me off guard with the first one. I was desperate to make the second kiss last.</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t expect you to trust me, but, Livvie, I would never do anything to hurt you again. Just give me a chance to prove it. How can I prove it to you?\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist the urge to stroke her bronzed shoulder. She looked like a goddess. She looked like sex on silky legs. Her kitten tongue, just like I remembered it, swept her bottom lip as she pondered her response. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me with that, Livvie.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted to one side.</p> <p>\u201cKilling you with what?\u201d</p><p>I took a chance and tugged her a little closer. I removed my other hand from my pocket and let my thumb run across the curved bow of her lips. We swallowed.</p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you again, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll scare you away.\u201d I took a step back when she tensed. \u201cSo I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>It was almost more than I cared to take. The impulsive man in me that was used to getting what he wanted at any cost was tempted to take control.</p><p>I realize you\u2019ve somehow been lulled into believing my baser urges had been overcome, but that couldn\u2019t have been further from the truth at the time. I had spent the year prior to our reunion righting old wrongs, and sometimes it had meant being the man Rafiq had raised me to be.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me, Caleb?\u201d Livvie\u2019s voice was small and her fear irritated me because I knew she had a right to it. She cared about me. She wouldn\u2019t have shown up if she didn\u2019t, but I hated her trepidation just the same.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say? You know who I am. You know what I do.\u201d I let go of her hand before she had a chance to pull away from me again. The night was quickly going to shit. I was glad she didn\u2019t have me arrested, but I hadn\u2019t really planned for a scenario involving lust and incredible awkwardness.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t mean it like that. I\u2019m happy to see you, I am! But if you found me... what makes you think someone else can\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>I felt like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. If it weren\u2019t for our conversations, the things I know about you, I don\u2019t think I would have found you. You\u2019re safe, Livvie. No one\u2019s coming for you. I swear it.\u201d I didn\u2019t mention that I\u2019d killed anyone who would have bothered.</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d she asked. I could hear the hesitation in her voice.</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to know, Livvie? Because once you know, I can\u2019t take it back.\u201d I let my eyes meet hers. I was willing to do a lot of things to win her, but she had to accept the harsh truth that I wasn\u2019t a man who played by society\u2019s rules and I never would be.</p><p>\u201cDid you hurt anyone?\u201d Her eyes implored me to say no.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said honestly. I even managed a flirtatious smile. She smiled back.</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I don\u2019t need to know.\u201d She reached for my hand and tugged me in the direction we had been walking.</p><p>\u201cThis still doesn\u2019t solve the problem of what we\u2019re going to do when we get to my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a stick shift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why? Did you finally learn to drive?\u201d I laughed at the memory of her admitting she couldn\u2019t drive. I laughed even harder when she scowled at me and playfully hit my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, you like it when I tease you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you smiling?\u201d I whispered the words in her ear as we walked. All became right in my world when I felt her nudge me with her shoulder and her hand held mine a little tighter. The void in me sighed. I had found a way to feed it.</p><p>\u201cI can drive. I\u2019m not good with a stick though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember you being quite so bad with mine.\u201d A smile played across her lips as she gawked at me. If there\u2019s one thing I know how to do, it\u2019s flirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you handle your stick, Caleb. You\u2019re much better at it than I am.\u201d She kept eye contact with me as I stared at her in shock, but she still blushed something furious.</p><p>I tried to make words come out of my mouth. I settled for smiling and shaking my head. She\u2019d made me uncomfortable in the best way. It was a skill only she seemed to possess. I know it sounds juvenile, but there it is.</p><p>Finally, we reached my car. I\u2019d be lying if I told you I didn\u2019t expect Livvie to be impressed. If you\u2019ve ever stood in the presence of a Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera and not gotten a tingly sensation in your naughty bits, you have to be very young, very old, or completely f**king blind.</p><p>\u201cNice car,\u201d she said.</p><p>I could tell she was trying to be nonchalant. She didn\u2019t do it well. I knew what she looked like when her pu**y was wet.</p><p>\u201cWait until you get inside. It\u2019s my favorite part.\u201d And yes, gentle readers, I am that f**king smooth. I didn\u2019t open the door for her, but considering I was used to women opening them for me, let\u2019s call it progress.</p><p>I slid against the soft black leather and reached for Livvie\u2019s safety harness. Within the enclosed space of the vehicle, her scent infiltrated my senses. I took my time pulling the straps across Livvie\u2019s chest. I could feel her anxiety like a physical caress, but I didn\u2019t think it had to do with fear.</p><p>I was mere inches from her red lips. They were gently parted. I could hear her taking soft open-mouthed breaths. I looked up into her eyes and noticed immediately how they seemed both vigilant, and heavy with desire. She was watching my every move very carefully.</p><p>I leaned closer to her. I moved slowly, giving her every opportunity to say no or push me away. Carefully, I braced myself against her door with one hand. I didn\u2019t want my weight against her, not yet. I brushed the end of her nose with mine, urging her head to tilt upward. I felt her breath against my mouth, faster and heavier than before. And at last, I watched her eyes close as she leaned forward.</p><p>I let the tip of my tongue trace her bottom lip, coaxing her mouth open. I didn\u2019t want to rush things. Well, I did want to, but I know when I shouldn\u2019t. I wanted to push her up against the door, rip off her panties, and ram myself into her, but I suspected she wouldn\u2019t appreciate it as much as I would. It was enough to feel her lips opening for me. I came a little closer and she let out a soft whimper into my mouth.</p><p>She wanted me. She wanted me as much as I wanted her.</p><p>I kissed her for a long time. I couldn\u2019t get enough of her moans. I liked to threaten to pull away and let her lean forward, chasing after my mouth. I was pretty sure if I used my skills in the right way, I could get Livvie into my bed. I could see every glorious inch of her. Taste her pu**y in my mouth before I wrapped her legs around me and f**ked her until there was no come left inside me.</p><p>I heard myself moan, but I didn\u2019t give a f**k. I hadn\u2019t had sex in months, and the sex I\u2019d had since Livvie wasn\u2019t worth mentioning or even thinking about. I\u2019d jerked off before I came to meet her and my balls still felt heavy. I took a chance and removed my hand from the door. I let myself caress her shoulder to gauge her reaction to my touch.</p><p>\u201cCaleb,\u201d she sighed. She gripped the edges of her seat and pushed her chest out slightly. Her tongue pushed harder and deeper into my mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fuck! Yes! I wanted to yell the words. I reached for her breast and my c**k throbbed when I felt how hard her nipple was against my palm. I could tell she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra beneath her dress and the thin fabric let me feel every contour of her. As quickly as I could, I pushed on the harness and released the straps. I pulled the fabric aside and Livvie\u2019s beautiful breast came into view.</p><p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d It wasn\u2019t a sigh this time. She was a little panicked.</p><p>I didn\u2019t let it stop me. I could still hear the lust in her voice. I palmed her breast and put my mouth around her puckered nipple. I sucked on her greedily. I moaned loud and gripped her harder when her cry hit the air and her hands held on to my head, pulling me closer.</p><p>Somewhere in my lust-addled head I knew the situation wasn\u2019t ideal. As sexy as a Gallardo Superleggera is, it\u2019s incredibly cramped and certainly wasn\u2019t conducive to the all-out f**k-fest I had in mind. It took every ounce of self-control I didn\u2019t possess to pull myself away from Livvie\u2019s delicious nipple.</p> <p>It was harder not to go back to it when I got a good look at Livvie upon pulling away. Her body was tilted at an angle, with her head against the door, and her dress was pushed to the side to expose one of her br**sts. Her nipple was hard and wet from my mouth. Livvie\u2019s lipstick deserved an award because it had surprisingly stayed on her lips and wasn\u2019t smeared all over her face.</p><p>\u201cLet me take you home, Livvie. Please. I can\u2019t stand being this close to you and not being inside you for one more f**king second.\u201d I put myself out there. I let her know exactly what my intentions were.</p><p>She was slow to catch her breath. Her dark brown eyes looked on me with lust, but also with what seemed to be a myriad of other emotions.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I know you want this as much as I do.\u201d I tried not to sound annoyed, but it\u2019s next to impossible not to sound like an ass**le when my dick is hard enough to pound nails and I\u2019m expected to have higher brain function.</p><p>Livvie eyed me warily. Sadly, it was an expression I\u2019d come to know very well in our time together. She could probably tell I was annoyed and it was scaring her. Carefully, she set about adjusting her dress and slipping her breast back into it. She couldn\u2019t seem to stop fidgeting, and with every movement it became obvious she was pondering her next actions.</p> <p>Then, with her gorgeous tits no longer in view and her racy dress smoothed down to reflect a more demure appearance, she spoke.</p><p>\u201cI want to ask you a few questions, Caleb, and I need for you to be completely honest with me. Can you do that?\u201d She looked toward me with her sad brown eyes.</p><p>She had me in a precarious position and I was willing to do whatever it would take to make her happy again. I wanted the opportunity to taste Livvie\u2019s happy tears again.</p><p>\u201cAsk me anything you really want to know. But only if you think you can handle the answer.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stress my point enough. She couldn\u2019t ask me for honesty and then hate me for following the rules. Well, she could\u2014but it\u2019s a shitty thing to do to a person.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said resolutely. \u201cYou drive and I\u2019ll ask my questions.\u201d</p><p>I raised a disbelieving brow.</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier to ask me now, when I don\u2019t have to navigate in traffic? And where exactly do you want me to take you?\u201d</p><p>Livvie smiled coyly and it made my chest ache. She could be such a tease sometimes.</p><p>\u201cI want you distracted, Caleb. I don\u2019t want to give you the chance to shape your version of the truth. You\u2019re far too good at half-truths. Just drive around and I\u2019ll tell you when to stop. Stay in the city\u2014no rural roads.\u201d She reached for her harness and strapped herself in.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if I was offended or impressed, but I decided to go with the more agreeable of the two.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust me?\u201d I asked and smiled. She\u2019d always been a fan of my smile.</p><p>\u201cTo a point,\u201d she replied smoothly. \u201cI trust you enough to get in your car, but you can\u2019t blame me for being cautious.\u201d</p><p>I could feel my face and neck getting hot. I wasn\u2019t immune to my guilt. I felt guilty for a lot of things where Livvie was concerned and she was right. She was entitled to much more than caution. I cleared my throat to break through the tension. I adjusted myself as surreptitiously as possible, put on my harness, and started the car.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Livvie gripped the door handle as the car roared to life and the engine caused our seats to vibrate.</p> <p>I smiled at the knowledge her pu**y had received a little tickle. My balls appreciated the RPM too. I pulled away from my parking spot and tried to concentrate on navigating our way out of the tourist-filled traffic. In the pit of my stomach, my anxiety churned and threatened to ruin my dinner.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m all yours. Ask me anything you\u2019re prepared to have answered.\u201d From the corner of my eye I could see a smile tugging at the corners of Livvie\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all mine?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I looked in her direction.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? That\u2019s your first question? This might be easier than I thought. Yes, Livvie, I\u2019m all yours.\u201d I winked at her for good measure. My stomach felt a little better when I saw her smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re mine, only mine.\u201d The void fed on the memory.</p><p>\u201cGood to know. But it won\u2019t be that easy. When you offered to take me home, did you mean my house?\u201d Her tone hinted at her unease.</p><p>I suddenly knew where this conversation was going to go. However, I\u2019d promised to answer her honestly. I always kept my promises. All, except one. I pushed the thought away.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to go to mine, so I thought yours might be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where I live?\u201d she accused.</p><p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a while, but I couldn\u2019t really gauge her thoughts because I had to focus on the narrow, disjointed streets.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said resolutely. \u201cIt makes sense you\u2019d know where I live. I\u2019m sure it took you a while to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did.\u201d I smiled again, but I can\u2019t be sure it was genuine. I don\u2019t like answering questions, especially ones that sound like a trap.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known where I am?\u201d The tone of her voice was less than friendly.</p><p>\u201cLivvie, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb. You promised.\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known for a few weeks.\u201d I slammed on my brakes to avoid hitting a group of drunken idiots crossing the street. Fucking teenagers, they thought they owned the world. I rolled down my window without thinking and yelled at them. \u201cGet the f**k out of the road!\u201d One of them gave me the finger and called me a fag in Spanish. \u201cI\u2019ll show you a fag, you little bitch. I\u2019ll f**k-start your head!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d Livvie cried out and gripped my arm. I snapped my head toward her and I could see she was more than a little frightened. It irritated me more than I understood at the time. I watched as the group of soccer idiots kept walking down the street. They were still laughing and shouting at me. I wanted to shoot each of them in the kneecaps.</p><p>A horn blared behind me. I stepped on the gas and propelled us into a roundabout a bit too quickly.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going the way I hoped, Livvie. You\u2019re obviously scared of me and I\u2019m just getting irritated. Maybe I should take you home.\u201d I felt a pang in my chest as I spoke. I didn\u2019t want to take her home, at least not to drop her off. But I couldn\u2019t take much more cat and mouse. It\u2019s just not who I am.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, then I think you better.\u201d She was definitely angry.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not what I want. I wouldn\u2019t have gone through all the damn trouble to find you if that\u2019s what I wanted. Please be rational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou be rational, Caleb. You show up out of the f**king blue and just expect me to fall on my back and throw my legs open for you? No! Not until I know what the hell you\u2019ve been up to for the last year. Not until I know why you\u2019re back in my life and what you expect from me.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that made sense. I knew it did. I didn\u2019t have to like it. My entire life had changed. I\u2019d given up everything I knew and the last thing I wanted to do was talk about it. Why do women have to do so much talking? If you\u2019re hungry, eat. If you\u2019re thirsty, drink. If you want somebody to f**k the guts out of you, just say so!</p><p>Of course, I knew I couldn\u2019t say any of those things without proverbially shooting myself in the foot. I\u2019d come to grovel. I\u2019d f**king grovel. I took a deep breath and slowed down. The car could practically idle and do 40kph.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to fall on your back and throw your legs open.\u201d I spoke calmly. \u201cBut it would be nice.\u201d I glanced in her direction and gave her my most suggestive smile. She glared at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I expected, Pet. I\u2019ve been thinking about you for a long time. I guess I just want to say I\u2019m sorry. I know I can\u2019t erase our past. I can\u2019t promise you I\u2019m a completely different person. I\u2019m messed up in ways most people can\u2019t possibly understand, but I care about you. I had to find you and tell you you\u2019re the only thing I care about anymore.\u201d I kept my eyes on the road and swallowed hard. My pride is thick and I may have had to swallow more than once to force it down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sighed.</p><p>\u201cI... care about you too, Caleb. The past year hasn\u2019t been easy for me. It\u2019s not just moving, or letting go of my family and friends....\u201d She was silent for a minute. When she spoke, there were tears in her voice. \u201cYou betrayed me.\u201d</p><p>She may as well have slapped me again. Maybe punched me in the stomach for good measure. She knew how much the word \u201cbetrayed\u201d would get to me.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I asked the question as smoothly as I could.</p> <p>\u201cI was ready to go with you. After everything you\u2019d done. And you just... left me. You have no idea what I had to go through. How hard I had to work to become... human.\u201d She whispered the words. She looked out the window and watched the same streets pass her.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure where I went mentally. I kept circling the same large block. I remembered that day. I had replayed it in my mind a million times in the past year. What could I say to her? The truth was awful. I\u2019d killed Rafiq the day before. I\u2019d buried the only family I had ever known, and I was reeling with the discovery he had been the cause of every horrible thing that had happened to me. I loved him. I killed him. I couldn\u2019t look at Livvie without comparing myself to Rafiq. I had kidnapped her, tortured her, raped her, and taken her away from everything she knew. And she said she loved me. That had been the worst part.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to be sure.\u201d My words sounded alien, wooden. I felt Livvie\u2019s hand on my arm. It startled me and brought me back from the place I\u2019d been. I took a few seconds to just look at her. She was so damn beautiful\u2014not only on the outside, but on the inside as well. She was stronger than me. She was braver. She didn\u2019t want vengeance.</p><p>\u201cI know why you made me get out. It took me a long time to accept it, but I understand. I know it was your way of being selfless, your way of sacrificing. But you made me sacrifice too. I almost went bat-shit crazy.\u201d She smiled genuinely and I couldn\u2019t help but follow suit.</p><p>\u201cYou are crazy, Livvie. But I wouldn\u2019t have you any other way.\u201d I turned my hand over and she moved her hand into mine. It\u2019s stupid how happy it made me. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, I am not the poster child for mental health.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d I feigned insult.</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d I said.</p><p>She squeezed my hand.</p><p>\u201cTake me to a hotel, Caleb.\u201d</p> <p>I visibly straightened. There was a fleeting moment of internal struggle while I contemplated giving her answers to questions she didn\u2019t ask, but in the end I just had to be me. I am the master of half-truths.</p><p>\u201cI know just the place.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect when I put the keycard into the door. I knew what the room would look like. I knew Livvie would think it was beautiful. I knew there was an enormous bed waiting to be soiled. What I didn\u2019t know was if I\u2019d get the chance to use it the way I wished.</p><p>\u201cWow, Caleb.\u201d Livvie stepped inside and put her purse on the coffee table. \u201cYou certainly know how to make an impression. First the car, now the room.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged from the foyer.</p><p>\u201cThe car\u2019s rented. Technically, so is the room. I have good taste though; no one can deny me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess they can\u2019t.\u201d She wandered to the curtains and pulled them back. It seemed to be a clear indication she didn\u2019t trust me.</p> <p>I took the insult as best I could. How insulted did I really have a right to be? I knew she believed the hotel to be a secure place to meet. All she\u2019d have to do was scream and someone would probably hear us. Of course, the key word there was probably. I was tempted to remind her that if I were so inclined, she wouldn\u2019t even get to scream. However, I figured it wasn\u2019t in my best interest to point such things out to her.</p><p>I walked into the living area and made myself comfortable on the sofa. I wanted to get the preliminaries out of the way as soon as possible and get back to more pleasurable pursuits. In the meantime, I watched Livvie. Always inquisitive, my Livvie, a curious little kitten. I eyed her from my seat as she ran her long fingers along the furniture, the drapes, and the Tiffany lamp on the desk.</p><p>\u201cLivvie.\u201d She focused on me. Her nerves were obvious. \u201cCome sit with me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s such a good idea.\u201d</p><p>I rested my head on my fist. I stared. On this point there would be no discussion. I\u2019d made my request clear and I expected her to acquiesce. I wasn\u2019t going to argue moot points. I took great pleasure in exerting my dominance. It was fun watching her squirm.</p><p>Taking my bait, Livvie filled the silence.</p><p>\u201cCaleb... come on. You know the second I go over there you\u2019re just going to pounce on me.\u201d She was biting her lip again, her fingers nervously tugging on it. \u201cCaleb? Are you even going to say anything? Oh, okay, so you\u2019re just going to sit over there, looking all \u2018you know you want me\u2019? I\u2019m not scared of you, Caleb.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest and tried her best to look intimidating. \u201cI have pepper spray in my purse!\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it. I burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re such a jerk,\u201d she said. She walked toward me and unceremoniously plopped onto the sofa. \u201cFine! I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>I was still holding my stomach when my laughter finally subsided and I could make eye contact without starting up again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Livvie, I really am. You kill me. Pepper spray? I\u2019ve tracked you all over the world and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to stop me\u2014pepper spray.\u201d</p><p>Livvie\u2019s wide grin was my reward for all the slaps and insults she\u2019d thrown my way during the course of the evening.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe it wouldn\u2019t stop you. It would still be fun to watch you roll around on the ground crying for a while.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt might still be fun.\u201d</p><p>We laughed for little while, diffusing all the tension. I felt completely at ease by the time we were done laughing and I knew Livvie did too. Her shoulders had dropped. Her fingers had stopped fidgeting.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you, Livvie.\u201d</p><p>Livvie took off her heels and set them beside the sofa. As she pressed her toes into the carpet and grabbed at the thick fibers, she smiled at me. She sat up straight, bending her knees so she could sit on her feet. It was a relaxed and casual pose. It was a good sign for things to come.</p><p>\u201cAll over the world, eh? Tell me about that.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her for a second, but I relented. It was best to get it out of the way. I took off my shoes and adopted a more comfortable pose as well. There is nothing more unattractive than having to stop getting naked to remove one\u2019s shoes. I like to think ahead.</p><p>\u201cYes. I looked for you everywhere and anywhere I could think of. If you really wanted me to find you, you could have left me a note in Mexico. It was the first place I looked.\u201d I reached out with my right hand and stroked Livvie\u2019s cheek. I loved that she let me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a good idea. The FBI knew you\u2019d left me the money. I was afraid if I left you a note they\u2019d know you were alive. I couldn\u2019t risk it.\u201d She smiled, though it didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes.</p><p>I felt many things upon hearing her words. I was touched. I was angry. I was sad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. They made you change your name.\u201d I hadn\u2019t counted on Livvie. I\u2019d been too sick about Rafiq to believe she\u2019d ever try to protect me.</p><p>\u201cI like my new one.\u201d She reached for my hand and held it on her knee. \u201cI\u2019d do it again, Caleb\u2014in a heartbeat. I don\u2019t know how you feel about it, but I want you to know I\u2019m happy. I have a great life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that counts for something. If I\u2019d let you come with me... I don\u2019t know. I doubt you\u2019d be the same person. I doubt you\u2019d be as happy as you seem to be.\u201d My own words gave me pause. I\u2019d been right to leave her behind. Had I been right to return?</p><p>She gave me a sidelong look. Her smirk hinted at amusement, but her eyes promised retribution.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not off the hook, Caleb. If you hadn\u2019t left me at the border with a gun, I wouldn\u2019t have had to make a scene to get back into the country. They were barely even looking for me. So don\u2019t give me that \u2018all\u2019s well that ends well\u2019 bullshit.\u201d</p><p>She got a chuckle out of me.</p><p>\u201cPoint taken. So how was your time with the FBI?\u201d I was genuinely interested in what she had to say. I\u2019d had some close calls in the past year. At the time, I assumed it was the FIA in Pakistan trying to find me. I was sure they didn\u2019t appreciate Rafiq had gone missing, nor the fact he had been connected to the Zahra Bay'. I played with my life every time I went into the country. I wondered if the FBI had been looking for me too.</p><p>Livvie looked sad for a fleeting moment before she plastered a smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to that. There\u2019s a lot you should know. First, I want to know how you found me. I want to know what you\u2019ve been up to. I don\u2019t want to have to change my name again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to doing it again in a heartbeat?\u201d I provoked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot,\u201d she said and nudged me with her knee. I let out a defeated sigh.</p><p>\u201cAfter Mexico, I decided to try your old neighborhood.\u201d Livvie looked aghast. I was quick to reassure her no one had been hurt. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk to anyone. I couldn\u2019t take the chance. I waited outside your former apartment building, but I realized pretty quickly your family didn\u2019t live there anymore.\u201d I inched a bit closer to Livvie on the sofa. I didn\u2019t move so much she\u2019d notice\u2014at least not right away. \u201cI must have scouted the bus stop for weeks, just hoping. Which, in retrospect, was pretty dumb. Why would you go back there?</p><p>\u201cAfter your old neighborhood proved fruitless, I remember you talked about your friend Nicole. And before you get all huffy\u2014I didn\u2019t talk to her either. I just stole her laptop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d Livvie admonished.</p> <p>I shrugged unapologetically.</p><p>\u201cAre you glad I found you or what? Your whereabouts weren\u2019t just going to fall out of thin air.\u201d I practically dared her to tell me there had been another way. \u201cI found an email that could only have come from you.\u201d I moved a tiny bit closer. I don\u2019t think she realized. \u201cYou sounded really sad. You mentioned going to the Eiffel Tower by yourself. Someone stole your wallet. It was months after the incident, but I still worried for you. You said you weren\u2019t over me.\u201d</p><p>Livvie looked away from me. She had tears in her eyes and she was working hard to make it seem as though she didn\u2019t. While I didn\u2019t necessarily relish her pain at the memory, it boded well for me. It made me believe there was a chance for us.</p><p>She cleared her throat and wiped at her eyes with the back of her finger.</p><p>\u201cUgh! I thought I was past this part. I promise I\u2019m not quite as emotional as I used to be.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI guess you just bring it out of me. I like your hair. How long is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s camouflage. I keep it back because it annoys me when it touches my shoulders.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to talk about my hair. I reached up and collected a tear racing down her cheek. I drank it. I knew it didn\u2019t make sense to her. If anything, she seemed more embarrassed. However, it was my way of taking her pain away. It was a promise. I didn\u2019t go around drinking random tears. I\u2019m not that creepy.</p><p>Livvie took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. Some of the tension from earlier was slinking its way back into our intimate moment.</p><p>\u201cSome things never change I guess,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I moved closer, until our knees brushed. My arm rested on the back of the sofa and I was able to touch her hair with my fingers. Warmth spread through me as I watched her eyelids slide shut.</p><p>\u201cEverything is in the process of becoming something else. It\u2019s the law of change.\u201d I briefly kissed Livvie\u2019s eyelids before she could open them. \u201cI\u2019m in the process of becoming something else, Livvie. I hope it\u2019s something good, something far removed from the monster you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Livvie said. Her tears had gotten the better of her and she raced to put distance between us. She wiped hurriedly at her cheeks. \u201cHoly shit, Caleb. How can I keep from being a mess when you say things like that? I don\u2019t even know how to feel.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled and moved back. I had her where I wanted her, but more than that\u2014I had her where I needed her. In a place where she could admit she could forgive me for the past. In a place where we were possible.</p><p>Over the next several hours, I relayed the many airline tickets I had purchased to search for her. The places I had almost caught up and missed her. I told her about Germany and the caf\u00e9. She hadn\u2019t been happy to hear about that one but accepted I wasn\u2019t quite ready to approach her at the time.</p><p>She attempted to ask questions about our last days in Mexico. I was honest and told her it was too much for me to discuss so soon. I\u2019d tell her at some point. She didn\u2019t like it, but she used it as leverage to dodge questions about the FBI and what she\u2019d learned about me.</p><p>For the most part we tried not to delve too deeply into subjects that were excruciating to either one of us. It was more about discovering how we felt toward one another after so much time had gone by. As our feelings became more obvious, we were able to discuss our present instead of our past. I liked that much better. I liked hearing about Livvie going to school. I listened to her talk about the endless possibilities of her future and it made me feel somewhat better about... well, everything. I would be lying if I told you I was over what happened with Rafiq\u2014far from it. Still, it gave me a modicum of solace to know that if he had lived, Livvie\u2019s future would not be so bright.</p><p>Too quickly, the hours had ticked by. The night had gone silent and in a few hours, pre-dawn would be approaching. My thoughts began to turn toward more carnal diversions and talking had begun to lose its appeal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d she whispered. She had her feet on the sofa, her knees pulled up to her chin. Her dark eyes begged me to come closer. Her legs threatened to push me away.</p><p>I felt myself getting hard, my dick throbbing in rhythm with my heartbeat. I was transported to Felipe\u2019s plantation in Madera. I remembered the first night I whipped her. She\u2019d known she was in trouble and she hid under the sink. She was curled up in much the same way, eyes staring up at me, legs trembling ever so slightly. I remembered the thrill of making her surrender.</p><p>The memory filled me with mixed emotions. I had been her abuser. I had taken something from her she had been unwilling to give. I felt guilty. Yet, I also had a fondness for the memory. It had been the beginning of my exploration with Livvie. Even cowered beneath the sink, her eyes had met mine. She fought me without words. She fought my possession. It was in those moments I first saw the ghost of the boy I had been. I knew the words behind her stare: You can have my body, but you can\u2019t have me.</p> <p>I had admired her even as I was resolved to bend her to my will. She had closed her eyes at our first touch, gathering her courage.</p><p>\u201cLook at me. I want you to look at me.\u201d</p><p>In the quiet hotel room, with Livvie only a short span away, I stared into her unflinching eyes and once again read the message. I wouldn\u2019t be able to take what I wanted this time. This time, I had to earn her surrender.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this night to end,\u201d I said. I wanted to make myself as clear as possible. Whatever she decided to do after that was fine.</p><p>\u201cSo... what then?\u201d She raised her hand to her mouth and tugged gently at her lip. Her eyes had a mischievous glint.</p><p>\u201cWell, the way I see it, you have three options: You can make me very sad by asking me to drive you home. You can take pity on me and spend the night. Or you can admit you want me to f**k you until you beg for mercy.\u201d I leaned back and put my arms around the sofa. I let her see how hard I was for her, how much I wanted to be inside her.</p><p>She inhaled sharply. Her cheeks reddened. A quick glance downward revealed her toes, curled tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou... still have a way with words.\u201d Her voice was breathy, but confident.</p><p>\u201cJust laying it out for you.\u201d I winked at her. I felt pretty confident about which of the three options she would choose. However, she has a way of throwing in her own surprises.</p><p>\u201cI still have the pepper spray,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cKinky.\u201d We laughed.</p><p>I knew she wanted me. It was written all over her face. It was in the way she licked her lips in preparation for being kissed, the way her eyes seemed to go dark. I had a moment of hesitation. I wasn\u2019t sure what role she wanted me to play. On the one hand, it would have given me pleasure to tell her what to do. I liked being in control. I liked knowing she\u2019d obey me of her own free will. On the other, I wasn\u2019t sure how my dominance would be accepted. The last thing I wanted to do was scare her away. I didn\u2019t want to remind her there had been a time she hadn\u2019t had a choice.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s it going to be, Pet?\u201d</p><p>She raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cPet?\u201d She didn\u2019t seem put off by the moniker, despite the gentle warning in her tone.</p><p>\u201cForce of habit,\u201d I whispered unapologetically. Slow and easy it is.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of bad habits, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not all my habits are bad, are they?\u201d I let my hand rest on my dick. Her eyes followed my movements. She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s a few I\u2019m quite fond of.\u201d She met my eyes and held me captive.</p><p>\u201cDo tell,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cGive me time, Caleb. I will. But... tonight? I just need you to know I\u2019m not the scared girl you remember.\u201d She brought her knees down and opened her legs. Her dress hid what was beneath, but her message was clear as she placed her hand on her pu**y.</p><p>My heart beat erratically, spurred by her seduction. Beneath my own hand, my c**k strained against my zipper.</p><p>\u201cI remember you were brave,\u201d I managed to say beyond the lust clogging my throat.</p><p>\u201cI remember you liked to watch me touch myself.\u201d She inched her dress up her thighs. Her short, blunt fingernails left faint red trails along her smooth tan skin. \u201cI remember I liked watching you too.\u201d She shifted down and rested her head on the arm of the sofa.</p><p>I was beside myself. My mouth was dry\u2014too many open-mouthed breaths. My chest felt bruised by the incessant pounding of my heart. Lower down, my flesh was rigid and surrendering its first clear droplets of seed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to do a hell of a lot more than watch.\u201d I leaned forward and was met with instant resistance. Livvie\u2019s foot pushed against my chest and urged me back against the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWe do it my way. Or not at all,\u201d she threatened playfully.</p><p>I knew a battle I couldn\u2019t win when I encountered it. I tilted my head toward Livvie in deference.</p><p>\u201cI can accept that.\u201d I resumed my previous posture. \u201cI await your every whim.\u201d I baited her with my smile.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d She relaxed. Her fingers trailed lightly over her pu**y. \u201cYou show me yours... and I\u2019ll show you mine.\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly. If it were possible to care for her any more, I wasn\u2019t sure I could stand it.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I sighed and unzipped my jeans. \u201cAs I recall, shyness was your obstacle, not mine.\u201d I quickly undid my pants and opened them. My lust intensified as my c**k hit the air. I resisted the urge to touch it. I took great satisfaction in hearing Livvie gasp. To her credit, she composed herself quickly.</p><p>\u201cVery nice, Caleb. I know we\u2019re both in the process of becoming something else, but it\u2019s nice to know there are a few things that will never change.\u201d She lifted her knee closest to the couch. Her dress rode up toward her waist. She spread her legs and revealed her naked pu**y. She hadn\u2019t been wearing any underwear!</p><p>I reached for my dick and squeezed it. I wasn\u2019t in any danger of embarrassing myself; the impulse was simply too much to ignore. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. I stroked myself once, twice, and stilled my hand.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re f**king beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She blushed.</p><p>\u201cThank you. So are you.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about being called beautiful, but I took the compliment. I had much more interesting things on my mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat now? I have to be honest; I\u2019m not sure I can sit here and watch you play with yourself. I don\u2019t have the self-control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you force me?\u201d she whispered. Her fingers parted her pu**y, revealing how pink and wet she was.</p> <p>\u201cFuck! No. But I\u2019d be really childish about it.\u201d I stuck out my bottom lip and she laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d she said through a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re making this really difficult. Don\u2019t ruin my fantasy.\u201d</p><p>I composed my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Go on. Far be it from me to deny you another fantasy. I was so fond of the last one.\u201d I watched her mouth and remembered the way her lips slid over my cock. \u201cMaybe we could relive that one too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she teased. \u201cIf I come over there, will you put your arms on the couch and keep them there?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d I raised my arms to the back of the sofa and gripped it. I\u2019m hard again just remembering how sexily she crawled across the sofa toward me. Livvie is a predator in her own right.</p><p>My eyes drifted shut at the first touch of her hand against my chest. I knew she could feel how hard my heart was beating. I might have been more nervous than she was. Her dress was soft as it caressed my aching cock.</p> <p>\u201cYour dress is going to get ruined. Take it off,\u201d I whispered as enticingly as I was able.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she whispered against my ear. The smell of her skin infiltrated my senses. I held tighter to the sofa. \u201cI want it just like this.\u201d Her thighs straddled mine and her wet pu**y made contact with my dick. I thrust upward. I couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Kitten! Just let me f**k you already.\u201d I was ready to abandon all chivalry and self-control. I was ready to rip her damn clothes off and bury myself so deep she\u2019d forget we were ever separate people. The only thing that stopped me was the sudden pain of Livvie pulling on the tie holding my hair back. Once free, she buried her hands in my hair. She pulled my head back and the pain refocused my attention. Her eyes were nearly black, her pupils wide with desire. She was enjoying herself. I didn\u2019t want to stop her.</p><p>She placed soft kisses against my mouth as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Caleb. Let me. You\u2019re still in control.\u201d Her hips moved against me. Her pu**y was hot against my cock. \u201cYou\u2019re bigger, stronger. I know that. It turns me on that you\u2019d let me do this to you. You\u2019d never let me before.\u201d</p><p>I held tight to that damn sofa because I suddenly knew why it was so important for her to have the upper hand between us. This encounter was not about earning her surrender\u2014it was about surrendering myself. She was testing me and I refused to fail.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Livvie.\u201d I panted against her mouth. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it your way.\u201d Her tongue invaded my mouth and we kissed.</p><p>\u201cYou can call me Kitten if you want to. I miss it,\u201d she crooned. She didn\u2019t give me a chance to respond before her tongue was in my mouth again. There was no protest when I rocked against her.</p><p>Finally, she seemed to have enough of her own teasing. She leaned back quickly and reached behind her neck to undo the buttons. Accomplished quickly, her ample br**sts, complete with pebbled ni**les came into view. I licked my lips as I stared at them.</p><p>\u201cGive me,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>With her hands on my shoulders, she raised herself up onto her knees. My dick felt cold without her heat. Only the promise of her br**sts in my face was enough to quell my disappointment. Livvie is soft, ridiculously soft, and the flesh of her br**sts against my face was a feeling just this side of heaven. I placed kisses on one and then the other, ignoring her non-verbal cues for my mouth on her ni**les. I could be a damn tease too!</p><p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d she said with some irritation. I smiled.</p><p>\u201cYes, Kitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She held her breast and ran her nipple across my mouth. \u201cSuck on me.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth and pulled her into it. She tasted even better than she smelled. I sucked harder than I probably should have, too driven by my lust to stop. Livvie\u2019s arms wrapped around my head, forcing me closer, not letting me move away\u2014though I had no intention of it. I softened my suckling. I let my tongue flick at her nipple, slowly and repeatedly. I made her insist on more.</p><p>Livvie was slow and maddeningly calculated in her seduction of me. Though she writhed against my chest, all but begging me to take control, she let me know I wasn\u2019t to move my arms away from their resting place. She fed me one breast and then the other. She liked watching me, she reminded. For as much as we both wanted things to be different, our history could never be erased. I knew she was punishing me for the things I\u2019d done. As far as punishments went, I knew I was getting off too easy.</p><p>Pulling away slowly, she slid her body down my chest and put her head on my shoulder. She moaned once she made contact with my c**k again. I just managed to keep my body from responding. I was ready. I was more than ready. I wanted to touch her. It was beginning to feel unreasonable that I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d she whispered against my neck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. All you have to do is tell me I can touch you.\u201d I was close to doing it anyway.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d She laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cSomeone once told me you shouldn\u2019t let vendettas run your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably never had you like this.\u201d She lifted her head and watched me. \u201cIf she knew revenge could be as sweet as this, she\u2019d never stop seeking it out.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope not.\u201d</p><p>I lost all logical thought as I felt Livvie\u2019s hand travel down my chest toward her spread thighs and my cock. I let my head fall back when I felt her tentative fingers wrap around my flesh and guide me toward her pu**y. She was so hot, so wet, and the pressure required to get the tip inside her hinted at how tight she would be.</p><p>\u201cLivvie,\u201d I said insistently. \u201cPlease let me touch you.\u201d</p><p>Her soft lips kissed my throat.</p><p>\u201cTell me again how much you missed me.\u201d Her hips rocked back and forth, trying to accommodate more of me. She whimpered but wouldn\u2019t admit her difficulty.</p><p>I lifted my head and looked at her. Her face was a mixture of pleasure and pain, yet her eyes remained determined. I swallowed thickly.</p><p>\u201cI missed you every day, Kitten. Every. Fucking. Day.\u201d I raised my hips and felt myself slide into her a little deeper.</p><p>\u201cOh! God!\u201d She pitched forward and held on to me. \u201cCaleb,\u201d she sighed. She was panting already. \u201cTake it easy. I haven\u2019t done this in a while.\u201d</p><p>Her words brought me up short. I found myself suddenly jealous and angry. I was reluctant to show it. I didn\u2019t have a right to my anger, except it didn\u2019t matter\u2014it was there. I stopped moving.</p><p>Livvie gained her breath and slowly rocked against me again. I tried to ignore the pleasure it brought me to gain further entrance into her body. She smiled at me and I scowled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad, Caleb.\u201d She slid up a little on my dick and let her bodyweight push me deeper on the way down. I couldn\u2019t stop the moan that escaped me. \u201cI meant you. Not since you.\u201d</p><p>My chest seemed to expand and contract in unison. It was barbaric, selfish, and nevertheless, I didn\u2019t give a shit. Livvie belonged to me. Yes, I\u2019d been with other women since her. In my heart, they had counted for nothing. I broke my promise, but still surrendered. I surrendered to Livvie\u2019s power over me. I surrendered to the havoc she unleashed on my control. I raised one of my hands and pulled Livvie\u2019s face toward mine. I needed to be inside of her. I needed my tongue in her mouth and my c**k in her body like I needed my next breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We moaned into one another\u2019s mouths as our bodies instinctively moved against each other. I moved my other arm off the sofa and wrapped it around Livvie\u2019s waist. I had her pinned against me. A dark thrill rushed through me as I yielded to my primal nature to conquer.</p><p>I stopped kissing her and held her still as I bent my knees and thrust into her. I heard her cry out, but she didn\u2019t ask me to stop. Her arms wrapped tightly around my head. I thrust again, and again, until at last, I felt the whole of me inside her tight heat.</p><p>I felt incapable of speech. I had wanted her for so long. I had dreamt of her in my sleeping hours and ached for her in my waking ones. There was nothing I could say to compare with the intense elation and satisfaction of finally having that which I had desired for so very long. Nothing except\u2014</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t intend to say the words. I knew she wasn\u2019t ready to hear them. However, I\u2019d been waiting to tell her since the moment I watched her leave and I couldn\u2019t hold it in a minute longer.</p><p>Livvie burst into tears and held me tighter to her chest to keep from meeting my eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she sobbed. She moved her body, sliding herself up and down my c**k in a rhythm that demanded I keep pace. I was at a loss for what to do. It seemed I\u2019d done and said enough already, so I did the only thing I could: I did as I was told.</p><p>Pressed so close to Livvie\u2019s chest, it was easy to find my way to her br**sts again. I put my mouth around one of her ni**les and resumed my previous attentions. I palmed her ass in both hands. I was rewarded with moans and sighs instead of sobs. All the while, I felt her pu**y trying to accommodate me further. Her wetness came more freely after a moment. Her muscles relaxed. I could move faster, push harder, and go deep on every forward thrust. The sound of my balls making contact with her wet flesh, her moans above me, the heat and tightness surrounding me\u2014it all spurred me toward my crisis.</p><p>\u201cMore, Caleb. Oh, god, please!\u201d Her words were a high-pitched plea. Her movements were frantic and disjointed. She was chasing an orgasm that wouldn\u2019t come and then came too hard and fast.</p> <p>I f**ked her through her climax. Her pu**y contracted around me, her muscles were rigid, and her sounds begged me to slow down. I couldn\u2019t. I kept pounding into her until her orgasm subsided and she collapsed limply against me.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Caleb,\u201d she panted against my ear. Her br**sts were sweaty and they slid against my chest. Beneath my sweater, I was caked in sweat too. I wasn\u2019t going to stop to take it off. \u201cSlow down.\u201d I knew she had to be tender, especially after she\u2019d come so hard. I forced myself to slow. \u201cYes,\u201d she sighed contentedly, \u201cI like that. Fuck me just like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying f**k,\u201d I panted. \u201cOr I won\u2019t be able to slow down.\u201d</p><p>She giggled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You bring it out of me.\u201d She found her way to my lips and kissed me. After a while, her movements fell into rhythm with mine. She pushed down as I thrust up. She pulled away when I did, only to meet me with equal force.</p><p>\u201cGod, you feel good,\u201d I murmured against her mouth. I delighted in her mewling whimper and increase in pace. I hadn\u2019t forgotten her silent rejection. Truth be told, it stung like a motherfucker, but I knew it wasn\u2019t the time to bring it up. I\u2019d made that mistake already.</p> <p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d she said though harsh breaths.</p><p>\u201cBeg me,\u201d I demanded. Two could very well play this game.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Caleb.\u201d She held my face in her hands and looked into my eyes. If I had found my primal nature, Livvie had also found hers. Her need was unmistakable. Her lust intoxicating. \u201cPlease f**k me with your huge f**king cock. I want to watch you come.\u201d She slid her eyes shut and moved her body harder and faster.</p><p>She certainly knew how to push my buttons. I only hoped she wouldn\u2019t regret it. I held her with one arm as I raised us off the sofa and pushed her onto her back. I finally reached for my sweater and pulled it off. I pushed my jeans down to my knees while I was as it. There was a moment of resistance on her part that quickly evaporated as I pushed myself in to the hilt.</p><p>\u201cAgain, Kitten. Beg me.\u201d Braced on one arm and holding her outer thigh, I watched myself f**k her. Remembered words made me smile. She was just right shade of pink. I glanced up and watched her br**sts moving to the rhythm of my thrusts.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t hold back any longer, but I wasn\u2019t sure I should come inside her.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want me to come?\u201d</p> <p>Livvie\u2019s eyes pierced me with their intensity.</p><p>\u201cWherever you want.\u201d</p><p>It hit me before I had a chance to decide. My balls drew up tight and I started coming. I tried to watch Livvie, but my eyes couldn\u2019t stay open. I was lost to the feeling of being emptied, of being received into Livvie\u2019s body.</p><p>Somewhere outside myself I knew Livvie was speaking. I couldn\u2019t hear her clearly until my orgasm slowly subsided. I opened my eyes and looked down. Her hand was between us, touching the place we were joined.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d I heard her say. Nothing had ever been truer.</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d I said.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>I dreamt that night.</p><p>Rafiq looked up at me from a table. He was shaking from fear. His face was bruised and bloody. He spoke calmly.</p><p>\u201cMe for the girl?\u201d</p><p>A ripple of love was fast on the heels of my shame. The feeling was quickly overrun by an old anger, a rage that had kept me alive when death had been a far better option.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not just for the girl. You... made me love you. You betrayed me.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq laughed, loud and rich, before his laughter devolved into gurgling coughs.</p><p>\u201cBetrayal again. It\u2019s always betrayal with you, Khoya.\u201d His words sounded in my mind as though he were flesh and blood again. \u201cYou lie, boy. I didn\u2019t make you love me. One cannot force love. What you gave, I earned.\u201d</p><p>I held a knife in my hand; I knew I did. However, as is the nature of dreams, it disappeared once I tried to plunge it into his thigh. I had so much anger, so much rage, and nowhere to put it. Rafiq found it more than amusing and it only fueled my hatred.</p><p>\u201cI gave you all you earned when I put a bullet in your heart!\u201d</p><p>Rafiq coughed up blood as he laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou are the man I raised.\u201d Slowly, his laughter subsided and he looked on me fondly. \u201cI know you washed my body. I know you buried me in accordance with the law. I know you wept for me.\u201d</p><p>His words wounded me despite knowing there was no way for him to know I did those things. Worse, it hurt knowing they were true.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you die?\u201d I asked with venom. Rafiq smiled wickedly.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me, Khoya. Not again. I\u2019m all you know. I am your mother. I am your father. I am your brother. I am your friend. I\u2019ll always be here. You\u2019ll never be rid of me.\u201d</p><p>As much as I loathed it, I was free to weep in my dreams and I did.</p><p>\u201cHow could you have done all those things to me? You stole my childhood. You stole my destiny.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq, suddenly unfettered, rolled onto his side and sat up. The bruises on his face had healed and clothing had magically appeared on his body.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s bothering you, Caleb. I betrayed you, yes, but that\u2019s not why you killed me, is it?\u201d I couldn\u2019t look at him while I processed my shame. \u201cYou would have killed me anyway. You would have killed me because it\u2019s the only way I would have let the girl go. You would have betrayed me, Khoya. We are not so different, and that\u2019s what eats at you.\u201d He raised a hand and ruffled my hair as he used to when I was young. My chest ached.</p><p>I pushed him with all my strength, knocking him backward over the table and onto the floor. I leapt into the air and landed on top of him. I punched him. Repeatedly. My fists felt ineffectual; I couldn\u2019t get the force I required to beat him to death. Switching tactics, I held his neck in my hands and tried to squeeze the life out of him.</p><p>Rafiq\u2019s maniacal gaze fell on me.</p><p>\u201cI am a god here! You\u2019ve made it so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust f**king die! Die! Die! I hate you! I wish you were alive so I could kill you all over again!\u201d I dug my fingers into his eyes, growing hard as blood oozed onto my fingers. Rafiq tried to fight me this time. His hands pushed against me, his legs flailed, and his body twisted as he tried to buck me off. \u201cI can kill you, Rafiq. You\u2019re not a god. I feel nothing for you.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq\u2019s body went still under me.</p><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d I heard a voice behind me. I turned and saw Livvie. She was wearing a white robe that reached the floor. Her hair was loose and unruly. She wore a slave collar at her throat. A wave of overwhelming guilt slammed into me.</p><p>\u201cLivvie? Don\u2019t look!\u201d I turned my head toward Rafiq. His body had disappeared. Only a large bloody stain remained. My hands were covered in blood and gore. I wiped my hands on my thighs, but the blood wouldn\u2019t come clean. \u201cDon\u2019t look,\u201d I said and I was sobbing again. \u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>Livvie\u2019s footsteps approached and I could actually feel the weight of her arms wrapping around my shoulders. Her warmth descended on my back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Master. I know why you do it. You can\u2019t help who you are.\u201d I hunched over and her weight followed me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>There are moments that define our lives. At the time, most of mine were comprised of people I had murdered or enslaved. I\u2019d done something about the slaves. I couldn\u2019t take back the murders. I didn\u2019t want to. However, my subconscious was not appeased by my belief in justifiable murder. I enjoyed it a little too much, my subconscious admonished. I was a little too \u201cwell-adjusted\u201d for someone inured to such treachery.</p><p>I woke to find Livvie\u2019s body wrapped around me. Her chest was pressed to my back and her arm lay covetously against my chest. Her warm breath skated against my neck. I smiled to myself. So far, each moment with her seemed to be better than the last.</p><p>Panic lingered in my chest, but I had grown accustomed to the nightmares. I am nothing if not adaptable. What I found more frightening than the dream was the voice in my head telling me I\u2019d never let Livvie go. Mine. Mine forever.</p> <p>If you\u2019re sighing with contentment, you\u2019re either one sick f**k or you don\u2019t grasp the seriousness of the situation. While I no longer kill, I am a killer. A killer in love is a very dangerous thing.</p><p>I laughed softly because Livvie was spooning me.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she sighed. Her fingers caressed my chest. She pressed closer, her lips finding my neck and leaving a sleepy kiss. I reached for her arm and stroked it with my fingers.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d I whispered. There was no way I was going to be able to go back to sleep. My dick was hard and Livvie was much too soft.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she grumbled. I chuckled.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not awake, I can\u2019t have your pu**y for breakfast.\u201d She twitched behind me. Her foot stroked my leg.</p><p>\u201cNever stopped you before.\u201d She undulated against me.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I held her arm and rolled over. Her br**sts felt hot against my naked chest. It went nicely with the silky feel of her thighs as I slid my c**k against them. \u201cDo you mind if I help myself then?\u201d She bit her lip and tried not to smile. She was more than awake but determined to feign sleep. Her lipstick had faded, but red stain remained. Aside from the disorderly mess of her long hair, she looked every bit the goddess of the night before.</p><p>\u201cMmnmyeah,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fooling no one,\u201d I whispered against her neck. She didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>I pushed my own hair from my face. Livvie had been playing with it before we fell asleep and I hadn\u2019t bothered to tie it back up. It was annoying, but I traveled with a Swiss passport and it helped me look the part. I often traveled with a snowboard, though I had no idea how to use it.</p> <p>I buried my face in her neck and inhaled. Her head fell to the other side, exposing her throat to me in clear invitation. Beneath me, her legs drifted open. The head of my c**k missed the silk of her thighs but compromised by rubbing against the sheets. I\u2019d get back to her heat soon\u2014no rush. I took my time kissing the long line of Livvie\u2019s throat. She moaned and undulated against me. Her feet found the backs of my knees and rubbed.</p><p>\u201cThat feels good,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cShh, you\u2019re supposed to be asleep. I\u2019m having my way with you.\u201d I used my thumb to trace her nipple until it was a hard little pebble.</p><p>\u201cWell, could you take advantage of me a little faster?\u201d Her arms wrapped around me and pulled me closer. Her intention to get me to suck on her ni**les was obvious, but I ignored it. I\u2019d already made reservations at a different restaurant.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me gag you,\u201d I threatened. There was a non-verbal response from her, a slight tensing perhaps, but I was too otherwise engaged to think on it. I kissed and sucked my way down her chest and briefly stopped to tease her ni**les with the tip of my tongue. I kept my pressure light. I didn\u2019t suck or lave. I wanted the air to do my teasing as I continued my way south.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s hands found their way into my hair and she grabbed handfuls of it. It hurt. I decided I might have to cut it if she was going to use it as makeshift handlebars. Then again, I couldn\u2019t blame her. I loved grabbing hold of her hair too. I decided payback would be more fun (and no one even had to die, which was a bonus).</p><p>Finally, I decided if she wanted me to pick up the pace, I would. I had waited too damn long already. I reached for her hands and disentangled her fingers from my hair.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put these somewhere a little less dangerous,\u201d I whispered against her taut belly. Holding one hand on either side of her hips, I pinned them there and shifted myself toward her pu**y. I put my mouth on her without hesitation.</p> <p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d she cried out. She pressed her feet into the mattress and pushed away from my mouth. I tugged her back down by her wrists and continued my assault on her clit.</p><p>I moaned against her. I loved the way she writhed on my face and I could already feel her getting slick. I traced her inner lips with my tongue. It wasn\u2019t long before she was using my grip on her wrists and her feet in the mattress to leverage herself closer. She wanted me to put my tongue inside her... and I would, when I was good and f**king ready. In the meantime, I enjoyed the smell and taste of her. Some men don\u2019t eat pu**y. I think those men are pussies.</p><p>I sucked Livvie\u2019s clit into my mouth and licked her hard. I was rewarded with pain as she dug her fingernails into my wrists. She\u2019d been pretty feisty since our reunion. I\u2019d been slapped, teased, threatened with pepper spray, had my hair pulled, and then I was pretty sure she\u2019d drawn blood. I didn\u2019t know what to make of it, but I decided I\u2019d try fighting fire with fire. I squeezed her wrists until her fingers unfurled and she let out a whine.</p><p>I let her wrists go and sat back on my heels. Livvie\u2019s legs were wide open, her chest heaved with arousal, and her wet pu**y begged to be f**ked. It also didn\u2019t escape my notice that she hadn\u2019t moved her hands. I think that might have turned me on more than anything else.</p><p>\u201cFlip over. Lift that sexy ass in the air.\u201d I swallowed past my arousal.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb.\u201d She rolled onto her stomach and adopted a posture I recognized immediately. I\u2019d taught it to her.</p><p>I felt like someone had stroked my c**k and punched me in the chest in chorus. Was it wrong to enjoy the view? Did she think I hadn\u2019t changed? Did she know I regretted ever forcing her to obey such commands? Why was I so damn turned on? Was I still the same man who got off on breaking her?</p><p>Not the time for ethical quandaries, ass**le.</p><p>Shaking free of my thoughts, I placed one hand at the small of Livvie\u2019s back and held my dick with the other. I lined up my c**k with her slick opening and thrust halfway inside her. I pulled back and thrust again. I didn\u2019t stop until my hips met her ass. Livvie cried out and fisted the sheets in her hands.</p><p>\u201cGod!\u201d</p><p>I ran my hand up her spine, pressing her down. I jabbed her with my hips against her ass. They were short thrusts that had us both in a frenzy of lust. I leaned over and whispered in her ear.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d She whimpered but didn\u2019t reply. It incensed me. I was reminded of a cheetah that had just spotted a bolting rabbit. I wrapped one arm under Livvie and grabbed a handful of tit. So close to her face, I reveled in every little gasp, moan, sigh, and whimper as I slammed myself against her harder. \u201cI asked you a question. Do you like it?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and her eyes squeezed shut. She had to be enjoying herself because I could practically hear and feel how wet she was. She refused to answer me. It was starting to mess with my head. The night before, I\u2019d told her I loved her and she hadn\u2019t said a word. The pattern was disconcerting and I decided if she was trying to piss me off, it was working.</p><p>I lifted my weight off of her. I gripped her hips and slowed my rhythm. I looked down to watch myself sliding in and out of her. Indeed, she was sopping wet. Her shy little ass**le beckoned. I smirked as I wondered if my next action would get her talking. I traced the puckered hole with my thumb. Her hips jerked, but then settled. I stepped it up a notch and let my thumb press its way inside her ass.</p><p>\u201cWhat about that, Pet? Will that get you talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s all I get?\u201d I became less angry. She liked it. She wanted me. She wanted the things I was doing to her. But for reasons yet unbeknownst to me, she couldn\u2019t come right out and say it. Or maybe she\u2019s turned on pretending she doesn\u2019t. I had to shake my head to make the thought go away. It was too much to think about right then. I pulled my thumb out and held on to Livvie\u2019s hips. I went at her hard until I felt her shake and shudder around my dick. I came inside her again and collapsed on the bed next to her.</p><p>\u201cGod, I am starving! I want breakfast so bad,\u201d Livvie murmured into the sheets. Her forehead was plastered with sweaty hair. I laughed.</p><p>\u201cShe speaks!\u201d I pushed the hair off her forehead and she closed her eyes to enjoy my touch. What a strange pair we made.</p><p>\u201cFor a minute there I didn\u2019t know if I wanted to come or bolt out for pancakes.\u201d She smiled at me. \u201cYou certainly take it out of a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, I put some back in, too.\u201d I winked. \u201cWe have to check out of here in about fifteen minutes. We slept late.\u201d I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be a problem, but I still liked to give Livvie a hard time.</p><p>\u201cCrap. That\u2019s hardly any time to take a shower and I only have the clothes from last night.\u201d She flipped over and huffed toward the ceiling. I rolled onto my side and propped up on my elbow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe could go to my flat. It\u2019s close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow close?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cNext door.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes got huge.</p> <p>\u201cYou dick!\u201d she laughed. \u201cI thought you had a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople say \u2018come to my house\u2019. It doesn\u2019t mean they actually live in a house. I live in the hotel... but not in this room. You can\u2019t blame me for being cunning. And... we can order room service.\u201d I smiled broadly and waited for her reply.</p><p>Thank goodness for whatever hormones make women so agreeable after you\u2019ve laid them right, because that\u2019s all it took to get her to agree. Also... pancakes.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>After our pancakes (and an obscene amount of syrup on some very interesting body parts), Livvie informed me she had to go to her apartment and get ready for work. I wasn\u2019t too happy about it, but I decided to be cordial and allow her some sense of normalcy. We\u2019d had a lot of sex and done more talking than I cared for, but there were still plenty of things unresolved between us. I had my work cut out for me with Livvie. She wouldn\u2019t even let me take her home.</p> <p>\u201cI can take a cab home. I\u2019ll be in a rush when I get there and I\u2019d feel bad ignoring you.\u201d She smiled at me while putting on her shoes. \u201cCan I call you when I get off work? It\u2019ll be a little before midnight since it\u2019s a Monday.\u201d</p><p>I was still in bed, naked. I hoped my silent protest about putting on clothes after our shower would have inspired her to keep me company, but it didn\u2019t work. She still hadn\u2019t said anything about my confession. It was making me more nervous than I cared to admit.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re leaving me. You know I\u2019ll get up to no good without you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at me again and walked toward the bed. She bent down and kissed me on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cI trust you.\u201d She moved away before I could drag her back into bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wearing any underwear,\u201d I teased. The last thing I wanted was for her to run into trouble with some cab driver.</p> <p>\u201cI think the odds of being kidnapped twice in a lifetime are pretty slim. Don\u2019t you?\u201d Her tone was meant to convey sarcasm, but there was an edge to her words that smacked of resentment.</p><p>I forced myself to smile when all I wanted to do was tell her I was through taking her shit. I knew I deserved it. I deserved much more than she was giving. It\u2019s just not in my nature to let people kick me while I\u2019m already down.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll be here if you call.\u201d I rolled out of bed, kissed her on the top of her head, and walked into the bathroom to take a leak. I heard the door shut.</p><p>I tried to keep my mind away from Livvie by keeping busy. I read a book. I returned the Lamborghini. I ate. I searched through local and international news. Regardless of my intentions, it wasn\u2019t long before my thoughts veered toward Livvie again.</p><p>I thought about the night before and her hasty exit in the morning. One set of thoughts made me smile; the other had me on high alert.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s apartment was near her school. I researched the campus and neighborhood. Crime was relatively low. The internet wasn\u2019t flush with stories of sexual assault at her college. However, I doubted the university would willingly offer such information. I made a mental note to investigate for myself at a later time. Livvie had a tendency to trust too easily.</p><p>I\u2019d already done my due diligence and researched her neighbors. The man across the hall from Livvie had been arrested for domestic violence the year before but hadn\u2019t been in trouble since. He\u2019d been living with a female student at the time. I\u2019d be keeping a close eye on him as well.</p><p>I showered around ten-thirty.</p> <p>I had champagne brought up an hour later.</p><p>By midnight, I was expecting the phone to ring at any moment.</p><p>With each passing minute, I realized the void inside me was alive and well. It was thriving. It had a taste for a new sort of misery\u2014hope. It had been a long time since I had allowed myself such an emotion. The void feasted on it while old memories reminded me how dangerous it could be. Hope and fear are different sides of the same coin. I had gone from missing Livvie to hoping I could be the man she wanted. I didn\u2019t know which was worse.</p><p>I had gone through all sorts of scenarios in my mind prior to making contact with Livvie. However, her passive aggressive behavior toward me was not one of them. My mind is much more problem/solution oriented. Mad at me? Scream at me. Punch me if you\u2019re up for it. Please don\u2019t smile at me sweetly, act like nothing is wrong and then leave me disillusioned. And before you say anything, yes\u2014I realize how f**king ironic my words are. I have played my fair share of mind games with Livvie. It doesn\u2019t mean I liked being on the other side. No man does.</p><p>I took a cab over to her apartment. There was a wall of buttons and a speaker panel just outside the door. I ran my finger down a column of buttons until someone buzzed me in. I ignored the groggy insults coming through the speaker. I made it a point to ignore the button marked \u201cS. Cole.\u201d</p><p>The elevator to the fifth floor moved at a glacial pace. Thoughts raced through my mind, each bombarding me with different emotions. In the time it had taken to arrive on Livvie\u2019s floor, I had changed my mind about what to say or do a dozen times.</p><p>I could turn around, change hotels, and let her wonder where the hell I\u2019d gone. I could pound on her door and make a scene in the hall. I could push my way past her when she opened the door and refuse to leave until she gave me answers. I could tell her to go f**k herself and then leave.</p><p>I could.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>I took a deep breath and knocked. My heart beat a staccato rhythm and my breaths filled in the gaps. I\u2019d been in more than my fair share of perilous situations, but few had the ability to affect me so physically.</p><p>After a few seconds, the door opened. A small chain prevented it from opening fully. Livvie\u2019s tear-stained face looked at me through the gap. My anger evaporated and fear blossomed.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? You didn\u2019t call.\u201d</p><p>Livvie glanced away and shut the door in my face. I heard her dealing with the chain just before the door reopened and she motioned me inside. I stepped slowly and carefully. As I let my eyes wander around her apartment, I realized I\u2019d never walked in Livvie\u2019s world. I didn\u2019t know all the different sides of her. There was a blue sofa and a coffee table in the shape of a splat. Fake orange daisies stuck out of a vase filled with clear marbles. Framed posters adorned her walls: Interview with a Vampire, The Crow, The Social Network, Inception, a poster of four different colored records, and a half-naked man whose virtues were compared to chocolate.</p><p>I felt conspicuously out of place. Livvie was young. She cared about movies, music, and boys. She preferred bright colors. I smiled when I saw her PlayStation. A set of drumsticks, a microphone, and a plastic guitar were crammed up against the TV stand. I wondered if Livvie liked to sing or if she preferred one of the instruments. I wondered who she played with and decided the couple she was always with seemed the most likely. They knew her in ways I didn\u2019t. It made me jealous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Livvie said as she walked toward a side door. She was wearing a pink robe with teddy bears on it. I would never have chosen an outfit like that for her. I followed her onto her balcony and watched her light a cigarette. \u201cI got out of work late and I figured you were probably asleep.\u201d She inhaled deeply and let the smoke out smoothly, a sign of a well-seasoned smoker.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been smoking?\u201d I asked. I hadn\u2019t noticed her smoking during the course of my surveillance. She smiled and scoffed sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cYou going to give me shit about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We all have our bad habits.\u201d I would be doing something about the smoking, but I didn\u2019t need to get into it right then. She turned her head toward me and gave me a grin.</p><p>\u201cNot all my habits are bad.\u201d</p><p>I smiled despite my unease.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a few I\u2019m quite fond of,\u201d I quoted her. I stepped closer and brushed her hair away from her forehead. I liked touching her. I liked to remind myself she was alive. To my relief, she closed her eyes and enjoyed my touch.</p><p>\u201cI only do it when I\u2019m stressed out. I took it up after I left the hospital. I haven\u2019t had one in months.\u201d She turned away and took another drag from her cigarette.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the real reason you didn\u2019t call?\u201d My fear surged. \u201cDid you... change your mind? About us?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at me over her shoulder before pointedly staring off into the night. She took two more drags from her cigarette.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what us is.\u201d</p><p>My eyes were burning. The smoke, maybe.</p><p>\u201cIt could be whatever you want it to be, Livvie. Or it could be nothing. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d I knew the moment the words left my mouth they were a lie. She scowled at me.</p><p>\u201cNo, Caleb, it\u2019s not so simple. It\u2019s been a year. A f**king year! You never gave me the chance to be angry with you. You just disappeared and left me to worry that maybe you were dead. I had the FBI up my ass and the whole time\u2014the whole time\u2014I defended you. I defended what you did to me because I loved you and you\u2019d just risked everything to save me. And now you walk back into my life.\u201d She wiped at the tears on her cheeks. \u201cAnd goddammit I can\u2019t bear the thought of being without you again. But there\u2019s all this other shit too. All the things I never let myself feel because I didn\u2019t want to admit that maybe Reed and Sloan were right. Maybe I can\u2019t love you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adrenaline coursed through my veins as my dormant and underutilized emotions were accosted.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I heard myself whisper. I didn\u2019t even know what I was asking for. Perhaps it was only that I wanted her to stop saying those things. Her words hurt me. They hurt me more than I thought anything could hurt. They hurt nearly as much as the memory of Rafiq\u2019s eyes going dead. My own words taunted me.</p><p>\u201cI did think it was really cute when you said you loved me though.\u201d</p><p>Livvie, in her infinite capacity for compassion, put out her cigarette and wrapped her arms around my waist. I took the lifeline she offered and held her in my arms. I might have squeezed her too hard. I didn\u2019t want to let her go. I couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cCaleb,\u201d she gasped. I loosened my grip but didn\u2019t let her go. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to disappear again. Please, promise me you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I searched blindly for my voice and had to clear my throat before I could speak.</p><p>\u201cI promise, Livvie. But I... I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve never been here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither have I, Caleb. And we\u2019re seriously more f**ked up than anyone else I know.\u201d She laughed morosely. \u201cBut you have to give me time. You have to let me be mad at you. You have to promise that no matter what I say or do, you\u2019ll forgive me. You\u2019ll wait for me to let it go.\u201d</p><p>So many emotions and I couldn\u2019t let them out. I settled for stating the obvious.</p> <p>\u201cLivvie, I\u2019ll forgive you whatever the hell you want. You don\u2019t need my forgiveness; you never have to ask for it. It\u2019s yours, Livvie. Anything that\u2019s mine to give is already yours.\u201d I placed my fingers in her hair and tilted her face up to mine. Her lips were salty with tears, her mouth tasted like smoke, but beyond that there was just Livvie. I needed Livvie.</p><p>In my best interpretation of every superhero movie I\u2019d ever seen (and I hadn\u2019t seen too many by that time), I lifted Livvie into my arms and carried her inside. She kindly gave me directions to her bedroom. We made love on her pastel-yellow sheets amidst a ridiculous amount of throw pillows.</p><p>Later, after we\u2019d finished having sex, Livvie engaged me in conversation. It reminded me of Mexico. We had always been better in the dark. I\u2019m going to spare you and, admittedly, myself the agony of the details of what happened after we finished making love. You know what Livvie went through. You know the truth about my past. After that night, I knew it too.</p><p>I learned my name had been James Cole. I had been born to an American named Elizabeth Cole and a man known only as Vlad. I was five when I\u2019d been kidnapped and sent to live as a whore. My mother killed herself when I was twelve. I couldn\u2019t help but take notice I\u2019d been taken under Rafiq\u2019s care around the same time. I wondered if he\u2019d known my mother was dead when he\u2019d decided to \u201crescue\u201d me.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t remember her face. I would always remember Rafiq\u2019s. Meanwhile a voice nagged me: Vladek is your father. Your father is still alive.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Livvie whispered against my neck. I could feel her tears dripping on me. I could feel her arm wrapped tightly around my chest. I could feel her heart beating against my ribs.</p> <p>I felt. I f**king felt and it was awful.</p><p>I pulled her close and ran my fingers across the small of her back, taking whatever comfort I could find in having her close to me. She was alive. I was alive. We were together. I tried to focus on that.</p><p>\u201cNo, Kitten. I\u2019m not okay,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take for me to be okay. I just know that as long as you\u2019re with me, there\u2019s a chance that one day... I might be.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed me. So much was trapped inside me, and her love\u2014or whatever it was she felt for me \u2014threatened to coax it out. I fought to keep it all inside, where I could control it and no one could use it against me. My life was f**ked up. It always had been. There was no point in dwelling on things I couldn\u2019t control or change. My mother was dead. Rafiq was dead. Livvie and I were alive. End of f**king pity party.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Caleb,\u201d she sobbed. I closed my eyes to blink the burning and stinging away. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cI wish that were true. Once, it may have been, but it stopped being true a long time ago. I did what I did, Livvie. It was my fault.\u201d We were quiet for a minute as the words settled. There was something I needed to know. \u201cLivvie, why did you change your last name to Cole? Was it for James? Or... me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb, I know who you are. It doesn\u2019t matter what I call you as long as it\u2019s what you want.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI did it because...\u201d She shifted uncomfortably.</p> <p>\u201cYou loved me.\u201d I closed my eyes. \u201cTrust me\u2014I didn\u2019t miss the past tense. I understand.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cCaleb, it\u2019s not...\u201d she whispered and pressed closer. \u201cIt\u2019s just... what you said about change. We\u2019re changing. We\u2019re both different, and until we know what that means, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it, Livvie. I just want to be here. Right now. With you. Fuck the rest of it, because I don\u2019t care. If there\u2019s anything else you need to tell me, please do it now. Let\u2019s get it over with and tomorrow we can start over. I want to start over, Livvie. Can we do that?\u201d I kept stroking her back. It kept me grounded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that. But what will we tell people? We can\u2019t tell them the truth, and I can\u2019t leave my life behind again, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the FBI? Are they still watching you?\u201d I had a momentary flash of rage as I imagined coming face to face with Agent Reed. I\u2019d pound his face into the ground\u2014present tense!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to meet Reed on Thursday. I know you don\u2019t like him. Hell, I\u2019m not sure I like him.\u201d I could hear the smile in her voice and it irritated me. She\u2019d compared him to me one too many times. \u201cBut he\u2019s a good guy. He wanted to check on me since I told him I felt like someone was watching me. Aside from him and Sloan, I don\u2019t deal with the FBI. I don\u2019t have anything they want.\u201d She nudged my ribs. I sighed.</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t. You do now. With any luck you\u2019ll be able to get rid of Reed easily. Tell him you have a secret admirer from school or something. I\u2019m sure you do anyway. If you tell him there\u2019s nothing for him to look into, he\u2019ll be suspicious.\u201d A voice in my head asked me if I could get away with getting rid of him for good. I calmly ignored it. I was determined to be someone different. I didn\u2019t want to be a killer anymore.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but what about the other stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day at a time, Livvie. I\u2019m not ready to start explaining our relationship any more than you are. Let\u2019s take our time coming up with our story.\u201d</p><p>She propped herself on her elbow and leaned down to kiss my chest. She wiped at the wetness she had left on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI swear I\u2019ve done more crying in the past two days than I\u2019ve done in the past year.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI think I\u2019m done now. I really didn\u2019t want to have to tell you all that stuff. It broke my damn heart when I had to hear it from Reed, but you deserve to know about your past.\u201d Her gaze traveled from my eyes to my chest. She stroked me casually with her fingers. \u201cThe way you looked that day... he wasn\u2019t worthy of your grief.\u201d</p><p>I placed my hand on top of hers and cleared my throat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Her expression turned playfully wistful.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d have found me sooner, we could have celebrated your birthday. I lit a candle for you last month. I had to eat the cake myself.\u201d She smiled. Her words were strange to me, but I laughed too.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGerman chocolate. It was soooo good,\u201d she groaned. I smiled, and at last it was truly genuine.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s just as well. I don\u2019t eat a lot of cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do! Then again, I\u2019m eight years younger than you and my metabolism can handle it. You have to watch your handsome figure.\u201d Her hand shifted down my chest and rubbed my abdomen.</p><p>\u201cI think I do alright,\u201d I said. I wasn\u2019t shy about my body. I had no reason to be. \u201cSo weird to have a birthday, though. Do you think I look twenty-seven?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was coquettish.</p><p>\u201cI think you look... delicious!\u201d Her hand traveled further down my abdomen until she brushed my c**k with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cDelicious, huh? That\u2019s a new one. I was thinking virile, or the male personification of perfection.\u201d</p><p>She laughed out loud. Her laugh was infectious. I loved the way it was a little too loud to be lady-like.</p><p>\u201cOh, Caleb. You\u2019re those things too. But right now? I\u2019m more interested in your tastiness.\u201d She slid down on the bed and took my c**k in her hand.</p><p>\u201cOh! Well in that case... taste away. If you have any more cake, I\u2019d be happy to provide the frosting.\u201d She wrinkled her nose and I laughed.</p><p>I lay back and let Livvie blow more than my mind.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Livvie\u2019s meeting with Reed went okay. He wasn\u2019t an idiot though, Livvie recounted to me. He wanted to hang around for a few days and make sure Livvie was safe. I didn\u2019t like him. I suspected his visit had more to do with uncovering secrets than keeping Livvie safe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He spoke to Livvie\u2019s friends, her co-workers, even the kid at the restaurant Livvie liked to go to. It was a good thing I had paid someone to give my note to the waiter. If he\u2019d given Reed my description, we would have been pretty screwed. It took a great amount of will power to steer clear of him. I knew there were certain things Livvie would not forgive.</p><p>Livvie and I had no contact during Reed\u2019s visit. I discovered more nightmares and a level of boredom I had never experienced before in my life. I was grateful for the internet until I was unable to resist doing a search for \u201cMissing child+James Cole\u201d.</p><p>There were a couple of results, but nothing that jumped out at me. I was kidnapped before the internet had become commonplace, before Twitter and Facebook, and 24-hour news. Back then, milk cartons and mailers were the best people could do. James Cole never stood a chance.</p><p>That night I dreamt I was trapped inside a child\u2019s body. I was with Narweh again and my strength meant nothing. He laughed at me. I didn\u2019t go online for a week.</p> <p>I never like it when I dream. It\u2019s usually about things I\u2019d rather not think about. When I was a young boy and worked in the brothel, I never dreamed. At least, not that I can recall. There were mornings when I would wake and have new and interesting ways to murder Narweh when the time came\u2014but I never attributed them to my dreams.</p><p>The first dreams I can recall began when Rafiq brought me to live with him. The uncertainty of my new fate had the tendency to terrify me. I have never felt comfortable sharing my feelings\u2014especially my doubts, fears, hopes, and desires. They are what make me vulnerable and more than anything, I hate being vulnerable. Once Rafiq had gained my trust, once he had given me a destiny and a purpose, I didn\u2019t dream so much.</p><p>The dreams resurfaced in the weeks following Livvie\u2019s kidnapping. I had dismissed them at the time. I knew I was conflicted over many things: My desire to move on with my life. My confusion over Rafiq\u2019s increasing secrecy. The nagging sense of doubt over kidnapping Livvie. The fear I was becoming Narweh. The dreams intensified the more my feelings for Livvie had begun to develop. I denied it then. I see it now.</p><p>The nightmares I had after I left Livvie at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border were some of the worst I have ever had. If you know anything about me\u2014and we\u2019ve well established you do\u2014then you can perhaps imagine the horrors I had to choose from. The truth is, I don\u2019t let these things, the horrors of my past, drag me under. Quite the contrary\u2014for so very long, they fueled me. Considering what I\u2019ve been through, I often think I\u2019m very well adjusted. I can handle anything the world throws at me, but for someone who tries to plan his moves ahead of time, uncertainty about my future leaves me disturbed as nothing else.</p><p>I thought finding Livvie would give me certainty, but I was learning that happiness also presents new ways to suffer. Misery, I understand. Happiness is terrifying.</p> <p>Also, Livvie\u2019s words about \u201cother shit\u201d coming to the fore made sense to me. For the first time in my life I didn\u2019t have anything to do. No one had any expectations of me. I had enough money to do anything and go anywhere, but I had no idea what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go. I had idle hands. My mind was the proverbial devil\u2019s playground. It seemed as though everything I had kept tucked away in the dark recesses of my mind was escaping into my consciousness.</p><p>I breathed a deep sigh of relief when Reed left Spain and Livvie could finally come back to me. I still had the nightmares, but waking up to her warm body made it easier to come back from the anxiety.</p><p>It was October, and the weather was becoming unpredictable. On some nights it was the perfect excuse to spend hours in bed. Livvie and I f**ked like rabbits\u2014and a few other animals too.</p><p>Although Livvie\u2019s presence brought me solace after a nightmare, I hated how weak it made me feel to accept it. Instead, I took to staying up after Livvie went to sleep. I slept while she was out in the world of the living. I still had the dreams, but I didn\u2019t wake up to darkness.</p><p>All in all, things were good. Aside from the dreams, I didn\u2019t have anything to complain about. However, I\u2019d be lying if I told you I wasn\u2019t beginning to get more than a little restless. Livvie had a job, she went to school and had friends. I didn\u2019t have any of those things. Trust me, I wasn\u2019t butt-hurt over it. I didn\u2019t begrudge her those things. It was simply becoming obvious to me that my life was completely different from what I had known. What does a former kidnapper/murderer do in retirement?</p><p>After three weeks of idle hands, I decided to buy a car. I bought a 5-Series BMW. It wasn\u2019t as sexy as the Lamborghini, but it did the trick. I could go for long drives and avoid my sterile hotel room. Even when I was out, I kept to myself. Having decided I would be staying in Barcelona indefinitely, I didn\u2019t need or want to draw unnecessary attention toward myself. It was a huge risk just being with Livvie.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take long for Livvie\u2019s friends to realize something had changed. She\u2019d all but abandoned them those first three weeks. She worked three nights a week and went to school Monday through Thursday. She spent most of her free time with me.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Livvie began as we sat down to eat the meal room service had brought up. \u201cRemember when we said we\u2019d take things one day at a time and figure out what we were going to tell people when the time came?\u201d She bit into a piece of asparagus. I swallowed the chunk of steak in my mouth without chewing.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think we should start talking about it. Claudia and Rubi are starting to complain about the amount of time I\u2019m not spending with them.\u201d She smiled at me.</p><p>I stabbed a piece of broccoli like it owed me money.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it their business? You\u2019re an adult. You don\u2019t need their permission to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb,\u201d she admonished. \u201cThey\u2019re my friends. They\u2019ve been there for me. If you\u2019re going to fit into my life, you\u2019re going to have to find a way to get to know my friends. I can\u2019t keep coming over here every night. It\u2019s exhausting. I have a life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd aren\u2019t you lucky? Good for you.\u201d I shoveled food into my mouth and avoided her eyes. I didn\u2019t know why I was so angry. She\u2019d made a perfectly valid argument and I\u2019d shit on it. Her smile quickly disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what? How about I just quit my job?\u201d she spat.</p><p>I looked up from my plate. Here we go...</p><p>\u201cLivvie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She was on a roll. Her eyes screamed of crazy. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect! I\u2019ll leave school and cut my friends out of my life. Then you can have me all to yourself! You can keep me in your dark little room and f**k me stupid. You can own me. It\u2019s what you want, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>My rage was a living, breathing monster in my gut and it fed on every word she\u2019d said. I had no doubt she\u2019d been waiting to say those words to me since the night we\u2019d talked on her balcony. Did her words hurt? Yes. But they also excited me. My dick was hard and a familiar thrumming thudded in my ears. I wanted a fight. I needed a fight. I was sick and tired of playing nice. I AM NOT NICE!</p><p>I chewed my food slowly and with a smile on my face. I watched Livvie closely. She was trying hard not to crack under the pressure of my silence. Livvie could never handle it\u2014still can\u2019t. I could hear her breathing. Her eyes were narrowed onto my face. If I\u2019d been some little boy her age, I might have worried for my safety. But I\u2019d seen scary, and Livvie just didn\u2019t fit the bill. She was too sweet, too sexy.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to f**king respond?\u201d She was taunting me and enjoying it. Her chest rose and fell with gaining speed. I could make out the points of her ni**les through her shirt.</p><p>I swallowed my food and sipped from my wine glass. I\u2019d missed the familiarity of pushing Livvie\u2019s buttons. I didn\u2019t want to hurt her. I\u2019d vowed not to hurt her again. It didn\u2019t mean I had to become a pu**y.</p><p>\u201cYou want a response, Kitten?\u201d Fear flickered just behind her angry stare. She shivered before she could stop it. I took my napkin from my lap and set it on the table. Livvie watched me intently. \u201cHere\u2019s my response.\u201d</p><p>I slid my arm across the table. Our plates, glasses, and silverware crashed onto the floor. I stood up just in time to catch Livvie\u2019s arm as she leapt out of her chair and ran toward the door.</p><p>\u201cCaleb, no!\u201d she screamed. I put my hand across her mouth and hoisted her with one arm. Her legs kicked out at me viciously. Her teeth bit into my hand. Her nails dug into the flesh of my arm. The pain only spurred me on.</p><p>I pressed her body into the wall until she could barely move. She squirmed against me. You might hate me for it, but I loved every second. Then again, I knew I wasn\u2019t going to hurt her\u2014not really. Once I had her immobilized, I whispered into her ear.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think if that\u2019s what I wanted, I wouldn\u2019t just do it?\u201d She whimpered. \u201cIt would be easier for me. You\u2019d be mine in every way possible.\u201d I rubbed my c**k between the cheeks of her ass. I almost came in my pants when she groaned. She struggled, but she was barely trying.</p><p>\u201cI could keep you chained to the bed. I\u2019d f**k you every night and never let you come. Only good girls get to come, Kitten. Would you be a good girl for me?\u201d I took my hand away from Livvie\u2019s mouth and smoothed her hair back so I could see the side of her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck you. Let me go,\u201d she panted. Her tone meant business, but her body language told another story. She moved against my cock.</p><p>We were in dangerous territory. I knew the situation could blow up in my face, but the thrill was too strong. I couldn\u2019t resist. I pressed her deeper into the wall, until she gasped for breath. I planted soft kisses against her neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you go if you\u2019re not wet,\u201d I whispered into her ear.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. She didn\u2019t speak.</p> <p>\u201cWhat, no response? Should I check?\u201d My heart was racing. I was afraid of going too far. I was afraid I\u2019d already gone too far and didn\u2019t know how to come back. \u201cTell me to stop and I will. Tell me you don\u2019t want me to pull your tights down and f**k you up against this wall. Remind me of what a terrible person I am. Tell me I\u2019m a sick bastard and you want me out of your life forever.\u201d</p><p>Livvie screwed her eyes shut. Her lip trembled, but she didn\u2019t cry.</p><p>I softened toward her. I didn\u2019t want to hurt her. I loved her. I didn\u2019t know how to do it like normal people. I didn\u2019t know how to tell her how scared I was. I pressed my forehead to the back of her neck and I tried.</p><p>\u201cTell me I don\u2019t deserve you. Tell me all the things I already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb...\u201d My name was a heart-wrenching sound coming from her lips. I prepared for the worst and began to pull away. Livvie\u2019s hands gripped my forearm and held me in place. \u201cFuck me.\u201d</p> <p>There was no time to think. I reacted. I pulled her skirt up to her waist. I shoved her panties and tights down to her knees. She gasped. Her hands slapped against the wall for balance. It was only seconds before I had my own pants down to my ankles. I thrust into Livvie fast and hard.</p><p>She was wet. She was wet and warm and f**king heaven wrapped around me. I never wanted to leave the safety of her body. As long as I was inside her, she was mine. No one could take her from me. I couldn\u2019t ruin things between us.</p><p>I pounded away at her. I put my hands around her wrists and f**ked her into the wall. I practically lifted her body with every thrust... and I groveled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Livvie. I\u2019m sorry. Forgive me. Forgive me.\u201d And I kept f**king.</p><p>Afterward, Livvie left in a hurry. I was tempted to stop her, but I didn\u2019t. I felt I\u2019d done enough damage for one night. I left all the broken dishes on the floor and proceeded to take a scalding hot shower. I refused to sleep that night.</p><p>Early the next morning, Livvie called me.</p> <p>\u201cHey you.\u201d I could hear the smile in her voice. I was a little suspicious but warily accepted she might not be mad about the night before.</p><p>I rubbed my eyes. I was exhausted.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to let you know I have work after class, but I\u2019m free tomorrow. I can spend the night, and tomorrow I thought we could go see a movie. I want to watch Let Me In.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and propped myself up against the headboard.</p><p>\u201cUm... okay.\u201d I\u2019d been expecting anger from her. Maybe even excuses as to why she couldn\u2019t see me for a while. I decided it was better to accept her offer than question her motives. \u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a horror movie, but not really. I really liked the Swedish version called Let the Right One In, but I\u2019m curious to see what the director did with it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. I remembered all the movie posters in her apartment.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, Livvie. We can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pet names today?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>There was silence on her end. Then very quietly, \u201cI liked it last night.\u201d</p><p>My dick stirred.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well... just don\u2019t get too many ideas. You can\u2019t solve everything with sex, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>A tingle of shame bloomed in my chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. See you tonight, Sexy.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cIs that a pet name? I hate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to remember.\u201d</p><p>I hung up and went straight to sleep. I didn\u2019t even dream.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>Livvie liked to see a lot of movies and read a lot of books. She often lamented not being able to read as often as she\u2019d like because her life was so busy between work, school, and dividing her free time between me and her friends. I often changed the subject when she brought up the last bit. I knew she wanted me to meet them. However, the idea of surrounding myself with typical twenty-year-olds was less than appealing. I had nothing in common with most people\u2014less with those who had never shot a person at point-blank range. At least Livvie and I had that in common!</p><p>\u201cThanksgiving is next week,\u201d Livvie said as she slid into the car. We\u2019d just finished watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. Livvie had insisted we have a marathon to catch me up before we went to see the film. Surprisingly, I genuinely enjoyed the movies. I wondered if I was more like Harry or Voldemort. \u201cCaleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I looked toward Livvie and smiled. She sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou know where I\u2019m going with this. Don\u2019t make it difficult for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kitten. Again? I have enough friends. I don\u2019t want any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any friends, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my friend.\u201d I winked at her as I started the car. She was a sucker for my flirting.</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d She threw up her hands sarcastically. \u201cYou are so irritating! If you weren\u2019t so handsome I\u2019d punch you in the face.\u201d I laughed. \u201cCome on, Caleb. Don\u2019t be an ass. I\u2019ve been really patient, but this is important to me. You\u2019re important to me... and so are they. Please don\u2019t make me choose.\u201d</p><p>Despite her playful tone, I could tell how serious the situation truly was. I\u2019d put her through a lot. After all, an evening with her friends had to bode better for me than it had for Livvie when she\u2019d spent time with mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to tell them about me?\u201d</p><p>She shifted in her seat and gave me a look of tempered excitement.</p><p>\u201cOhmygod, are you asking me because you\u2019re actually considering it?\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d I grumbled. I wasn\u2019t prepared when Livvie took off her seatbelt and jumped on me with a squeal of delight. I tapped my brakes and heard a horn blaring behind me. \u201cLivvie! What the f**k? I\u2019m driving!\u201d She was completely unapologetic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy! So happy, happy, happy.\u201d She danced into her seat and put her seatbelt back on. \u201cClaudia is going to flip her shit when she sees you. Rubi is super polite, but Claudia is a bit of a chatterbox. So expect her to talk your ear off. Sometimes she gets kinda personal, but I\u2019ll warn her ahead of time how grumpy you are. Ohmygod, what are we going to eat? I hope the grocery store has turkeys. Big turkeys!\u201d</p><p>My anxiety levels were rising. What the hell had I just agreed to?</p><p>\u201cLivvie, it\u2019s not going to be that easy. We have to be careful if you don\u2019t want to send me pen pal letters in prison.\u201d</p><p>Her excitement dwindled slightly. She rested her hand on my arm.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d run before I ever let that happen, Caleb.\u201d She was dead serious. My chest felt a little tighter. \u201cBesides,\u201d she continued, \u201cthe FBI is far from here and they don\u2019t check on me unless I reach out first. Sloan calls sometimes, but now that she knows I have friends and don\u2019t sit around moping over you, I don\u2019t hear from her much. We\u2019re okay, Caleb. We\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>I smiled despite myself.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re pretty far from perfect, Kitten. I\u2019m the most f**ked up person you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m the second most f**ked up person I know, and when you put two negatives together, you get a positive. That\u2019s math, Caleb. Math is the language of the universe. You can\u2019t argue with the universe.\u201d Her grin was patently ridiculous.</p><p>I love you so goddamn much.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I\u2019ve been screwed over by the universe before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! It totally owes us.\u201d She stuck out her tongue. I laughed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, what are we going to say?\u201d I held her hand as I focused on the road.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s just like writing. You start with what you know, and what I know is the best lies are rooted in the truth. Your name is James. You were born in Portland, Oregon. You\u2019re twenty-seven, well-traveled, and we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a month and a half.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cBeen thinking about it, have you? My passport doesn\u2019t say James. Also, in the event your FBI friends come poking around, I\u2019m not sure having James Cole in your life is going to go unnoticed. Then there\u2019s what do I do for a living? Why do I have an accent if I grew up in America? What\u2019s my family like? Do I have any hobbies?\u201d I slowly watched the enthusiasm fade from Livvie\u2019s face. I felt like shit. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Livvie. I know you deserve better, but I just don\u2019t know how you think we can pull this off.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for the rest of the ride back to my hotel. We stripped and climbed into bed. I pulled her close. I could practically hear the gears turning in her head.</p><p>\u201cWe tell them we\u2019re both in witness protection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t supposed to be together, but we couldn\u2019t stand to be apart. The FBI wants you to turn over evidence that belongs to another country. That\u2019s why Reed was poking around and I\u2019ve been so secretive about where I\u2019m spending my nights. They can never tell anyone about us. As far as they\u2019re concerned, we met at The Paseo. They love me, Caleb. They\u2019ll keep our secret.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think that will work? It seems far-fetched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more so than the truth.\u201d</p><p>I considered her words carefully. It could work if her friends could truly be trusted, but I didn\u2019t know them from anyone. I\u2019d have to check them out thoroughly, keep an eye on them. Livvie wouldn\u2019t like it. I\u2019d have to keep it from her, but it was better than getting ambushed down the line. Rafiq was with me for twelve years before I found out he couldn\u2019t be trusted. I was never going to make that mistake again.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait on telling them about witness protection. We\u2019ll avoid details beyond my name, where we met, and what I do. If all goes well, we can tell them the \u2018truth\u2019 later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to tell them about your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell them I\u2019m independently wealthy. I have a trust fund. I\u2019ve traveled since I was a boy and that\u2019s why my accent is strange. I\u2019m twenty-seven, well-traveled, and we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a month and a half.\u201d I kissed the top of Livvie\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Kitten.\u201d I reached for her breast and traced her nipple with my thumb. I kissed her throat when she sighed, tilting her head to the side to allow me access. My hand slid from her breast, down her ribs, and over her ass until I palmed her flesh and squeezed. \u201cYou owe me though,\u201d I whispered against her neck.</p> <p>\u201cMmm. What do you want?\u201d She mimicked my actions and palmed my ass. She was oddly obsessed with my body. I couldn\u2019t complain.</p><p>\u201cI want several things.\u201d I sucked the flesh of her shoulder into my mouth. She arched her body against me, rubbing her tits against my chest. Her fingers dug into the flesh of my ass. \u201cLet\u2019s start with you moving your hand and putting it somewhere a little more useful.\u201d She giggled softly.</p><p>\u201cI like where it is.\u201d She spanked me. It was loud, but it didn\u2019t hurt. I laughed.</p><p>\u201cIn your f**king dreams, Kitten. But if it\u2019s spanking you enjoy, allow me to indulge you.\u201d I let my hand fall on her ass solidly. The force caused her to push closer to me.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she yelped and squirmed in my grasp. \u201cNo, Caleb. I swear to God!\u201d She was laughing, but also panicked. I let her go and she did exactly as I\u2019d hoped\u2014she ran. Her naked body bounded over me onto the floor and she took off toward the living room with a squeal.</p><p>I gave chase.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make security come up here,\u201d I taunted from one side of the sofa. Livvie was on the other side, countering every move I made in either direction. She was laughing maniacally, half excited, half frightened.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll tell them you\u2019re trying to spank me. Pervert!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it. You\u2019re the pervert!\u201d I pushed the sofa toward her, upsetting her balance. I lunged, but she backed away and made a run toward the dining room table. I paid an ungodly amount for the room. I didn\u2019t give a shit if we destroyed it.</p><p>\u201cStop chasing me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop running.\u201d</p><p>She circled the table, tossing down the chairs as she went. Her ni**les were hard little pebbles I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes from as her full br**sts jiggled and swayed with her movements.</p><p>\u201cYou promise not to spank me?\u201d</p><p>I grinned.</p> <p>\u201cNot a f**king chance.\u201d I watched her carefully as she kept going around the table, stepping over the backs of the chairs she\u2019d knocked over. If I made my move too soon, she could run toward the bedroom and subsequently lock herself in the bathroom. On the other side of the table, her back was to the wall. I let her enjoy the thrill of evading me for one last turn around the table. I leapt on top of the table, startling her. She backed up and hit the wall with her back. I jumped down and pinned her.</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d</p><p>She was breathing hard. I loved watching her laugh when she was trying hard not to. Despite her obvious beauty, she often made the most hideously comedic faces.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d She wrapped her arms around my shoulders. She was suddenly very flirty.</p><p>\u201cWhatever I want.\u201d I kissed her lips until she opened for me. As I swept my tongue inside I felt satisfaction in the way she moaned and rubbed herself against me. The idea that I had ever thought of giving her away was almost enough to make me angry. However, if being so close to Livvie had taught me anything (and it had taught me a great deal), it was that being angry was next to impossible while she melted against me.</p><p>In the weeks prior, I had learned that Livvie liked to play a little rough. It suited me well when I didn\u2019t overthink it. She liked to be held down and done from behind. She liked to be told what to do. She liked to be spanked. Mostly, though, she liked to come. She didn\u2019t care how it happened\u2014just that it did. It helped take the edge off for me.</p><p>I backed away, stroking my dick. I liked the way Livvie\u2019s eyes followed my hand. She really did like to watch me (so long as another woman wasn\u2019t in bed with me). Her lips were swollen from kissing. She licked them and waited. I obliged by shortening her wait.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands on the table and spread your legs.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wickedly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb.\u201d She quickly assumed the position.</p><p>I ran my hand down her long ebony mane. I knew one day I would insist on wrapping it around my dick and coming in it. I brushed her hair aside and replayed my touch down her spine. I grinned when she dipped her chest lower, lifting her ass. I would get to it, but I took my time touching everything. Her tits looked heavier in her position\u2014full. I pinched them and she whimpered. I pinched her clit and she moaned. Her moans and whimpers were like food for my dark soul.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for me to spank you?\u201d It wasn\u2019t really a question. It was a warning. She took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Her breath hitched with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your chest down on the table and hold the sides.\u201d I waited patiently for her to comply. Livvie\u2019s beautiful skin was free of imperfections. There were no scars marring her slender back. She\u2019d been spared my fate and I was deeply grateful.</p><p>I braced her body against my hip with one hand. I delivered the first blow with my free hand. The sound rent the air. Livvie gasped, but otherwise remained silent. I watched her ass turn pink where my hand had been.</p><p>\u201cPink already, Pet. How many do you think it\u2019ll take for your ass to be bright red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Caleb.\u201d She spoke softly. Her legs trembled.</p><p>\u201cShould we find out?\u201d I traced the welt with my fingertip. Livvie whimpered again.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, Caleb.\u201d I smiled to myself. I knew I was a sick f**k. Livvie made me a lucky f**k too. I spanked her twice, one slap after the other. Livvie braced with her arms, but didn\u2019t clench her ass. Practice, practice, practice.</p><p>\u201cIs that good, Kitten?\u201d My own breathing had picked up speed as my arousal shot through the roof. Livvie\u2019s sounds, coupled with her writhing, had me in an acute state of lust.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb. More please.\u201d</p><p>I hissed. I spanked her four times in rapid succession. Livvie\u2019s ass was hot beneath my fingers. She picked up her feet and writhed against the table.</p><p>\u201cGetting pretty red now, Pet.\u201d I was panting. \u201cPut those f**king feet on the ground. You know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb,\u201d Livvie whispered. She was close to tears. She wouldn\u2019t be able to take much more. Hell, I couldn\u2019t take much more.</p><p>I used my heated fingers to rub her pu**y from behind. She moaned and opened her legs wider.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully wet inside, Kitten. You must really like getting a spanking.\u201d I slid my index finger inside her and moved it back and forth slowly. She shook.</p><p>\u201cI like this better. More please. Harder.\u201d She started moving her hips as much as she could with me holding her. She was f**king herself with my finger.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not being a very good pet right now, Kitten. You don\u2019t get to decide when you get f**ked.\u201d I slowed my finger and she groaned in frustration. I smiled. \u201cWho decides, Kitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do, Caleb.\u201d She went still and relaxed her all her muscles. She was a vessel for my pleasure, a willing participant in my depravity.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Kitten. I do.\u201d I spanked her three more times before I heard a little sob. She\u2019d had enough. I\u2019d had enough. I stood behind her, lifted her hips, and slid her wet pu**y down my c**k until I hit the bottom of her.</p><p>\u201cOh, god! Please, Caleb.\u201d She took swift advantage of the table and used it as leverage to saw herself back and forth on my cock. It felt so good, I temporarily gave up control. It couldn\u2019t last long. It wasn\u2019t what either of us wanted. I wanted control. Livvie wanted to surrender it.</p><p>Gaining my wits, I laid down on top of her. I\u2019m over six feet tall (I use feet for your benefit, but you should really learn metric, America) to Livvie\u2019s five feet six. I covered her entire body. To avoid depleting her oxygen supply, I braced on one elbow and gripped the other end of the table with my free hand.</p><p>\u201cYou want it hard, Pet? I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d I moved my hips in long strokes, almost pulling out when I moved back, making Livvie grunt when I gave her all of me at once on the way forward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We did it that way until my elbow hurt and we were dripping with sweat, then I flipped us over and made Livvie ride me until we both came.</p><p>She fell asleep on top of me afterward. My dick was still inside her, getting soft. Semen ran out whenever either of us moved. I didn\u2019t care. I was too damn happy.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>The night before Thanksgiving, I had a dream Livvie said she\u2019d decided she couldn\u2019t love me. I woke up in a panic and made Livvie have sex with me. She didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p> <p>We had Thanksgiving dinner in Livvie\u2019s apartment. Claudia and Rubio brought bottles of sangria, since it was apparently the favorite drink of their little group. I started drinking scotch before breakfast.</p><p>Livvie thought it was \u201ccute\u201d how nervous I was. True, I was a little nervous, but mostly I wasn\u2019t looking forward to making conversation. I figured the smell of me might keep people away.</p><p>Claudia was a force of nature\u2014a spritely-looking creature with short dark hair, green eyes, and a mischievously sinister grin. She was even smaller than Livvie, but you wouldn\u2019t notice it given the way she had a tendency to get into one\u2019s personal space. That one being me.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d She held my head in both hands and turned my face from side to side, then up toward the ceiling. I felt like I was being looked over for lice, or worse\u2014being appraised. I pulled my face away and scowled at her. \u201cOh! Touchy. Sophia said you were.\u201d She shrugged and hopped toward the kitchen.</p><p>Rubio was much more respectful. He was handsome in an awkward sort of way. He was tall, but lanky. His hair had a fastidiously cultivated look of dishevelment, as was the style with the youth in Europe. He shared the same color eyes as his girlfriend.</p> <p>I had no doubt as to who ran the relationship between Claudia and Rubio. At the very least, Rubio had the decency to look embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cSorry, she does that to everybody. When I met her, she told me I was adorable and was her boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you became her boyfriend?\u201d I gave him a look. He smiled.</p><p>\u201cShe was wearing a tight shirt and I could see her boobs.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cYou did the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>Thanksgiving is an American holiday. Livvie and I had to scour the grocery stores to find a turkey that was apparently suitable enough to feed an army, despite our only needing to feed four people. However, as I watched Livvie pull the turkey out of the oven and set it on top of the stove, I knew it had been time well spent. Livvie\u2019s pride in her poultry was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cLook! It\u2019s my first turkey.\u201d Livvie showcased the bird between her outstretched hands with a curtsy.</p><p>\u201cIs it supposed to be swimming?\u201d I asked. It smelled delicious and I couldn\u2019t wait to eat it, but I love to give Livvie shit. It\u2019s my second favorite pastime.</p><p>\u201cI hate dry turkey. I may have over-basted it. Who am I kidding, though? No such thing. You\u2019ll eat my f**king turkey and lick your fingers when you\u2019re done.\u201d She pulled a strip of meat off the top of the turkey and put it to my lips. \u201cOpen up, lover.\u201d</p><p>I put my arm around her and pulled. She smelled of perfume and food. I opened my mouth and let her feed me. It was the best turkey I\u2019d ever had\u2014moist inside with crispy skin. I licked Livvie\u2019s fingers as she withdrew.</p><p>\u201cHmm, not bad. You almost didn\u2019t get your finger back.\u201d</p><p>Livvie beamed at me.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a lucky girl then. There\u2019s so much I like to do with my fingers.\u201d She pulled my mouth toward hers and kissed me. Between us, my c**k gave a twitch. Livvie pulled away slowly with one last peck against my lips. \u201cClaudia and Rubi are here.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed the front of my pants against her belly. Our height difference always confused my cock. It couldn\u2019t decide between seeking the warmth between her br**sts and the wet heat waiting just below.</p><p>\u201cThey can watch. The boy might learn something.\u201d</p><p>Livvie laughed and pulled away.</p><p>\u201cNot everyone is as obsessed with sex as you are. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d appreciate it very much.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWe could ask.\u201d</p><p>Just then, the sprite walked into the crowded kitchen.</p><p>\u201cTell me the food is ready! I am starving. I didn\u2019t eat all day because you said to come hungry.\u201d She grabbed a roll from a nearby pan and started munching. \u201cMmm, this one is still hot.\u201d She crammed the rest into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cClaudia! That\u2019s not for snacking, you bitch.\u201d Livvie spanked the other girl on the ass and both of them giggled.</p><p>Girls are so strange. If another man called me a bitch and spanked me, it would not end in giggles. Although, women are far more inherently bisexual than men in my opinion. The thought gave me pause as I pictured Livvie doing very dirty things to the sprite. I turned toward the living room and made my escape before my dick got any harder. The kitchen was crowded enough.</p><p>Rubio was in the living room unraveling cords and setting up the PlayStation when I walked in. I was surprised he could do any amount of labor wearing the pants he had on. I don\u2019t understand skinny jeans for men. Who wants to walk around with their balls in a vise? For a second I wondered what Rafiq would think of the fad. A strange sort of melancholy drifted through me and I set my scotch on the coffee table. The last thing I needed was drunken reflection.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help with that?\u201d I asked. I needed a distraction.</p><p>\u201cNo, I got it already. Do you play or sing?\u201d He beamed at me and I suddenly felt very old and out of touch with the world I was invading.</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d I said. I stood there feeling awkward without a drink in my hand and with nothing to do. Rubio smiled and put a plastic guitar in my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou can start with the guitar. It\u2019s easier if you\u2019re just starting.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for my reply before he turned on the TV and loud rock music filled the living room. I found it annoying but didn\u2019t say anything about it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have to choose a character first. Then we pick a song and you push the colored buttons on the guitar as they go by on the screen. I\u2019m going to play the drums.\u201d Rubio seemed excited and I didn\u2019t understand it. I\u2019d never considered myself socially retarded until that moment.</p><p>I chose a bearded rocker as my character and got a feel for the toy guitar in my hands. At the very least, I felt less awkward having something to do. Rubio selected his character and proceeded to the song list.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of our band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia picked it. We\u2019re The Sex Rifles.\u201d He laughed. \u201cShe thought it was more gangster than The Sex Pistols.\u201d I didn\u2019t know who The Sex Pistols were, but I could appreciate Livvie\u2019s sense of humor.</p><p>\u201cOoh, yes! I want to play.\u201d Claudia squealed as she joined us in the living room. I looked around for Livvie and didn\u2019t see her. Please don\u2019t leave me alone with both of them.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s L-Sophia?\u201d I just stopped myself from saying Livvie and was glad the pair of them were too busy fitting Claudia with a bass guitar.</p><p>\u201cSophia! Come play!\u201d Claudia yelled at an obnoxious level. I must have made a face because she responded to me. \u201cGet used to it, gorgeous man. If you\u2019re going to be part of our group, you\u2019re going to have to handle our rude-ass behavior. There\u2019s no room for politeness in a family.\u201d She winked at me. I smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou startled me is all; I don\u2019t think you\u2019re rude.\u201d Really, she was very rude. If she weren\u2019t Livvie\u2019s friend, I\u2019d have shown her some manners. Alas, I had promised Livvie I was done torturing people who didn\u2019t like it. And as for family, she was really talking to the wrong person.</p><p>Livvie walked in and the happiness I saw on her face melted me. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever seen her so happy. It made me jealous of her friends. I\u2019d given up my whole f**king life to be with her and she never looked that happy with me. She walked up to me and fiddled with the strap of the guitar.</p><p>\u201cWell, look at you. You making nice, Sexy?\u201d She rose up on her toes and puckered her lips. I bent down and accepted her kiss without thinking.</p><p>\u201cI have a name, you know.\u201d</p><p>She grinned.</p><p>\u201cI remember, Sexy.\u201d She turned and reached for the controller and the microphone. \u201cDinner is ready, so we can only do one or two songs and then we should eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe food is so good, Rubi. I\u2019m glad you met me instead of Sophia first. I\u2019ll never make you anything that good,\u201d Claudia said.</p><p>\u201cWhat you give me is better than food,\u201d Rubio replied evenly. He kissed his girlfriend on the cheek and she blushed. I gained a little respect for them both. Their love was obvious and I hoped that one day Livvie and I could have what they did... without the skinny jeans... or the reminder we met under horrendous circumstances.</p><p>I felt a tap against my ass. Livvie was giving me some serious \u201ccome f**k me\u201d eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to play, Sexy? Make sure you set it to easy so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>Some of my anxiety fell away.</p><p>\u201cAnd you better remember who you\u2019re talking to, or else I\u2019ll have to remind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I look forward to it.\u201d She squeezed my ass. I shook my head and laughed. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna do \u2018Eye of the Tiger\u2019.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou always do that one,\u201d Claudia whined.</p><p>\u201cShut up! When it\u2019s your turn to sing, you can pick the song. Don\u2019t embarrass me in front of Sexy. I want him to marvel at how talented I am,\u201d Livvie said.</p><p>\u201cYou should let him read your smut. I bet he\u2019d love that.\u201d Claudia made claws out of her fingers and scratched at the air in a motion no one in their right mind would think is sexy but was supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019re always writing on your laptop?\u201d I smiled wide, knowing I was going to get my hands on Livvie\u2019s laptop at my earliest opportunity. Livvie looked ashen for a second.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Forget it. Let\u2019s play already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh come on, Sophia. It\u2019s so good.\u201d She turned to me. \u201cIt\u2019s about this girl who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaudia!\u201d Livvie said seriously and glared.</p><p>\u201cFine. Okay, let\u2019s play,\u201d Claudia said sarcastically.</p><p>My interest was piqued before, but I became like a dog with a bone after Livvie\u2019s reaction. I would be asking questions later, that much was certain. For the moment, I decided to focus on the plastic guitar in my hands and pushing the right buttons. It was a good thing my mind is so quick, because even on medium I was having a tough time keeping up with the rush of colors going across the screen.</p> <p>The intro seemed to take forever, but once Livvie began singing I found myself swept up in the game. Livvie\u2019s voice was beautiful, raspy and powerful. She seemed filled with so many talents I didn\u2019t know about. I wanted to know all there was to know about her. I fleetingly wondered what talents I possessed that could possibly compare with hers. She turned toward me during an instrumental section.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing good! I suck at guitar.\u201d</p><p>I winked at her.</p><p>\u201cTrying to concentrate, Pet. If you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Play on, rock star, don\u2019t let me stop you.\u201d She went back to belting the chorus and I wondered how her lungs were capable of holding so much air.</p><p>Finally, the song ended and I skated through the round with a seventy-five percent success rate. The rest of the band scored in the nineties and Livvie the highest with ninety-nine percent. A fact she wouldn\u2019t stop gloating about. I\u2019d never seen Livvie so smug, and I felt my chest expand with something akin to pride at seeing some of my own mannerisms in her. We\u2019d come so far, and I was oddly desperate to see where we could go.</p> <p>Claudia sang next. Her softer, more lyrical voice did well with \u201cNine in the Afternoon.\u201d I had a hard time keeping up with the guitar but seemed to be out-performing Livvie, who was attempting to play bass with her entire body. Her tongue was out as she concentrated on the screen, paying no attention to the way I stared at her every chance I had.</p><p>After Claudia finished her song and everyone laughed at my sixty-two percent accuracy (Livvie only had sixty-five, and why they chose to only make fun of me, I\u2019ll never know\u2014bastards), the decision was made to sit down to dinner. Livvie\u2019s table wasn\u2019t large enough for all the food and guests, so we served ourselves in the kitchen and brought our plates to the table. It was all so strange to me. I felt a bit like an outsider, even if I\u2019d literally been closer to Livvie than either of her friends.</p><p>Once everyone was seated, I picked up my fork, eager to get into the turkey and stuffing when Livvie stayed my hand. I looked at her and purposely growled. She only smiled and patted my hand.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, Sexy. It\u2019s Thanksgiving. We have to go around and say what we\u2019re thankful for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be thankful if we could eat,\u201d I muttered. I put my fork down and looked around the table. They were all smiling at me. It was creepy. Believe me\u2014I know creepy.</p><p>\u201cSophia, it\u2019s your house. You should go first.\u201d Rubio suggested.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Livvie said and took a deep breath. \u201cWell, first, I want to say I\u2019m thankful for the food. I can\u2019t wait to eat it. But, more importantly... I\u2019m thankful that I\u2019m here at all.\u201d She swallowed, and the sight of her eyes becoming wet with unshed tears made me want to tell everyone to leave so I could kiss her into forgetting everything she was feeling. Instead, I had to sit and pretend I wasn\u2019t the villain in Livvie\u2019s life. \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult year for me. Last year I spent Thanksgiving alone. I didn\u2019t know where I was going with my life or what I wanted out of it anymore. I was... heartbroken and miserable.\u201d A tear rolled down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cSophia....\u201d Claudia reached for Livvie across her boyfriend\u2019s chest. Livvie smiled.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mean to cry. It\u2019s just... this year, I have two of the greatest friends a girl could ask for, an apartment of my own\u2014in Spain! And I...\u201d She looked toward me, and damn it I could feel myself getting caught up in her emotions. \u201cI have you. I have a place to belong. I have a family that loves me. I\u2019m deeply grateful for that. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without it.\u201d She wiped at her cheek and shook herself. \u201cEww, sorry to get all emo. I just love you f**kers, that\u2019s all. Someone else go now.\u201d</p><p>I sat perfectly still in my seat, trying to process exactly what I was feeling. Livvie had included me on her list. She was thankful for me. She\u2019d found a place to belong with me. I felt exactly the same way, but I could never be so casual with expressing my emotions. Perhaps if we were alone, perhaps if we were in the dark, or imaginably naked, then I could tell her. But everyone was looking at me. Livvie was smiling sweetly, encouragingly. Claudia\u2019s stare was much more invasive and practically tried to intimidate me into speaking. Rubio simply waited. He was a patient sort. I cleared my throat and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s difficult to top that, but I\u2019ll try to offer something.\u201d I looked toward Livvie. \u201cI know we haven\u2019t known each other long. We\u2019ve only been seeing each other a month and a half.\u201d She smiled at me with narrowed eyes. \u201cHowever, I can honestly say... these have been the best six weeks I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019m thankful for the time we\u2019ve been given so far, and I hope that by next year\u2014\u201d I looked toward everyone else, \u201cI\u2019ll love all you f**kers as well.\u201d</p><p>Claudia and Rubio laughed. I returned my gaze to Livvie. She was staring at me with an expression I hadn\u2019t quite seen before. I liked it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thankful for good food, great friends, and love. May God bless this food and our friendships,\u201d Rubio said quickly and succinctly. I looked away from Livvie reluctantly and smiled. Claudia pulled Rubio toward her mouth roughly and kissed him much more passionately than was perhaps appropriate at the dinner table. Young love. That\u2019s what I wanted.</p><p>Claudia whispered to him in Spanish, \u201cI\u2019m thankful for you, my love.\u201d To the rest of the table, she said, \u201cI\u2019m thankful for my family, my friends, and all this food. Now please, let\u2019s eat it!\u201d Everyone laughed and agreed it was time to eat. I picked up my fork and dove into the turkey and stuffing. It was my first Thanksgiving and I immediately decided we would celebrate it every year.</p><p>Over dinner, I listened to Livvie discuss classes with her friends and the movies they were watching. They had been watching Stanley Kubrick\u2019s work and discussing it in class. Claudia and Rubio were fans, but Livvie felt a lot of his work lacked in its ability to communicate a clear message to its audience.</p><p>\u201cAll this talk about A Clockwork Orange, like it\u2019s the greatest movie ever or something,\u201d Livvie said around the turkey in her mouth. \u201cI\u2019d say two-thirds of the people who saw that movie didn\u2019t f**king get it. It\u2019s the emperor who has no clothes. Enough people called it brilliant that the idiots who didn\u2019t get it pretended to understand it just so they wouldn\u2019t be called idiots\u2014which makes them cowardly idiots. The movie could have been better. It could have delivered the message of the movie in a much clearer fashion and inspired some real dialogue about human nature, society, and psychology as a treatment. Instead, all anyone can remember is the rape scene. It\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to disagree,\u201d said Rubio. \u201cI think it\u2019s very clearly a movie about how society doesn\u2019t care about its own ruination. Society does not care about the disease\u2014it only wants to treat the symptoms. It does not care that Alex is violent or what happened to make him such a sociopath. It only wants him punished and \u2018rehabilitated\u2019. But there is no such thing as behavior control. It has to be a choice, a person has to choose to be a better person, and the only reason they choose to be better is if there is a reason. Alex was forcibly rehabilitated with aversion therapy, but once he went back out into the world and encountered all the violence that was still out there he became violent again. It\u2019s the nature of human beings. Kubrick did an incredible job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what the movie was about, Rubi. I get the point. My point is Kubrick was so obsessed with portraying the dystopian future that he neglected to push the message to a mainstream audience. Film students and artistic types are not typically prone to violence. The message is nothing new for them. The average movie-goer has to be kicked in the face with the truth or they don\u2019t f**king get it. Why do you think Mel Gibson\u2019s The Passion of the Christ did so well? It was like a hammer of guilt hitting people in the face.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck Mel Gibson!\u201d Claudia contributed. \u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s talented. He\u2019s a sanctimonious ass and the last person with any right to make a movie about Jesus.\u201d Rubio caressed Claudia\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cNo need to get worked up, Claudia. We\u2019re just talking.\u201d Rubio looked toward me. \u201cWhat do you think, James? Are you a Kubrick fan?\u201d</p><p>It was the first time anyone had called me James. It was such a simple name. It had no hidden meaning like dog or loyal disciple. It was just a name. A normal name for a normal person.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019ve never seen the movie and I don\u2019t really know who Kubrick is. We saw the new Harry Potter last week. I liked that one.\u201d I smiled and sipped some sangria. Everyone burst into laughter, and Livvie leaned over to give me another easy kiss.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sexy. Sometimes we get our nerd on without thinking about other people. Let\u2019s change the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. I like hearing what you think. I follow the conversation. Personally, I\u2019d like to think a person can change for the better. But I think Rubio is correct as well\u2014a person has to have a reason to change. They have to believe their situation will be made better by changing. Otherwise, that person is at a disadvantage. Violence is necessary if you live in a violent world.\u201d My heart was thumping hard.</p><p>Rubio\u2019s expression turned sour. \u201cI never said violence was necessary. I said there\u2019s too much of it and we need to find a way to treat it as a societal disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will never happen. Even flowers kill, Rubio. Human beings are far more flawed than flowers. We all do what we feel we must do. If that means killing... so be it. Survival\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the most important thing,\u201d Livvie finished. Her expression turned wistful. She set her fork down and stood. \u201cI\u2019m bored of this conversation. Let\u2019s play more Rock Band.\u201d She smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach her eyes. I knew that smile well.</p> <p>I regretted ever opening my stupid mouth.</p><p>We played Rock Band for a few more hours. I got much better at the guitar and actually enjoyed myself. I\u2019d studied a lot of things about America and Americans. I\u2019d learned about their pop culture, but I\u2019d never played a video game. It was very entertaining and I decided I\u2019d be buying a PlayStation the very next day.</p><p>Afterward, Claudia and Rubio decided to pack up more than their share of the leftovers and head home. They hugged me goodbye\u2014yes, both of them\u2014and I thought it was a little strange. I went with it, though. I could be a hugger... maybe. No, it was weird.</p><p>\u201cIf we were in The States, you could buy one on the cheap tomorrow. Too bad Spain doesn\u2019t celebrate Black Friday,\u201d Livvie said as she turned the faucet on and began washing dishes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d I asked and opened the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sacred tradition where thousands of hoarders camp outside stores and then bludgeon their neighbors for the best prices on PlayStations and iPads. I used to go with my mom.\u201d She shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll just order one on the computer. Unless you would find it romantic for me to bludgeon your neighbors?\u201d I smiled. Livvie laughed.</p><p>\u201cHmmm... maybe. Let\u2019s see who complains about the loud rock music.\u201d She shoved me with her shoulder. \u201cYou did good today. My friends are a little in love with you, I think.\u201d</p><p>I felt a strange pang in my chest.</p><p>\u201cI did my best. They seem nice. Claudia is a little too friendly, and I don\u2019t understand how Rubio does anything in those skinny pants, but they obviously love you. You\u2019re very lucky, Kitten.\u201d I paused. \u201cThere seems to be no shortage of people who love you.\u201d</p><p>Livvie was scouring a pot and didn\u2019t meet my eyes.</p><p>\u201cCaleb,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cI like James. Maybe you should call me that. Less chance you\u2019ll slip around your friends. I could call you Sophia. We could, I don\u2019t know... pretend. We could pretend to be normal... together. I\u2019m not wearing those skinny jeans, though.\u201d I tried to keep the conversation light. We\u2019d had such a great day and I didn\u2019t want to ruin it.</p><p>Livvie handed me the pot for rinsing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that. I think... it could be a good idea. It might sound weird, but when they changed my name I felt free to become someone else. Livvie was a sad girl. She cared too much about things that didn\u2019t matter and let people take advantage of her. Sophia is self-aware and she doesn\u2019t take shit from anyone.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t care for her words.</p><p>\u201cYou never took shit from anyone. You\u2019re the strongest person I know. Stronger than me.\u201d I swallowed. \u201cBut I know what you mean. Rafiq started calling me Caleb after he...\u201d I couldn\u2019t say the word rescued. Rafiq had never rescued me. \u201cI used to be called something far less flattering.\u201d</p><p>Livvie handed me another dish and moved closer to me. Our arms brushed whenever we moved.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>I mentioned the name in Arabic.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound bad. What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p><p>I had to laugh to keep from feeling everything else.</p><p>\u201cIt means dog. My name was dog.\u201d I took the dish Livvie had been washing from her hands and rinsed it before putting it in the dishwasher. I didn\u2019t want to acknowledge her shock.</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone...? The world is f**king disgusting.\u201d She stopped washing dishes and put her arms around my waist from behind. \u201cI think you\u2019re a miracle, James. I think you deserve to be happy. We both do.\u201d</p><p>I kept washing dishes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re right, Sophia. I know you deserve to be happy. I know you deserve someone... better, but I\u2019m selfish. I want you. I want you bad enough to try and be someone better.</p><p>\u201cThat said, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if you decided it was too little, too late. I won\u2019t be here a second longer than you want me to be. I promise.\u201d I didn\u2019t mention the part where I\u2019d lose my f**king mind. I wasn\u2019t sure what I would do if Livvie didn\u2019t want to be with me. I didn\u2019t necessarily have anything to go back to except killing and smuggling. Was I a better person? Maybe not. I was only better when I was living for her. I felt like a time-bomb.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m selfish too, because I want you just as much. I know it\u2019s been odd between us. How could it not be? We don\u2019t know each other in this world, but I\u2019ve seen you at your worst, and what I know is that you\u2019d do anything to protect me. That\u2019s enough for now. The rest will come.\u201d She kissed my back and came back to the sink to continue washing.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to me, you know? Not much that\u2019s good anyway. What else do you expect to learn?\u201d I knew my expression wasn\u2019t doing much to hide my frustration.</p><p>\u201cI know we both like Harry Potter. I know you have to get drunk to meet my friends because you\u2019re nervous. You pay attention when you\u2019re not speaking and whenever you do, you add something to the conversation. You like to read as much as I do. I know I\u2019ll never catch you in a pair of skinny jeans.\u201d She laughed and bumped me with her hip. \u201cI know you\u2019re a quick learner. You killed it on guitar in just a few hours. You help with dishes. I\u2019m learning a lot of things about you, James. I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the part where I\u2019d grab you and f**k you in front of the sink, but I have to be honest\u2014I am stuffed! I can\u2019t wait to put on a pair of lounging pants and take a nap.\u201d</p><p>We laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the turkey. It makes everyone sleepy. Tomorrow we get to eat leftovers all day. So good.\u201d She looked at me sidelong and made her lips curve into a mischievous smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to ask you to f**k me before I feed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me?\u201d I asked through a laugh. She\u2019d never have to ask me.</p><p>\u201cBeg you?\u201d she purred.</p><p>My c**k stirred.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you do know me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cDo you have plans for Christmas?\u201d I asked Livvie. She handed me a cup of coffee and took a sip of her own. The temperature had been dropping steadily, but the streets were still crowded with would-be shoppers. Livvie and I seemed a bit at odds with our surroundings due to our lack of shopping bags. She smiled at me brightly.</p><p>\u201cYes. I plan to spend the better part of the day super glued to your body.\u201d She ran one of her mitten-clad hands down the front of my coat. I laughed.</p><p>\u201cWell then, I\u2019m looking forward to it already. I\u2019ll be sure to giftwrap.\u201d I tugged her close and kissed her more passionately than was appropriate in public. Her lips were cold but the inside of her mouth was warm and tasted faintly of coffee and sugar. \u201cBut I meant with other people. Are there people you have to see?\u201d</p><p>A strange expression marred her features.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just us. Claudia and Rubio are each spending time with their families. They\u2019re only going to see each other for part of the day because Rubio\u2019s family lives in Madrid. Claudia invited us to go over to her mom\u2019s house, but I didn\u2019t figure you\u2019d want to go. Honestly, I don\u2019t feel like going either. We might all get together on Christmas Eve, though. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>I took her hand and led her into the flow of bodies, making our way toward the next block of shopping. It had been her idea to go shopping, but Livvie had yet to purchase a single thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never celebrated Christmas. I haven\u2019t celebrated a lot of holidays, actually. I thought since I liked your Thanksgiving, I might... branch out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Livvie said excitedly. \u201cThat\u2019s great, Sexy! Now I feel bad for not getting you a gift yet. We\u2019ll have to do it up right if it\u2019s your first Christmas. I figured you didn\u2019t celebrate it, so I didn\u2019t want to push the subject. If you weren\u2019t into it, no reason for me to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>I noticed the undercurrent of sadness in Livvie\u2019s voice and suspected it had something to do with her lack of family. I was oddly tempted to ask about them. I didn\u2019t much care for her mother, but I knew she had siblings and I didn\u2019t know if she spoke to them or not. Then again, her having a relationship with her family didn\u2019t necessarily bode well for me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already given me more than I\u2019ve ever had. You wouldn\u2019t want to spoil me, would you?\u201d I flashed my most suggestive grin. Livvie looked at me sidelong.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of spoiling you. You\u2019re a big enough pain as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought I was gentle.\u201d I braced for the punch I knew I was coming. She can be such a violent little thing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be gross!\u201d she admonished. It was difficult to take her seriously while she was laughing. \u201cI wonder if there\u2019s still time to get a tree. Usually people put them up after Thanksgiving, but there has to be a lot somewhere that sells them. I\u2019ll ask Claudia. She usually knows where to go for stuff. I mean, I\u2019ve learned a bunch since I\u2019ve been here, but like, I\u2019m not from here so I need help sometimes. Ha! This one time I got lost...\u201d Livvie seemed completely engrossed in the art of one-sided conversation. I admit it, I tuned out a little. I thought I had learned the various sides to Livvie while in Mexico, but I was beginning to feel as though I\u2019d only scratched the surface. I rather liked the idea of new discoveries\u2014even when the discovery was that Livvie could be as much of a rambler as Claudia.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of something else entirely,\u201d I broke in. Livvie halted, much to the chagrin of the pedestrians behind us trying to get upstream with the other salmon.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d She looked somewhat perturbed and I wasn\u2019t sure why.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that face for?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and pasted on a saccharine smile.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Nothing. It\u2019s just... what were you going to say?\u201d She smiled a bit more genuinely.</p><p>\u201cYou were thinking something. Just tell me what it was.\u201d I took a sip from my coffee. I\u2019d never been much of a coffee drinker, but it was slowly growing on me. Livvie usually had some with her breakfast. She blew out a breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I thought you might say something about... visiting friends of yours. Or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said. \u201cYou think I have friends? Friends I would want to spend holidays with, no less.\u201d I had to laugh out loud at the ridiculousness of it.</p> <p>\u201cWell, not friends, but... you know people.\u201d She lifted an ebony brow and tilted her head to the side with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve left all that behind, Livvie. You know that,\u201d I said evenly.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to call me Sophia from now on.\u201d She looked down at her shoe and kicked at an imaginary rock.</p><p>\u201cThat question wasn\u2019t exactly meant for James, was it?\u201d I kept my tone pleasant.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry, James.\u201d She stepped closer and playfully kicked at the tip of my shoe with her sneakered foot. \u201cYou forgive me? Do I still get my surprise?\u201d</p><p>I chuckled because I had no other recourse. I had come to understand our relationship would be riddled with moments where the past sucked all the joy out of the present. My only hope was that with enough time, Livvie and I would build memories capable of trumping our beginning.</p><p>\u201cYes, on both counts. I\u2019m much too excited about your gift to let you ruin it for us.\u201d</p><p>Livvie looked up at me with a glare that quickly became a smile.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for both of us, eh? It\u2019s not lingerie, is it? Because that\u2019s more for you than it is me. I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t wear it, but I\u2019m going to insist I get other presents too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous.\u201d I started walking and Livvie quickly fell into step next to me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sexy,\u201d she whispered as she dragged my arm across her shoulders. It made for awkward walking, but I didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. It\u2019s a curse. Anyway, I was hoping you could take the week of Christmas off from work. I want to take you to Paris.\u201d I pulled her close and placed a kiss on the top of her head. The pink fuzz from her hat stuck to my lips. I lifted my arm from her shoulders and picked it off.</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I observed an older man watching me and Livvie. I wouldn\u2019t have noticed him, except he was alone and without shopping bags\u2014or anything in his hands at all. He caught me watching and tilted his head in greeting before turning to look at a window display. I warily pulled my attention back toward Livvie. The old man wasn\u2019t anyone I knew and he hardly looked dangerous. I had left the world of intrigue behind. Old men were only old men.</p><p>\u201cParis? You are so damn sweet when you want to be. I\u2019ve already been to Paris though\u2014last year.\u201d She bounced as she walked happily. \u201cI can probably get the time off work, though. It\u2019s late for requests, but Giovanni is pretty good about that kind of thing. I\u2019m a student, so I don\u2019t think he expects too much out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiovanni\u2014is he handsome?\u201d She seemed surrounded by men sometimes: Reed, Marco, Rubio, and now Giovanni.</p><p>\u201cOnly in that tall, dark, and foreign kind of way. Not my cuppa, really.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d I swatted her ass as we walked. People were beginning to stare at us while we walked. I thought of the old man and started to feel better about him watching us. It was more than possible that Livvie and I were simply drawing attention to ourselves. Some people even seemed to enjoy our antics. \u201cAnyway, I know you\u2019ve been to Paris before. I read about it in that email you sent to your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d Livvie said.</p><p>\u201cI am reminding you. It didn\u2019t seem like you had very much fun while you were in Paris. You were lonely and some bastard stole your wallet. I thought we could go together and make new memories. I\u2019ve never really played the tourist before. It could be fun. What do you think?\u201d I took several swallows of coffee, pleased it had sufficiently cooled.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s eyes told me all I needed to know. They were bright and excited.</p><p>\u201cI think... you\u2019re amazing, James. No one makes me as happy as you do.\u201d She hooked her arm in mine and rested her head on my arm. She let out a little sigh of contentment that warmed me better than the coffee.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled then. I\u2019ll make all the arrangements. We\u2019ll stay at the best hotel and eat at the best restaurants. We\u2019ll see all the best things and have the best sex.\u201d I was shockingly giddy. I\u2019d never been the type before. I tried not to overthink it despite the niggling worry always running in the background of my thoughts that warned me how dangerous happiness could be.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be with the best boyfriend ever!\u201d Livvie did a little hop and spilled coffee onto her mitt and sleeve. \u201cAh, boo! My glove is all wet. Oh well, at least it didn\u2019t burn my hand.\u201d</p><p>We stopped at the next trash bin and tossed the coffee. Livvie stood still as I wiped her off as best I could with my gloved hands. Once finished, I pulled off my gloves and put them in the garbage along with hers.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve called me your boyfriend,\u201d I mentioned softly. \u201cWe\u2019ll buy new gloves in that shop over there.\u201d I pointed. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to find some outfits for Paris. I rather like the idea of you in lingerie.\u201d I bent down and kissed her lips. Livvie took it upon herself to deepen our affections by cupping the back of my head and pressing her lips once, twice, three times against my own until I opened my mouth to her tongue.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s kisses had gone from shy to ravenous during the course of our relationship. I was surprised to discover my growing taste for Livvie\u2019s forwardness. She\u2019d had such a demure nature in the past and I\u2019d loved to play The Wolf to her Little Red Riding Hood. I hoisted her up into my arms and she wrapped her legs around my waist. A mother hurried her children past and called us disgusting. I grabbed Livvie\u2019s ass and squeezed before I pulled away from the kiss and set her down. I tugged my coat down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d only kiss my boyfriend like that,\u201d she panted and giggled. I gave her one more kiss and managed to keep it chaste.</p><p>\u201cI accept. These lips officially belong to me, and mine they will remain. If I find them anywhere near another man, he better be kin to you.\u201d I was entirely serious.</p><p>\u201cYou manage to say the most romantic things in the creepiest way possible. If I didn\u2019t know you, I\u2019d be scared of you,\u201d she said with a smile and a wink.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m still scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d she whispered. I felt a little pinch in my chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only acceptable from you.\u201d I tilted my chin toward the shop I had mentioned earlier. \u201cShould we do some actual shopping on this shopping trip or are we only out to pervert young children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we do both?\u201d she said with such seriousness I had to struggle to keep a straight face. Did other couples banter as much? I didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>We returned to Livvie\u2019s apartment with as many bags as we could manage. There had been some trepidation on Livvie\u2019s part over allowing me to pay for our purchases, but I was quick to point out it was my right as her boyfriend to shower her with gifts. I\u2019d missed the opportunity to court her properly, I had said, and it was only fair to allow me to make up for it. I felt fifteen hundred Euros was a sufficient overture for one day.</p><p>She had purchased bags, shoes, cocktail dresses, new gloves, and enough lingerie to keep me ripping them off of her for a few weeks. There was a particular pair of lacy thong panties I couldn\u2019t wait to chew my way through. Oh, and a red negligee without breast cups that was of particular interest to me. I had looked for a red cape to go with it but came up empty. The urge to hunt down Little Red would have to wait.</p> <p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Livvie asked. I could barely hear her as I set the bags in the living room. Livvie had made her way toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I called out, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think you have anything in your cupboards worth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get in here and eat my pu**y!\u201d Livvie interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYou little bitch,\u201d I muttered under my breath and laughed. She got me. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for that, Pet!\u201d I yelled as I made my way toward the bedroom while divesting myself of my gloves, coat, and shirt. \u201cI\u2019m going to wash your filthy mouth out with cock.\u201d I heard the shower running in the adjoining bathroom. I kicked off my shoes, pulled on my belt, and slid the rest of my clothing down my legs and off.</p><p>\u201cOoooh, I\u2019m soooo scared,\u201d Livvie taunted. She was already in the shower and soaping the parts I fully intended to put in my mouth. Ingredients for Mind-numbingly Sexy: 1 Livvie, Just add water.</p> <p>I wasted no time once I stepped into the shower. I grabbed Livvie by her wet hair and tugged her back toward the shower wall. The water was hot and it stung my cold skin. I liked the burn.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think you are, ordering me around? Didn\u2019t I teach you better?\u201d I licked a hot, wet trail up the side of her neck while I slid my c**k against her belly.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t stick,\u201d she panted hotly near my ear. \u201cTeach me again.\u201d</p><p>Her words made my pulse race. There had been moments between us in Mexico when I had witnessed glimpses of Livvie\u2019s brazenness. However, that\u2019s exactly what they had been\u2014glimpses. The Livvie I had been dating was worlds beyond the Livvie I had held captive. After a lifetime of being subjugated or, conversely, crushing the disobedience out of others, it shocked me how much I enjoyed the back and forth.</p><p>Yet, for all that Livvie seemed determined to push my buttons, her actions told a different tale. I was beginning to see that her words were less about putting me in my place and more about forcing me into a course of action that would lead me to behave... ungentlemanly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that mouth of yours.\u201d I kissed her softly and I could almost sense her annoyance after expecting something rougher. \u201cIt gets you into trouble every time.\u201d Another soft kiss, and another.</p> <p>Livvie made frustrated little sounds. She tried to lean in and deepen the kiss but I selected that moment to remind her of my fist firmly embedded in her hair. She winced.</p><p>\u201cDid that hurt?\u201d I whispered against her lips and left another weak kiss. She made another frustrated sound and I felt the warmth of her hands on my hips urging me toward her. I lifted my free hand and traced her open lips with my fingertip. \u201cI asked you a question, Pet. I expect you to answer it.\u201d</p><p>Livvie\u2019s fingers pressed deeper into my hips. Her eyes were gently closed. For whatever reason, she could never seem to handle the directness of my gaze. I allowed it only because I enjoyed the way she abandoned her self-control whenever she couldn\u2019t see. I thought of all the times I had blindfolded her to achieve the same results. Her tongue licked suggestively at my finger as it circled her lips. She had never been so blatant in Mexico, not without first being reminded of her need to survive. Things were different. She wanted me. She wanted to give herself to me. I felt unworthy to accept such a gift, but it didn\u2019t stop me from clutching it fiercely to my chest.</p><p>Long seconds passed without an answer.</p><p>\u201cDo what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d Her voice was thick with lust.</p><p>I pulled her down by her hair slowly but with the force of my grip behind it. She went down easily, with only a small startled yelp to suggest her surprise.</p><p>\u201cI said I was going to wash your mouth out with cock.\u201d I wrapped my hand around my hardened flesh and traced her lips with the tip. \u201cOpen up.\u201d</p><p>I licked my own lips as the lust thrumming though my body grew in intensity. I watched Livvie\u2019s lips purse defiantly. She placed soft kisses on the head of my c**k and slowly worked down the shaft. It was nice to look at, but it offered no satisfaction. If she wanted a lesson, I was obliged to give her one. I tapped her face with my erection and she smiled wickedly. I gripped her hair rough and she gasped, allowing me to put myself inside.</p> <p>Warmth. I was surrounded by it. It was a warmth that vibrated with every surprised murmur Livvie tried to make. I thrust into it in degrees. I watched as Livvie\u2019s lips stretched over my flesh and inches of me disappeared into the heat of her willing mouth. I delved deeper, until teeth scraped the sides of my c**k and Livvie\u2019s throat contracted around me. Yes! Right there.</p><p>I know there are a lot of women who don\u2019t like sucking dick, but god, do I love the ones who do. For a moment I felt adrift in the sensation of Livvie\u2019s warm, wet, and tight mouth wrapped around my cock. The sensation was almost painful to pull away from. Every instinct in my body was insisting that I push harder, deeper, keep f**king\u2014but I didn\u2019t. I pulled out quickly. Livvie was gasping. Loudly. A long trail of spit connected her flushed lips to the tip of my cock.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d I asked. Livvie nodded and I pushed forward again. She sucked and my thighs started to quake.</p><p>There was only so much I could do to keep myself from getting too rough. I pulled my hands away from Livvie and my c**k and placed them on the wall in front of me. I felt more than heard Livvie\u2019s grateful sigh. I was rewarded further when her hands roamed from my hips to my ass and she pulled me deeper into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d I let myself stay. I wanted to stay. It felt so f**king good. Livvie\u2019s gag reflex kicked in and I pulled away quickly. More gasping. More spit.</p><p>Livvie opened her eyes as she caught her breath. There were tears in her eyes, but I knew she wasn\u2019t crying. She was wanton. Her head came forward and rubbed against my thigh in supplication. It\u2019s difficult to process all the things I feel when Livvie expresses herself this way. If I were a wolf, I would howl. If I were a lion, I would roar. If we lived in the jungle, I would bring her a wolf and a lion to feast on.</p><p>I reached down and stroked her wet head. She tilted her face into my hand, eyes pleading, her mouth leaving kisses in my palm. I had a thought: Does she love me, or does she love all the things I do to her?</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want,\u201d I said. It wasn\u2019t a question. Livvie\u2019s eyes had not left mine and it was easy to see the sudden vulnerability in them.</p><p>\u201cTo make you happy,\u201d she said. She seemed unsure, though I couldn\u2019t guess why.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d I said. I knew I could push her further, but I wasn\u2019t up for the repercussions. I pulled her up onto her shaky legs and finally gave her the proper kiss she\u2019d been wanting. As I broke the kiss I said, \u201cTurn around and spread your legs.\u201d</p><p>She did as I asked while I rearranged my larger frame in the small space. Livvie\u2019s shower was really only meant for one person. I managed to sit on the shower floor with her thighs spread over my face. I kissed her clit once before I slid my tongue inside her and made her come.</p><p>As she came apart above me, I guided her down my body until she finally sat on my cock. The void in me shuddered. It was enough, I told myself. Everything Livvie and I had was enough. I paid no attention to the void when it sang: For now.</p><p>Livvie and I kissed. We f**ked.</p><p>The void was silent.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>Paris is a lovely city, even in the winter. It\u2019s a delightful mix of the old and new. It\u2019s one of the only places you can see a five-hundred-year-old building with a Starbucks inside. However, as the world\u2019s most popular city to visit, the congestion of tourists does detract some from the experience. At least, it did for me. I don\u2019t like people as a general rule, and I like them even less when they\u2019re pressed against me in a crowded space.</p><p>It was our second day in Paris and Livvie had insisted that we visit the Louvre Museum. Thanks to some generous tipping, we managed to circumvent the line to see the Mona Lisa but not the throngs of people already inside.</p><p>\u201cI wish we could see it better. All that glass makes it hard to see the details. Still pretty cool, though. What do you think?\u201d Livvie looked up and craned her neck back to see me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I scowled (it\u2019s something I do a lot apparently).</p><p>\u201cI think this ass**le behind me should take his blurry photo and stop bumping into me before I decide to do some performance art with his face.\u201d</p><p>Livvie\u2019s smile turned into a judgmental pout.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crowded, Sexy. Guy can\u2019t help it. At least we\u2019re up front. Last time I was here, I was sort of in the middle and I couldn\u2019t see over the people. I kept getting pushed from every side. I finally just turned around and left.\u201d She leaned against the small barricade to get a closer look.</p> <p>\u201cWell, that idea has promise.\u201d I glared at the man behind me while Livvie wasn\u2019t looking. He held up his hand and dipped his head as he apologized. He was so nice about it I actually felt bad for being angry. This was the effect of being with Livvie. The old me would have said, Yes, you\u2019re sorry. Now f**k off.</p><p>There was a swat to my chest and I turned back toward Livvie, who had apparently caught me.</p><p>\u201cBe. Nice. I don\u2019t want to be carted off to Les Mis jail in my fancy clothes. The lesbians will eat me alive.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cTwo puns in one joke,\u201d I said with a blas\u00e9 tone. \u201cBit of an overreach. Also, it\u2019s pronounced lay, not les.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, it was funny.\u201d Livvie blushed and cuddled into my chest. I finally had to chuckle. It took me a long time to realize how adept Livvie is at managing my moods. She\u2019d made me forget I was angry and she\u2019d done it without my knowing.</p> <p>I took her hand and navigated our way through the crowd so that we might visit other, less inhabited, exhibits. Like most people, I don\u2019t know art, but I know what I like. For my part, I appreciated some of the \u201cless superior\u201d pieces more than the Mona Lisa. I didn\u2019t find her smile that mysterious, to be honest. I enjoyed Guiseppe Arcimboldo\u2019s Autumn much more. The artist incorporated fruits and vegetables to create a portrait of a man. It made me think about life and death. All things ripen and die. I thought about being twenty-seven. Knowing one\u2019s age had consequences.</p><p>After the Louvre, we ate lunch at a small caf\u00e9 within walking distance of the museum. The hotel provided a courtesy chauffeur, but Livvie insisted it was cheating to utilize such services. Walking was certainly more Parisian and therefore necessary to our tourist experience. I was no stranger to walking, but I shared no such thoughts on the subject.</p><p>By the time we reached the Eiffel Tower by way of the Arc de Triomphe, I was ready to throw Livvie into a taxi. But of course, we had to reach the top of the tower. Livvie\u2014being the beautiful, young, and spry girl she is\u2014was still full of energy and smiles. It was just her luck (and my misfortune) that her joy seemed to be infectious and kept me from voicing my growing disdain for tourist traps.</p><p>\u201cAwesome! The elevator is working this time,\u201d Livvie said.</p><p>I pulled her away from the ticket window before the line turned on her.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Kitten, but I\u2019m not getting in that thing. What if it breaks down? Do you really want to be jammed into a tiny box with dozens of strangers? The idea doesn\u2019t appeal to me.\u201d I don\u2019t like cramped spaces of the non tight, wet, and warm variety.</p> <p>\u201cAww, are you claustrophobic?\u201d Livvie made a mockingly sad face.</p><p>\u201cWatch yourself, Kitten. I\u2019d hate to have to spank your ass in front of all these people.\u201d I tugged her close and delivered a firm slap to her behind. Someone giggled as they walked past. Livvie laughed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan on doing a lot more later,\u201d I whispered in her ear and bit it for good measure. She squealed and pulled away. \u201cI just hope I have the energy after I climb all these damn stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? The stairs?\u201d At last it was Livvie who was whining about doing things the hard way.</p><p>\u201cYes. The stairs. And it serves you right for having me walk all over Paris. I hope your thighs get nice and sore on the way up. It\u2019ll make things that much more interesting when I make you squat over me later.\u201d She scrunched up her nose and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mean,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWould you have me any other way?\u201d I received little more than a suspicious glare. \u201cDo you have anything in your coat pocket?\u201d</p> <p>She inspected her coat.</p><p>\u201cNo. All I brought was my passport, but you took it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019d hate for you to get pick-pocketed again.\u201d I kissed her forehead and directed our steps toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you get pick-pocketed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cute, Pet.\u201d I half hoped someone would try. I\u2019d been growing increasingly desperate for confrontation. It had been months since I\u2019d had some sort of altercation. I was surprised to discover how much I missed it. I pushed the thought aside for perhaps the hundredth time.</p><p>As others crammed themselves into the lift, Livvie and I started up the stairs. I regretted my decision to wear slacks and dress shoes almost immediately. There was a thin layer of frost on the stairs, and as we rose they only became more slippery.</p><p>\u201cTry doing it in velvet Mary Janes. I swear, if I die, I\u2019m going to be so mad at you.\u201d Livvie huffed up another set of stairs.</p><p>\u201cAs if I would let anything happen to you. Would be a bloody waste of redemption, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d I was sure I was suffering far more. In addition to climbing, I was also pushing Livvie along to help her up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cBloody? I\u2019ve never heard you say that before.\u201d She laughed. \u201cAnd while I appreciate the chivalry, I\u2019m pretty sure the redemption is for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a common expression. Also\u2014\u201d I reached out to steady Livvie after she slipped on one of the stairs. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay. But seriously, James, can we please take the elevator once we get to the first platform? It\u2019s over a thousand stairs to the very top.\u201d She wrapped her arms around my neck as she caught her breath. Her forehead was a little sweaty and her cheeks were red from the cold. \u201cPlease?\u201d She placed soft kisses on my cold cheek. \u201cI\u2019m begging.\u201d I laughed as I took in the sight of her mischievous smile and raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d I mumbled. I really did not want to get into that damn lift. I ride them very seldom and only while alone.</p><p>The first time I rode a lift was a few years after coming to live with Rafiq. He had business in Karachi and took me along. I must have been about sixteen or so. Rafiq didn\u2019t warn me the damnable contraption would move, and when I got out of the moving box of death I vomited in the lobby. Not only did I not get to accompany him into his meeting, but he made me ride the lift up and down the entire time he was gone. It took me about seven or eight trips and a threat of bodily harm from a security guard before I stopped yelling as the lift traveled between floors.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best boyfriend ever. You let me ride in elevators and everything.\u201d Livvie laughed somewhat maniacally.</p><p>\u201cLaugh it up, Pet. It\u2019ll be hilarious when we get stuck and the smell of unclean tourist is invading your nostrils.\u201d Livvie only laughed harder as we continued our trek up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sexy. I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d She turned and gave me a wink. Livvie was slowly picking up on some of my mannerisms and though I wouldn\u2019t admit it, it always made me feel... content.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll be the one trying to pry the doors open with my bare hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod! I think tomorrow I\u2019m going to wear slippers all day. My feet are killing me.\u201d Livvie hobbled toward the desk chair in our room and immediately reached for the strap holding her shoe in place.</p><p>\u201cIt was your idea to walk everywhere.\u201d I laughed as I poked fun at her. \u201cNow you\u2019ll have blisters to commemorate our trip to Paris. You can tell Claudia all about the Parisian band-aids I purchased for you in the lobby.\u201d I mockingly switched to her vernacular. \u201cShe\u2019ll be so jealous.\u201d I winced as I kicked off my shoes. Livvie glared.</p><p>\u201cI just hope she\u2019ll be able to hear me over the sound of her own laughter when I tell her how you yelled at that teenager and his girlfriend on the elevator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were jumping up and down! Shaking the whole thing. They\u2019re lucky all I did was yell.\u201d I pulled up a chair in front of Livvie and reached for one of her feet. I was tempted to tip her over to stop her belly laughing.</p><p>Her laughter turned into a long keening moan as I rubbed her foot with both hands.</p><p>\u201cOh! I will love you forever if you don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>A strange pang rippled through my chest. I ignored it. If Livvie loved me, she wasn\u2019t in any rush to let me know and I hadn\u2019t brought up my feelings for her since Thanksgiving. We were taking things slow and getting to know each other. We\u2019d discussed it at length. Regardless, the words stirred me. The void yawned as if waking from a nap.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t chivalry,\u201d I countered. \u201cI fully expect you to return the favor when I\u2019m done. Also, I think a good back massage is in order. My muscles are tense after having been locked up tight during our gradual and torturous ascension.\u201d</p><p>Livvie smiled with her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you say things.\u201d</p><p>She was thoroughly lost to my ministrations. Her lack of tactful word choice didn\u2019t even occur to her, and I suppose it made it that much easier to forgive. I knew that though she might not love me, she cared for me a great deal and would never hurt me on purpose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Livvie continued, \u201cI get a foot massage and the chance to rub you down? I really am the luckiest girl in Paris. Do you even notice how women look at you, Caleb? James. Whatever. You\u2019re just... you\u2019re f**king beautiful is what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandsome. I\u2019m handsome. And no, I don\u2019t notice. I\u2019m too busy looking at you. Or using my carefully cultivated death-stare to threaten any man stupid enough to set eyes on you.\u201d I smiled at the contented sigh this elicited from Livvie.</p><p>\u201cYes, you definitely have a way with words. You should be a writer; you\u2019re certainly screwed up enough for the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the writer?\u201d</p> <p>Livvie opened her eyes and sat up. There was a brief moment when I perceived she was nervous, but it quickly faded. She was all flirty smiles when she spoke.</p><p>\u201cNot really. It\u2019s not like anyone reads my stuff. It\u2019s all just on my laptop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true. Claudia has apparently read your work. I don\u2019t know if you know this, but I read. I could take a look if you\u2019d like. Claudia seems to think it isn\u2019t to be missed.\u201d</p><p>Livvie slowly removed her foot from my lap and straddled me in my seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You can read? I\u2019m shocked!\u201d She kissed me on the lips briefly.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to distract me,\u201d I said, unimpressed.</p><p>\u201cI am not. I\u2019m just eager to give you that massage.\u201d She rubbed my shoulders and I groaned. \u201cWill there be some sort of oil involved? The idea of sliding my hands all over you is really appealing. I could take off all my clothes if you\u2019d like.\u201d She pressed her thumbs into my neck and ground her hips against me. I felt her breath as she whispered in my ear. \u201cI\u2019ll even do the front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forget about this,\u201d I said half-heartedly.</p><p>In all honesty, the only thing I was truly thinking about was slippery Livvie and how easy it would be to slide into her. Some days it seemed as though the only time I felt firmly connected to her was when I was literally inside her. I could imagine myself as her Prince Charming. I was not a monster. I was worthy. My heart was not an empty husk\u2014it was engorged with blood and feeling.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Livvie whispered against my mouth. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go, Sexy?\u201d She was worried. I could hear it in her voice and memories threatened to invade. I hated how familiar her worry was to me. I made eye contact with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, exactly where I want to be.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d She kissed me slowly, passionately, and inherent within the press of lips there was an undercurrent of gratitude. It was difficult for me to accept given our circumstances, but the void consumed it nonetheless. It had the gall to demand more.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re mine, Livvie.\u201d The past intruded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Caleb.\u201d Her lips traveled across the side of my face and down my neck. Our attentions had gone from slow and passionate to fast and hungry. She sucked the flesh of my neck into her mouth, marking me. I already bore her scratches on my back. \u201cAnd you\u2019re mine. Only mine.\u201d</p><p>I hated where Livvie and I had started. I loathed that I had ever wounded such an incredible person. However, the past was not without its comforts. It had been a time when I labored under the illusion of purpose and strength. Livvie unabashedly proclaimed her love for me and I held all the power. For all the horrors of my past, I took comfort in my understanding of the darkness in my soul. Livvie had let in the light and it blinded me. I groped for purchase within my new world. With Livvie at my side, I clung to her, powerless and oft times petrified. Moments like the one in which we found ourselves were sweet succor.</p><p>I undid the three tiny pearl buttons at Livvie\u2019s nape with care before I forcefully pulled the zipper along the back. She made a startled but eager sound against my neck. I spread the fabric and let it slide down her arms, pinning them to her sides. Livvie whimpered as she writhed against me. Her hips made little thrusts as she chased her pleasure.</p><p>I put my mouth against her collarbone and sucked. I had left my own marks on Livvie: I\u2019d scraped my teeth along her hipbones. I\u2019d left my handprint on her ass. There was a bruise near her nipple where I\u2019d pinched her while she came. Her pu**y still had my come in it from the night before. What more did I need? What more did I deserve?</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel so good,\u201d Livvie panted. Her knees dug into my hips and her hands tugged at my shirt in search of more contact. The long line of her throat, naked shoulders, and exposed cle**age were offered up to my mouth freely while Livvie\u2019s head was tossed back. I let my lips brush against the purple mark I\u2019d left on her collarbone.</p> <p>\u201cOnly good? I must not be trying near hard enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm... try harder then.\u201d</p><p>I gripped her hips and ground her down hard against my erection. She pulled her arms free of her dress and wrapped them around my neck as she attempted to ride me. I canted her hips back and held her in place, feasting on her hungry little sounds.</p><p>\u201cAgain with that mouth. So saucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb,\u201d she purred. \u201cStop f**king around. You know what I want.\u201d</p><p>I grinned.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Inside me.\u201d</p><p>My c**k gave a little leap of excitement.</p><p>\u201cYou want to feel me?\u201d I put my hand beneath her dress, skimming the sensitive flesh of her thighs where her stockings squeezed. I decided I would buy her garters, like a French girl would wear. I continued my exploration, lifting the trim of her lacy panties so I could graze her with my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cYes... please.\u201d I heard Livvie swallow. Her hips tried to guide my fingers. My finger pulled the scrap of fabric forward. Her panties were damp where her pu**y had rested.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think you deserve it? Am I the sort of man who appreciates a saucy mouth?\u201d A memory: \u201cI like your saucy little mouth. I don't want to hurt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She pressed forward, cunt seeking. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>I touched her with the back of my fingers.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d I whispered and took her mouth, both of them, at the same time. She shuddered. I pumped my fingers into her heat as I collected her moans in my mouth. Livvie\u2019s pleasure was short lived. I withdrew my fingers slowly.</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean you get to speak to me however you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>\u201cCaleb.\u201d I pressed my wet fingers to her mouth. She pulled back. She was shocked and a little disgusted. She\u2019d licked her lip before she thought about it.</p><p>I brought her mouth to mine and licked her lips until she opened to me again. I liked the taste of pu**y in her mouth. It drove me wild with lust. A familiar part of me enjoyed her horror and always would. I felt like myself. I felt powerful.</p><p>I pulled away from the kiss. I stood, carried Livvie toward the bed, and tossed her on it.</p><p>\u201cTurn around and lie flat on the bed. I want to f**k you.\u201d Livvie sat, chest heaving, with her rumpled dress pooled around her waist. She reached for it, to take it off I assumed. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you to take it off,\u201d I snapped. Fear ignited behind her eyes and quickly burned down to an ember.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb,\u201d she whispered. Slowly, she turned and crawled toward the top of the bed. Once there, she lifted her dress to uncover her panties. The lacy fabric didn\u2019t cover her completely\u2014it left the bottom of her cheeks exposed and framed her ass. She made eye contact, caught me looking. She smiled coyly and finally lay down on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYes, I like what I see. I would have thought that much was obvious by now.\u201d I palmed her ass with a loud smack. \u201cNo need to be smug.\u201d I reached for her panties and slid them down her legs. I stood up to remove my belt.</p><p>Livvie visibly tensed. Her hands fisted in the comforter. To her credit, she didn\u2019t move. She didn\u2019t turn to see what I was doing. She didn\u2019t ask what I was up to. She simply waited. Patient. Trusting. Submissive.</p><p>I was tempted to swat her with my belt. I pictured her gasping in surprise, her cheeks flexing and red. I imagined the way she would struggle to remain still. I visualized the raised welts my belt would leave. Another mark. Another brand. Another claim. My fist tightened on my belt. I let it go. I didn\u2019t want to remind her any more than I already had.</p><p>I undressed slowly. I took the time to hang my pants in the wardrobe. I set my other clothes aside to be sent in for washing. I watched Livvie the entire time, letting my lust build with every minute she patiently waited for me to return.</p><p>Or issue a command.</p><p>I riffled through the luggage to retrieve a bottle of oil I\u2019d brought. I really did want that damn massage, but it could wait. I had different plans. I let my mouth nip and lick the backs of Livvie\u2019s legs on my way back up to her sexy ass. She trembled. A small squeak escaped her lips when I drizzled the oil in her cleft.</p><p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d I asked. I didn\u2019t need an answer to my question. I simply enjoyed listening to her answer. She was slow to acquiesce. It wasn\u2019t until I rubbed the oil into her crack with the head of my c**k that her lips opened.</p><p>\u201cY-y-yes?\u201d I rubbed harder. \u201cOh... wait... please...\u201d Livvie propped herself up on her elbows and tried to drag her body higher up on the bed. She couldn\u2019t. She was pinned beneath me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShhh.\u201d I held her elbows and urged her back down. \u201cDo you trust me, Kitten?\u201d I unfastened her bra and massaged the red marks it had left. She liked that. \u201cDo you believe me when I tell you I wouldn\u2019t hurt you? Not like before. Not ever.\u201d My thumbs pressed on either side of her spine between her shoulders and pressed forward to the base of her neck. Livvie sighed.</p><p>\u201cYes. I trust you.\u201d Her mouth went slack and her muscles loosened beneath my hands. \u201cJust... be gentle.\u201d</p><p>I sported a sad smile Livvie couldn\u2019t see. The first time she\u2019d said those words to me, she\u2019d thought I was about to make love to her. Instead, she\u2019d told me she loved me and I\u2019d been cruel. I wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake.</p><p>I settled the length of my body on top of her. I kissed her shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cI promise, Kitten. I\u2019ll stop if you don\u2019t want it.\u201d I pressed my c**k against her. \u201cSpread your legs.\u201d There was no hesitation this time. Livvie\u2019s thighs spread on either side of me in invitation.</p><p>I watched the side of her face intently as I moved my hips. My dick was slippery. I knew she could feel the heat and weight of it sliding between her cheeks. Penetration could not happen, and having removed the threat of it, I knew the temptation would be planted.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s eyes were closed, only opening occasionally when accompanied by a shy moan. Her teeth worried at her lip and already her fingers were near her mouth. The pink stain of arousal painted her cheek.</p><p>I kissed her cheek, the back of her neck, her shoulder\u2014faint little kisses that offered comfort but did nothing to soothe the heat of arousal. I wanted her delirious with desire. I wanted her pulsing with lust. I wanted her to beg.</p><p>I adjusted my angle and for the first time let the tip brush against her opening. It was an implicit suggestion, but only that. I wanted her to crave my domination as much as I desired her submission.</p> <p>Triumph!</p><p>Livvie let out a pleading sound. Her hips made little thrusts before she could help it. I went back to rocking against her. I treasured Livvie\u2019s sigh of disappointment, the way she forced her hips to stop moving.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want,\u201d I said hotly in her ear.</p><p>She frowned, resisting.</p><p>I pulled my hips back and brushed her hole with an oiled finger. I pressed inside slowly, only to the first knuckle. Livvie was moaning loudly. I withdrew.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease, Caleb.\u201d She lifted tail.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d I held the tip of my c**k against her and pushed gently.</p><p>\u201cOh god!\u201d She fisted the sheets and arched her back. \u201cPlease, Caleb. I need you.\u201d</p><p>That was certainly good enough for me. However, having suddenly gained the submission I desired, I wondered if I was perhaps wrong to accept.</p><p>I kissed Livvie\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThank you for that. I know I\u2019m a difficult man to trust.\u201d My fingers found her wet flesh and slipped inside. It was familiar territory. It did not require me to be overly gentle or careful. It did not require her to bend her will to mine. It was safe.</p><p>Livvie hissed in arousal. Her hips moved as much as they were able beneath my weight.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Her voice carried on little more than breath.</p> <p>I curved my fingers downward, pressing against the front of her inner walls. I knew I could make her come that way.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was obvious. First, I\u2019m going to make you come and then I\u2019m going to f**k you until you do it again. And maybe once more after that.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered. I lived for that sound.</p><p>\u201cBut... I thought... oh god... right there.\u201d A series of moans and incoherent begging filled the small, intimate space between Livvie\u2019s mouth and my ears. A wet rush escaped around my buried fingers. Livvie\u2019s body was rigid, hijacked by her orgasm. And then she went limp. I slowly withdrew my fingers. I was eager to replace them.</p><p>\u201cNo, Caleb,\u201d she murmured into the bedding. \u201cNot like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it to hurt,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her hair was matted to her forehead. Her body was flushed, and her eyes were closed. She didn\u2019t acknowledge my tense reaction. She didn\u2019t open her eyes to take in the moment. She seemed afloat in her bliss despite asking me to hurt her. Who the hell are you?</p><p>\u201cYou want me to hurt you?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>She was quiet for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI trust you, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d she cooed. \u201cDon\u2019t analyze it. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>With more than a small amount of trepidation, I did. I pressed into her ass in miniscule degrees. I could hear her breathing, deep breaths, in and out. She was willing me into her body through her submission. She kept herself open and ready.</p><p>My heart beat with enough force to leave a bruise in my chest. I didn\u2019t understand. She wanted me to change. She wanted someone different. Didn\u2019t she? Why was she baiting me? Part of me didn\u2019t care. I wanted it too much to care. I focused on my shallow thrusts. I focused on the pressure surrounding me and the dull scrape of every hard-earned inch I buried.</p><p>Livvie whimpered. It was a sound born of pain. I held myself perfectly still.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she whispered. I obeyed.</p><p>There were tears in her eyes by the time I was fully inside. I was almost afraid to move, but equally as determined to take what Livvie had so boldly offered. My mind was befuddled\u2014my body was not.</p><p>\u201cLast chance,\u201d I said. I pressed my lips to her cheek and they came away wet. I licked my lips to ingest her tears. I had tasted her sadness. I had tasted her joy. I wondered what kind of tears I tasted in that moment.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d and her rocking hips were her response.</p><p>I was so tangled up inside, it was a relief to let my body take over. I let myself fall: into a rhythm, into the void, into Livvie. I let her moans, whimpers, and cries into my ears. I answered them with groans, grunts, and hisses of breath. As my pace increased, the sound of our bodies slamming together joined in the chorus.</p><p>Livvie writhed beneath me. Sometimes she urged me deeper, harder, and faster. Other times, her sounds and movements begged me to go slower and pull back. There was no stop. Stop was unacceptable to us both.</p><p>When I couldn\u2019t take the heat, I pulled Livvie up onto her knees. She pushed back against me, burying me inside. She cried out, coming and riding me hard. My world tilted on its axis. Mine!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come,\u201d I warned.</p><p>Livvie was panting hard.</p><p>\u201cTell me you love me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou first!\u201d I yelled and spilled inside her.</p><p>We didn\u2019t discuss any of it afterward. Neither of us was willing to cede any further emotional territory.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>By the time early January reared its head, Livvie and I were starting to settle into being a couple. Granted, we weren\u2019t your average couple, but we were getting comfortable with who we were. The nightmares became less frequent and we attacked each other less often. Livvie let me put it in her ass sometimes (grin).</p><p>Naturally, I had to try my best to f**k it all up.</p><p>Okay, before I even go on, please let me say I am not proud of what I did next. I was bored and insatiably curious. Also, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m not your typical boyfriend material.</p><p>It was the first time I\u2019d ever been in Livvie\u2019s apartment alone. She had classes during the day but didn\u2019t have to work in the evening. She asked if I\u2019d be there when she came home and I said yes because it beat being in my hotel room.</p><p>The sun flooded Livvie\u2019s apartment. I lay in her bed, smothered in throw pillows of various colors and shapes (Seriously ladies, what the f**k with all the pillows?). I felt especially dirty jerking off in her frilly bed. I was sure to wipe up my come with a fuzzy pink pillow. I hoped it would prompt Livvie to throw the damn thing away.</p><p>Afterward, I took a shower, made myself a bowl of Cocoa Puffs, and perused the stack of movies Livvie had rented and left on the coffee table. I\u2019d never been the type of man who liked to eat cereal, let alone kid cereal, but Livvie loved the stuff and it was often the only thing I could find in her kitchen. I knew she could cook when she wanted to, but it seemed the mood rarely struck her. Some nights we ate cereal for dinner.</p><p>I decided not to watch the movies without Livvie since she seemed to enjoy regaling me with random movie factoids as we watched. I made the mistake of asking why we were watching \u201cEpisode IV\u201d instead of starting from the beginning, and what followed was a diatribe about George Lucas and how he ruined Star Wars when he released three prequels. I didn\u2019t much care, but I enjoyed watching Livvie rant about things that weren\u2019t me. What I didn\u2019t much enjoy was the way she stared at me the entire time I watched the movie to gauge my response during \u201cawesome\u201d scenes.</p><p>As I sat on the couch eating my cereal, my eyes landed on Livvie\u2019s laptop. It was just sitting on the coffee table\u2014daring me! Livvie was on the thing whenever she had time. I desperately wanted to know what Livvie had been writing and why she was keeping it from me. I remembered the way Livvie had snapped at Claudia to be quiet. Then the way she\u2019d avoided the topic in Paris. It only made me more curious. I determined fairly quickly it had to be about me, us, or better\u2014her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shoveled the remainder of my cereal into my mouth and set the bowl on the table. I scooped up the laptop and opened it. A smile curved my lips when I saw her screensaver. It was a picture of me asleep on her couch on Thanksgiving.

Why did she need a password? Didn\u2019t she trust me? I hope you\u2019re smiling, because I know I am.</p><p>Anyway, it took me the better part of the morning, but I finally gained access to Livvie\u2019s laptop. Her password gave me mixed emotions: Survival. If you\u2019re horrified, please consider that I was fully aware Livvie would discover what I\u2019d done. I wasn\u2019t trying to hide my actions. I just wanted to know what the hell was on her laptop and why she chose to keep it from me.</p><p>There was a fleeting moment when I considered I might be opening Pandora\u2019s box, but it really was fleeting. I make it my business to know what\u2019s going on around me, and it has saved my ass more than once.</p> <p>Livvie is very systematic. Her desktop was organized into a series of folders: FLM101, ENG202, HIS152, ART102, School Plan, and most alluring, Captive. One guess as to which folder I opened first? No! Not film.</p><p>There were several different documents inside the folder: Caleb, Reed, Sloan, FBI procedures, Mexico, East, Stockholm Syn, Human Traffick, Captive_D1_R2. My fingers began to shake as I hovered over each file. I wondered what I would discover. I wondered if I could process what I\u2019d find. I wondered if I would feel different toward Livvie once I read them. If she was betraying me in some way, did I want to know? I knew already there would be no going back. Ignorance had never served me well.</p><p>I tested the waters by opening the document labeled \u201cSloan\u201d. It contained a description of her appearance and a list of her mannerisms. I found Sloan interesting in a strange sort of way (free-form knitting and interpretive taxidermy? What?). I immediately moved on to the file on Reed.</p><p>Height: 6\u20192\u2019\u2019 Weight: 195? Desc: Pitch black hair that\u2019s a little too long (surprising because of his job and his obvious anal retentiveness). It curls a little around his ears and the nape of his neck. His eyes are dark and expressive due to his dark brows. Clean shaven (very meticulously groomed aside from the hair). His lips (mmmmm). His mouth is warm and he tastes like coffee and mints. Bit of an angry shit when you kiss him unexpectedly (ha!).</p><p>Rage hit me fast and hard. Why had she kissed him? What had she really been up to when Reed had come to \u201ccheck on her\u201d?</p> <p>I had to stop reading and take a few deep breaths. Livvie wouldn\u2019t betray me. Would she? She obviously hadn\u2019t turned me in. I forced myself to keep reading.</p><p>Livvie went on to describe Reed as good looking and sharp witted. I\u2019m f**king good looking and sharp witted! I bet Reed only speaks one language. I\u2019m sharp witted in five!</p><p>I moved on to my file. Surely, it had to read better than the one she had on Reed. I recalled Livvie telling me in Mexico that she hoped to write a book one day. She\u2019d also told me the first rule of writing was to write what you know. The thought filled me with foreboding.</p><p>The document was longer than the previous two\u2014about three pages. She\u2019d managed a great deal of detail. The description calmed me somewhat. Livvie was very flattering, except I felt she had transformed me from a person into a character, and I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about being picked apart.</p><p>Height: 6\u20194\u2019\u2019 Weight: 210? Desc: blond hair, Caribbean blue eyes. A full mouth made for kissing. He has a canine tooth that is a bit sharp and slightly out of line with all of this other perfect teeth (the first time I saw him smile). Muscular, but lean\u2014not bulky or overly muscled. His skin is tan from the sun, not a machine. He has almost invisible blond hair everywhere (kissing his back, they stood on end\u2014super soft).</p><p>Mannerisms: Caleb always seems to think something is funny or amusing (that ridiculous smirk). His eyes can be beautiful or f**king terrifying (peaceful waters v. dark murky water). His mouth gets tense when he\u2019s pissed and trying not to show it. He scowls a lot and sometimes he does it while he\u2019s smiling, which usually means he\u2019s about to do something especially cruel (that first whipping).</p> <p>Livvie\u2019s character profile went on and on about me. She wrote down pieces of things she remembered about me. She even went on to describe my dick, what I looked like when I came, and the way I laughed. Had Claudia read these notes? I knew she\u2019d read at least part of Livvie\u2019s story. What the f**k could she possibly have been thinking? I resented taking instant notice of how tight my lips were as I bit down on the tip of my tongue to help calm me down. I laughed bitterly.</p><p>I finally opened Captive.</p><p>Prologue:</p><p>This is not a romance. Romances are filled with valiant men and simpering damsels in distress. Romances have heroes worthy of the title. They slay dragons and climb towers to rescue beautiful princesses they immediately marry and impregnate. Romances end with a happily ever after. This is not a romance.</p><p>This is a love story. The characters are flawed to the point of being broken. The hero is beautiful, but ugly in ways that defy the ordinary imagination. The heroine isn\u2019t trapped in a tower, but a dark and lonely room. There is no prince coming to save her. While love blooms and thrives, there is no happily ever after. Love does not always begin or end the way we wish it would.</p><p>A love story can happen to anyone. This one happened to me.</p><p>The words stirred something inside me. There wasn\u2019t a doubt in my mind. Livvie was writing a book about us. Our story was not romance. I was not worthy of being called a hero. I was beautiful on the outside and hideous on the inside. We... didn\u2019t have a happily ever after.</p><p>I swallowed hard. I swallowed a few times.</p> <p>I\u2019d come too far to stop. I kept reading:</p><p>I\u2019m hurrying down the sidewalk, trying to get away from the sinister man in the car behind me, when I look up and see him. Perhaps it\u2019s his easy stride, or the way his gaze sweeps past me instead of over me, but for whatever reason, he seems safe. I throw my arms about his waist and whisper, \u201cJust play along, okay?\u201d</p><p>He does, and I\u2019m surprised when his arms wrap around me. The moment of danger seems to pass very quickly, but for some reason I don\u2019t want to let go. I feel safe in these arms, and I\u2019ve never really felt safe before. And he smells good, he smells the way I imagine a man should smell\u2014like crisp, clean soap, and warm skin, and a light sweat. I think I\u2019m taking too long to let go, so I release him as though he\u2019s burned me. Then I stare up and acknowledge the angel in front of me. My knees almost buckle.</p><p>He is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. That includes puppies, babies, rainbows, sunsets, and sunrises. I can\u2019t even call him a man\u2014men don\u2019t look this good. His skin is beautifully tanned, as if the sun itself took the time to kiss his skin to perfection. His muscled forearms are dusted with the same golden hair of his head. And his eyes mimic the blue-green of the Caribbean Sea I\u2019ve only seen on movie posters.</p><p>He smiles, and I can\u2019t help but smile, too. I\u2019m a puppet. He pulls my strings. His smile reveals his beautiful white teeth, but also his sharp canine on the left side. His teeth aren\u2019t perfect, and the small imperfection seems to make him more beautiful.</p><p>He\u2019s saying something to me, something about another girl, but I refuse to listen.</p><p>It was the first time we\u2019d met. She\u2019d felt safe in my arms, never guessing, never knowing what I was about to do to her. Even knowing all the things that happened afterward, the fact we were having a relationship, I felt sick to my stomach over her words. Her choice of phrases made her youth obvious. She\u2019d compared me to puppies, babies, and rainbows. So young and na\u00efve\u2014I\u2019d ruined that.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s first draft looked nothing like what you\u2019ve read. She didn\u2019t have my perspective. She didn\u2019t have the knowledge of my thoughts or the things that were in play during those first encounters. The picture she painted was of a sad, lonely girl trapped in a room at the hands of a sadistic monster who cared nothing for her well-being. This was Livvie\u2019s recollection of me.</p><p>I read about her kidnapping, living every moment of her fear with her and feeling rage when she talked about Jair slapping her unconscious. It was beyond surreal to read about Livvie\u2019s first impressions of my cold and detached voice as she lay bound and blind in Felipe\u2019s house. She\u2019d thought I was going to rape and kill her. I suppose I knew those things then, but I didn\u2019t care and that was the worst part. I remembered I hadn\u2019t cared. That was the truth about the man I was.</p><p>I was a glutton for punishment and I kept reading. To my surprise, I found erotic undertones. While I remembered the moments vividly and with a certain sick fondness, reading them from her point of view was like a knife twisting in my gut. I wasn\u2019t sure if the Livvie I had come to know was honestly the Livvie she had been. Perhaps I had simply altered her to suit me.</p><p>I wondered if Livvie had been someone else, a different girl as I had once suggested, if I would have gone through with it and sold her to Vladek. I wondered if Livvie had never gotten away from me, never suffered the encounter with the bikers, if I might have taken this beautiful woman and ruined her. In those moments, I would have done anything to unmake the words in front of me. I didn\u2019t want them to exist. I didn\u2019t want them to be true. With all that I was, I longed to go back to that first day I had met Livvie and make different choices. Yet there was the nagging voice in my head reminding me how far back I\u2019d have to go to undo my mistakes. I would have to go back to the night Narweh beat me and give up my fight to live. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Where would Livvie be in her life if I had just died?</p><p>Where would all of the women I had made suffer be? I\u2019d been too late to save Pia Kumar. I\u2019d buried her masters alive next to her so that she might be able to hear their screams.</p><p>I had to look away from the screen. I had to set the laptop down and walk onto the balcony for air. My chest felt heavy.</p><p>It was no wonder she couldn\u2019t say she loved me. What right did I have to love?</p> <p>I went inside and wrote her a note.</p><p>I read your book. I know you\u2019ll be furious and you have a right. I realize you\u2019ll want to scream at me and you have a right to that as well, but I have to be honest and tell you I\u2019m not sure I can take it just yet. I\u2019ll be at the hotel for a few days. I need to think.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Caleb</p><p>p.s. I\u2019m sorry for all of it.</p> <p>I gathered up what meager belongings I had in Livvie\u2019s apartment and locked the door behind me when I left. I was numb and unsure what to do next.</p><p>I could barely drive. My attention wasn\u2019t focused on the road, but on Livvie. Why had she let me stay with her? After all the things I had put her through, I couldn\u2019t imagine her reasons for inviting me back into her life. Perhaps it was only that she feared me. Perhaps she only wanted to keep me close and keep an eye on me. It was the smart thing to do. It\u2019s what I would do.</p><p>I hated how weak my feelings for her had made me. I was not a sniveling child. I hated the way I felt empty when she wasn\u2019t around. I loathed waiting in my hotel room for her to get out of school or off work. I thought of her as mine. She was mine, and yet I couldn\u2019t touch her where it mattered. I couldn\u2019t touch her heart and force her to give me the things I had stupidly come to need. For a moment... I hated her. I hated loving her.</p><p>I\u2019d meant to return to my hotel, but my thoughts took me elsewhere. I\u2019d seen the gym a few times and had even considered going inside, but I ultimately decided against it. I was a violent person. I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to be around violence. I had apparently changed my mind. My violence needed to be let out.</p><p>I parked the vehicle and went inside. I was immediately assaulted by the smell of male sweat. The room practically teemed with body odor. There was no air conditioning, or escalators, or walls lined with treadmills and circuit training machines. This was a real gym. This was a place where men went to commune with the beast that lives in all of us.</p><p>Adrenaline found me at last. My heart pounded with it, my fists clenched, my muscles yawned and flexed. I was practically lusting for a fight. I searched the room for someone who might be willing and able to take me on.</p> <p>\u201cCan I sign you up?\u201d someone asked in Spanish. I turned and glared at the man behind me. He wasn\u2019t particularly tall, but he carried himself with extreme confidence. He was perhaps a little younger than me too, and I thought that added to his demeanor. I took my measure slowly and decided the man was likely a martial artist of some kind\u2014his legs looked capable of snapping bones.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to fight,\u201d I said as calmly as I was able. I must not have been very successful in portraying calm because he eyed me somewhat suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cEnglish? Okay. I speak little bit. You need...\u201d He struggled for a word but ended up tugging on his clothes.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring any,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t need any. Just like this.\u201d I swept my hand across my t-shirt and jeans. I didn\u2019t bother explaining I could speak Spanish. I wasn\u2019t in the mood for conversation. He smiled and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cFighter? What style?\u201d He walked back toward the front door and into a room on the left. I assumed it was the office. I stepped inside, somewhat annoyed I couldn\u2019t just jump into the action.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trained.\u201d Rafiq had been a military officer and had given me quite the education. One of my favorite memories was the day I\u2019d finally bested him in hand to hand. He\u2019d taken a big risk teaching me all that he did. Without him I\u2019d have been an illiterate, defenseless whore. It was ironic that the very skills he\u2019d taught me had aided in his demise.</p><p>The man at the desk rolled his eyes and muttered about me in Spanish. He thought I was an idiot who\u2019d come to get his ass kicked. He seemed amused by the idea. He grabbed some papers from a printer behind him and placed them in front of me.</p><p>\u201cPlease to write all your information and sign the bottom. Need identification and money for membership.\u201d</p> <p>I filled in the necessary information and took out all the cash in my wallet. It was enough to cover my membership for three months. The man at the desk seemed pleased with my payment and stood to shake my hand.</p><p>\u201cCarlos.\u201d</p><p>Seeing no reason to make a new enemy, I shook his hand and tried out my name.</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d I dropped my hand and looked toward the ring. \u201cCan I fight now?\u201d</p><p>Carlos shook his head, somewhat exasperated.</p><p>\u201cOkay. You fight.\u201d He walked beyond me and I followed him toward the ring. He called out to a nearby fighter. I listened while he informed the man of my intentions. The fighter sized me up and smirked before he informed Carlos he was willing to take me on. Neither of them seemed to think I had any talent.</p><p>I paid them little mind as I removed my socks, shoes, and shirt. I didn\u2019t care how the fight was going to go. I only cared about hitting. I accepted the ill-fitting mouth guard handed to me and put it in my mouth. I also took heed and wore the required headgear.</p><p>Within minutes, I stood in the ring across from Fernando. I thought we were fairly matched. He was a touch shorter than me, but his muscles were bulkier and more defined. I knew his fighting style involved the use of his legs as he stretched them, bending his feet toward his ass.</p><p>I rolled my head and shoulders, shaking my arms out. I bounced on the balls of my feet, warming my muscles as much as I could in the short span of time I\u2019d given myself to prepare. I held no illusions about not getting hit. In fact, I craved the blows that would soon land on me. I knew they would incense me. I knew they would trigger the rage I\u2019d been keeping locked inside. I knew once the rage took over, all thoughts of Livvie would cease. I knew the pain inside would yield to the pain on the outside.</p><p>Carlos called us toward the center and went over the rules for my benefit: No gouging, biting, breaking of bones, hits to the groin, head-butting, or fighting after the bell. There were more rules than I was used to, but then again I\u2019d never fought anyone but Rafiq for fun. Even then, I was learning survival. Implicit in the rules, but not necessary for anyone but me, was one more rule: No killing.</p><p>Fernando and I nodded at one another and took one or two steps back from the center. Carlos left the ring and took a position not far away. He rang the bell. The man opposite me was not eager. Despite the smirk and overconfidence he displayed, he took the time to circle the ring and gauge my strengths. I did the same.</p><p>It erupted quickly. For all that I was expecting a kick from his powerful legs, I was caught off guard when he simply rushed me with the full force of his body. He lifted me and threw my back into the corner. A knee came up and landed on my ribs. My breath left me in a rush.</p><p>My hands free, I joined them together and hit him in the junction between neck and shoulder. He took a step back and I landed another blow in the same spot before I had enough room to lift my right leg and push him back. He smiled and made a motion with his upraised hands: Come on.</p><p>He\u2019d winded me and I had barely done anything to convince him I was a worthy opponent. It was a situation I intended to remedy quickly. I came at him with a series of kicks that he met easily enough. I came at him with so many kicks he diverted his attention from my hands and I made my move. I punched him in the side of the neck with my left, stepped in, and sent an elbow to his temple with my right. He lost enough of his balance I was able to hook one of his legs and push him to the mat.</p><p>Fernando was a skilled fighter and the attack did not daze him for long. He quickly rolled, catching me with his powerful legs and flinging me to the mat. His foot came up and his heel landed on my back with impressive force. The gym seemed to come to life in those moments as others began to gather around the ring. They cheered for Fernando.</p><p>On the mat, we grappled, each of us avoiding an arm around the neck or an arm grab that would undoubtedly lead to a painful submission hold. The bell rang before either of us was willing to surrender our position.</p><p>\u201cSeparate!\u201d called Carlos. I kicked Fernando off of me and scrambled to my feet. We stared at one another and heaved for breath. Carlos was laughing and remarked that I had more fight than he thought.</p><p>Fernando told me not to get too excited. He\u2019d been taking it easy on me but was ready to kick my ass just as soon as Carlos rung the bell.</p><p>I took off my headgear and threw it outside the ring. Mimicking Fernando\u2019s hand gesture from earlier, I raised my hands and told him to kick my ass if he thought he could. Everyone seemed pleasantly surprised by my ability to speak Spanish. Everyone except Fernando. He removed his own headgear and tossed it. Carlos rang the bell.</p><p>Fernando rushed again, but I was ready this time. I waited until he was within arm\u2018s reach and used his momentum against him. I stepped to the side, caught his neck with my arm and jumped on his back. We went down with a loud thud as I rode Fernando to the ground. With my knees firmly planted in his sides, I went to work punching Fernando in the face before he covered himself. My hands throbbed with pain after colliding with bone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fernando rolled, knocking me to the side, and delivered a backward kick that landed between my shoulder blades. I cried out, my hands scrambling for purchase on the other man\u2019s sweaty flesh. Wearing jeans had been a mistake. The fabric trapped me. Two more kicks landed on my back and I saw spots.</p><p>The fight had gone from a sparring match to an earnest struggle. Fernando scrambled to get on my back, his arms trying to wind their way around my neck. I kept my arm up to protect my windpipe.</p><p>A familiar feeling spread throughout my body. Suddenly, the only thing that mattered was winning. A fist collided with the side of my face and my teeth bit down hard on the mouth guard. I could taste blood in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me, Khoya. I\u2019m a god here.\u201d</p> <p>I gritted my teeth and pushed with all my strength on the arm attempting to circle my neck. Fernando\u2019s arm trembled and eventually he was forced to readjust his position on my back. The bell rang and Carlos yelled for us to separate, but neither of us listened. I refused to be saved by the bell for a second time.</p><p>I pushed myself up with my arms, exposing my neck to Fernando in a way he couldn\u2019t resist. As he wrapped his arm around my neck, his face pressed to the side of my own, I reached behind his head with one arm and grasped my other hand. I squeezed. Fernando grunted into my ear. I crushed his windpipe with my shoulder as I pressed him from behind.</p><p>With each of us having the other by the throat, it became a test of endurance. Fernando\u2019s position was better than mine, but he was used to fighting for sport. I was accustomed to fighting to live. I squeezed until my shoulders burned. I had run out of oxygen long ago and black spots invaded my vision. But I held on. I held on until I felt Fernando sag against me, only seconds before I blacked out.</p><p>I was jolted into consciousness by a forceful slap and cold water being splashed on my face. Carlos\u2019 angry glare was all I needed to realize what had happened. I looked beyond him to watch as another man treated Fernando to the same. He sat up with a cough and rubbed at his neck.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were a troublemaker when you walked in,\u201d Carlos said in Spanish. \u201cGet dressed and get the f**k out.\u201d He stood and tossed my shirt onto my chest. I pulled it on and stood as quickly as I was able.</p> <p>\u201cGood fight,\u201d I managed through a strained throat. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it again.\u201d Fernando managed to smile and nod as I turned to leave the ring.</p><p>I grabbed my socks and shoes and left without putting them on. The cold was bracing as I walked toward my car, but I didn\u2019t mind. It was the only thing keeping me upright. I knew I\u2019d be bruised to hell in the morning. At last, something felt normal.</p><p>I managed to get back to the hotel before the first stirrings of bruised muscle, scraped flesh, and weary bones had me longing for the comfort of a hot bath. Slowly, I eased my body into the water. It stung viciously. I put ice on my face. No one could accuse me of being pretty at that moment.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>I was sound asleep when I heard the pounding on the door. I moaned as I attempted to move all at once. The light coming in through the curtains told me it wasn\u2019t yet evening. Livvie hadn\u2019t waited long before coming to find me.</p><p>I decided further movement was ill advised. My throat was too sore to yell. A strange pinch occurred in my chest. I wanted to see Livvie, but I didn\u2019t want to fight with her.</p> <p>Vivisected. It\u2019s the only word I can think of to describe how I\u2019m feeling\u2014vivisected. As though someone has cut me open with a scalpel, the pain not sinking in until the flesh begins to separate and my blood bubbles out. I can hear the crack as my ribs are flayed open. Slowly, my organs, wet and sticky, are pulled out of me one at a time. Until I am hollow. Hollow and yet, in excruciating pain\u2014still alive. Still. Alive.</p><p>As I lay unable or unwilling to move with Livvie pounding on my door, it occurred to me: It\u2019s always going to hurt. Yes, vivisected had been a very apt word to use. Loving Livvie was like allowing myself to be peeled open and hollowed out. She made me weak. She made me vulnerable. She made me ache and long and hope for all the things that could never be mine.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>\u201cCaleb?\u201d Livvie called out. It was the first time she\u2019d ever used the key I\u2019d given her and I groaned at my own stupidity. That was another thing Livvie made me\u2014stupid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in here,\u201d I said. Getting choked until unconscious is hard on the vocal chords. I hated the way my heart knocked in my chest. I really wanted to see her. I wanted to tell her I was sorry. Shamefully, I wanted her to see me battered and use it to keep her from screaming at me.</p><p>She gasped when she saw me but didn\u2019t reach out to touch me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do now? I mean, aside from invade my privacy and break my trust? It\u2019s been a busy day for you.\u201d</p><p>I let her words hang in the air between us. What could I say? Finally, she stepped closer and brushed her fingers across my cheek. I hissed.</p> <p>\u201cServes you right,\u201d she snapped. Beneath the anger I heard concern. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked a fight,\u201d I whispered. \u201cYou should see the other guy.\u201d I laughed and it hurt.</p><p>\u201cIs\u2014is the other guy alive?\u201d she asked without inflection.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said just as coldly. \u201cYou would ask me, wouldn\u2019t you? I\u2019m always killing people for petty reasons.\u201d I turned away from her. \u201cIf you came for a fight, don\u2019t bother. I surrender.\u201d I felt an intense pressure in my chest. \u201cJust go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want me to go?\u201d she asked. There was no emotion in her voice and it scared the f**k out me. Please, don\u2019t go. Don\u2019t leave me.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re done with me,\u201d I said instead.</p><p>\u201cCoward,\u201d she spat. \u201cYou\u2019ll take a beating. You\u2019ll face men with guns. You\u2019ll kill. But God forbid you have to swallow your goddamn pride and apologize for being a nosy little shit.\u201d</p><p>I sat up fast.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t swallow my pride? Fuck you! All I\u2019ve done for months is swallow my pride. I\u2019ve apologized ad nauseum. I f**k you when you want to be f**ked. I play nice for your friends. I wait for you to come home because I have nothing more to do. You\u2019ve become my whole life!</p><p>\u201cMeanwhile, you\u2019re writing about me. You still see me as the man I was. You still see the killer\u2014beautiful on the outside and hideous on the inside. Why are you with me? Why am I trying so hard to be someone else when all I\u2019ll ever be to you is the man who ruined your life? I follow you around like a love-sick bitch and every day I fight the urge to go back to what I know. There are days when I want to go back to being the person I was because that person couldn\u2019t love you. The man I was would never be this weak!\u201d</p><p>I shouted through the pain in my throat and that, coupled with the emotion working its way to the surface, threatened to close off my airway. Livvie\u2019s face was a mask of indifference. It chilled my bones. How had she learned to be so cold? I knew the answer even as I asked the question.</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d she asked as she looked into my eyes. \u201cWhen did you come to the realization? Was it when I told you I loved you and you said it was cute? Or maybe it was after I killed a man? Possibly when I begged you not to leave me at the border?</p><p>\u201cDid you realize you loved me while I was alone in the hospital and weeping over you? When did you shout your love from the rooftops, Caleb? I couldn\u2019t hear you. I was too busy trying to f**king breathe without you. I was busy convincing everyone around me I wasn\u2019t crazy for defending my kidnapper. So, remind me. When did you say the words? I\u2019ll be sure to go back in time and comfort the broken girl you left in your wake. Your love can comfort her, because I\u2019m not the same person anymore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned to breathe without you. I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s no one in this life I can trust. It isn\u2019t that you read my words. I don\u2019t care about that. I would have shown you eventually. It\u2019s the note you left. It\u2019s now. It\u2019s knowing that at any moment you\u2019re going to run off and leave me again. How can I tell you I love you? How could I survive it again?\u201d</p><p>I was stunned into silence. Every cell in my body crawled with shame. Livvie was a survivor. She\u2019d survived me. I realized then what I was witnessing was not indifference\u2014it was pain. Livvie was in pain and it was my fault.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what was happening, but it came on suddenly. My nose started running and I sniffled. I knew Livvie was watching me. I knew how ridiculous I must look, how weak and broken. I couldn\u2019t even care. I had nothing left to lose. I did my best to clear my throat before I spoke.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say it, Kitten. I\u2019d just finished... I loved him.\u201d I felt my chest shaking.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Livvie whispered. She was still so stoic.</p><p>\u201cRafiq,\u201d I said softly. Livvie sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Caleb? You know what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know what he did. I also know what he didn\u2019t do: He never touched me the way the others did.\u201d A part of me couldn\u2019t believe I was about to go into this with her. I\u2019d read her story and it had me thinking of my own. I suppose I thought I owed her the other half of our tale. I needed her to know I hadn\u2019t cast her out without good reasons. \u201cI was so young, Livvie. I was so powerless. Every day I was raped by someone. I was raped every day until I started to convince myself it wasn\u2019t rape. I let them touch me. I let them... fuck me. I smiled at the ones I saw more often than the others, imagining they must care for me. Why else would they come back to use me repeatedly? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEventually, I believed them. I believed them when they said they cared. I believed them when they promised to buy me from Narweh. I let myself hope that one day I would be free.\u201d I heard myself sob. The sound was far away, as though someone else were falling apart and not me. \u201cIt never happened. They never cared. They were never going to set me free. It was the hope they loved to toy with\u2014my hope. I let it die.</p><p>\u201cAnd then one day... Rafiq came. He picked me up, whipped and bloody. He took me home and nursed me. He fed me. He fed my body. He fed my mind. He fed my soul. He taught me how to do more than survive\u2014he taught me how to live. And he never touched me.</p><p>\u201cFor years he took care of me. I didn\u2019t need hope anymore. I had something better. I had purpose! I loved him for that. And then...\u201d I felt numb as I stared off into space. \u201cI learned the truth.\u201d</p><p>My body shook as I recalled the night I murdered him.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t anything, Livvie. I wasn\u2019t anything to him and he\u2019d been everything to me. I would have died for him and the whole time... I was nothing.\u201d I finally looked at Livvie. Tears were on her cheeks. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the worst part. No, the worst part is that I meant to kill him before I knew the truth. It was the only way to set you free and I... I killed him, Livvie. I killed him and I buried him in Felipe\u2019s garden where his family will never find him. I buried the only person I thought I could trust. I loved him, and he turned out to be the person responsible for the most horrendous betrayal of my life.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I realized I\u2019d done the same to you. I\u2019d beaten you. I\u2019d raped you, and worse\u2014I even made you like it. I fed you hope and I snatched it away. I made you love me! How could I tell you? I couldn\u2019t tell you, Livvie. I was confused. I was... broken. I\u2019m still broken. I don\u2019t know who I am or what I want. All I know is that without you... without you, there\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m nothing. Do you have any idea how terrifying that is for someone like me?\u201d</p><p>My feelings toward her were on the tip of my tongue. I\u2019d been holding the words in since the moment I had watched her walk out of my life, and if she\u2019d turned around and looked at me for even a second, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to resist telling her then.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say it in Mexico. I had lost too much that day. I had lost my reality. What could I possibly understand about love when the only person I was sure I did love had lied to me for twelve years? Livvie had said she was mine. How could I be sure? Worse, what if it were true? What if she loved me and all I had to offer was a husk of a heart to love her with? How can anyone understand what love is without experiencing it? It would be like trying to describe color to a blind man. Some things you have to see for yourself. To understand love, you have to feel it for yourself.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until Livvie walked away and I was truly alone in the world that I began to feel what love could be. It didn\u2019t come to me as it came to others; I had to find love as I had found everything else that defined me: through my suffering. The chasm Livvie\u2019s absence opened in me was a hungry void. It was alive, the void, and it would not be filled with vengeance. It was not soothed by my attempts to right my wrongs. It was not pleased by random women. It did not sleep, despite the amount of drink I imbibed to dull my senses.</p><p>There was only one thing the void wanted. Greedily tearing me apart, it asked for Livvie. It wanted my hopes, my dreams. It wanted my memories of her face. It wanted the laughter we had shared. \u201cMine,\u201d the void had decreed. Only Livvie could make me whole, and as soon as I had realized it, I couldn\u2019t stop looking for her. I\u2019d become obsessed with knowing if she really loved me.</p><p>The first touch of Livvie\u2019s hand on my shoulder had me sobbing again. Love made me weak. I wished it would go away. Instead, it crushed me under its heel. I let Livvie push me back onto the bed. And when I heard her turn away, love made me beg.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go. Don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>I felt her fingers running through my hair.</p><p>\u201cI would never leave you, Caleb. I just wanted to get you some water.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotch? Whiskey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I heard her undress before she slipped in behind me. She smelled like smoke. She hadn\u2019t had a cigarette since the first night I\u2019d come to her apartment. I didn\u2019t say anything about it. She had her vises and I had mine. All that mattered to me was that Livvie was warm. And soft. Livvie was always warm and soft. She spoke softly in my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared too. You didn\u2019t come to the door and I thought: He left me again. Caleb, you can\u2019t do that to me.\u201d</p><p>Livvie kissed my shoulder, but I could feel her vibrating with anger.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I guess... maybe I can\u2019t blame you. In the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s ridiculous to assume you wouldn\u2019t break into my laptop. To use your words: I know who you are and I know what you do.\u201d Livvie let out a short burst of laughter that quickly became a thoughtful sigh. \u201cIt must be hard on you, not having anyone to talk to about... him. I certainly don\u2019t care he\u2019s dead\u2014he can rot in hell for all I care\u2014but I never guessed how much you...\u201d Livvie sighed and went silent.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to care. I don\u2019t regret what I did. I just wanted you to know why I couldn\u2019t let you come with me. To be honest, I don\u2019t regret leaving you behind.\u201d</p><p>She tensed.</p><p>\u201cSorry you came back?\u201d</p><p>I turned and pulled her into my arms. It wasn\u2019t her place to comfort me.</p><p>\u201cNo. I could never regret any amount of time with you. You\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s ever happened in my life. I just wish I could... be that for you.\u201d Her silence was nearly deafening. It was a confirmation.</p><p>\u201cI... fuck. I\u2019m so goddamn angry, Caleb. I don\u2019t know how to process everything sometimes. There\u2019s so much living inside me. That\u2019s what the writing is for, it helps me lay shit out and filter through my thoughts.\u201d She propped herself up on her elbow and met my eyes. Her expression was pained. \u201cYou are the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, Caleb. You\u2019re also the worst. I\u2019m trying to reconcile those two things. Help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to help you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cTell me your side of things. I want to hear the good and the bad. I have so many questions, so many moments in my life where I only know half the information. You read my side of it. I want your side. Help me understand how I managed to...\u201d Her eyes finished her sentence: fall in love with you. \u201cHelp me explain it to the rest of the world.\u201d</p><p>Her words left me reeling. I didn\u2019t want the world to know. I didn\u2019t want to know. In fact, I\u2019d been doing everything within my power to make us both forget where we started. How was this supposed to help?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for the rest of the world to know, Livvie. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t, but I do. I wouldn\u2019t betray your trust. I\u2019d tell it the way it\u2019s meant to be told. I\u2019d make them see that some stories aren\u2019t black and white. I\u2019d make them feel this, us. And then I\u2019d feel better. I wouldn\u2019t feel like you got one over on me. I\u2019d feel right about everything between us and I\u2019d defend it. I\u2019ll always defend it.\u201d</p><p>What justification did I have against that? I had what I wanted: assurance that Livvie had no desire to leave me. I\u2019d even managed to sidestep the argument over having broken into her laptop. Most importantly, she\u2019d given me a glimpse of the love she\u2019d once professed to have for me. I was determined to nurture that emotion.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know? For example?\u201d I edged. She leaned toward me and placed a soft kiss on my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI hate seeing you like this. If anyone is going to f**k up your face, it should be me.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cThink you could take me?\u201d I worked hard not to grin so I wouldn\u2019t split my lip open again.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got me there. I don\u2019t think anyone has ever slapped me so many times and walked away without having to look over their shoulder forever.\u201d I let my fingers caress her face. I\u2019d slapped her once. \u201cI felt horrible... that one time. I\u2019ll never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I asked about the... you know. I know you\u2019re trying to be different and you\u2019ve changed so much. That wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a right to ask. I\u2019m trying to change, but it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t struggle with who I used to be. I\u2019ve had blood on my hands.\u201d I silently reflected on my year away from Livvie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different now,\u201d Livvie said softly.</p><p>I saw the faces of the women I\u2019d once enslaved and then set free. I thought about the ones I\u2019d been too late to save. They would haunt me forever and it was scarcely penance enough. Yet, fate had brought me to Livvie .</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019m all that different. I\u2019ll never stop looking over my shoulder\u2014or yours. I think part of me will always be someone\u2019s loyal disciple. It\u2019s who I am.\u201d I stroked Livvie\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019d kill for you, Livvie. I\u2019d die for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCaleb. Don\u2019t. You\u2019re no one\u2019s disciple. You\u2019re free, and all that shit is behind you.\u201d Her arm squeezed my waist.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right, Kitten, but I\u2019d still do anything to protect what\u2019s important to me. I just hope it never comes to violence again. From now on, it\u2019s just fighting in the gym.\u201d</p><p>Livvie laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you did this on purpose? Oh, Caleb,\u201d she sighed, \u201cyou\u2019re such a f**king man sometimes.\u201d She kissed me again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m always a man. Don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d I winked. \u201cAsk your questions, Kitten. I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll always be this agreeable.\u201d I skimmed her lower back with my fingers.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s smile faded a bit, but I could sense her determination nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cWhy me, Caleb? Why\u2019d you choose me?\u201d</p><p>I was sorry I invited her questions. I could think of at least ten other things I would rather suffer than formulate words to loaded questions like those. However, why is always important to people. It had been important to me. I\u2019d wanted to know why I\u2019d been taken. I\u2019d wanted to know why Rafiq showed me genuine affection when I was a boy. My entire life had been about why. I owed Livvie answers.</p><p>I cleared my throat.</p> <p>\u201cYou made me curious.\u201d I could practically feel the intensity of Livvie\u2019s stare. \u201cI watched you for weeks before I decided. Every time I saw you... I wanted to know more about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d She pressed into my side. I let out a huff of air.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I don\u2019t know. I guess... you looked kind of sad.\u201d I raised my free hand and traced her confused brow. \u201cYou liked to stare at the ground and it used to make me angry because I couldn\u2019t see your face, your eyes. I wanted to know why you were sad.\u201d Listening to my words aloud and staring into those same eyes, I wondered what the hell had ever possessed me to hurt someone so innocent, so beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou told me about your mom, about how she treated you, but I didn\u2019t know that in the beginning. I saw you in your baggy pants and oversized sweaters and it didn\u2019t make any sense to me why such a beautiful girl would hide.\u201d I knew she had been hiding from someone like me. I thought, life is cruel.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I f**king met you. You ran right into my arms and I...\u201d I almost couldn\u2019t say it. \u201cI had to have you. I\u2019m sorry, Livvie. I\u2019m so very sorry.\u201d</p><p>Livvie shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to apologize anymore. We\u2019re together and I don\u2019t need you feeling bad about it. I just want you to stop pushing me.\u201d She gripped my shoulder and shook me playfully. \u201cI need to know how we arrived here, but it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not happy to be where I am. I\u2019m here, with you. That\u2019s nothing either of us should be sorry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that way sometimes. You care about me, Livvie. I know you do. Except you won\u2019t say it because you\u2019re punishing me for what I did. I know I deserve it, but stop pretending you\u2019ve forgiven me. If you want the truth from me, start being honest.\u201d I felt the shift in power between us. Livvie had me where she wanted me, but I had her too. We had each other, and I liked knowing it wasn\u2019t something either of us could surrender easily.</p><p>She put her head down on my chest in supplication. She could ply me so easily sometimes. If I had anything to do with her ability to wield power through submission, then I\u2019d done my best work in Livvie. However, I doubted that was the case. She\u2019d been playing me since the day we met in one fashion or another.</p><p>\u201cI forgive you, Caleb. I\u2019m just... angry. You\u2019re angry too. I don\u2019t like how easily you can hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy, Livvie. I don\u2019t like hurting you. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>She made a growling sound. I almost laughed but managed to hold it in.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean... you left. You could leave again. You think about leaving and going back to that life. How is that supposed to make me feel?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to get up and throw things around the room. Livvie could be so infuriating.</p> <p>\u201cThe only reason I said that is because you do the same to me. One minute you can\u2019t live without me and you want me to treat you rough. The next minute you ask me if I\u2019ve killed someone. Casually! As if I ever killed anyone on a whim. Am I supposed to believe you want to spend the rest of your life with someone you think is capable of those things? If so... you\u2019re definitely not the person I remember.\u201d</p><p>Livvie smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of my life? You\u2019re ambitious.\u201d</p><p>I took in a breath and let it out in rush. Yes, she was infuriating. I had to laugh to keep from shaking her.</p><p>\u201cI... fine. I\u2019m ambitious.\u201d Unable to resist, I added, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have anything else to do with forever. My schedule is wide open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, can I ask my questions?\u201d She smiled sheepishly.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>\u201cShit. Come on, then.\u201d</p><p>We spoke for hours, it seemed. How many people had I killed? Why had I killed them? Did I get rid of everyone at the mansion? What happened to Celia (she\u2019s very much alive)?</p><p>I answered all her questions as quickly and efficiently as I could and without becoming emotional about them. I didn\u2019t regret the lives I\u2019d taken. I had never killed indiscriminately. I only felt guilt for those I\u2019d put in harm\u2019s way.</p><p>I didn\u2019t care for the questions involving Rafiq, of which there were few, or the ones having to do with Livvie\u2019s and my history, of which there were many.</p><p>\u201cDid you like the things you did to me?\u201d she asked. I was mentally and physically exhausted.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d I asked. I hoped she\u2019d get the hint and stop asking me so many damn questions.</p><p>\u201cSome of them,\u201d she whispered softly.</p><p>I turned my head toward her and stared. She was blushing. Things were finally getting interesting.</p><p>\u201cSuch as? And don\u2019t say the spanking\u2014I know you love the spanking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... well, it\u2019s mostly the spanking, but I like... other stuff too. It\u2019s your fault. You\u2019ve turned me into a sexual deviant like you.\u201d She kissed my chest.</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cLucky me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could... tie me up. If you wanted. If you... like that.\u201d Livvie\u2019s finger slid beneath the sheets and caressed my dick. I groaned.</p><p>\u201cKitten... I\u2019m...\u201d I was distracted. Her fingers wrapped around my flesh and began stroking. \u201cI\u2019m beat all to hell. I don\u2019t think...\u201d I trailed off as my eyes slid shut.</p><p>\u201cWould you like that, though?\u201d Her voice was small and shy despite the boldness of her touch.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019d like that very much. I miss... god, that feels good.\u201d She\u2019d slid her hand to my balls, her nails dragged slightly over the sensitive skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you miss?\u201d she whispered. Her leg wound around mine. My hand rested on the small of her back and I could feel her starting to rock against me.</p><p>\u201cControl,\u201d I managed. \u201cI miss having control.\u201d I lifted my hand from her lower back and put it on the back of her head.</p><p>\u201cOver me?\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cYes. I... liked being able to tell you what to do. I liked knowing what was going to happen next.\u201d I laughed to myself. \u201cI liked...\u201d Breaking you down and making you do whatever the f**k I wanted you to do. I liked owning you. I liked shocking you. I liked making you come apart and putting you back together. \u201cStop, Livvie.\u201d I placed my hand on hers and kept her from stroking my dick.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked urgently.</p><p>\u201cThis!\u201d I sat up slowly. \u201cWhat do you think I liked about it, Livvie? I\u2019m not used to being... I\u2019m not normal, Livvie. I used to get a hard-on when you cried. Is that what you want to hear?\u201d</p><p>Livvie\u2019s expression was wounded.</p><p>\u201cI know that, Caleb. You told me. I don\u2019t expect you to be normal. It\u2019s just that...\u201d She\u2019d gone from wounded to embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what, Livvie? Explain it to me, because you\u2019ve got me all confused.\u201d I stared at her, willing her to answer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d she struggled. \u201cBefore you... there wasn\u2019t anybody. And then we spent all that time together and we did all those things. Then after, I was alone and you were gone and I tried to maybe... with other guys, but they weren\u2019t you... and I couldn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I insisted. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t with anybody since me.\u201d</p><p>She snapped out of her rambling.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t! I couldn\u2019t! Caleb, the things you did to me. I got used to them. I liked them. I could never do anything wrong with you. You told me what to do and... I liked it. There was nobody that could...\u201d She blushed until even her chest looked red.</p><p>I exhaled, shocked. I thought about the first morning in the hotel room and the various other times she\u2019d goaded me into dominating her. I felt stupid for not putting it together before. I knew some people enjoyed games involving domination and submission, it\u2019s just that it had never been a game for me before. I looked at Livvie and smiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Kitten. What a strange pair we are. I\u2019m... a little speechless. You know what I like. I don\u2019t just like dominating you\u2014I love it. But it\u2019s difficult to turn it on and off. It\u2019s... different.\u201d</p><p>Livvie tugged at the sheet between us nervously.</p><p>\u201cI know. But... couldn\u2019t we try? We\u2019ve sort of been doing it. Like... just when we\u2019re having sex. Couldn\u2019t it be like that?\u201d</p><p>My brain felt like it was expanding in my skull. She was offering me control, but only under certain circumstances. It was a big concept for me to grasp, but one I was eager to thoroughly comprehend. My dick was fully erect just trying to understand it.</p> <p>\u201cSo if I were to say to you, \u2018Get down on your knees.\u2019 You would say?\u201d</p><p>Livvie let out a deep breath and smiled. She slid off the bed and onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb,\u201d she whispered and blushed.</p><p>My heart leapt.</p><p>\u201cI think... I\u2019m going to like this. A lot.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>February. Things were changing. Again. Some of the changes, perhaps even most of them, I enjoyed.</p><p>My favorite development had to do with Livvie\u2019s thirst to be dominated. Since \u201cThe Laptop Incident\u201d and our subsequent pact to be more forthcoming with one another, Livvie had no choice but to break her silence on the subject.</p><p>Some of it hadn\u2019t been surprising. The sex we\u2019d been having had been undoubtedly familiar to me. I knew Livvie enjoyed being spanked, chased, held down, and occasionally f**ked in her ass. What I hadn\u2019t anticipated was her desire for what she called games and I referred to as reenactments.</p><p>It had been my hope that upon finding Livvie again, we would start fresh and pretend the past had never occurred (it sounds asinine when I read it back). However, all freshmen are required to take psychology and Livvie seemed to take to it like a duck to water. She wanted to experiment with Exposure Therapy in the hopes that by reliving some of her experiences in a safe environment, she would no longer fear them.</p><p>Needless to say, I thought it was a bat-shit crazy idea (that\u2019s the technical term). The last thing I wanted was to reprise my role as Livvie\u2019s captor. What if it didn\u2019t work and she ended up hating me? It took a great deal of convincing from Livvie, but ultimately I\u2019d agreed to some of the less... disturbing moments.</p> <p>One morning I made us breakfast, put it on a wheeled cart from IKEA, and took it into Livvie\u2019s room. Livvie had taken the time to prepare herself while I cooked breakfast, and I\u2019d been pleasantly surprised to find her wearing one of my white button-up shirts and a dainty pair of kitten ears. I understood the significance of the shirt. The ears were a nice touch. I felt that touch center mass.</p><p>\u201cShould I take my shirt off?\u201d I asked. History dictated I should.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re over your self-indulgent modesty,\u201d she whispered. In the past, I would have found her words incendiary\u2014another time, another place\u2014but in our reimagining I found them to be... charming.</p><p>I\u2019d removed my shirt, enjoying the way Livvie\u2019s eyes lusted instead of feared. I took a chance and played along.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity I have nothing to bind you with. I\u2019d be hard-pressed to recall anyone who looks as good as you do in a collar and shackles.\u201d</p><p>Livvie turned and brought me a box from beneath her bed. Inside I found a jeweled collar, a leash, and a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. I laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh my, you have been a busy girl. When and where did you get these?\u201d</p><p>Livvie blushed and the memory was further reshaped.</p> <p>\u201cI ordered them online,\u201d she said timidly. Her hands were already behind her back and she swayed gently from side to side.</p><p>I kissed her. It was a light meeting of lips, a token.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d I ordered. Livvie shivered and a small sound escaped her lips. She complied quickly.</p><p>As I fed Livvie breakfast while she knelt at my feet, I was struck by several thoughts. First, I realized the power of forgiveness. Second, I found Livvie\u2019s game enticing. Third, I could never leave Livvie. Fourth, I never wanted to leave her.</p><p>For better or worse, Livvie had been irrevocably altered by her experiences with me. She was a nineteen-year-old with proclivities no one her age would understand and a vulnerability any creep like me could easily spot and take advantage of. She was strong, smart, willful, and driven, but she was also soft, trusting, and needy where her heart was concerned. Livvie needed taking care of.</p><p>Other changes in our relationship I didn\u2019t enjoy quite as much. As part of our pact, Livvie and I discussed our fears, hopes, and aspirations for what our relationship could be. She wanted to know more about my past, Mexico, and the less gruesome ways I\u2019d spent my year away from her.</p><p>Also, I wasn\u2019t comfortable with Livvie\u2019s writing. However, aside from the time we spent with Claudia and Rubio\u2014or having sex\u2014there seemed little else occupying Livvie\u2019s and my time. Apparently, I\u2019d inspired her to go \u201cback to the drawing board.\u201d She wanted to incorporate more of the facts I\u2019d given her.</p><p>Suddenly, there were days when she wouldn\u2019t speak to me because she\u2019d just finished rehashing some traumatic event involving me. There were some moments neither of us wanted to re-imagine. At first I tried try to seduce her away from her thoughts, but after the first few times she began to see it as manipulative. Soon after, I decided to make myself scarce during her periods of... well, her periods.</p><p>Other days, she took to cornering me on the sofa or at the dinner table to ask me invasive questions about my past. These usually ended in an argument over my \u201cevasiveness\u201d or sex. Sometimes we had both\u2014an argument first, and sex right after. I worried that if it kept up, I\u2019d get an erection every time she looked upset with me.</p><p>Yet, as with our sexual games, I began to see the merit in expressing myself through my conversations with Livvie. I began to realize I wasn\u2019t as upset by her questioning as I had been before. In slow gradations, I found myself offering information she hadn\u2019t asked about. I told her about RezA and how guilty I had felt for not warning him Narweh was dead. He\u2019d been such an optimistic person. He hadn\u2019t enjoyed his slavery any more than I had, but where I\u2019d been rebellious unto my own ruination, RezA had navigated his situation with grace.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he could have escaped? I mean, I\u2019ve heard that gun go off. The whole neighborhood probably knew someone had been shot. Couldn\u2019t he have heard it and escaped?\u201d Livvie asked.</p><p>This is going to sound absolutely ridiculous but... it hadn\u2019t f**king occurred to me! It really hadn\u2019t. I\u2019d been out of my mind. To this day, whenever I recall the moment of my first kill, there is no sound beyond the beating of my heart and the high-pitched wail of adrenaline in my veins. I remember the heavy weight of the gun. I remember the look of disgust on Narweh\u2019s face. I remember shutting my eyes and squeezing the trigger. I remember something wet splattering on my face before I hit the ground. I remember the silence.</p><p>I sat up and I heard nothing. I stared into Narweh\u2019s cold, empty eyes. I remember thinking the soul must be real. Something had been keeping Narweh alive. That something was gone. There was only meat, blood, and bones left behind.</p><p>I remember an acute feeling of anger and sorrow that I had not been brave enough to keep my eyes open. I remember thinking: I should have made him beg for my forgiveness. I should have made him plead for mercy. I should have raped him with the cane he used to beat me.</p><p>\u201cI... don\u2019t know if RezA could have escaped. I suppose it\u2019s possible,\u201d I said. I was dumbfounded. \u201cRafiq said he burned the building down with Narweh inside it. I guess... I didn\u2019t want to ask too many questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Livvie\u2019s hand rested on top of mine.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure Rafiq would like it,\u201d I said simply. \u201cI figured if he could burn a building full of people down and chat about it over breakfast, I had no business getting on his bad side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to do the math. When\u2019s my birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames. Seriously?\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cGive me a break. I\u2019ve never had to remember before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twenty-seven.\u201d She smiled a little sadly. I let myself think for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI guess I was... twelve, maybe thirteen?\u201d</p><p>Livvie sat back in her chair and stared at me.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d She shook her head and wiped at her eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Pet. At least... I think?\u201d I didn\u2019t mind opening up to Livvie (much), but afterward there was always the worry she would see me as weak. I didn\u2019t want her pity. I only wanted her to understand why it took so much effort on my part to give her what she needed. Though I was beginning to learn that what I thought Livvie needed and what she actually needed were sometimes two different things. Not often, but sometimes. There were days I could take my job as Livvie\u2019s protector overboard (drunk college boys should watch their mouths if they value having teeth).</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better than fine. I\u2019m so damn impressed with you. I feel like... the more I learn about your past... I had all these feelings I couldn\u2019t process in Mexico. When I tried to explain them to Reed or Sloan, I could see on their faces how ridiculous they thought I was.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to explain your feelings for an abused whore than a man who held you prisoner. Is that about the size and shape of it?\u201d I kept the sound of my balls shriveling from my voice.</p><p>Livvie appeared horrified.</p><p>\u201cNo! James... no. It\u2019s more like... you could be so cold. But when I was at my lowest, when I felt like I was hanging on by a thread... you always knew what to say. You have this ability to hold me and make me believe you. You\u2019re full of warmth and kindness.\u201d</p><p>I had to scoff at that, and Livvie slapped my arm.</p> <p>\u201cYou are!\u201d she insisted. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even see you in that room sometimes, but I could still feel it. I didn\u2019t understand where it came from, but when I hear you talk about the past it all makes sense to me.\u201d</p><p>Admittedly, I was a little embarrassed. I\u2019m not really accustomed to compliments, especially when they\u2019re intensely personal and genuine. The void almost felt... full. I, on the other hand, felt squirmy.</p><p>\u201cWell then. Good. I suppose. It\u2019s good that you think I\u2019m... nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, you look like I just farted in your general direction.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat! That\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p> <p>Livvie laughed. It was her incredibly loud cackle that meant she couldn\u2019t control herself. It was not a pretty sight, but I loved it when she laughed like that. I love it when she laughs like that.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s Monty Python.\u201d</p><p>I was laughing too. Livvie\u2019s laughter is too infectious not to take part in it.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a movie.\u201d She wiped tears from her eyes.</p><p>I pulled her hand toward my mouth and licked her finger. There are so many kinds of tears. I plan to collect them all.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to see it.\u201d</p><p>Livvie leaned forward and kissed my lips.</p><p>\u201cWell, we have to now. It\u2019s an older movie and over-the-top ridiculous, but I can\u2019t wait to see your face.\u201d</p><p>I made a face of the \u201cwhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d variety.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s disturbing when you do that. I always know when something big is about to happen because there you are, staring at me with your huge doe eyes.\u201d</p><p>Livvie shrugged.</p><p>\u201cNot my fault you\u2019re so nice to look at.\u201d Her expression turned ruefully judgmental. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I know who looks sexier with bruises.\u201d She poked the butterfly stitch on my eyebrow and I hissed.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Pet. That hurts.\u201d I\u2019d been visiting the gym a few times a week and sparring. I fought Fernando mostly, but other fighters from time to time. Some of them were even decent conversationalists, so long as the topic didn\u2019t stray from matches, fighting styles, or food intake. I was compelled to try a protein shake... once.</p> <p>\u201cOh? And it didn\u2019t hurt when that guy kicked you in the face?\u201d She made a fist and twisted it near the corner of her eye while sticking out her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cAre you calling me a cry baby?\u201d I stood and glared. Livvie\u2019s head was craned all the way back to meet my eyes. \u201cBig talk for such a little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared of you. I\u2019ll poke your band-aid.\u201d She puffed out her ample chest.</p><p>It was difficult to keep a straight face. Had I really been outmatched by her? The answer was a resounding yes.</p><p>\u201cYou poke my band-aid and you\u2019re going to have a serious problem.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her cheeks to keep from smiling. Slowly her hand reached up toward my eyebrow. Her eyes met mine. She considered. A flicker of excitement caused her to lick her bottom lip. She pressed her fingertip to my cut. I didn\u2019t wince.</p><p>\u201cIs this the part where I get angry and threaten to teach you a lesson?\u201d I asked calmly. Livvie practically vibrated with excitement.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She shivered.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you leave for work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a few hours.\u201d She sounded breathy.</p><p>\u201cWell then.\u201d I caressed her face so I could watch the way she closed her eyes to savor my touch. With my other hand, I grabbed a fistful of hair and pulled. \u201cLet\u2019s go teach you some manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me again. Why are we spending our romantic evening with Claudia and Rubio? If romance is what you\u2019re after, it seems counterproductive to have other people in attendance.\u201d I\u2019d forgotten my shoes in my hotel room and we were forced to go and retrieve them. The clock in my dash display reminded me we were supposed to pick up the other couple in an hour.</p><p>\u201cBecause, Best Boyfriend in the World, it\u2019ll be fun. Also, Rubi really wanted to take Claudia somewhere nice. He\u2019s been saving up since Christmas. Can Fabes is supposed to have amazing food. I still don\u2019t know how you managed to make reservations. How did you get reservations anyway? It was pretty short notice.\u201d Livvie checked her lipstick in the visor mirror for the third time. I think she just liked the way her lips looked in red. So did I.</p><p>\u201cIt was short notice because you didn\u2019t tell me I was supposed to plan something. Valentine\u2019s Day? I\u2019ve heard of it, but I had no idea people actually participated in such... sentimentality. Don\u2019t they get enough of that during Thanksgiving and Christmas?\u201d I put my blinker on and moved to the passing lane to get around someone in what appeared to be a golf cart. Fuel-efficient cars. Bleh!</p><p>\u201cChanging the subject, James. I\u2019m on to your tactics.\u201d Livvie glared. A smile played on her lips.</p><p>\u201cI went down to the restaurant in person and charmed the hostess. She was very amenable.\u201d I grinned. Livvie\u2019s smile turned sour. \u201cYou asked.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to flirt with another girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I flirted. I said I was charming. I simply explained that I was a cad who\u2019d made the grievous mistake of not acquiring reservations to take my beautiful girlfriend and her entourage to dinner on the most romantic day of the year. I told her I\u2019d be lost without you and that anything she could do to help me keep your favor would be worthy of my deepest gratitude. Then I tipped her a day\u2019s wages.\u201d I kept my eyes forward, though I knew my expression remained smug.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Livvie said. She grabbed my hand and put it in both of hers, squeezing.</p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d I countered. \u201cAs if anyone else could hold my attention.\u201d I squeezed her hand in return.</p><p>\u201cI got you a present,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cKitten,\u201d I admonished. \u201cWe already exchanged gifts.\u201d I\u2019d given her pearls. She\u2019d gifted me with the sight of her in a red cape and heels high enough to nearly put us at eye level. It had been a very short but enjoyable chase. No one could run in those things. I forbid her to wear them outside the house.</p><p>\u201cRelax. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d She opened her purse and took out a box of candy. I laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt looks open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ate most of them,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou are so strange sometimes, Pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMethod to my madness, Sexy. Open your hand.\u201d I complied and she put the heart-shaped candies in my palm. When I looked at them, I felt as though someone had squeezed my heart. All the candies read \u201cBe Mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already yours, Pet. And you\u2019re mine.\u201d Stuffing my mouth full of candy hearts may have lessened the romance of the moment, but Livvie didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>\u201cYes, yours,\u201d she said. She kissed my cheek.</p><p>I felt in my heart the affirmation of what I had come to suspect was true for some time. What she really meant was: I love you.</p><p>After retrieving my shoes and picking up Claudia and Rubio (I have never been comfortable with calling that man Rubi), we arrived at the restaurant with ten minutes to spare. I felt the slightest bit awkward as we approached the hostess. She was the same woman from the week before and she smiled warmly. However, I didn\u2019t miss the way her eyebrow lifted as she saw the young crowd I\u2019d brought with me. I could never be ashamed of Livvie, but traveling with three younger people made me feel... old. There had been a time when it wouldn\u2019t have bothered me because I had no idea of my age. Regardless, the hostess greeted us warmly.</p><p>\u201cSe\u00f1or Cole.\u201d She pointed us in the direction of our waiter, who greeted us with a smile and asked us to follow him.</p><p>\u201cYour last name is Cole? Like Sophia\u2019s?\u201d Claudia sounded incredulous.</p><p>\u201cStrange coincidence,\u201d I said.</p><p>Claudia shrugged and it made her look younger, despite the very adult cocktail dress she was wearing.</p><p>\u201cI guess if you ever get married you won\u2019t argue about whether or not Sophia will change her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaudia,\u201d Livvie hissed.</p><p>The waiter averted his gaze with a tight-lipped smile as he ushered us into our seats. I helped Livvie out of her coat and pulled out her chair (six months prior I couldn\u2019t open a door). Rubio, upon witnessing my impeccable boyfriend skills, assisted Claudia. The ladies seemed to appreciate it very much.</p><p>\u201cI will give you a moment to go over the menu while I check your coats.\u201d The waiter walked away with the coats. I watched him speak to the hostess and surmised she was supposed to check our coats when we arrived. I hoped I didn\u2019t get her into any trouble. Then again, she should have done her job. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you for inviting us,\u201d Rubio said to me. He is ever the gentleman, and I often wonder how Claudia has managed to keep him. Then I am reminded of me and Livvie. Stranger things have happened.</p><p>\u201cThank you for helping me choose the restaurant. I\u2019m not overly familiar with the area.\u201d I winked and Rubio repressed a smile. The concierge at my hotel had told me about the restaurant, but there was no harm in helping Rubio impress his date.</p><p>\u201cRubi is so modest.\u201d Claudia turned to her boyfriend. \u201cYou never told me you helped plan this.\u201d She kissed him on the cheek. Rubio blushed (poor bastard).</p><p>\u201cIt was... a surprise.\u201d</p> <p>Livvie\u2019s hand squeezed my thigh.</p><p>\u201cAww, you guys are so sweet you\u2019re going to make me puke.\u201d She and I laughed at the other couple\u2019s discomfort. Did they have any idea whom they were out to dinner with?</p><p>Claudia composed herself quickly.</p><p>\u201cLike you guys are any better. You\u2019re always undressing each other with your eyes. I\u2019m surprised you even left the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man has to eat,\u201d I said. \u201cAlso, I undress her with more than my eyes. Sometimes I use my teeth.\u201d Livvie blushed to her roots while the rest of us laughed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad she finally met someone. Rubi and I were trying to set her up for a while. We thought she might be g*y and ashamed to tell us. I even told her about kissing my friend Bettany so she would come out, but she never did.\u201d Claudia has a tendency to impart too much information, but when it comes to Livvie, I often enjoy what she has to say.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a friend named Bettany,\u201d Livvie said. She sounded put-out, but it was all for show.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know that,\u201d said Claudia. \u201cI was just trying to let you know I was okay with you being g*y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not g*y!\u201d Livvie said with mock exasperation. She covered her face when the waiter chose that exact moment to return to our table.</p><p>Though I was sure he had overheard, the waiter kept a professional demeanor. We all managed to compose ourselves enough to order dinner and wine. Livvie thought Europe was \u201cawesome\u201d for no other reason than a person could drink legally drink at age eighteen. Of course, if you could reach the bar they\u2019d serve you.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you ever want to experiment with a woman\u2014under my close guidance, of course\u2014I\u2019d be alright with it.\u201d I smiled cheekily toward Livvie and lifted a brow for good measure.</p> <p>Livvie shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI bet you would.\u201d Her hand cupped my balls beneath the table. Her eyes widened as she felt the stirring of my arousal. \u201cLater,\u201d she whispered. I wondered if she meant she\u2019d please me later, or if I\u2019d get to see her kiss and touch another woman later. Either way\u2014lucky me.</p><p>The rest of dinner went on in the same jovial fashion. Claudia and Livvie took care of most of the conversation. I preferred it that way, and Rubio seemed to as well. Livvie was witty and Claudia so uncouth that one couldn\u2019t help but be amused by the pair of them. The sprite and her boyfriend were growing on me\u2014like a fungus.</p><p>After dinner and an attempt at dancing (I am not a good dancer), I returned Claudia and Rubio home. Rubio, being the gentleman that he is, tried to slip his share of dinner into my pocket, but I wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>\u201cBuy her something expensive. Nothing makes a woman more agreeable in the bedroom,\u201d I said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already agreeable,\u201d retorted Claudia. \u201cRubi may seem quiet, but you know what they say about the quiet ones.\u201d</p><p>Rubi laughed even as he blushed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s drunk. I better take her inside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes! Take me!\u201d Claudia pulled Rubio toward her and mauled his face with her mouth. It went on so long I decided to drive off. I saw Rubio wave as he kept kissing.</p><p>Livvie was stretched out in the passenger seat. She was blissfully drunk, and by the way she was rubbing herself, I knew I\u2019d have my own hands full once we got home.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you need from your apartment? I\u2019d rather stay at the hotel tonight.\u201d I stroked her with one hand whenever I wasn\u2019t shifting.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked dreamily.</p><p>\u201cAll of my things are in my hotel room. Your apartment is closer to where we are. We may as well stop and get your things if you need something,\u201d I said. I hated sleeping without Livvie. The nightmares were significantly diminished when she was next to me.</p><p>\u201cBut I want you. I don\u2019t want to wait,\u201d she whined. She was very intoxicated, and part of me suspected there would be no sex for me that night.</p><p>\u201cI want you, too. It\u2019s a pity we live so far apart. Claudia and Rubio don\u2019t have that problem.\u201d</p><p>Livvie suddenly seemed very sober, if you didn\u2019t take her huge eyes into consideration.</p><p>\u201cAre you... do you want to move into my apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said definitively.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She seemed at once relieved and disappointed. She turned away and stared out the window for a few minutes, then, angrily, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your apartment is small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Confusion.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to move in with me, Sophia. I\u2019ll leave the hotel, you\u2019ll leave your apartment, and we\u2019ll buy a place that\u2019s ours.\u201d Silence filled the vehicle for what felt like endless hours.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d I asked, incredulous. What sort of response was that?</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she repeated and put her hand in mine.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.</p><p>The void was overflowing.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>We moved into our new flat in April. Though I thought otherwise, Livvie insisted it was the perfect birthday gift to move into our new home on her birthday. She\u2019d insisted her birthday was just the leverage she would need to coerce her friends into helping her move her things. She didn\u2019t want movers, she said. It made her feel awkward enough that I had purchased our home and put it in her name. I insisted it was better than putting it in the name of someone who didn\u2019t legally exist. She agreed but couldn\u2019t abide by making strangers move her.</p><p>For my part, I was something akin to excited. It seems wrong for a man to be \u201cexcited\u201d; it sounds too much like an emotion for a school girl. I\u2019d wanted to buy the house outright, but I thought that might be suspicious if the FBI decided to poke around. Instead, I had Livvie remove the amount of the down payment from her fund and put it in a safe deposit box. I then used that sum of cash to pay the bank.</p><p>Eventually, I was going to have to enlist the help of some former acquaintances to keep up appearances where Livvie\u2019s new lifestyle was concerned. The FBI couldn\u2019t necessarily touch us in Spain, but it was best not to provoke attention by living outside the means they knew Livvie was capable of. For better or worse, I didn\u2019t tell Livvie about my plans involving illicit activity. I was becoming a very well-behaved boyfriend, but I was still me.</p><p>We\u2019d purchased an enormous property that had been vacant for some time. Livvie and I had a good laugh over the number of windows. There was hardly a dark corner to be found, and light flooded every nook and cranny. I thought it very apropos. We\u2019d spent enough time in the dark. However, because there were some things I liked to do with Livvie that should never see the light of day, I made sure the bedrooms had drapes.</p><p>The home had been furnished to best display its vaulted ceilings, marble countertops, bowl sinks, sunken living rooms, and wood and stone accoutrements. I\u2019d made an offer to purchase it as it was. It was the perfect excuse to talk Livvie into donating her furniture to Claudia and Rubio (let him deal with all the bed pillows). She\u2019s raised her eyebrows at me, but ultimately didn\u2019t resist. I\u2019d already been looking at houses for some time. By the time Livvie and I started taking tours, I\u2019d narrowed the list significantly. It had been a test of my cunning to push Livvie toward \u201cchoosing\u201d the flat I wanted on her own. I was ultimately successful.</p><p>All in all, the home suggested a certain level of wealth, but not enough to raise eyebrows. Our neighbors were professionals, not celebrities. It was the sort of place we could grow into and live in for quite some time. I planned on converting one of the larger rooms upstairs into a library/office for Livvie. I\u2019d already claimed the downstairs for a project of my later choosing.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me this is the last box.\u201d Claudia lay sprawled on the hardwood floor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that much stuff, Claudia. Stop whining.\u201d Livvie put down the box she was carrying and wiped sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand. I caught her looking around with a wondrous expression and my chest expanded. Making her happy was more reward than I\u2019d ever expected. I was once again struck by a sense of purpose. One I could take pride in.</p><p>I stepped over Claudia and spoke to Livvie. \u201cThere\u2019s Coke in the fridge. I picked some up, along with a case of water. I\u2019ll go to the grocery in a little while for more supplies. I owe you a birthday dinner at the very least.\u201d I kissed Livvie on the forehead on my way out the door. The moving van was empty and Rubio was going to follow me to drop it off and bring me back.</p><p>He was waiting for me outside. He was actually dressed for function instead of fashion. It was amusing to see him in loose jeans, sneakers, and a t-shirt. He looked even younger than he already was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. The women can handle the unpacking while we\u2019re gone. I want to stop at the grocery on the way back. We can pick up some steaks for dinner.\u201d I ruffled Rubio\u2019s hair as I passed him. He laughed and turned toward his car. I\u2019d never done more than shake his hand until that moment. However, over the last few months we\u2019d become friends of a kind. I could never confide in him, but he looked up to me and I\u2019d begun to take him under my wing, so to speak.</p><p>\u201cSounds good. We can pick up a cake for Sophia.\u201d He smiled. He\u2019d sort of taken me under his wing as well. Rubio gave me insight into Livvie\u2019s youth. She was downplaying the importance of her birthday, but he knew she still wanted a little spectacle. I planned on giving her quite the spectacle later when we were alone. But cake was nice too.</p><p>\u201cGreat idea,\u201d I said. As I pulled away, I couldn\u2019t help but look at Livvie\u2019s and my new home in the rearview. Had I really moved on? Had I left the man I was behind? I didn\u2019t know for certain. However, the knowledge that Livvie would be the first person I saw every morning and the last person I would see every night was more comfort than I\u2019d ever allowed myself. My new life with her was everything. As much as it terrified me to think I was nothing without her, I was only too happy to have her for any amount of time fate would allow. Of course, if and when fate decided to try and wrest her from my arms, I would fight like the bastard I was to keep her.</p> <p>After we dropped off the van, Rubio and I picked up some groceries and a cake for Livvie. I was exhausted, but I was looking forward to making Livvie\u2019s birthday special. Selfishly, I couldn\u2019t wait until everyone else left and Livvie and I could enjoy our first night in our new home.</p><p>\u201cI hope Sophia likes our gift. We\u2019re not ballin\u2019 out of control like you.\u201d Rubio grinned and tossed some of his fastidious hair out of his face. I was constantly tempted to take scissors to it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll love whatever it is. You\u2019re her friends\u2014you probably know her better than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. She\u2019s different with you. She\u2019s happier. When Claudia and I first met her, she was kinda quiet. She didn\u2019t like to talk about things: her family, where she grew up. Claudia felt sorry for her, said she must be very lonely.\u201d</p><p>I frowned.</p> <p>\u201cSophia doesn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s pity. She\u2019s too strong for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like that.\u201d Rubio appeared wounded. \u201cClaudia just doesn\u2019t like to see people unhappy. She doesn\u2019t show it, but she\u2019s very sensitive. She has a very big heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, incredulous. The sprite was brash and rude. I liked her, but I had my doubts about her soft mushy insides.</p><p>Rubio, for the first time, looked irritated.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know, would you? I do.\u201d</p><p>I had to laugh.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend you. Claudia is a good friend. She\u2019s just... well, you know.\u201d</p><p>Rubio\u2019s anger faded quickly.</p><p>\u201cYes. I know. The night we met, a friend of mine dragged me to a party. There was a girl I liked and I was heartbroken because I found out she started seeing someone else. I wanted to stay home but I went out anyway. Claudia saw me and she came over to me. She\u2019s a big ball of happy energy and she insisted I cheer up. I told her about the girl and she told me to forget about her because I was her boyfriend.\u201d Rubio had a stupid grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou belong together,\u201d I said. Rubio seemed to like that. \u201cTell me more about Sophia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe used to be sad. We cheered her up, but only for so long. I used to leave her and Claudia alone sometimes because I think it upset Sophia to see us so happy. She never said, but it was a vibe we got. That\u2019s why we tried to set her up so much.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThen she met you. She\u2019s happy now. I hope you understand how lucky you are. I don\u2019t know much about her past, but I know she is a good person. You should be careful with her.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Rubio and his expression was very serious. Rubio was a good man.</p><p>\u201cI plan to make Sophia very happy, Rubio. You don\u2019t have to tell me what I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cI never want to fight you.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed. I couldn\u2019t help it. I was picturing Rubio trying to fight me.</p><p>\u201cI never want that either, Rubio.\u201d</p><p>Things were considerably less pleasant when we finally arrived home. Claudia met us in the driveway and the expression on her face gave me heart palpitations.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d I asked. I was already rushing toward the house. I didn\u2019t hear what Claudia was trying to tell me.</p><p>\u201cSophia!\u201d I yelled. I bounded up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in here!\u201d she responded from the bedroom. A wave of relief shivered through me. She was safe. There was no danger. Our lives were different. It took me a moment to settle. I\u2019d thought I was going to have to hurt someone.</p><p>When I walked into the bedroom, Livvie was sitting on the bed. She\u2019d been crying, and there was a letter in her hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Pet?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just...\u201d She wiped at her eyes and sniffled.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Did I do something?\u201d I hated when Livvie was sad. I no longer relished the sight of those tears. They were bitter on my tongue.</p><p>\u201cNo, Baby. It\u2019s not you.\u201d She\u2019d never called me baby before\u2014well, not in a positive way.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d I sat next to her on the bed and she instantly found her way under my arm and against my chest. I rubbed her back and waited. Livvie was a talker and I knew she\u2019d come out with it eventually.</p><p>\u201cMy mom sent me a birthday card. I brought my mail over and there was an unmarked envelope. I wasn\u2019t ready for it.\u201d She buried herself further in my chest.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s relationship with her family presented a quandary. I wanted her to be happy. I wanted her to have all the things she desired. However, I wanted to be a part of her happiness. I wanted to be the largest part. Her family could threaten that\u2014they could threaten us, what we had. I needed to tread carefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat did it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she\u2019s sorry. She says she misses me, that they all miss me: my brothers, my sisters. She wants to know if we can work things out.\u201d Livvie sobbed and held me tighter.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want, Pet?\u201d I wanted her to say no. I wanted her to say I was the only person she needed and to hell with the rest of them. But I knew what that would mean. I\u2019d been orphaned. I might have one living parent, but as far as I was concerned I was still an orphan.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. It\u2019s always me. I don\u2019t want to be the thing that keeps you from the people you love.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure what I was trying to say, I just knew it hurt like hell to say it. Livvie\u2019s relationship with me was always going to alienate her from the rest of the world and I was too selfish to change that.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t!\u201d Livvie insisted. \u201cThings were shit between us before you and I ever met. You know that, it\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your mother. They\u2019re your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d She kissed my chest and went back to lying against me. \u201cWe\u2019ve bled for each other. That\u2019s more than I can say for my \u2018blood\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I inhaled sharply. While I found her words moving, they were also troubling.</p><p>\u201cThat was my fault too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb, is this about you? Are you trying to make me angry with you? You make me happy. Today was one of the best days I\u2019ve ever had. Don\u2019t ruin it by making this about us. This is about my mom and the way she manipulates everything. At least you had reasons for what you did to me. She\u2019s my mother. What the f**k were her reasons, Caleb? What were her reasons for treating me like shit and then waiting five days to come see me in the hospital?\u201d Livvie sat up. Her fists were clenched around what I presumed was her birthday card.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kitten. I didn\u2019t mean to make it about me. Here\u2019s what I know: You deserve to be happy. If getting the answers to your questions is going to give you peace, you owe yourself that much. If you\u2019re done with her, that\u2019s okay too... but I don\u2019t think you are.\u201d I pulled her back into my arms. I didn\u2019t know if I did it to comfort her or myself, but it seemed to help us both.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll call her next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered. It was all I could manage.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t leave.\u201d Livvie\u2019s arms gripped me tight.</p><p>\u201cI promise. Can you say the same?\u201d I almost dreaded the answer.</p><p>\u201cI promise. I\u2019m yours,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia? Should we go?\u201d Claudia shouted from downstairs.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Livvie said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be down in a minute.\u201d She sat up and kissed me, softly at first, and then passionately. I pulled her to me and caressed her br**sts. She broke the kiss. \u201cLater, Sexy. We have all the time in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to hold you to that.\u201d I kissed her one more time.</p><p>\u201cGood. I love it when you hold me.\u201d She smiled and I could see she was in a better place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I went downstairs to keep our friends company while Livvie cleaned herself up. Once she came down, we dined on arroz con gandules and steak. We had birthday cake for dessert, and I will always remember the smile on Livvie\u2019s face when she blew out her candles.</p><p>That night, after everyone else had left and we were finally alone, Livvie and I sat on our new sofa and stared into the flames of our new fireplace.</p><p>\u201cThank you, James. I had a great birthday.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled.</p> <p>\u201cMoving boxes, emotional trauma, and birthday cake\u2014you\u2019re easy to please.\u201d</p><p>She nudged my ribs.</p><p>\u201cButthead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you have that one since it\u2019s your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of, do I get a present?\u201d I could hear the smile in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cYes. Do you want it?\u201d I coaxed.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, but first... I believe it\u2019s customary to give the birthday girl a spanking.\u201d</p><p>Livvie squirmed.</p><p>\u201cBut... I\u2019m so tired!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Less chance of you moving around so much.\u201d I adjusted our bodies and placed her over my lap. It was the most uninspired spanking I\u2019ve ever delivered. She giggled through the entirety of it and I did nothing to curb her behavior.</p> <p>\u201cAww, you went soft on me.\u201d She was still laughing between panting breaths.</p><p>\u201cThere are no drapes in the living room. I don\u2019t want to scare the neighbors just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God. I forgot about the windows.\u201d She scrambled up and sat in my lap. \u201cThey probably think we\u2019re perverts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. Now, kind sir, my present please.\u201d She held out both hands. I lifted her off my lap and we walked upstairs.</p><p>I\u2019m going to interject now and tell you upfront that I won\u2019t be sharing the details of my gift to Livvie. Don\u2019t pout! It\u2019s simply too embarrassing to rehash. However, as I don\u2019t want to read the incessant questions about it on the internet, I\u2019ll tell you this: It involved recreating another of Livvie\u2019s memories... of me... alone... in the shower. Make your own panties wet! I\u2019m moving on to the next chapter.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>I was dreaming. I hate it when I dream, but for the first time in recent memory... it was good. I was having the kind of dream a person doesn\u2019t wish to wake up from. Rafiq was there, but it wasn\u2019t really him. It was a version of him I\u2019d never know and that he could never be. His presence made it obvious I was dreaming, but his company added something and I chose to go along.</p> <p>Livvie and I were having a party. We were celebrating my birthday. There were lots of people I didn\u2019t recognize, but Livvie seemed to know them. I think one of them was her mother. They were in the kitchen together, pouring champagne into long flutes. One of Livvie\u2019s sisters was trying to convince them she could have a glass. She looked the way I imagine Livvie looked as a child. Livvie looked so happy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done well, Khoya. I\u2019m proud of you. You deserve this,\u201d Rafiq said. He clapped me on the back and ruffled my hair the way he used to when I was a boy. I swatted his hand away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child. Stop doing that.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re a man now. You have a family of your own. Perhaps I am only reminiscing over the boy I knew.\u201d He ruffled my hair again and I didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you could come. I don\u2019t have any other family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re orphans, Caleb. We make our own families.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYes, I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest? Do you remember that as well?\u201d Sadness had crept into his voice.</p><p>\u201cI forgave you. It\u2019s all led me here.\u201d I looked toward Livvie and her mother. They waved at me and I raised a hand to acknowledge them.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this guy? He looks rather interesting and scary.\u201d Claudia bumped into my side and nearly pushed me into Rafiq.</p><p>\u201cDo you always have to be so forceful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it when I\u2019m not the center of attention.\u201d She winked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday!\u201d I chided. Claudia shrugged.</p><p>I introduced Claudia to Rafiq and made a hasty exit. She was already asking him intimate questions about his role in my life. Rafiq looked like he\u2019d smelled something foul and I laughed. He deserved it.</p><p>As I walked into the main living room, Rubio was working on connecting the PlayStation. He turned toward me when I came in.</p><p>\u201cGive me a hand, James? I can\u2019t seem to do anything in these ridiculously skinny pants.\u201d Rubio is a quiet guy. My head couldn\u2019t create inventive dialogue for him.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t quite put the PlayStation together either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dreaming, Rubio. I can\u2019t put this shit together. Hold on.\u201d I kicked the PlayStation and all the cables were magically connected.</p><p>\u201cNice! Someday, when Claudia stops coddling me like an infant, I hope you can teach me how to be more of a man,\u201d Rubio said (it\u2019s my dream\u2014stop judging me).</p><p>\u201cYou can start by taking care of this.\u201d I took out a pair of scissors from my pocket and cut the large hank of hair covering most of his face. There was a large round of applause.</p><p>\u201cOkay everyone, it\u2019s time to sing Happy Birthday!\u201d The crowd parted for Livvie as she walked out of the kitchen holding a large chocolate cake covered in candles.</p><p>Happy birthday to you.</p><p>Happy birthday to you.</p><p>Happy birthday dear, James.</p><p>Happy birthday to you.</p><p>I scrunched my face. When had I learned that song?</p><p>Wake up, Birthday Boy. It\u2019s time for one of your presents.</p><p>Something soft touched my face.</p><p>Wake up, Sexy. It\u2019s your birthday.</p><p>I smiled both inside and outside the dream. Livvie. She was real. She was with me. She was mine. If the dream had been good\u2014and it had been\u2014waking up had been even better.</p><p>I opened my eyes slowly. Reality and fantasy rearranged themselves in my mind until everything was clear. I smiled when I saw Livvie standing by the side of the bed. She raised her arm and tickled my face with a long feather. I rubbed my nose.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what that\u2019s for,\u201d I said. My voice was rough. I yawned and stretched.</p><p>\u201cWant me to tickle your penis?\u201d She flicked the feather over the tent in the sheets.</p><p>I put my hand over my erection and turned away.</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not for you. I have to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell get up! I have a whole day of birthday activities planned and you\u2019re spoiling my fun with your sleeping... and your pee boner.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cI hate when you call it that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well I hate that I can\u2019t play with it. Why the hell is it so hard if I\u2019m not supposed to play with it? That\u2019s false advertising, Mister.\u201d</p><p>I flopped onto my back and threw my arms across my eyes.</p><p>\u201cFine. Ravage me. But don\u2019t expect to go anywhere for a while.\u201d The last time she mounted my morning erection I couldn\u2019t come for over an hour. Livvie had to take a nap when we finished and the whole morning had been appropriated.</p><p>\u201cLe sigh. It\u2019s going to have to wait. We have plans. Now, get up!\u201d Livvie put her hands on my stomach and bounced me up and down.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I really had to piss. I grabbed Livvie around her waist and pulled her into the bed with me. She squealed as I tickled her. \u201cI\u2019m going to do this until you pee!\u201d Her legs were kicking, but I threw the comforter over them until she was trapped.</p><p>\u201cOh, god! Oh, please. Please stop!\u201d She was laughing despite the panic I could see in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you sorry?\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cYes! Please!\u201d Livvie was panting by the time I stopped tickling her. She smiled up at me.</p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t brushed your teeth.\u201d She wrinkled her nose.</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I asked.\u201d I was already leaning down toward her mouth. I kept it brief. I hopped off of her quickly and made my way into the bathroom before she could try to retaliate.</p><p>There was a knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cMeet me downstairs when you\u2019re done. I made breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.</p><p>Once I was done using the bathroom, I washed my hands and brushed my teeth. As I wiped my face on a purple hand towel (Livvie had worked her frilly girl-magic in our bathroom), I stared at myself in the mirror. It was my first birthday. I was twenty-eight. The feeling was surreal. I wondered if I looked my age.</p><p>This is my life. I was a whore in my youth, a killer since my adolescence, and a monster as a man. Who am I now? What am I now? I shrugged.</p><p>Livvie and I had been living together for about four months. It had taken some getting used to in the beginning. I wasn\u2019t accustomed to having another person around me every day. Although, having already spent so much time with Livvie during her captivity and also having made every effort to see her often while we were dating made it somewhat easier to adjust. If I needed to hide out for a while, I would usually go upstairs to work on Livvie\u2019s library/office some more. Otherwise, I was downstairs working on building new sets to exorcise my perversions (a few of the perversions were her ideas). Livvie made me put a lock on the door so no one would accidentally stumble across it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Livvie didn\u2019t seem to have much of an adjusting issue at all. She explained she was used to a house full of loud people. If anything, she sometimes didn\u2019t like the size of the house. She said it was so big it felt empty sometimes. However, Claudia and Rubio practically lived with us, so that didn\u2019t last very long. On the days Livvie needed to be alone, she was usually upstairs writing on her laptop.</p><p>I was ever changing and discovered that while some things would always make me uncomfortable\u2014Livvie\u2019s new phone-relationship with her mother, meeting new people, attending film festivals (I love Livvie, but some of those people are so dull!), and explaining my lack of actual employment\u2014I was happy being James. Admittedly, there were moments when I missed my former life, but for the most part I was becoming more comfortable with my new life and the things that came with it: Livvie, friends, and... birthdays.</p><p>Livvie was impatiently waiting for me once I reached the bottom of the stairs. She\u2019d made small pancakes with strawberries and bacon. They were arranged in a smile on my plate.</p><p>\u201cI was expecting a bowl of cereal,\u201d I quipped.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m saving that for tomorrow,\u201d she replied. She came around the counter and put her hands on my face. \u201cHappy birthday, Sexy.\u201d She pressed her lips to mine. She tasted like orange juice and syrup. I chased the sweetness of her tongue, pulling her toward me until I felt her go soft in my arms.</p><p>Livvie once told me I stole her breath when we kissed. She said it was as though I filtered the very air she breathed into her lungs. I thought it was more of her flowery words. However, once the thought was planted in my mind, I began to pay particular attention. Yes, I felt something too. I loved the moment Livvie gave herself to me. She became nothing but her instincts. She swayed. She whimpered. She rubbed against me.</p><p>I let my hands travel down her back and over her rounded ass. I pulled up her skirt. I was seconds away from putting my thumbs in her panties and pulling them down when my efforts were thwarted.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sexy, not right now.\u201d She put her hands behind her in an attempt stop my mauling.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cRight now.\u201d I grabbed her hands and held them in my left. With my free hand I began slipping her panties down. I placed sucking kisses across her shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cJames,\u201d she groaned. \u201cThe windows.\u201d</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>\u201cDammit! I\u2019m putting in drapes. Today!\u201d I said, exasperated. What did I have to do to get laid on my birthday?</p><p>Livvie pulled away and righted her clothing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be upset.\u201d She kissed me quickly before she scurried back into the kitchen to get her own breakfast. \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty of time to play \u2018Kitten\u2019s been a naughty girl\u2019 later. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe better,\u201d I grumbled. I picked up a piece of bacon and put it in my mouth. Rafiq wasn\u2019t what one would call a devout Muslim, but I was pretty sure he would roll over in his grave at the sight of me devouring bacon. I, for one, really enjoyed it in moderation. \u201cSo what do you have planned for me today? Please tell me it doesn\u2019t involve leaving the house.\u201d</p> <p>Livvie glared at me ruefully.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a geezer, Sexy. Let\u2019s get out of here and have some fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate fun.\u201d</p><p>Livvie laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou would. Good thing you\u2019ll never have to put out a personal ad.\u201d She assumed her ridiculous parody of my voice. \u201cHey, I\u2019m James. I\u2019m twenty-eight years old. I enjoy kicks to the face, having sex on kitchen counters, stalking my girlfriend, and telling kids to get off my lawn. I also hate fun. If you do too, hit me up.\u201d She was nearly doubled over while laughing at her own joke.</p><p>\u201cI do not stalk you... anymore. Also, I\u2019ve never yelled at anyone to get off our lawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Claudia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe front yard is not a place to tan.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the memory of turning the sprinklers on Claudia. She\u2019d been mad as a hornet. I\u2019d let her process her anger on the porch before Livvie let her back inside.</p> <p>Livvie and I joked a lot over breakfast. Livvie is the only person I know who can make me furious one second and laugh the next. She likes to say I\u2019m contrary, but I feel the same dichotomy is present in her. I suppose it keeps things interesting.</p><p>Livvie could not have planned a more perfect day. To begin, she assured me we would be spending the day alone. As much as I had come to like Claudia and Rubio, the only person I wanted to spend my first birthday with was Livvie. I never had to pretend with her. I could be myself\u2014whoever that happened to be from one moment to the next.</p><p>Livvie was full of charm and whimsy. Since I\u2019d missed out on so many birthdays, she was determined to show me what I\u2019d missed. The first place she took me to was a go-kart racing track. Though small, the karts could reach speeds of up to forty-five miles an hour. Livvie won four out of seven races\u2014she weighs less than me, so her car was inevitably faster. All things being equal, I\u2019m sure I could have won every time. Of course, Livvie didn\u2019t quite see it that way. She is a very sore winner.</p><p>After go-karts, we ate pizza and played video games in the arcade upstairs. Livvie was no match for me when it came to shooting games, and I think we spent close to thirty Euros pumping change into a game called Area 51. If the earth is ever attacked by aliens, you\u2019re welcome to stand behind me.</p><p>By early evening, we were just finishing up eighteen holes of glow-in-the-dark mini golf. I was having one of the best days of my life and was spending it with the best person in my life. I couldn\u2019t wait to get Livvie home and express my gratitude to her for being everything I needed and far more than I deserved.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that, Pet. You\u2019re cheating.\u201d I glared at Livvie as she picked up her ball and reset it on the mat.</p><p>\u201cYou distracted me. I should get to try again. It\u2019s the last hole.\u201d She stuck her tongue out.</p><p>\u201cI distracted you while I was standing here being quiet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you try again if you tell me you love me.\u201d I smiled my most wicked smile. The one I liked to give her just before I stripped her down and had my filthy way.</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d she said with a grin. She hit the ball and it rolled part way up the green before it failed to make it over the ice cream hill and rolled back toward her.</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get.\u201d Livvie kept hitting her ball until she made it into the hole. She was a sore winner and a very quiet loser.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d she asked as we were leaving.</p><p>\u201cNot really. We\u2019ve had a lot of junk.\u201d I hit the unlock button to the BMW.</p><p>\u201cWell, just say you\u2019re hungry so I can suggest a place for dinner.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving!\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMe too! Luckily, I know of this new Italian place that opened up. We should go there.\u201d</p><p>I opened the door for Livvie and she gave me a kiss on the cheek before she got inside. I slid behind the wheel, and as I put the vehicle in gear to leave the parking lot, Livvie\u2019s hand was already on my thigh. She explained where to go while her fingers gently stroked me.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Kitten,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Sexy. Are you enjoying your birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmensely. I think tomorrow I\u2019m going to try and find that arcade game.\u201d Retirement had opened me up to new hobbies. I discovered I really like video games.</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d Livvie scoffed. \u201cYou better not start ignoring me.\u201d She was pouting, but her heart wasn\u2019t in it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who encouraged me to get a PlayStation. I\u2019m not the only bad influence in this vehicle.\u201d I casually put my hand on top of hers and held it the twenty minutes it took to get to the restaurant. When we arrived, I realized Livvie had lied to me about spending the entire day alone. Claudia and Rubio were already waiting to be seated. They held bags in their hands.</p><p>Claudia appeared giddy, and after hugging Livvie, she tossed herself at me.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday!\u201d She planted a kiss on each of my cheeks. I begrudgingly returned the embrace and the kisses. Claudia is a good friend, and though I hate to admit it, I\u2019d do most anything for her and Rubio.</p><p>Rubio shook my hand and wished me a happy birthday. He was wearing a pink shirt with grey pinstripes beneath a dark grey sweater and black slacks. It wasn\u2019t bad actually\u2014for a moment he had me contemplating pink. Then I realized the shade matched the summer dress Claudia was wearing and I scrapped the idea. Livvie and I will never wear matching outfits. No!</p><p>\u201cThere is a fair in town. Claudia and I are going after dinner. You\u2019re welcome to come with us if you don\u2019t have other plans,\u201d Rubio said on the way to our table.</p><p>I looked ahead at Livvie, who was busy gabbing with Claudia about beating me at go-kart racing. She conveniently didn\u2019t supply the results of our shooting spree or mini-golf tournament. I smirked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll probably head home after dinner. I have one last gift waiting for me and I\u2019m eager to open it.\u201d</p><p>Rubio blushed.</p><p>\u201cI... yeah, ok.\u201d I nudged him with my shoulder and we laughed.</p><p>We ordered appetizers and salad since no one was particularly hungry. The restaurant was quaint and quiet. Most likely it was owned and operated by a single family. The food tasted homemade and was delicious. I almost wished I hadn\u2019t eaten so much pizza earlier, but it was difficult to regret any part of the day I\u2019d had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs it time for gifts? I\u2019m so excited!\u201d Claudia clapped her hands.</p><p>\u201cI had to buy her that dress earlier. She always wants a present when someone else is getting one.\u201d Rubio laughed and kissed Claudia\u2019s bare shoulder. She didn\u2019t have the decency to look embarrassed and I found myself enjoying that aspect of her personality the best. With Claudia, what you saw was the truth. It\u2019s more than I could say about most.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to open presents?\u201d Livvie asked. She wriggled her eyebrows at me.</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d I feigned disinterest.</p> <p>Claudia shoved her gift toward me first. It was a slender box and weighed practically nothing, but Claudia was nearly bursting with held laughter and excitement. I was instantly suspicious. Especially when she said to Livvie, \u201cYou have to make him wear it.\u201d</p><p>I tore away the paper and lifted the lid off of the box. I stared and stared and stared some more.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d I laughed. I shook the box and two plastic eyes wiggled around.</p><p>\u201cTake it out,\u201d Livvie suggested. She had her hand over her mouth to hide her grin.</p><p>I obliged the group and regretted it. I had to smile though. It was funny and just the right touch of embarrassing. It was underwear.</p> <p>\u201cI assume I\u2019m supposed to put my um... in the trunk of the elephant? Very clever. Rubio, do you also have a pair?\u201d I tossed them onto his lap and he picked them up between thumb and forefinger. He slung them back at me.</p><p>\u201cSorry, friend. I don\u2019t do animal prints.\u201d We all laughed.</p><p>I received a new video game featuring the Mario Brothers from Rubio. I didn\u2019t know much about the game at the time, but let me assure you that many a day has been spent acquainting myself with the famous plumbers since.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Livvie said as she stood. \u201cClaudia has my present for you. Open it.\u201d She kissed me and walked away before I could ask where she was going.</p><p>The box from Livvie was large and I ripped into it. I laughed hard when I saw the contents. Claudia was out of her seat and hovering over my shoulder. Rubio stayed in his seat but was trying to peer into the box. There was a piece of paper that read: Sexy\u2019s Kung-fu Boo-Boo Kit. Inside were rolls of bandages, band-aids, butterfly stiches, a bottle of peroxide, bath salts, a hand-made massage coupon entitling me to a \u201cfull body rub down (with happy ending)\u201d, and hand wraps \u201cspecifically designed for boxers.\u201d</p><p>I still had a smile on that could crack my face when the singing started. I looked up from my box and Livvie was walking toward me. The restaurant staff was carrying an entire tray of cupcakes with candles in them. They sang:</p> <p>Happy birthday to you.</p><p>Happy birthday to you.</p><p>Happy birthday dear, James.</p><p>Happy birthday to you.</p><p>I stood up and reached for Livvie. She kissed me and whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cOne cupcake for every birthday, my love, and one more for good luck.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop staring at her as she pulled away. I love you, I wanted to say, but my throat felt closed and I was afraid of what would come out. There were tears in her eyes, and if I\u2019d been a weaker man, there would have been tears in mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for, the building to burn down?\u201d Claudia chided. \u201cBlow them out!\u201d</p> <p>I smiled, though I felt on the verge of falling apart. I kissed Livvie on her forehead and let my lips linger long enough for her to feel the depth of my appreciation. Then, for the first time I could remember, I blew out my birthday candles.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>\u201cTell me how you feel.\u201d I ran the leather tongue of the riding crop along Livvie\u2019s outstretched arm. I watched as she shivered. The tiny hairs on her arm stood on end.</p><p>Livvie opened her mouth to speak, stopped, swallowed, and then replied.</p><p>\u201cExcited,\u201d she said. She shivered again and the leather straps that held her in place on the cross creaked. There wouldn\u2019t be any kicking or flailing to interrupt me this time.</p><p>\u201cWas that your first thought? I don\u2019t think it was.\u201d I continued down her arm and over her shoulder. I knew she liked it when I kissed her down her spine. I let the crop caress her where my lips typically would.</p><p>We hadn\u2019t done this before, not as lovers. I had my doubts about doing it at all, but she insisted. Her book was nearly finished. She\u2019d been working on it more aggressively in the weeks leading up to her request. Between Livvie\u2019s writing, work, and school schedule, I\u2019d hardly spent any time with her since my birthday. She needed this, she said. She needed to remember how it felt. She needed to recreate it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want her to remember. I didn\u2019t want to remember. Yet, there I was, crop in hand. It was a pull too compelling to resist. I wouldn\u2019t use the belt. I wouldn\u2019t leave the marks I\u2019d left the first time. If Livvie could re-imagine the events of our past, I could too. I could give her pain and pleasure. I could finally let the fading ghost of our past die and rest in peace. It was time for us to go on living.</p><p>I tapped her gently on her flank. She jumped.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question. Was excited your first response?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m... I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she was afraid. I\u2019d learned her fear very well. In fact, I consider myself a connoisseur of fear. I know there are as many varieties of fear as there are colors in a rainbow. Livvie was afraid, but it was a brand of fear I very much enjoyed.</p><p>\u201cFear is part of it.\u201d I slapped at her inner thighs gently. I liked the sound it made. \u201cYou\u2019re defenseless. You\u2019re vulnerable. You\u2019re completely at my mercy.\u201d I stood behind her, unmoving, and I smelled her fear. True to her word, there was excitement as well. I leaned in and kissed the shell of her ear. \u201cYou. Are. Mine. Say it for me.\u201d</p><p>She sagged in her bonds. Her head fell on my shoulder and she nuzzled against me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Caleb.\u201d I was always Caleb while she was vulnerable. My name on her tongue reminded me of slipping into a worn pair of shoes. I\u2019d been called Caleb most of my life, and were it not for Livvie, the name would be lost to me. Caleb had done horrible things\u2014he\u2019d been a monster\u2014but he\u2019d also allowed James to survive. Caleb deserved to live. I could be both men. I am both men.</p><p>I stepped back and took in the sight in front of me piece by piece. Her long mane of ebony hair cascaded down her slender back. I couldn\u2019t wait to hold it as I f**ked her. I\u2019d put her in red satin. Every miniscule movement caused the red fabric to shift and offer a different tantalizing bit of skin. The panties were scant. The meaty flesh of her backside appeared plumper by way of the cut. With her legs spread open on the X-shaped cross, I could catch glimpses of her pu**y when she tried to adjust. Thick black straps made of leather held her in place at wrists and ankles.</p><p>My heart raced at the thought of whipping her. There was the hum of guilt living within me, but my baser urges banged like a drum in my veins. She was mine. She\u2019d given herself to me, and I would take possession of her as surely as she had taken possession of my battered soul. The void in me had been filled by her love and forgiveness. All that she asked was that I give her all I had in me to give: my heart, my soul, my love, my secrets, my loyalty, and my whip hand.</p><p>I took her quickly and unaware across the bottom of her ass. Livvie\u2019s scream rent the air. James flinched at the sound, but Caleb\u2019s blood sang. I am both men.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s scream died just as suddenly as it had been born. Her lips were pressed together. Her hands were fisted above the leather straps holding her in place. A red stripe decorated her hindquarters.</p><p>\u201cTell me how you feel,\u201d I grated. I ran a hand along her quivering backside. I could already feel the welt.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201dLivvie croaked. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to continue?\u201d I already knew the answer. I wanted her to know it too.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb.\u201d There was confidence in her voice.</p><p>\u201cAnything for you, Pet.\u201d I did show mercy. I caressed her behind with my hand until I felt her muscles relax into my touch. \u201cLet\u2019s start with more familiar ground.\u201d I raised my hand and slammed it forward. I hit one cheek first and then the other in rapid succession. I wanted her nice and warm before I used the crop again.</p><p>If Livvie could have moved, she\u2019d have been up on her toes. I\u2019d spanked her harder and not encountered quite so much movement, but it was my belief that restraints often invited slaves to thrash to their hearts\u2019 content. I had to remind myself Livvie had only ever played at the part of slave. She was mine of her own free will.</p><p>I stayed my hand from continuing to spank Livvie, but I did not keep it idle. Within seconds, my heated fingers wormed their way beneath the scrap of satin only just concealing her pu**y. Her hips pushed back to meet me before she had a thought in her head. I liked that.</p><p>\u201cIs that better, Pet? Did you like the spanking?\u201d</p><p>She rocked her hips as much as she was able and tried to seat my fingers inside her.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb. Please, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d I pushed two fingers inside as far as they would go. I worked them back and forth quickly, delivering both jolts of pleasure and surprise. My dick jerked as Livvie\u2019s unabashed and lascivious yelp met my ears. I watched her hips move back and forth as she found her own pleasure. My sadistic appetite was slowly fed as, little by little, I withdrew my fingers and Livvie\u2019s hips gave chase to catch them. Back, back, back, she canted her hips as much as she was able. I hadn\u2019t given her much slack. She wouldn\u2019t have liked it if I had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMore, Caleb. Please?\u201d she whined. She treated me to the sight of her wiggling her bottom.</p><p>I spanked her once.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to entice me. I\u2019m not near finished with you. You wanted a whipping and I\u2019m determined to give you one.\u201d</p><p>There was a sulky whimper preceding her murmured, \u201cYes, Caleb.\u201d She huffed and rearranged herself in her restraints.</p> <p>\u201cAlways with the saucy mouth, Kitten. Whether you\u2019re using it to spout invective comments or simply petulant sounds, you\u2019re always pushing me toward this\u2014toward punishing you. I always wondered\u2014before\u2014if you craved me like this. Did you?\u201d I lifted the crop and let it land on her ass again. Livvie lurched in her bonds, her lips pressed tightly together so that not even her surprise could break free.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, Kitten.\u201d I whipped her again and once more for good measure.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, Caleb.\u201d There was the slightest stirring of real fear in her voice.</p><p>\u201cNo? Why now? What\u2019s changed?\u201d I whipped her again, mindful to keep the kiss of the crop across her flanks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she cried. Her body was tight as a drawn bow. She was fighting me and I didn\u2019t know why. I thought perhaps she was only fighting herself.</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember the first time I whipped you?\u201d I asked. I knew for certain she did. This entire scenario had been constructed based upon that particular memory. The least I could do was assist her in cataloging it properly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb,\u201d she said more quickly.</p><p>\u201cI remember too. It all could have gone differently.\u201d I reached around to the front of her body and cupped one of her br**sts. I rolled her nipple between my fingers as I spoke. \u201cI would have shown you mercy, of a sort. I knew you were scared. You\u2019d been shocked to learn I was your abductor and not the hero you\u2019d imagined.\u201d I tugged on her nipple. It was a hard little stone between my fingers. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let me be kind. I would have fed you while you rested your head in my lap. I would have given you as many answers as I could to ease your plight. You could have gone to bed without the marks from my belt. But you fought me. You couldn\u2019t win, and you still fought me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated you!\u201d she said. The words caught in her throat. She shut her eyes and tears raced down her cheeks. \u201cI didn\u2019t want your f**king mercy.\u201d The words were difficult to hear, but I knew them to be true and I deserved them.</p><p>I leaned forward and collected a salty tear from her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sad, Kitten. You were right to hate me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you anymore, Caleb. Please believe me. I don\u2019t hate you.\u201d More tears spilled down her cheek.</p><p>I stroked her hair. I kissed her salty cheek.</p><p>\u201cI know, Pet. We\u2019ve come a long way from there. Yet, here we are. You\u2019re still asking me to punish you. Why?\u201d I struck her several times. With each loud slap her resolve crumbled a little more. I pushed her. I pushed myself. I wanted her to understand there had only ever been one reason to return to this.</p><p>Livvie was sobbing.</p><p>\u201cI... I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. I placed my hand between her legs and stroked her wet folds. \u201cYou do. So why are you still fighting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to!\u201d Her chest shook with the force of her crying.</p><p>\u201cI think you do. I think you believe I want you to\u2014but I don\u2019t, Kitten. You don\u2019t have to provoke me. You\u2019re no longer my captive.\u201d I touched her clit. My fingertip glided easily through her slick folds. I whipped her across her other thigh with the crop.</p> <p>Livvie screamed but settled quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Caleb. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Begging... I\u2019m always a sucker for the begging when it suits my own desires.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgiven. Don\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>She took several deep breaths.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb.\u201d She moaned loudly when I bit her shoulder. \u201cGod! The things you do to me...\u201d Her breath shuddered from her chest. \u201cNo one else makes me feel this way. You hurt me so much\u2014before. But you always made it better. You\u2019re the only one who makes it better. I don\u2019t want it to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than whom, Pet?\u201d I dropped the crop and palmed her ass as I continued making circles on her clit. Livvie had found a taste for pain, but I knew the best way to get her to talk was to bring her as close to the edge of orgasm as possible.</p><p>\u201cEveryone,\u201d she whispered. Her eyes were closed, but I could see the tears still leaking from her eyes. Her hips were moving again, finding a rhythm to match my touches. \u201cYou take care of me. No one\u2019s taken care of me like you.\u201d</p><p>A weight pressed on my chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take care of you without this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want this. I didn\u2019t want it before. You didn\u2019t care about me. I was a thing to you. I know that\u2019s not true anymore. I trust you, Caleb. I trust you to see me like this. I trust you to take care of me.\u201d Livvie\u2019s thighs began to shake.</p><p>\u201cNo, Pet. You\u2019re not allowed to come yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Caleb,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>I stifled a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo manipulative.\u201d I spanked her with my bare hand. Hard. It didn\u2019t seem to affect her. She was on another plane.</p><p>\u201cI learned from the best,\u201d she said. I watched her smile and then attempt to hide it.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t make it five minutes, could you? And now I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t let you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb, no. Please! I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She opened her eyes when I pulled my hands away. Her expression was one of astonishment. I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI warned you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Her tone suggested she was frightened. Her eyes said otherwise. She\u2019d asked me that same question dozens, perhaps hundreds, of times. I always had the same answer.</p><p>\u201cWhatever I want.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been working on something rather special and I couldn\u2019t wait to try it out. I\u2019d never been much of a carpenter or inventor, per se, but idle hands and an agile mind had led me to explore more hobbies. I found that I liked working with my hands, and I especially liked when my new hobbies coincided with my favorite pastime.</p><p>Livvie was silent as I undid the straps on her ankles. She was always most quiet when she was nervous. She sagged in my arms, limp as a wet noodle once I unstrapped her wrists.</p><p>\u201cCaleb?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I hoisted her over my shoulder and slapped her ass.</p><p>\u201cNo questions, Pet. You\u2019ll like it. I promise. Or at the very least, I will.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed a pillow from the sofa before I walked the few steps necessary to reach my constructed apparatus. It hadn\u2019t taken much to put together. The downstairs was mostly unfinished and it was easy to find the choice support beams.</p><p>I tossed the pillow on the floor and set Livvie down on it. I heard her wince as her heated backside made contact, but I also knew she\u2019d be just fine.</p><p>She appeared beautifully at odds with the unfinished basement, a diamond in the rubble.</p><p>\u201cLean back on your hands and put your legs out in front of you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me for a moment as if she were unsure about whether or not to bait me with more of her insolent backtalk. Then, seeming to come to her senses, she did as I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cVery good, Kitten. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d I winked at her and smiled. We were supposed to be having fun. I didn\u2019t want either of us to forget that fact.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Caleb.\u201d She managed a smile for me.</p><p>She was very curious about my every move as I gathered up the harness I needed, along with a spreader bar and some nylon rope. The hardware store was a very convenient place to shop for sex toys.</p><p>It took a few minutes, but I finally had what I wanted. Straps placed at Livvie\u2019s waist, thighs, and ankles would help lessen the amount of gravitational strain. The spreader bar would keep her ankles apart, evenly distribute her weight, and give her some semblance of balance. Finally, the nylon rope\u2014anchored to the spreader bar and pulled through a series of load-bearing pulleys secured in the ceiling\u2014 would make it easy to lift her slowly off the ground.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d I asked. Livvie lay on her back with her knees bent. She was pulling on her lip with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cNervous. Are you sure this is safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me to keep you safe?\u201d I palmed one of her br**sts and traced her satin-clad nipple with my thumb. She sighed.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop asking silly questions.\u201d I leaned down and kissed her. I was beyond aroused. I felt like a starving man sitting down to a feast. I wanted to touch every part of Livvie all at once. I also knew the wait would make the reward all the sweeter.</p><p>I let myself kiss her slowly. I let the tip of my tongue coax her lips open. I scraped it along the edge of her upper teeth before I felt the first slow slide of her tongue meeting mine.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s hand cupped the back of my head and pulled me closer. She was just as eager, but less inclined to savor than I was. Our teeth clicked against one another as she attempted to let the kiss consume us.</p><p>I pinched her nipple between my forefinger and thumb. I was treated to a keening whimper, a blatant request for more. I tugged Livvie\u2019s nipple, delivering sensation and rewarding myself with more of her whimpers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou really won\u2019t let me come?\u201d she asked between kisses. One of her hands reached between my legs. She caressed my balls through my pants. Her fingernails dragged behind them. I shook.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Caleb.\u201d Her hand moved from my balls to my cock. She squeezed. \u201cYou\u2019re so hard. I know you want to f**k me.\u201d</p><p>A groan escaped me. I pulled away from her before she could convince me to let her have her way yet again.</p><p>\u201cI do want to f**k you, Pet. I said you weren\u2019t allowed to come yet. I didn\u2019t say anything about not f**king you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned but kept from making further protests or demands. For Livvie, I supposed that qualified as being obedient.</p><p>Slowly, I pulled on the rope and hoisted Livvie into the air by her ankles. She gasped loudly and let out a yelp or two, but otherwise she\u2019d come through it very well.</p><p>\u201cComfortable?\u201d I asked. Anticipation burned hotly in my chest. I paid particular attention to the damp spot on Livvie\u2019s panties. I licked my lips.</p><p>\u201cUm... I guess so.\u201d Her fingertips scrambled for purchase on the ground but couldn\u2019t quite reach.</p><p>\u201cRelax your body and just hang there. The more you tense up, the more you\u2019ll move about.\u201d I secured the rope and grabbed a few items before I made my way to Livvie.</p><p>I ran my hands from her ankles down to her inner thighs. I stroked the little damp spot between Livvie\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Livvie exclaimed. Her arms wrapped around my waist and she pulled me close. Her head was pressed against the front of my pants.</p><p>\u201cMy, but you are wet, Kitten. Did your whipping turn you on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb.\u201d She rubbed her face against my erection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d I said. My voice was as hoarse as hers. I hooked my thumbs on either side of her panties and pulled them upward. They gave only as far as a few centimeters past the bottom of her ass. Her legs were spread too wide for much more. It was enough to suit my purpose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you before, Kitten, but I\u2019ll say it again: You are beautiful here.\u201d I kissed her mound and Livvie\u2019s hips made a tiny thrust. \u201cShould I lick your pu**y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, god! Yes. Please.\u201d She began kissing my erection.</p><p>I palmed her ass in both hands and brought her to my mouth. I licked her from clit to delicious hole and darted my tongue inside to collect the wetness she\u2019d so generously created for me. Livvie\u2019s entire body was shaking. Her hands gripped my ass and pulled me close.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I love the taste of your pu**y. You should try it.\u201d I slowly backed away, ignoring whimpered protests. Placing one hand behind her neck and an arm behind her shoulders, I pulled Livvie upward and let her taste her pu**y from my mouth.</p><p>She moaned and sucked on my tongue. Her hands held my head in place as she navigated her way through our upside down mashing of mouths.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb,\u201d she said through panting breaths.</p><p>Gingerly, I lowered her until our previous posture was achieved. I couldn\u2019t wait anymore. I wanted her mouth on me. I undid my slacks and pulled out my dick. Pre-come wept from the tip and I smeared it along Livvie\u2019s cheek.</p> <p>Livvie turned her head and latched on to my c**k like a vixen possessed. She suckled.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d I exclaimed. I couldn\u2019t stop myself from thrusting into her ravenous mouth. I reached for the back of her head and gathered up her hair from the floor. I held it in my fist as I let the first volleys of my lust clear. I had no intention of coming so soon. I pulled my c**k out of her mouth with a wet pop.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Pet. Let me set the pace. Open up.\u201d I wasn\u2019t at all surprised by her immediate obedience. With one hand holding her hair, I used my free hand to take hold of my cock. I couldn\u2019t resist tracing her wet, red lips with the tip of my cock. I sighed as I watched her kitten tongue dart out to lick it. Finally, I slipped back into the warm, suctioning sanctuary of her mouth.</p><p>I let go of Livvie\u2019s hair and stood. I desperately wanted more of her pu**y in my mouth. I palmed her ass and pulled her toward me. My lips mouthed her clit while my tongue licked at her tiny bud. I felt every shudder, every moan, and every whimper against my cock. I made shallow thrusts interspersed with deep ones that drove past the scrape of Livvie\u2019s teeth into her throat.</p><p>I pulled my hips back every so often to allow Livvie to breathe. Drool coated her cheeks and puddled on the floor, but she\u2019d never looked sexier to me.</p><p>\u201cTell me how you feel,\u201d I said.</p><p>She cleared her throat and swallowed.</p><p>\u201cI want to come,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. I urged her mouth back onto my cock. As she continued sucking, I bathed her pu**y with my tongue until her thighs began to tremble. I pulled away. \u201cNo, Kitten.\u201d I ran my finger through her wetness and circled the tight pucker of her ass.</p><p>Her mouth pulled off my cock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be good. I won\u2019t come. I won\u2019t come.\u201d She tried to wriggle away from my finger.</p><p>\u201cLet me in. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you come.\u201d I pressed my lips to her clit and kissed her.</p><p>There was a moment of hesitation, and then I felt her muscles relax. I slipped the tip of my finger inside her ass and wiggled it back and forth.</p><p>\u201cOh, god! Caleb. Please! I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die, Pet. You\u2019re going to come. Hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d Her hips moved back and forth. \u201cI\u2019m so close. Please lick my pu**y. I want to come. Please let me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut me back in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>The moment I felt her sucking, I put my mouth on her. I knew she couldn\u2019t take much more. I couldn\u2019t take much more, and I wasn\u2019t the one hanging upside down.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s hips thrust back and forth as she tried to work my tongue on her pu**y. In the meantime, she was also f**king herself in the ass with my finger. A more glorious way to spend an evening has not been created.</p><p>I felt her muscles tightening. Even her mouth got tighter around my flesh.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and come for me, Pet.\u201d I cupped the back of her head and kept myself in her mouth as she came in mine. I felt her orgasm on my tongue, around my finger, and her cries of ecstasy vibrated along my cock. It felt as though she could come for days, and as I continued to f**k her mouth slowly my crisis found me and I spilled my seed inside.</p><p>Afterward, I lowered her to the ground and held her for a long time.</p><p>\u201cTell me again, Kitten.\u201d I kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Caleb. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m yours. Happy anniversary, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was perfect,\u201d she whispered and nestled deeper into my arms.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have the energy to do much more than move us to the sofa. We slept for an hour or two before we could drag ourselves into the shower and then to bed where we made love again, soft and slow.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>So, here we are at the end. Was it good for you? It was for me. I suppose in the end that\u2019s all that really matters. I know that\u2019s selfish, but you know I\u2019m selfish and you love me anyway.</p><p>For what it\u2019s worth, I think I might actually miss you.</p><p>Will you miss me?</p><p>Will you cry?</p><p>If you do, please drink a tear for me and know that I never meant to cause you pain. Our parting is no cause to fret. In the words of Frank Herbert, \u201cThere is no real ending. It\u2019s just the place where you stop the story.\u201d</p><p>Livvie and I go on. We still live and have adventures.</p><p>Will we see each other again? I don\u2019t have the answer to that. Life has taught me to expect the unexpected and it\u2019s a lesson I learn over and again. Suffice to say \u2013 I hope so.</p><p>To be perfectly honest, I\u2019ve gone around and around trying to find the perfect ending to this novel I never intended to write. In the end, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with the way Livvie ended things. Her epilogue was short, but it captured the essence of our story: Survival is the most important thing. It affords us the chance to live and to find all of the things that make living worthwhile. I found redemption. I found forgiveness. I found love.</p><p>That said, Livvie did a beautiful job with the ending and I can think of no greater tribute than to end this book as she intended.</p><p>As I walked, I could feel his eyes on me, the way I could always feel his eyes on me. Tears ran down my face unabashed, but I didn\u2019t move to wipe them away. I had earned those tears, and I would wear them as a symbol of everything I had been through. They represented all the pain I had suffered, the love I felt, and the ocean of loss sweeping through my soul. I had finally learned to obey and never looked back.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
