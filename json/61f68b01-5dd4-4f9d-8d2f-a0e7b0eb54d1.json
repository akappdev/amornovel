Please. I don\u2019t want to wake up hollow and numb, a ghost of myself. I want to remember what it felt like to be touched all over by someone, be kissed like I meant something; if only for a moment. I want to remember what I went through, both the good and the bad. If I can\u2019t, then I want to die. Please, please, let me die.</p><p>\u201cGemma Lucas,\u201d a welcoming voice graces my ears. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>I blink my eyes open to wispy clouds lazily floating across a crystal blue sky. The sight is breathtaking and makes me feel calm and serene. Yet something about it is off. The clouds look almost too wispy, like a smeared watercolor painting, and the sky has jagged edges that slope in distinct directions as if it\u2019s one gigantic, glistening crystal.</p> <p>I roll to my side and through the gemstone grass, Where am I? \u201cThe City of Crystal,\u201d I murmur. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>I quickly push to my feet. The land is paved with a winding path of shattered teal porcelain that leads to a silver throne perched on a podium. To my right is a crystal wall that fences through the grass, flashing vibrant images of people and landscapes like a television screen.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d I turn in a circle, searching for life, a Foreseer, even Dyvinius.</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d Suddenly a figure of a woman flickers across the screen then rapidly fades, lines covering the glass. \u201cGemma, can your hear me?\u201d Her voice is glitched, but it\u2019s still clear enough that I recognize the sound and pitch of it.</p><p>I race through the grass and up to the screen, panting as I tip my head back. \u201cMom, can you hear me?\u201d</p> <p>A woman with flowing brown hair and bright blue irises appears clearly on the screen. In the background, a circular light forms, glowing brighter and brighter until a lake forms, I\u2019ve seen it before. The entrance to The Underworld.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d my mom whispers, pressing her hand to the glass. Drops of water drip from her hand and down the screen. \u201cGemma, please help me... save me... I can help... I know about the star, you just need to save me. Please.\u201d</p><p>I press my hand to the glass, lining our fingers up. \u201cMom, I don\u2019t think I can... I think I might be gone... I think my body\u2019s somewhere and my mind\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, her hair blowing in the wind as the water starts to vibrate and ripple. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay... now please come help me.\u201d</p><p>Tears burn at the corners of my eyes as I push my hand harder to the glass, as if I can go into it, however there\u2019s resistance as the screen begins to splinter and crack. \u201cHow can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook around you. Gemma,\u201d she says as the water rolls closer to her, the cracks spreading and spider-webbing the glass. \u201cYou have so much power. The possibilities of what you can do are endless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that how?\u201d I panic as she falls back with the waves, her hand leaving the glass. \u201cMom, can my power save you!\u201d</p><p>She reaches out as she\u2019s hauled back into the lake. Seconds later, thousands of boney arms emerge from the water and pull her down beneath it. I scream, backing away as the image fades and the glass wall bursts. Sharp fragments sail through the air and claw at my skin as water rushes through the ruined screen and into the land around me. The force knocks my feet out from under me and I fall to the ground on my back. The rapids nearly slice me in half as they roll over me and I\u2019m pulled away with the violent movement. I sink and then submerge, fighting against the water, flailing my arms and kicking my legs while trying to figure out how to swim. It\u2019s a powerful force, though, one that I have no control over. And finally, I lose the willpower to fight and just let myself drown.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Betrayal.</p><p>Betrayal.</p><p>Betrayal.</p><p>It\u2019s an echo in my head.</p><p>How could this happen? How could Alex do what he did? How could he hurt me... there\u2019s so much pain inside. I hate it. Hate him. Hate myself for being so stupid and trusting him. There\u2019s so much loathing and anger inside me that I feel like I\u2019m rotting, spoiled, decaying on the inside and turning into something morbid that no one wants. The vile feeling spreads and the weight of it crushes me. I open my mouth to scream, but my lungs burst and bleed out; at least that\u2019s what it feels like. At least I want them to because it will take away the agonizing pain inside my heart.</p> <p>Never again.</p><p>Never.</p><p>I'll never trust anyone in this world again. I'll never get crushed. I'll protect myself at all costs; that is, if I ever get out of this darkness.</p><p>Then suddenly my head starts to buzz like a Goddamn bug trapped in a light, over and over again. It just about drives me crazy; it\u2019s to the point where I feel like I\u2019m going to gouge my ears out. I seriously consider it, too, but I can\u2019t see past the darkness\u2014I can\u2019t see light.</p><p>My skin swelters with invigorating warmth, my body peacefully relaxing as the ground below me becomes soft and inviting. I feel content, blissfully and almost alarmingly content. Feel? What the hell... I\u2019m supposed to be dead, or at least locked in a coffin within my own head.</p><p>My eyes shoot open as I bolt upright, but as the blood rushes from my head, I collapse back onto the mattress. I swiftly glance around and my jaw drops. After the dream I was having, I had expected to be buried in water, however I\u2019m dry and breathing. Alive. Unlike my mom.</p><p>I try not to choke on the image of her drowning in the water, the Water Fey dragging her down, and I take in where I am. I\u2019m lying in a bed in a room with pale purple walls and a small window that lets in minimal sunlight. The view outside is painted with colorful lights and flamboyant buildings that stretch toward the skyline.</p><p>\u201cI know this place...\u201d I gradually sit up, clutching my throbbing head. \u201cVegas... I\u2019m in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the safest place I could think of.\u201d The sound of Alex\u2019s voice sends a chill down my spine, but then electricity counteracts it and my body erupts with heat, awakening my heart from a very deep slumber.</p><p>He ambles through the doorway, taking tentative steps as he inches toward the bed. Emotions of hate mixed with lust amplify and every image of the last time we were in bed together flashes through my mind; the way he\u2019d made me finally feel like I was breathing. Then he stole it all away, betraying me, ripping my heart out of my chest and shredding it to pieces; he probably still has my blood on his hands.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He comes to a stop at the foot of the metal-framed bed. He\u2019s wearing a black t-shirt and a pair of loose-fitting, dark blue jeans and his brown hair is disheveled and damp. He also has a black smudge on the center of his forehead, like ash or charcoal. He almost looks like a normal guy, completely harmless, yet his welcoming demeanor is just an illusion. I know this\u2014I\u2019ve learned better.</p><p>I throw the blanket off me and swing my legs over the side of the bed. I\u2019m not wearing the same clothes; a pair of boxer shorts and a t-shirt that don\u2019t belong to me have replaced them. I don\u2019t even want to think about how I got changed while I was blacked out. One of my wrists is bandaged up... the one I had slit myself when my emotions had gotten the best of me... I can remember. I can remember? \u201cStay away from me you asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d His voice is as smooth as silk as he winds around the bed, his radiant, green eyes fixed on me. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t hurt you. Everything\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I laugh sharply as I put weight on my weak legs. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest lie I\u2019ve ever heard come out of your mouth, which says a lot since you\u2019re the biggest liar I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Alex stops dead in his tracks, his skin tinting red with his anger. \u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>My knees shake as I square my shoulders and find my stability. \u201cIt means your promises are bullshit. At least, the ones you make to me.\u201d I fling my arms out to my sides. \u201cYou told me once that you made me a promise that you would never to hurt me, but I\u2019m finding that hard to believe since you keep hurting me over and over again.\u201d</p><p>A condescending look appears in his eyes. \u201cMy promises got you to Adessa\u2019s, safe and sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe and sound doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d I step back toward the wall, dropping my hands to my sides. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not stupid enough to believe otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it does... right now it does.\u201d He matches my step and instantly reduces the space I put between us. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll understand why, if you just let me explain what happened.\u201d</p><p>I dare to move forward, needing to get out of the room and away from him. \u201cI\u2019m leaving. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m even able to walk around... why I\u2019m alive and normal, but I\u2019m not going to waste my time listening to your lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re walking around normal because of me\u2014because of how I feel about you.\u201d He\u2019s coursing with infuriation as he inches to the side, obstructing my path to the doorway. \u201cJust let me explain.\u201d</p><p>I dodge to the right and skitter around him, however I\u2019m like a newborn deer and my knees give out. I collapse to the floor, but before I hit, his arms encircle my waist and he catches me. Then he swiftly picks me up, slipping his arms underneath my knees, and carries me over to the bed, setting me back down before I can even conjure up a protest. I start to sit back up, but he puts his hands down on the mattress, one on each side of me, and lowers his face toward mine.</p><p>\u201cI just need five minutes to explain,\u201d he almost begs, and it sounds strange coming from his lips; almost as if he\u2019s never begged for anything before. I bet he\u2019s been begged a lot, though. \u201cFive minutes for me to tell you what happened, and then, if you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>I search his eyes for the person that lay with me in the bed, but I\u2019m not sure who that is exactly \u2014who he really is. I find myself hoping that I can find out. I hope he doesn\u2019t crush me again. What I really want to do is run away, yet he\u2019s got me trapped and I know how strong he is\u2014how easily he could chase me down and hurt me if he wants to.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes.\u201d I push him back a little, his chest searing hot beneath my palm. \u201cThat\u2019s all you have, and if one single thing sounds like a lie, then you leave, not just the house, but my life.\u201d</p><p>He nods without hesitation and leans back, allowing me to sit up.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I finally ask when he doesn\u2019t say anything right away.</p><p>He sits close to me on the bed, his hands near his lap as he keeps flexing his fingers, channeling his tension there. \u201cWe\u2019re at Adessa\u2019s, the Witch we went to see in Vegas to get the crystal. This is her house which is attached to her store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it safe here?\u201d I scoot to the edge of the bed and put my feet onto the hardwood floor.</p><p>He nods. \u201cFor now. Aislin and Adessa covered the house with charms.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows, overwhelmed already. I\u2019m still getting used to the supernatural stuff that\u2019s invaded my life over the last couple of weeks. \u201cHow did we get here?\u201d I wonder. \u201cBecause the last thing I can remember...\u201d I trail off, aiming him a dirty look. \u201cWell, I think you can remember what happened.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame me until you hear the whole story,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we got here because Aislin transported us here. It\u2019s a simple as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, super simple,\u201d I respond in a derisive tone. He\u2019s already getting under my skin, not just because he\u2019s pissing me off, but because of the damn electricity. He\u2019s sitting close to me, too close to me on a bed. It\u2019s driving me mad because my mind is begging me to let him do things to me; touch me, kiss me, fill the void within me. \u201cWhere are Laylen and Aislin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is that super simple,\u201d he retorts. \u201cAislin and Laylen are downstairs and if you want the whole story then keep quiet and listen.\u201d He watches me with challenge in his eyes and I know he\u2019s doing it on purpose, attempting to get under my skin.</p><p>Needing to get the last word in\u2014needing to prove that I still have some say in this\u2014I say, \u201cFine, continue.\u201d</p> <p>The corners of his lips quirk, as though he\u2019s enjoying the bantering. \u201cAfter Aislin came back to get Laylen in Nevada, there was a huge ambush of Death Walkers. I guess their cold ruined Aislin\u2019s transporting crystal so they had to bail out and come here to get another one. Then they transported to Colorado and ended up saving all of us.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms across my chest. \u201cBut how? I mean, if I remember correctly, which I\u2019m pretty sure I do since I was the target of everything that was going on, then there was an ambush of Death Walkers there along with your father who was trying to kill me with that smoking rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a memoria extracto,\u201d he says flatly.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mumble. \u201cNow if I ever have to take a test on strange crazy things that shouldn\u2019t exist, I know I\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>He covers his mouth with his balled fist, either pissed off or trying to hide a smile. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad to see that you still have your twisted sense of humor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBarely,\u201d I retort, holding his gaze while he holds mine. \u201cBut I can already feel it fading, just like everything else inside me.\u201d All I can feel at them moment is rage. It\u2019s like a fire, ready to burn me to pieces. I wish I could turn it off, but I can\u2019t seem to figure out how. Shit. What if something\u2019s wrong with me? What if whatever did happen broke my emotions instead of getting rid of them.</p><p>He lowers his hand onto his lap and sighs. \u201cWhen Aislin and Laylen showed up at the cabin,\u201d he continues. \u201cStephan and the Death Walkers were gone. They just upped and left while I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I interrupt. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense, since Stephan was pretty much dead set on breaking my soul and mind apart.\u201d I pause, eyeing him over, closely watching his reaction. \u201cSomething you were pretty dead set on helping him do.\u201d</p><p>He swiftly shakes his head. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you were. At first I thought you were going to save me, which felt...\u201d I trail off, trying to figure out exactly how it felt, but I can\u2019t quite piece what I\u2019m feeling together. \u201cAnd then I guess you changed your mind and decided to side with the devil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t decide to side with my father,\u201d he insists. \u201cI did what I had to do because it was the only way to keep you safe.\u201d</p> <p>I tap my foot anxiously on the floor. Do I want to sit here and listen to more of his story? Or try to run? I feel like I\u2019m in a maze where almost every end is a dead end or a trap and it\u2019s hard to figure out which path will get me to wherever I need to go. My emotions are also confusing, combined with the electricity, I feel like I\u2019m being pushed toward Alex and then pulled back. Pushed and pulled. Pretty soon I\u2019m going to tear in half.</p><p>\u201cI know what I saw.\u201d I place a hand on my bandaged wrist. \u201cYou stood by while your father tried to erase my mind and I bled all over the floor; I could have died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have never let you die.\u201d He reaches for me, however I hover back, shaking my head, not ready to be touched by him yet. He sighs and withdraws his hands to his lap, clenching his fist so tightly his knuckles turn white. \u201cDo you remember that necklace I gave you?\u201d</p><p>I grab the hollow of my neck and then panic at the bare space. \u201cWait. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>He sets a hand on my knee before I have time to react and a burst of passion swells through me. \u201cRelax. I have it.\u201d</p><p>That doesn\u2019t make me relax at all. I keep remembering how Laylen and I talked about Alex being brainwashed. What if he\u2019s right? What if he has to be here because the memoria extracto didn\u2019t work and Alex is helping his father hold me hostage until they can figure something else out?</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have it?\u201d I ask warily.</p><p>He takes a deep breath and gradually frees it, his fingertips massaging my kneecap. \u201cWhen I gave you the necklace, I wasn\u2019t just giving it to you because it belonged to you. I gave it to you because it has sugilite in it,\u201d he says. I\u2019m about to ask him what sugilite is when he adds, \u201cThat\u2019s the purple stone in the center of the locket. It protects whoever\u2019s wearing it from certain kinds of magic.\u201d He pauses. \u201cLike the mind erasing kind of magic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you said my mother gave me the necklace when I was little?\u201d I ask. \u201cDid she give it to me to protect me from something, too?\u201d</p><p>He sweeps my hair back off my shoulder and I tense, unsure why he is so persistent about touching me. \u201cShe gave it to you because you have the star\u2019s energy in you. It was her way of trying to protect you from anyone who tried to use magic on you to get to the star\u2019s power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t it work when I was little?\u201d My voice is sharp and bitter. \u201cWhen Sophia detached my soul from my emotions? Why didn\u2019t it protect me then?\u201d</p><p>Alex shuts his eyes, his face contorted in pain. \u201cStephan knew what it was and he took it off you before Sophia detached your soul.\u201d He opens his eyes and they\u2019re glossed over. \u201cThat\u2019s why I tucked it into your shirt in the Jeep. So he wouldn\u2019t see it and take it off.\u201d</p><p>I remember when Alex was about to climb out of the Jeep back at the cabin in Colorado. The Death Walkers and Stephan had just shown up and stopped us from running away. Alex had reached over and tucked the locket under the collar of my shirt, whispering, whatever you do, keep that hidden. Don\u2019t let anyone know you have it.</p><p>\u201cSo you were planning all along to save me.\u201d I\u2019m doubtful because none of this makes sense. There are so many questions without answers, like why Stephan and the Death Walkers would just walk away.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that goes against everything you said... how my soul had to be detached or else the star\u2019s power would die and then the portal would open and the world would end.\u201d I frown, thinking of my dooming fate. That I might die, or live and be hollow, neither of which were options that I wanted. I want normalcy, plain and simple.</p><p>His hand slides up my thigh and halts at the top of my shorts and the rage burning inside me fizzles. My heart and body want one thing and my mind another. What do I want?</p><p>\u201cThings changed between us... you know that. When we... after we...\u201d He drifts off.</p><p>\u201cHad sex.\u201d I strive to sound blas\u00e9, but my cheeks heat.</p><p>His eyes are secured on mine and he displays no emotions at all. \u201cIt was more than that, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flame even hotter, though I refuse to look away. \u201cI have no idea... I have nothing else to compare it to. Besides, that was my fault... I pretty much begged you to do it.\u201d</p><p>He keeps one hand on my thigh and reaches his free hand up to cup my face. Being touched intimately always throws me off guard since I didn\u2019t experience any human connection for about fourteen years. Something as simple as being touched both frightens and enthralls me to the point where I do irrational things, solely based on my hormones.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to kiss you. I\u2019m the one that took it that far because I...\u201d he grapples for words he never does find. \u201cAnd I meant what I said when I woke you up. If my father wouldn\u2019t have shown up, I would have gotten you out of there and hid until we figured something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we didn\u2019t make it that far, did we?\u201d I scoot away from him. \u201cAnd then you held that rock up in front of me...\u201d</p><p>He rubs his hand across his face, letting his fingers linger on the smudged black spot on the middle of his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your head?\u201d I reach out to touch him, but then retreat. The last thing I want to do is trust him again and end up in a situation like back at the cabin in Colorado.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from the memoria extracto,\u201d he whispers, rubbing the spot with his fingertips. I\u2019m surprised when it stays and doesn\u2019t smudge.</p><p>\u201cWhy did it do that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the magic bounced back on me.\u201d</p><p>I scan him over; long lean arms, solid shoulders, a firm, stubbly jawline. \u201cBut then how could you... do you... huh?\u2019</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the sugilite does,\u201d he explains. \u201cThose who try to use harmful magic on someone who has sugilite on them, automatically gets magical harm done on them instead. So when I used it on you it bounced back on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you knew that was going to happen?\u201d I gape at him.</p><p>\u201cBetter me than you.\u201d He shrugs, acting nonchalant, the exact opposite from the meaning his words convey.</p><p>\u201cWhen you say the magic bounced back on you, does that mean your memory was erased?\u201d I inquire. \u201cBecause you seem fine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am fine now,\u201d he assures me. \u201cBut for a while there...\u201d he blinks and then his face contorts like he\u2019s remembering an excruciating memory.</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I blacked out. When I woke up Stephan and the Death Walkers were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have no idea where they went?\u201d I question. \u201cOr why they just left?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cBy the time I came to, Aislin and Laylen had shown up to a torn up cabin and you were still passed out.\u201d</p><p>Pushing past my confliction, I extend my hand forward to rub the black spot on his head. The contact brings a euphoric tingle to my body that I secretly bask in. \u201cIs this permanent?\u201d</p><p>He watches me intently. \u201cIt\u2019ll go away eventually.\u201d</p><p>I withdraw my hand to my lap, fighting the impulse to touch him some more. \u201cWhat about your head?\u201d</p><p>The corners of his mouth tug upward. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want it to be okay?\u201d</p><p>I tuck my hand under my leg to keep from touching him again. \u201cI\u2019m sure it probably has its benefits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d he wonders, looking amused.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have answers. More than you\u2019re probably sharing.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, he retrieves something from the pocket of his jeans. \u201cPut this back on.\u201d He holds his hand in front of me and in his palm is a silver, heart-shaped locket with a small, violet stone in the center. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t take the locket right away. Can I trust Alex to help me instead of harm me? Is he finally telling the truth? Considering his track record, my initial instinct is to scream no! However, there\u2019s something else inside me that\u2019s conflicting. My emotions. Those Goddamn tingling and fluttering sensations in my heart that are fucking with my head.</p><p>\u201cYou can have it back.\u201d He urges his hand at me. \u201cI want you to wear it again, so you\u2019ll be protected.\u201d</p><p>I still don\u2019t take the necklace. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you took it off me to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Aislin had to use magic to get us out of the cabin,\u201d he explains, slipping his hand under mine and forcing me to open my palm. \u201cAnd if you would have had it on it would have hurt her.\u201d</p> <p>He lifts the necklace above my hand and releases it from his fingers, allowing it to fall into my palm. The metal is cold, yet his touch brings warmth. He chews on his bottom lip as he studies me while I put the necklace around my neck and secure the clasp. I feel weirdly better now that it\u2019s back on, so I release a stressed breath, shutting my eyes for a moment, taking everything in. I don\u2019t know what to do. What to believe. I know what I want to do and that\u2019s pretend that Alex is a trustworthy person, but things aren\u2019t that simple.</p><p>I open my eyes. \u201cAlex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...?\u201d He looks distracted in his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the memoria extracto?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He snaps back to reality and shifts uncomfortably on the bed. \u201cAislin and Adessa destroyed it with a spell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what about your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d he asks, his tone clipped. \u201cI already told you I don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d</p><p>I observe his reaction closely. He\u2019s upset about something. \u201cBut you said he\u2019s immortal? And that the sword won\u2019t even kill him.\u201d</p><p>He presses his lips together. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d I\u2019m baffled. \u201cIs yeah.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cWhat else do you want me to say besides the fact that he is?\"</p> <p>\u201cHow about explaining why you never mentioned this and how we\u2019re supposed to get rid of him if he can\u2019t die.\u201d I clutch onto the locket, wishing it could make me feel safe, too, rather than so vulnerable.</p><p>His expression hardens as he inclines back, putting space between us. \u201cEven though he seems like he\u2019s working for the bad side, he\u2019s still my father and I don\u2019t want to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like he\u2019s working for the bad side?\u201d I fume. \u201cTry is working for them. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure he might be the leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf who exactly?\u201d he counters heatedly. \u201cThe Death Walkers? Demetrius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell should I know? I never know half the shit that\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He stands to his feet, towering over me. \u201cWhich is why you have no right to make accusations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the right to do whatever I want.\u201d I rise to my feet very unsteadily and brace my hand on the bedpost to keep my balance. \u201cBesides, the reason why I don\u2019t know things is because you keep half the shit to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now we\u2019re back to where we started,\u201d he snaps hotly, stepping closer. Even though I\u2019m tall, he\u2019s much taller and I have to tip my chin up to meet his beautiful, yet heated eyes. \u201cNo matter what I say, you never trust me.\u201d</p> <p>I point my finger at the door, ignoring the electric current boiling in my blood and dampening my skin with sweat. \u201cWhich means you can leave. That was the deal, right?\u201d</p><p>His gaze darkens as he slants closer to me, stopping only inches from my face. I can feel my heart thrashing in my chest and I\u2019m almost certain I can hear his as well, erratic and pounding. At first I think he\u2019s going to kiss me and I wonder how I\u2019ll react if he does. The need spiraling inside my body makes me speculate if I\u2019ll make a dumb choice, one based solely on my hormones.</p><p>But then he steps back and raises his hands in front of him, surrendering. \u201cFine, you want me gone, then I\u2019ll leave.\u201d He storms to the door, pausing just in front of it to call over his shoulder, \u201cAislin put some clothes in the dresser if you want to get dressed.\u201d He jerks open the door and steps out in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I ask, but he slams the door shut, cutting me off and leaving me alone in an unfamiliar room with my thoughts and confusion.</p><p>I stare at the door for an eternity, trying to decide what to do. There\u2019s no way he would really leave, is there? I doubt it, though I\u2019m still not simply going to sit around and wonder.</p><p>I stumble over to the window, dizzy and kind of nauseous. How long have I been out? I glance outside at the city and the sun setting. Hours? Days? Weeks? I have no idea. The last thing I can remember is Alex holding the rock in front of me and then seeing images of what I\u2019d be missing out on, or what I thought I\u2019d be missing out on. Then I blacked out and saw my mom begging me to help her. The question is: was that a dream or something more?</p><p>Moving away from the window, I open the top dresser drawer and find a few clothes folded up inside. I take out a pair of very small, black shorts and a tight, maroon tank top that has a black ribbon lacing the front. Definitely not my style, but everything else in the drawer resembles the slutty gothic look so I slip them on anyway. There\u2019s some sort of elastic in the shirt that pushes my breasts up and I feel fully exposed as I pull my tangled, long, brown hair up into a ponytail and secure it with an elastic that I find on top of the nightstand next to the bed. I carefully peel back the bandage on my wrist, wincing as the tender wound hits the air. It\u2019s still fairly fresh, which means too much time couldn\u2019t have gone by since I\u2019d cut it open.</p><p>Sighing, I wrap it back up and search the room for my shoes. I find a pair of black combat boots next to the foot of the bed and quickly put them on.</p><p>I feel almost naked with the way my ass hangs out of the shorts and I wonder why on earth Aislin would put this outfit in there for me. It\u2019s definitely not her style, either.</p><p>I go out into the hall, wondering where I\u2019m supposed to be going. There\u2019s a line of doors on my one side and a spiral stairway to my other. I turn for the stairway, when arms slip around my waist. I open my mouth to scream when a hand clamps down over my mouth. There\u2019s no electricity, no sign that it\u2019s Alex and all I can think is that I\u2019m in deep shit.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d someone whispers in my ear. \u201cRelax. It\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>I try to twist my arms free as I squirm against the stranger. Yet they easily haul me back into the room as if I weigh nothing.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Gemma. Calm down,\u201d Laylen says in a sultry voice as he loosens his grip on me. \u201cIt\u2019s me. It\u2019s Laylen.\u201d He lets me go and I reel around, panting with my hand over my heart as he shuts the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d I pant profusely as I work to slow down my rapid heartbeat. \u201cYou scared the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh...\u201d Laylen puts his finger up to his deep red lips that are ornamented with a silver loop. He glances around the room and then at the window. \u201cKeep your voice down.\u201d</p><p>I take in the sight of him, insanely tall, at least a few inches taller than Alex with striking blue eyes and skin as pale as snow. Wisps of his blonde hair hang down his forehead, the tips dyed blue. He\u2019s dressed head to toe in black, very gothic, very sexy, in a way that sends me yearning for things it really shouldn\u2019t. I remember how I used to dream about Laylen, back before I met him, or re-met him anyway. The dreams were erotic and would alternate between Alex and Laylen. I wonder if they mean anything. If down the road, I could end up doing something with Laylen. The idea is exciting and unsettling at the same time, considering I have feelings for Alex and Aislin has feelings for Laylen, yet I also have feelings for Laylen, too; I merely can\u2019t quite decipher what kind yet.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I have to be quiet?\u201d I hiss, standing up straight and stepping toward him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He glances nervously around the room again and then locks the door. \u201cSo what do you think about what Alex told you?\u201d He rests back against the door, his gaze flickering to the top of the shirt that I\u2019m pretty much bulging out of.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d I fold my arms over my chest self-consciously. \u201cSome of it seems plausible, but it seems like he\u2019s still keeping a lot from me. Like the fact that his father just disappeared along with the Death Walkers and just left us all behind.\u201d</p><p>He rakes his fingers through his hair, leaving his hand on the back of his neck, his elbow bent upward. \u201cI\u2019m unsure about that part, too... I\u2019m hesitant about a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>I sink down on the foot of the bed. \u201cWhen you guys came back from Nevada, how did everything seem? Was it only Alex and me inside that mess of a cabin?\u201d</p><p>He takes a seat beside me, sitting near enough that our legs press together. I can\u2019t help thinking about how he can manipulate emotions and, for a second, I contemplate telling him to give me a moment of solace, anything to make the pain go away.</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d he says. \u201cAlex was just sitting there, holding you. He looked like he was freaking out, but then when he saw us, he went completely calm.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s so confusing, a tangled mess of wires that need to be unwound. I ask him a few more questions about what Alex has told him so we can compare stories. For the most part, everything adds up, nearly matching. Maybe a little too much, as if Alex\u2019s story was rehearsed. I think about all the times he lied to me; how he pretended he didn\u2019t know me when he did, how he knew my memories had been erased, yet only divulged the information when I asked him. He\u2019s extremely good at keeping secrets, what's not to say he doesn\u2019t have more locked away inside him?</p><p>\u201cSo do you believe him?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhen he says he has no clue where the Death Walkers and Stephan went or why they ran off?\u201d</p><p>He stretches out his legs in front of him and crosses them at the ankles. \u201cI have no idea what the hell to believe.\u201d He leans in, his shoulder brushing against mine as he lowers his voice. \u201cWhat I do know is that there\u2019s a slim to none chance that the Death Walkers are just going to leave when they know you have the star\u2019s energy in you. Plus, if Stephan\u2019s in on it with Demetrius and the Death Walkers, which I\u2019m sure he is, then he\u2019s the kind of person that\u2019ll do anything to get what he wants. So walking away from you is pretty much impossible if what he wants is the star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I saw that\u2019s what he wants,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI mean, he showed up with a herd of Death Walkers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder why, though. I wonder if it\u2019s for the same reason as Demetrius... if he wants to open the portal... or he has other plans for you and the star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaylen did you... do you know that Stephan is Immortal?\u201d</p><p>With a clenched jaw, Laylen nods. \u201cNot until yesterday, though... when we got you here. Alex explained some things that apparently he\u2019s been keeping from everyone\u2014even Aislin. Like the fact that his asshole of a father pretty much can\u2019t be killed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow is that possible, though?\u201d I eye over the black ink tattooing his skin, the Mark of Immortality. \u201cI mean, I know you are because you\u2019re a Vampire, but what does that make Stephan?\u201d</p><p>Laylen scratches at the Greek-like marks on his arm. \u201cHe could be a lot of things. There are a lot of different breeds that get the mark... Alex says he doesn\u2019t know why his father has it, though. Only that Stephan told him once that he couldn\u2019t be killed by anything.\u201d Laylen rolls his eyes as I cringe. \u201cAlex didn\u2019t even question him, and I\u2019m not surprised. He always did what his father said... until in the cabin... supposedly.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut still, wouldn\u2019t it seem normal to be suspicious? Especially when he told Alex that he can\u2019t even be killed with the Sword of Immortality, which is supposed to be able to kill all Immortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if Alex fully understands the word suspicious,\u201d I point out. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even understand why I\u2019m suspicious over everything he does... but how can I not be after everything that\u2019s happened?\u201d I pause, taking an unsteady breath. \u201cI\u2019m not sure who I can trust.\u201d</p><p>Laylen offers me a sympathetic look and then places a hand on my leg. His touch causes a very mystifying feeling inside me that coils all the way up to my thighs. \u201cYou can trust me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that.\u201d I actually mean it, too. Something about Laylen makes him seem like a very trustworthy person, which is what I need at the moment. \u201cWhat else did Alex tell you?\u201d</p><p>Amusement develops on his face. \u201cHe told me that you guys took a little trip to the City of Crystal where you discovered that you\u2019re a Foreseer.\u201d</p><p>I rub my hand tensely on the mark on the back of my neck\u2014the inky black circle wrapping the \u2018S\u2019\u2014the one that brands me a Foreseer. \u201cDid he tell you about the vision I went into while I was down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Laylen hesitantly answers. \u201cDo you want to talk about it? I know it has to be hard for you to deal with, seeing that happen to your mother.\u201d</p><p>Images stab at my mind like shards of glass; Stephan forcing my mom to go into the lake, the entrance to The Underworld where she\u2019s been tortured by Faeries. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s any way she can still be alive? My mom, I mean... while I was blacked out I had a dream or something and I saw her... she was begging me to help her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asks and I nod. He stares at me contemplatively. Part of me grows eager, the stupid side probably, thinking he might say yes, there is a possibility that my mother, who I haven\u2019t seen since I was four years-old, and can barely remember\u2014thanks to the detachment of my soul from my emotions and the erasing of my memories\u2014might still be alive.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Gemma,\u201d he utters quietly, giving my knee a squeeze. \u201cShe\u2019s been down there for a really long time.... But maybe. I mean, there\u2019s been some people that I\u2019ve heard of who\u2019ve survived the Water Faerie\u2019s torture for a really long time without going too insane... God, there\u2019s even been a few people who\u2019ve escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you being serious?\u201d I ask. \u201cAlex made it sound like there wasn\u2019t a way to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get mad at him for that.\u201d Laylen slips his arm around my back and draws me closer to him. He puts his lips right beside my ear and whispers in a deep voice, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hang out with the same crowd as I do, does he?\u201d</p><p>I turn my head to the side and our lips nearly touch. \u201cAnd what kind of crowd is that? A Vampire crowd? Witch crowd? Black Angel crowd? There are so many crowds in this crazy ass world I\u2019ve been thrown into.\u201d</p><p>He grins mischievously. \u201cThe everything kind of crowd.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re so close that I can\u2019t help thinking about how amazing it\u2019d feel if he just took me over, owned my emotions; got my thoughts of dying, the end of the world and, ultimately, Alex out of my head for a while. \u201cIs there any way we can find out if she\u2019s still alive and where she is?\"</p><p>\u201cIt depends on how brave you are,\u201d he says with a wink.</p><p>I force a small smile, but thoughts of my mom drowning in a lake of Fey haunt my mind. If she\u2019s alive, I need to save her, like she asked me to in the dream, if that\u2019s what it was. \u201cAre you trying to get me all riled up for some reason?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and a grin slips through. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to tell you the truth, so you know what you\u2019re walking into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d I assure him, which doesn\u2019t seem like a lie. \u201cI want answers\u2014real answers\u2014and I\u2019ll do whatever I have to in order to get them.\u201d</p><p>He mulls over what I said, nibbling on his bottom lip, making sucking noises as he draws the lip ring in between his teeth. \u201cThen I say we do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what exactly?\u201d I\u2019m practically bouncing with excitement. \u201cI need to know what I\u2019m getting into.\u201d</p><p>He inclines back a little and his gaze fleetingly glides to the bed. It scares me for some reason, the idea that he might be thinking something that requires me being on the bed. Again I try to sift through my emotions to figure out how I feel about him, but I can\u2019t quite understand it and the prickle seems to be stuck in the REM cycle.</p> <p>\u201cYou remember that club we got the Sword of Immortality from?\u201d he checks.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, and I really remember how the bartender spiked my drink with a rufi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, where we\u2019re going is similar, but worse.\u201d Worry laces his tone.</p><p>I consider what he said, recollecting the Black Dungeon and how I pretty much attacked Alex after drinking that drink. Alex was there to help me, but he won\u2019t be this time. I\u2019m not sure I want him to be, either. \u201cYou think it\u2019s worth it to go check it out? That there might be answers there?\u201d</p><p>He nods with confidence. \u201cI think your mom may know more about what\u2019s going on than anyone does. I think that might be why Stephan sent her there. That and to keep her away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too,\u201d I agree. \u201cIn the vision I saw\u2014the one where Stephan forced her into the lake\u2014she said she knew things about Stephan that eventually everyone else would figure out.\u201d</p><p>Plus, I really just want to see my mom. I miss her, even though I really don\u2019t know her, and the idea of seeing her again is enough to make me risk anything. The only family I ever had was Marco and Sophia, my supposed grandparents and two of the most cold-hearted people I know.</p><p>\u201cLaylen, what happened to Marco and Sophia?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Laylen shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I feel like we need to find out. They were part of removing your soul and they might know something as well... but no one can seem to find them at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they just vanished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d he says. \u201cAt least that\u2019s what Alex told me. He tried to get a hold of them when we got here.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head with disdain. \u201cDespite everything, Alex seems to think that Keepers are still trustworthy and the only kind he can seek help from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are we going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d Alex\u2019s voice floats through the door. \u201cAre you in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...yeah,\u201d I call out, shifting away from Laylen, as though I\u2019m doing something wrong. \u201cI\u2019m in here with\u2014\u201d</p><p>Laylen covers my mouth with his hand and puts a finger up to his lips, shushing me. \u201cIf he knows I\u2019m in here, then he\u2019ll know something\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what,\u201d I whisper back, my voice muffled against his palm. \u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do?\u201d</p><p>Laylen aims me a \u201creally\u201d look. \u201cGet pissed off. Not let you go with me. Lock you in a cellar and never let you out just so no one else can touch you.\u201d At the end his lips tug upward. \u201cYou know how he is with you.\u201d He removes his hand from my mouth.</p><p>I frown. He\u2019s right. If Alex finds out about this, he won\u2019t let me go. Besides, I\u2019m not even sure I can trust him. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>Alex bangs on the door again. \u201cGemma, can you open the door?\u201d</p><p>I feel the prickle emerge on the back of my neck, begging me to open the door and let him in; allow him to see me with Laylen and think something\u2019s going on. I might have to, but Laylen abruptly gets up from the bed, drops down to his hands and knees and crawls underneath the bed.</p><p>I watch him with wide eyes as I scramble to my feet. \u201cSeriously? You\u2019re going to hide under the bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust pretend I\u2019m not here,\u201d he whispers as the last of his legs vanish.</p><p>I stand there, stunned, feeling like I\u2019m a teenager hiding my boyfriend from my parents, only I never really had that experience since I\u2019d never had a boyfriend or parents.</p><p>Alex knocks on the door again and a breath eases out of my mouth before I walk over to open it up. The second I see him, my emotions entwine together into a very perplexing knot, even though it\u2019s only been like an hour since I last saw him. I don\u2019t understand why it happens, why I\u2019m so turned onto him when he infuriates me to no end. I\u2019m seriously starting to wonder if because of all those years trapped in an unemotional state, my body and head are now broken, unable to deal with the newfound emotions recently piled onto me.</p><p>He looks very uncomfortable for some reason, however the black mark looks like its fading. \u201cTook you long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were leaving,\u201d I retaliate, leaning against the open door, aiming for nonchalant, but it comes off a little twitchier than I planned.</p><p>His eyes narrow, patronizing me. \u201cNow why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you said you would,\u201d I reply simply.</p><p>He braces his hands on the doorway, invading my comfort zone and my gaze zeros in on his solid stomach muscles as his shirt rides up. \u201cWell, you\u2019re the one who kept insisting I was a liar. I\u2019m just living up to my reputation, something I\u2019m really good at.\u201d</p><p>I try not to stare at his muscles, but thoughts of how they moved as he thrust inside me haunt my mind. I\u2019m still not sure how I feel about having sex, or if I feel anything other than confusion. I wonder if that\u2019s normal.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something?\u201d I shake my head at the unevenness of my voice.</p><p>He elevates his brows with suspicion. \u201cYou\u2019ve been up here forever. What have you been doing?\u201d</p><p>I gesture at my new outfit. \u201cChanging.\u201d</p><p>His eyes scan down my body, warming every single inch of my skin. His eyes linger a little too long on my chest area then finally land on my eyes and I can\u2019t tell what he\u2019s thinking at all.</p><p>\u201cYou look good,\u201d is all he says.</p><p>\u201cUm... thanks, I guess,\u201d I mutter, folding my arms over my chest.</p><p>His lips smash together as he deliberates something. Then he steps toward me, taking me by surprise as he lines his body with mine and I have no choice except to back up against the door. Fireworks of heat erupt as he pins my shoulders between his arms, his hands resting beside my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGemma, I don\u2019t want to fight with you,\u201d he says gently, changing his attitude in the snap of a finger. I\u2019m beginning to understand that he\u2019s good at doing that. \u201cI didn\u2019t... I didn\u2019t work to save you only so we could sit here and argue with each other.\u201d</p><p>His sincerity is puzzling since he\u2019s not much of a sincere type of guy. My eyes drift to his head at the dissolving black spot, the brand of his supposed good deed.</p><p>\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhen it bounced back on you?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his tongue in his mouth, like he\u2019s restraining a laugh. \u201cNot too bad, but I\u2019m good at handling pain, much more than other things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the non-pain part of it?\u201d With each ravening breath I take, my chest brushes against his.</p><p>He shakes his head and his forehead brushes against mine. We\u2019re almost pressing against each other, but there\u2019s still a sliver of space between our bodies, a boundary we need at the moment, until some sort of trust can be established.</p><p>\u201cThere was no non-pain part of it.\u201d His voice is strained as he starts to twist the ribbon on my shirt around his finger. \u201cIt didn\u2019t do anything other than give me a really, really bad fucking headache.\u201d</p><p>I hate this drive toward him. The invisible pull that I still don\u2019t understand. The overwhelming need to touch him, rip his clothes off, bite his lip, scratch his skin and feel his rock-hard body. I should be angry with him, yet I can\u2019t seem to get to that place.</p><p>My fingertips dare to go to the place my mind is heading, drifting to the top of his jeans, then skimming underneath the fabric. I feel him tense and I tense, too. I\u2019m about to go there and what really surprises me is how bad I want to do it, want to touch him. I can tell he wants to touch me also, his lips are dipping closer to mine as we breathe frantically. My back arches and my chest presses against his, my body and mind wanting more\u2014needing more. I feel starved from something, but I\u2019m having a hard time placing what.</p> <p>\u201cJesus... Gemma...\u201d He lets out a throaty groan and his eyes start to shut as my hand travels lower. I start rubbing him through his boxers until he becomes hard and tugs on the ribbon of my shirt to unlace the front. The curves of my breasts become more exposed along with my bra. My other hand wanders up the front of him, resting on the top of his heart, crushed between our bodies. I can feel it pounding in his chest, racing almost as fast as mine. Our lips brush, the connection sparking, and he lets out another groan, this time louder. Suddenly, I remember that there\u2019s a six-foot four, blue-eyed, blond haired, sexy Vampire hiding under my bed. Shit. I lean back, pulling my hands out of the top of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Aislin and Laylen?\u201d I ask, breathless.</p><p>He blinks and the emotion drains from his expression. Holding my gaze, he unwinds the loosened ribbon from his finger and pushes back from the door. \u201cDownstairs I think.\u201d</p><p>Just like that the tension and desire melt into a puddle below our feet.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to Aislin?\u201d I ask, refastening the ribbon.</p><p>He shrugs, pretending to be unbothered, but he seems uneasy. \u201cYou can do whatever you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be down in a second.\u201d I step to the side and hold the door wide open so he\u2019ll leave, even though I don\u2019t want him to at all. I want to put my hands back down the front of his jeans and let him completely untie my shirt.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He turns his back on me and walks out. \u201cGoddammit, why do you have to be so frustrating?\u201d he mutters to himself, although it\u2019s loud enough that I can hear it.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d I mumble back, then quickly shut the door and whirl around to the bed. \u201cLaylen?\u201d</p><p>He army crawls from underneath the bed, his soft laughter making me uneasy. He stands up straight, brushing some dust off his clothes. \u201cFuck. That was really awkward.\u201d</p><p>I fidget with the ribbon on my shirt. \u201cNothing happened.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, rearranging his hair into place. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t,\u201d I argue, but my cheeks heat. \u201cI swear nothing did.\u201d</p><p>He presses back a smile and strides for the window. \u201cAll I know is that those noises are going to haunt me for life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I apologize. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I did it... why I\u2019m like that towards him.\u201d</p><p>He smiles sadly at me from over his shoulder \u201cBecause you two have history together and a connection nothing can compete with.\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head to the side. \u201cWe do?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders rise and fall as he shrugs. \u201cKind of... you\u2019ll have to ask him about it, though.\u201d</p><p>I sift through my memories, knowing I\u2019m probably not going to see anything, but trying anyway. As usual, I see blankness, then a few fading clips, however nothing important appears in my mind\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cSo now what.\u201d I change the subject.</p><p>He hesitates, staring out the window. \u201cWell, here\u2019s where things get tricky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet tricky?\u201d I step up beside him and peer down at the three-story drop to a mostly vacant asphalt parking lot. \u201cThings have been tricky for a very, very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but they\u2019re about to get trickier.\u201d He unlatches the window, pushes it open, and sticks his head out, looking down below. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to just walk out the front door. Adessa set up these charms so if someone tries to come in or go out, she\u2019ll know. It\u2019s her version of a security system.\u201d</p><p>My jaw drops as he ducks back into the window. \u201cOh my God. You want us to climb out the window. Are you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way,\u201d he says simply, gripping the windowsill. \u201cAll the downstairs windows have charms on them, and although I\u2019m not sure exactly what Adessa\u2019s charms do if they get set off, I\u2019d really rather not find out.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the window with uncertainty. It\u2019s getting late, the sky is getting grey as the sun plummets below the tips of the towering buildings. \u201cCan\u2019t we just tell Adessa what we\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalking downstairs means facing Alex,\u201d he remarks, slanting his head to the side to meet my eyes. \u201cAre you ready to deal with that? Tell him what you want and then fight him until he lets you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then... \u201d</p><p>I sigh, shuffle my way to the window, and sit down on the windowsill. \u201cI really do hate heights.\u201d</p><p>He playfully pinches my leg. \u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d I say truthfully. \u201cBut how are we even supposed to get down there? Do you have some kind of like climbing-down-the-wall superpower or something?\u201d My voice turns mocking. \u201cOr are we just going to scale it with some sheets we\u2019ve tied together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheets would tear.\u201d He shakes his head, seeming entertained. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a Vampire, not Spiderman, so no. I don\u2019t have any climbing down superpowers.\u201d He pauses, blowing out an uneven breath. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get on my back, and I\u2019m going to jump out.\u201d</p><p>I start to laugh, but the sound quickly dissolves. \u201cTell me you\u2019re joking. Please.\u201d I stand up from the windowsill, shaking my head as I back away. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t get hurt.\u201d He sits down and swings his long legs out the window. \u201cThat far of a fall won\u2019t hurt me at all. It\u2019s a Vampire thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m not a Vampire,\u201d I say. \u201cThe fall will hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll be on my back, so I can break the fall for you.\u201d He winks at me. Even though he\u2019s adorably sexy, I\u2019m still not hopping on board his death plan.</p><p>\u201cI hate heights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I hate biting people, yet I\u2019ve still done it a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaylen...\u201d I\u2019m torn between wanting the truth and dying to get it.</p><p>He sighs disappointedly. \u201cDo you want me to go alone? Because I can. I just thought, since you\u2019ve been in the dark for so long, you\u2019d like to be a part of it, however it\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s giving me a choice. No one has ever given me a choice. I could seriously kiss him right now because I want to be part of this and help save my mother. \u201cAlright...I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a lopsided smile. \u201cGood. Now hop on.\u201d</p><p>I summon a deep breath and do what he says. I slip a leg on each side of his waist, so I have my legs wrapped around his midsection, my chest pressed up to his back, and my ass against the windowsill.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d Laylen asks as I move around, trying to get situated.</p><p>I tighten my arms and legs around him. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Gemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to try and not drop you,\u201d he says.</p><p>Before I can respond, he dismounts from the windowsill and, the next thing I know, I\u2019m falling.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>It\u2019s over by the time I actually acknowledge we\u2019r falling. Laylen lands with the gracefulness of a cat, his feet delicately touching the asphalt, and I barely feel the impact.</p><p>For a moment, neither of us moves nor breathes. Even the air seems to pause, as if we fell so fast we\u2019re waiting for the rest of the world to catch up.</p><p>\u201cYou alive back there?\u201d Laylen asks from over his shoulder. His arms are wound around my legs, supporting my weight as I clutch onto his shoulders.</p><p>I peek open my eyes, crane my neck, and glance up at the window above us. \u201cYeah, a little bit more of a warning would have been nice, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you would have just anticipated it and psyched yourself out,\u201d he says. \u201cUnexpected is always the best when there\u2019s fear involved.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I get his logic, but fear is also very new to my vocabulary. I nod and climb off his back then stretch out my legs and pop my neck, alleviating some of the tension in me.</p><p>We walk across the parking lot beneath the shimmering stars dusting the desert sky. The sound of rushing traffic and flashing lights surround us, along with rustic buildings. The entire area is decorated with graffiti, the ground is littered with garbage, and the lack of people around makes the scenario uneasy, yet at the same time calm.</p><p>\u201cYou said that we are going to a place worse than the Black Dungeon,\u201d I remark as we make a right down a narrower, more secluded street. \u201cSo does that mean there\u2019s going to be a bunch of strange creatures with lizard tongues and weird eyes or whatever?\u201d</p><p>He glances at me from the corner of his eye as he stuffs his hands into his pockets. \u201cActually, no. The only things you\u2019re going to find in this place are either human or simply have really sharp, pointy teeth.\u201d He traces his tongue along his teeth. \u201cNo weird eyes or lizards tongues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a club for Vampires,\u201d I state the obvious. I scoot in closer to him as a sketchy looking man wearing a black hoodie walks by us. \u201cHow high are my chances of being bit, then?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he drapes his arm around my shoulders. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let anyone bite you, sweetheart. Seriously.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut there will be people getting bit?\u201d</p><p>He goes rigid. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cWill they... will the Vampires be killing them?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cThis is just a feeding ground, a place to feed on willing humans in a closed space where you don\u2019t have to worry about getting caught.\u201d</p> <p>I angle my neck back to look at him. \u201cWilling humans?\u201d</p><p>He nods once, his eyes focused on the sidewalk ahead. \u201cVampire bites are intoxicating in ways I can\u2019t even begin to explain. Some humans love it... it\u2019s like a drug for them and so they come to clubs like these to get their next hit.\u201d</p><p>I picture teeth sinking into my neck. Pain. Then euphoria? If it\u2019s true, it sounds kind of sexy.</p><p>I push the thought from my head. \u201cSo who is this all-knowing person that we\u2019re going to see?\u201d</p><p>He inches to the left as a sleek, black car rolls up the road, driving close to the curb. \u201cDraven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe guy you were so afraid of back at the Black Dungeon? I thought he was dangerous and the reason why... the reason why Aislin got bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAislin got bit because she was a Keeper and most Vampires loathe Keepers.\u201d His jaw goes taut as we round the side of a warehouse. The road reaches a dead-end of dumpsters that line the walls of boarded up, metal buildings. \u201cYou\u2019re not a Keeper, so you should be fine, but I\u2019m not going to try and convince you that what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t dangerous. I think you deserve more than being lied to and walking in blindly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I appreciate that,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m just a little nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfectly understandable,\u201d Laylen replies as we halt in front of a door on the side a large, rusty looking warehouse. \u201cBut Draven should be able to help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how I can control emotions?\u201d</p> <p>Goosebumps dot my skin, but more from excitement than the cold. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He glances up at the stars in the sky. \u201cWell, Draven has a different kind of gift\u2014or curse depending on how you want to look at it. He can see what\u2019s going on in different realms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRealms, like The Underworld.\u201d I shiver.</p><p>He nods, his attention drifting to the door. \u201cSo, if we can get him to agree, he should be able to see if your mom\u2019s still there... it\u2019s going to be hard, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSince nothing is ever easy.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a partial smile and then removes his arm from my shoulder to rap his hand on the door. The sound echoes from the inside, the only noise that can be heard around us. I\u2019m about to ask him why it\u2019s so quiet when the door swings open and light floods the night.</p><p>On the other side of the door is a tall man wearing a hoodie and his dark eyes resemblie coals. His skin is extremely pale like Laylen\u2019s, his lips are a deep red, and he has a sequence of tattoos on his neck.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, if it isn\u2019t the cruor fastidio.\" He leans against the crooked doorframe, assessing Laylen with his dark eyes while I struggle to figure out what a cruor fastidio means.</p> <p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ve drank blood, Kameron\u201d Laylen replies, his blue eyes intense and his voice sinking to a low octave. \u201cI merely choose to do it only when necessary.\u201d</p><p>Kameron shakes his head as he runs his tongue along his teeth. \u201cBlood is always necessary in life, but you really don\u2019t have one, do you?\u201d</p><p>Laylen glances at me and then to Kameron, remaining nonchalant. \u201cI need inside. Now.\u201d</p><p>Kameron\u2019s eyes devour me. \u201cAnd who\u2019s this lovely creature right here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one you need to know,\u201d Laylen states, inching in front of me so I\u2019m partially hidden behind him.</p><p>Kameron leans to the side to get a better look at me. \u201cShe looks like a Black Angel, but the nervousness in her bloodstream suggests otherwise,\u201d he says and then waits for something. Perhaps for Laylen to deny that I am a Black Angel or insist that I do have hidden wings on my back, but Laylen never utters a word. \u201cFine, remain silent then.\u201d He steps back, getting ready to close the door.</p><p>Laylen slams his hand forcefully against it, shoving the door back open. \u201cI said I need in.\u201d His blue eyes blaze and his voice is low, sultry, dangerous.</p><p>It\u2019s giving me the chills and adrenaline crashes through my body. I\u2019m scared, yet excited for things I\u2019m not sure I should be excited for. I inch back, but only because my mind and body are becoming so perplexed. I wonder if it\u2019s because Laylen is getting pissed and his emotion gift\u2014or curse\u2014is no longer under his control.</p><p>\u201cYou know the rules.\u201d Kameron draws the hoodie off his head. His hair is black like the night sky and there\u2019s a scar running diagonally on the side of it. \u201cI can\u2019t let a Black Angel in here. Only Vampires and humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is human,\u201d Laylen breathes through gritted teeth, slanting in toward Kameron. \u201cNow open the door.\u201d</p><p>Kameron stands upright, trying to stand taller than Laylen, but he lacks the height. \u201cShe looks like one, though.\u201d</p><p>Laylen backs up with his arms expanded out to the side of him. \u201cBut she\u2019s not and, if you\u2019d look harder, you\u2019d realize it.\u201d</p><p>Humor dances in Kameron\u2019s eyes. He\u2019s toying with us and completely enjoying it. \u201cProve it. Make her bleed. Black Angels won\u2019t bleed.\u201d</p><p>I wince at the mention of blood and immediately recoil. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Laylen looks over his shoulder and the fire in his eyes makes me cower back even more. For a second I think he\u2019s going to attack me, but then he blinks and the Laylen I know reappears. He turns back to Kameron. \u201cNo fucking way,\u201d he growls.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re not getting in,\u201d he replies and starts to close the door again, about to slam my opportunity to find out about my mom away.</p><p>I peel back the bandage on my wrist and stride forward showing him my fresh wound. \u201cLook, it\u2019s almost still bleeding.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI want to see your body dripping out blood.\u201d</p><p>My expression falls. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s not fair.\u201d Kameron pauses with an impish smile on his lips and I can tell he\u2019s just messing with our heads. \u201cI want to see Laylen bite you.\u201d</p><p>Laylen and mine\u2019s jaws drop. \u201cNo way,\u201d Laylen says, seeming horrified. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Kameron opens his mouth, showing me his set of teeth, white, glinting, fangs fully in view. \u201cVampires feed on blood, Laylen. That\u2019s what we were made to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Laylen repeats simply. \u201cI won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Kameron\u2019s eyes fix on me. \u201cTrust me, if you let me sink my fangs into,\u201d he inhales deeply, his nostrils flaring, \u201cthat delicious looking skin of yours, I swear you\u2019ll be begging me to never stop.\u201d</p><p>On the inside I squirm, but on the outside I\u2019m surprisingly composed. \u201cAt first, you said that I need to bleed, not let you feed on me, so give me a damn knife and I\u2019ll show you I have blood in me, even though I\u2019m pretty sure you already know that.\u201d</p><p>I expect him to get angry, but instead he cocks his eyebrows. \u201cYou know, I really didn\u2019t believe you were one, but the cockiness and boldness coming out of you right now is making me second guess my original assumption.\u201d Kameron starts to slowly shut the door again. \u201cNow bite or no deal.\u201d</p><p>I almost hiss at him and snap my teeth. I have no idea where my emotions are coming from at the moment. Whether it\u2019s from the disturbing environment, or if Laylen\u2019s manipulating my emotions. I turn to Laylen and tip my chin to meet his eyes.</p><p>I\u2019m trying not to get angry, but the idea of punching Kameron in the face right now is really appealing. He\u2019s the one thing getting in my way of perhaps learning something about my mother\u2019s whereabouts.</p><p>\u201cBite me,\u201d I tell Laylen and his eyes nearly pop out of his head. Before he can argue, I add, \u201cJust scuff my skin with your teeth. You don\u2019t have to drink any of my blood, just spill some out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s not fun.\u201d Kameron pouts as he crosses his arms and leans against the doorway. \u201cI want to see a show.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him. Sick, twisted, pervert.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for fun,\u201d Laylen says, and my attention returns to him. His eyes locked on me and his brows are furrowed. \u201cIt\u2019s only so you have to let us in.\u201d</p><p>Kameron rolls his eyes. \u201cFine. Scrape your teeth against her and prove that she\u2019s a mere mortal... so fucking boring.\u201d</p><p>Laylen\u2019s lip twitches as he stares down at me. His body spasms as he struggles to keep his expression tranquil and I wonder what I\u2019m getting into; how dangerous will this really be? Will he lose control? Drink my blood? Kill me? Do I care?</p><p>I stick my trembling arm toward him and his gaze instantly snaps down to it, zoning in on my wrist. In the moonlight, my skin looks white and the bluish purple vein below it is visible.</p><p>Laylen\u2019s long, cold fingers curl around my wrist and he wets his lips with his tongue. Then he lowers his mouth to my arm and my heart slams inside my chest as his lips part, his neck muscles tensing as a pair of fangs descend from his gum line. He lets out a growl that makes my heart leap and then a groan that makes my stomach somersault. I try to hold as still as I can, but a flurry of emotions\u2014some dark, some fearful, some needy\u2014whisk through me as I watch his mouth brush my wrist.</p><p>He bites on his bottom lip, sucking his lip ring into his teeth, and strands of his blond hair fall into his eyes. Seconds later, I feel a sharp, fiery sting as his fangs delve into my wrist and pierce through my skin.</p><p>\u201cAhh...\u201d The pain mingled with bliss in my voice shocks me. My muscles tense as blood seeps out of my wrist, two pools of blood trickling a path down my arm.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t put the fangs in deep, but he doesn\u2019t pull back, either. His eyes shut and he lets out a deep, throaty groan that sends a shiver of pleasure through my body. I bite down on my lip hard to keep myself from begging him to sink his teeth into my pulse. It feels so Goddamn good and the idea of them being in further\u2014him being in further\u2014is driving me crazy. My skin is humming, my pulse throbbing, and my mind as well as my body are spinning out of control. I reach up and clutch onto his shoulder with my free hand.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d he whispers, his breath hot against my skin. \u201cI need to stop...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t what...\u201d I breathe, forgetting where I am, what\u2019s happening. Nothing other than his teeth and my blood seem to matter.</p><p>He pulls away, looking euphoric, like he\u2019s high on my blood; his pupils possessive and out of touch with reality. The look makes my pulse hammer even faster and I can feel an emotion drizzling through my veins; a comforting need to surrender myself to Laylen. The lesions on my wrist continue to trickle out blood, a red trail rolling down my hand and onto the pavement below my feet. I cover them with my hand, trying to limit the amount spilled, but only because of Kameron and the fear that the sight of it might cause him to attack me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laylen\u2019s fingers are trembling as he opens his eyes and releases my wrist. He holds my gaze for a moment and the atmosphere intensifies between us as a connection forms. Ripping his gaze off me, he turns to Kameron. \u201cNow get the fuck out of the way,\u201d he orders in a stern, yet subdued voice.</p><p>Kameron\u2019s demeanor is casual as he steps back, sucking in a breath and breathing in a mouthful of air. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to share?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe could each take a wrist.\u201d</p><p>Laylen says nothing and shoves his way inside the warehouse, slamming his hand against Kameron\u2019s chest hard enough that he crashes into the door. I hurry in, pressing my hand to my wrist.</p><p>\u201cOh, fine. Take the fun out of my job.\u201d Kameron shuts the door and walks around us, heading for a spiral stairway in the middle of the empty concrete room. We follow him and, with each step, the air grows colder and the atmosphere darker as the roof shifts from dingy, broken skylights to rusty, metal beams. I can hear music playing from somewhere, smell the potent scent of salt and sweat, and feel the ground pulsating below my boots from the rumble of the bass.</p> <p>When we arrive at the top of the stairway and halt as Kameron begins to unlock the multiple padlocks on a solid steel door. Laylen\u2019s head is down, his chin tucked in, and I\u2019m worried he\u2019s upset about what he\u2019s just done. I hook my finger under his chin to get a better look at his expression.</p><p>He\u2019s not upset. More like intense. His fangs have retracted, his blue eyes appear shades darker, almost like sapphires, and there\u2019s blood on the bottom of his lip, a thin trail just beside his lip ring. My blood, waiting for him to lick it.</p><p>\u201cYou have blood on you lip,\u201d I mutter. I reach forward and slowly swipe my finger along the spot of blood. I smear it a little and go over it again until most of it is off his lip and on my finger. I\u2019m about to pull my hand away, when his mouth unexpectedly moves forward and my finger ends up inside it on top of his tongue. Shutting his eyes, he sucks the blood off, licking my finger while he inhales deeply and then exhales.</p><p>He moves his mouth away as my jaw drops. I\u2019m shocked and shamefully turned on in ways I didn\u2019t know were possible. I pant heavily, my chest heaving. Laylen opens his eyes and his tongue slips out of his mouth again, licking the remaining blood off. \u201cGod... you taste so good...\u201d</p><p>Then Kameron utters something about letting him get a taste and Laylen looks away from me, breaking the tension as he glares at Kameron. Clearing my throat, I quickly wipe the blood on the side of my shorts and put my hand back over my injured wrist.</p> <p>Kameron gets the door open at the same time that Laylen catches my eye as we step over the threshold and onto the grated flooring. There\u2019s something in his expression, shame or desire. Perhaps a mixture of both.</p><p>I\u2019m freaking out inside, unsure how he feels at the moment or how I feel\u2014how I should feel. The prickle is getting me nowhere, stabbing at my neck and pumping all kinds of disorder through me.</p><p>Yet, as I glance around at the room, any thoughts or feelings of anything else float from my head.</p><p>Vampires. Everywhere. And they\u2019re feeding.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Watching a Vampire feed is a strange sight. However, watching an entire room of Vampires suck blood from willing humans is appalling. Yet, in the twisted side of me, the one I\u2019m barely getting to know, it\u2019s strangely stimulating.</p> <p>\u201cRascauche\u201d by At The Drive-In flows from the speakers surrounding the room. The lyrics and soft tune encompass the large floor and lights shimmer down onto the Vampires\u2019 euphoric faces. A lot of them are dancing, but some are simply standing in the light watching the others, doing one of two things that my mind can barely comprehend; touching each other and feeding off the blood of a human. Some have their fangs plunged deep into the neckline of the victim, while others choose the wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on your own now,\u201d Kameron calls out over the music, and then disappears somewhere into the crowd, grabbing the hair of a woman wearing a floor-length satin dress. She looks happy to be with him, content, and I wonder if I look the same way right now.</p><p>\u201cGood riddance,\u201d Laylen mutters, and then makes his way toward a bar at the back of the room, motioning me to follow. When he reaches the countertop, he scoops up a shot of a brownish liquid that the bartender magically puts down the moment he arrives. He swigs it down, sucking every last drop out with his head tipped back. He licks the brim of the glass with his tongue before dropping the empty glass back down on the counter.</p><p>The bartender, a medium height, curvy brunette smiles at Laylen as she wipes the counters down, her lips parting as if she\u2019s about to say something.</p><p>\u201cNot now, Taven.\u201d Laylen says, then makes a veer to the right toward a corridor with blood-red doors and floors as black as ash.</p><p>I rush to keep up and he waits for me in the arched entryway. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask as we enter the corridor. The black marble, domed ceiling is laced with red lines that look like blood and there are lanterns and a few chains as well as cuffs secured to the walls.</p><p>He nods only once, though his jaw tightens. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>I stay silent, hyperaware of his distant attitude. It terrifies me not only because he\u2019s my friend and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve broken him, but also because of the craving soaring through my body, the strange need for his fangs to return to my skin.</p> <p>Halfway down the corridor, we pass two large men dressed in black suits stationed in front of a shut door. Neither of them acknowledge us and we continue walking, the music from the bar fading the further down we go.</p><p>My wrist has stopped bleeding, but there\u2019s a drying trail on my hand. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>He nods, and then shakes his head, letting out a sigh that seems to clear the tension between us just a little. \u201cI\u2019ll get there... I just... I just hate drinking blood.\u201d He avoids eye contact with me. \u201cYet I don\u2019t, which makes me hate it more. And yours...\u201d He squeezes his eyes shut for a moment. \u201cGod, it smelled so intoxicating.\u201d</p><p>My heart aches for him, but at the same time his words put a wave of hunger in me; one that wants to feed, or him to feed on me anyway. We\u2019re embarking into dangerous territory and, even though I know it, it still takes me off guard.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t drink it, though,\u201d I remind him. \u201cOnly drew it from my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, I wanted to drink it.\u201d His gaze meets mine as we arrive in front of a door at the end of the hallway. There\u2019s a colossal, golden and black vase on each side and a mirror above it that reveals our reflections. We look high and sedated. \u201cI wanted to taste you, so fucking bad.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m unsure what to say to him. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He seems as perplexed as I do. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re agreeing to, but it feels like we\u2019re agreeing to something. The atmosphere lightens and Laylen\u2019s demeanor changes, his posture unstiffening, his jaw loosening.</p><p>He hesitates before knocking on the door. \u201cStay by me at all times,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I quickly nod as several latches click, and then the door cracks open.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d a voice snarls through the crack as smoke rushes out of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to talk to Draven,\u201d Laylen states calmly.</p><p>The door opens wider and a shorter man with silky blond hair and wearing a black suit steps forward. \u201cConcerning what?\u201d</p><p>Laylen tucks his hands into the pockets of his jeans. \u201cConcerning the donum of obscurum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very brave to come here and say such a thing,\u201d the blond guy states, his gaze sliding to me. \u201cIs this an offering?\"</p><p>Laylen protectively leans in toward me. \u201cNo, she\u2019s with me.\u201d</p><p>The guy rolls his eyes and starts to shut the door. \u201cCome back when you have something to offer. He doesn\u2019t just share his gift with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Laylen flattens his hand on the door and shoves his foot into the crack at the bottom, holding it open. \u201cI\u2019ll offer him something else, just not the girl.\u201d</p><p>The guy considers this for a moment, his eyes wandering to my wrist as he licks his lips. \u201cJust a second.\u201d He steps back and Laylen removes his hand and foot from the door so the guy can shut it.</p><p>I shoot Laylen a puzzled look and he puts his finger to his lips. A second later the door opens again and potent smoke rushes out so quickly I choke back a cough. I\u2019m not sure what kind of smoke it is and I think I might be better off left in the dark with this one.</p><p>The door opens wider and a different man stands on the other side with greasy black hair, pasty skin, and he\u2019s wearing a tuxedo while carrying a silver platter.</p><p>His fangs point out as he grins, gesturing at the room. \u201cPlease, do come in.\u201d</p><p>Laylen takes my hand as we enter the room. My pulse promptly quickens and he gives it a gentle squeeze, then his fingers move lower so they\u2019re covering the wounds on my wrist.</p><p>The room is small, though broad, with an extensive table down the center that\u2019s surrounded by spindle-back chairs. In every chair, a male Vampire sits holding cards, their fangs fully in view. Poker chips are stacked in front of them and there are ashtrays everywhere, covered with cigar butts. Standing behind each Vampire is a woman. They look human, but from a different era, their flowing corset dresses very out of date.</p><p>Laylen confidently approaches the table, dragging a very unconfident me along with him. As we reach it, one of the Vampires sitting at the end extends his arm back toward the woman behind him. He grabs the back of her neck and she voluntarily leans down to him. He sinks his teeth into her neck, gripping her waist as his sucks the blood from her vein. Her eyes roll back into her head as her body lifelessly slumps against his shoulder. She groans and pleads in a muffled voice for him to bite her more.</p><p>I tighten my hold on Laylen\u2019s hand. Then the Vampire releases her and she staggers back, plummeting to the flood with blood drenching her dress and neck.</p><p>The Vampire returns to his cards, wiping the blood from his chin with his hand, grinning as he says, \u201cI think I\u2019m about ready for another round.\u201d</p><p>The other Vampires mumble in agreement and reach for the women behind them. Shaking with fear, loathing, and curiosity, I let out a quiet gasp. Suddenly everyone is staring at us, and I wish I could shrink myself into a ball.</p><p>A man with jet-black hair sitting at the end of the table rises from his chair. He\u2019s tall, perhaps even taller than Laylen, with broad shoulders and dark eyes that match his shirt and slacks. He has a golden chain on his arm that stretches to a collar that\u2019s attached to a woman wearing a silky blue dress.</p><p>\u201cSo, Laylen,\u201d he says, walking toward us and dragging the woman with him. She seems dazed, her bare feet dragging along the floor as she stumbles after him. \u201cTo what do I owe the honor of a visit from the one and only known Keeper turned Vampire?\u201d His eyes flick over to me and he drinks me in as he stops in front of us and the woman kneels behind him. \u201cAnd with such breathtaking company.\u201d</p><p>Unsure of what to do, I hold his gaze, remaining impartial as I fight the urge to gape at the woman behind him.</p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d Laylen mutters, his grip constricting on my hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The man is fixed on me. \u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>An anxious breath eases from Laylen\u2019s lips. \u201cWith finding out if someone is still in The Underworld or if they\u2019ve escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d His eyebrows arch as he tears his eyes from me and resides his attention on Laylen. \u201cAnd what made you bring the human? I rarely see you with them, let alone biting them.\u201d He skims my wrist.</p><p>\u201cThe cost of getting in here.\u201d Laylen presses his lips together. \u201cYour guard wouldn\u2019t accept anything less.\u201d</p> <p>The man snakes the chain around his wrist, forcing the woman to crawl to his feet. \u201cYou should be thanking him, Laylen. I can tell by that euphoric look in your eyes that you must have enjoyed it.\u201d He glances at me, his nostrils flaring. \u201cShe does smell very divine.\u201d</p><p>Laylen says nothing, however his fingers compress into my skin.</p><p>The man grins at me. \u201cAllow me to introduce myself. I\u2019m Draven.\u201d My heart constricts in my chest as he sticks out his hand. Despite my wariness, I take it since he\u2019s the man who might be able to help me find my mother. He wraps his cold fingers around my hand, slides them up to my wrist and brings my knuckles up to his lips, placing a delicate kiss onto it. Then he inhales, breathing in my scent before letting my hand go. \u201cYes, very divine,\u201d he mutters, straightening back up. \u201cNow explain to me exactly what it is you need to know from me.\u201d He jerks on the chain and the collar on the woman\u2019s neck bites at her skin, causing her to whimper. \u201cWho is this person in The Underworld that you so desperately seek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said we were desperate?\u201d Laylen crosses his arms and maintains Draven\u2019s gaze.</p><p>Draven motions around at the room. \u201cLook where you are. You\u2019d have to be desperate to be here.\u201d</p> <p>Laylen glances around at the Vampires circling the table. They\u2019re no longer playing poker; their cards have been laid down as they watch. \u201cWould it be okay if we spoke in private?\u201d</p><p>Draven considers Laylen\u2019s request then calls over his shoulder, \u201cGentlemen, could you excuse us for a moment? It seems we have to discuss something of a serious nature, privately.\u201d There\u2019s humor in his voice, which makes it obvious that he\u2019s enjoying creating our feelings of uneasiness.</p><p>The Vampires get up from their chairs without arguing and file out of the room with the women beside them. After everyone\u2019s gone, Draven signals at us to have a seat at the table. We silently obey, either out of fear or the need for answers, and sit down beside each other. Draven sits in a chair across from us and the woman crouches beside him with her head hung low, her veil of auburn hair shielding her face.</p><p>Draven rolls up his sleeves, deliberately watching us. I notice that he has the Mark of Immortality on one forearm and on the other arm there\u2019s a bizarre looking set of triangles overlapping each other in black and red. Once he\u2019s finished, he relaxes back in the chair and studies us closely. \u201cSo who\u2019s this person you need to find and what makes her so important to you?\u201d</p><p>Laylen peeks at me from the corner of his eye. \u201cHer name is Jocelyn... Lucas.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitches in my throat at the sound of my mom\u2019s name and Laylen snatches hold of my hand from under the table, giving it a comforting squeeze.</p> <p>\u201cJocelyn Lucas,\u201d Draven ponders. \u201cThe Keeper Jocelyn Lucas?\u201d</p><p>Laylen warily nods. \u201cYes, that\u2019s the one. Do you know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow is a strong word... more like I\u2019ve heard of her.\u201d A sinister shadow casts across Draven\u2019s face as he yanks on the chain, jerking the woman\u2019s head onto his lap.</p><p>I swallow hard, wondering just how tricky it\u2019s going to be to get him to give us the information we need. Laylen said it was going to be dangerous and I\u2019m starting to understand why. There\u2019s something in Draven eyes, a darkness that unsettles every bone in my body.</p><p>Laylen shoves aside some poker chips and cards to rest his arms on the table. \u201cSo do you know if she\u2019s still alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do... However...\u201d Draven trails off, looking right at me as he licks his lips and then his fangs point out from his mouth. \u201cThis Jocelyn, I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s very important to you?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>He loops the chain around his wrist, making a spiral up his forearm and the woman is forced to comply with the movement, her head elevating toward his mouth. \u201cTell me, what would you be willing to give up to find out if she is alive or not?\u201d</p> <p>I glance at Laylen for help, but his eyes are fixated on Draven as he slips his fingers around the woman\u2019s leather collar and draws her neck toward his chin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d Laylen drifts off, biting at his lip ring, his blue eyes blackening.</p><p>Draven grins, aiming his fangs out as he sweeps the woman\u2019s hair to the side. \u201cIf you want, Laylen, I\u2019d be more than happy to share.\u201d With a final grin, he deliberately dips his fangs into the woman\u2019s neck.</p><p>She gasps as his fangs enter her skin and then clutches onto Draven\u2019s legs. Draven\u2019s neck muscles work to devour the blood out and her eyes widen before flicking to me. For a second I see life inside her, but it quickly vanishes the longer Draven continues to feed. Blood drizzles down her neckline and the collar of her dress, staining the silky blue fabric a deep red. She moans in pleasure and then whimpers when it\u2019s too much to handle, her eyes dazing off as she arrives at a state of contentment. I wonder what it feels like? What kind of sensations run through the body to make someone look that way?</p><p>Laylen licks his lips and I feel his weight shift, like he\u2019s about to stand up, his fingers burrowing into my wrist. I wrench my hand away from his hold and slam it down on top of his leg, holding him in place.</p><p>He winces and his gaze shoots in my direction. He doesn\u2019t even look like Laylen anymore, only a shadow of him that\u2019s full of hunger.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask Draven, my voice unsteady as I grasp onto Laylen\u2019s leg.</p><p>With blood on his lips, he frees the woman from his teeth and shoves her to the floor. She falls on her knees, her head low, blood rivering down her neck and dress as it pools on the floor. Draven wipes his mouth with his fingertips, licking the blood off each one.</p><p>He unbuttons the top button of his shirt, tugging it down a little, the fabric stained with blood. Then he reaches for a cigar box in the middle of a table next to a stack of poker chips. He lifts the lid off, takes out a cigar, and lights the end, putting it into his mouth and inhaling deeply.</p><p>\u201cI want one very simple thing in exchange for me using my lovely gift to peek in on the Fey of The Underworld.\u201d He takes another drag of the cigar and greyish smoke fills up the room.</p><p>Laylen tears his gaze from the woman bleeding on the floor and focuses on Draven, gripping onto my hand. \u201cAnd what is it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Draven puffs on the cigar several times, remaining silent, then finally he balances it on an ashtray, the smoke still rising off the end. He crosses his arms on the table and cocks his head to the side. \u201cI want you to feed on the girl.\u201d</p><p>Laylen quickly looks at the woman on the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t think she can take anymore feeding without me... killing her.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNot on her.\u201d His attention targets on me. \u201cHer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I cry at the same time Laylen snaps, \u201cNo fucking way.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and it\u2019s deafening echoes ricochet around the room. The woman beside him quivers and falls flat on her stomach, her head resting near Draven\u2019s feet. \u201cThen no deal.\u201d</p><p>Laylen\u2019s livid as he slants forward about to say who knows what, but I interrupt him.</p><p>\u201cHow do we know that you know anything at all?\u201d I ask and feel Laylen go rigid beside me.</p><p>His lips part and I half expect him to shout at me to shut the hell up, but surprisingly he stays quiet.</p><p>Draven\u2019s fingers seek the cigar in the ashtray. \u201cWhen the Lord of the Afterlife makes a deal, the deal is unbreakable. Those are the rules.\u201d He places the butt of the cigar into his mouth and inhales.</p><p>Laylen tips his head to the side, encountering my gaze. There\u2019s an exchange between us, an agreement, like we\u2019re asking each other what to do.</p><p>Laylen leans in toward me, keeping his voice hushed. \u201cIt\u2019s addicting.\u201d</p><p>Breathe in. Breathe out. \u201cI know... if you don\u2019t think you can do it, that\u2019s okay... I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just addicting for me... I\u2019ll always crave no matter what,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cBut it\u2019s also addicting for you, too.\u201d</p><p>My forehead creases. \u201cI\u2019ll become addicted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could and then you would most likely end up at a place just like this.\u201d He gives a fleeting glance to the woman on the floor. \u201cDoing whatever just to feel the sensations the bite brings.\u201d</p><p>Sensations? \u201cBut Aislin got bit and she\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine... but not great.\u201d He contemplates. \u201cBesides, Aislin is a Keeper and a Witch. She\u2019s stronger in the sense of control and what she can\u2019t do of her own freewill, she casts a spell for.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cI can be strong.\u201d My weak voice contradicts my words, though.</p><p>He gives me a heart-wrenching look and then cups my cheek, leveling our gazes. \u201cBut your emotions are so new... I\u2019m worried it might be even harder for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the best way to find out if my mom\u2019s alive?\u201d I ask, refusing to give up so easily.</p><p>He strokes my cheek. \u201cIt is... but we can try to find another way.\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together, deciding, but ultimately, it\u2019s not even a choice. My whole life, I\u2019ve had no one. It\u2019s merely been myself, yet it was only a shell of myself. I want more. I want my mom. I want to know where I came from and feel like someone cares about me. I don\u2019t want to walk around this world feeling so unloved. I also want to understand love.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d I utter. \u201cI want you to bite me.\u201d I actually mean what I say, too. Maybe it\u2019s because of my mom, out of curiosity, or maybe this is just the kind of person that I am\u2014one who welcomes intoxicating, dangerous things.</p><p>Draven claps his hands and Laylen jerks away from me, rotating forward in the chair so he\u2019s facing Draven.</p><p>\u201cVery well played,\u201d he says as he claps his hands again, puffing on the cigar. \u201cGive him the sad eyes and show him your heartache.\u201d He pauses, assessing us as a cloud of smoke envelops his face. \u201cAlthough, I might say that they\u2019re extremely lovely eyes so it\u2019s not quite fair on Laylen\u2019s part. They\u2019re so intoxicating... Violet is such a unique color. You don\u2019t see it that often, except for on Pixies and sometimes Fey.\u201d He ashes the cigar, tapping it on the side of the glass ashtray.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s neither,\u201d Laylen hurries and says. \u201cAnd will you please just get on with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d Draven puts out the cigar in the ashtray, spilling ashes onto the table. \u201cShe\u2019s agreed to let you bite her. The time will come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to bite her,\u201d Laylen makes it clear through gritted teeth. \u201cWhat I want is to be normal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNormal is overrated,\u201d Draven remarks. \u201cNow, please, feed on her. I\u2019m dying to see it.\u201d</p><p>The full reality of what\u2019s about to happen starts to sink in. Laylen\u2019s going to bite me and it\u2019s going to feel... well, as far as I\u2019ve seen good. Yet too good, almost to the point that I might become addicted to the feel of my blood being drunk.</p><p>\u201cTell us about Jocelyn first,\u201d Laylen demands. \u201cOr no deal.\u201d</p><p>Draven shakes his head with a wicked glint in his eye as he traces the triangular symbol on his arm with his finger. \u201cWe\u2019re not in Keeper\u2019s land anymore my dear Laylen. You are nothing except an ordinary Vampire with a very unfortunate mark on your body that brands you good in the world of the bad.\u201d</p> <p>Laylen\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobs up and down as he swallows hard. \u201cFine.\u201d His eyes reluctantly drift to me and, if it were possible, his skin looks even paler. \u201cGemma, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it,\u201d I whisper at the sight of the discomfort in his eyes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to. We can find another way or...\u201d</p><p>I trail off as he shifts his body forward in his seat, bending his back and moving closer to me. My chest heaves ravenously as anticipation and fear collide inside me and I turn inward to bring myself closer to him. He maintains my gaze as he cups the bottom of my neck softly, yet at the same time with purpose. I wonder if he can feel my rapid pulse. If he can smell the scent of my blood in my veins. What he\u2019s thinking. I wonder a lot of things, until he leans in so close I feel the heat of his breath caressing my skin, and then all thoughts are lost as a silence overtakes my body.</p><p>\u201cJust breathe and try to relax,\u201d he whispers, the pupils in his eyes expanding and taking over all of the blue in his eyes. His lips part, his breathing sharpens and his pointed fangs descend.</p><p>My mind tells me that I should be afraid, but my body won\u2019t have any part of it, the prickle on the back of my neck stabs wildly, releasing an abundance of emotions. I lean into his touch, his hand tightens around the bottom of my neck and my knees press into his. I know Draven is watching us, but I block him out and focus on my breathing. Deep breaths. Deep breaths.</p> <p>Laylen\u2019s head slants to the side, so he\u2019s moving in toward my neck at an angle. When he\u2019s only inches away, his tongue slips out and slides across his lips, moistening them and skimming along the tips of his fangs. I feel a tremor in his fingertips as they delve against my skin and I reach forward to grasp onto his legs. I hold my breath as his lips graze my neckline and then squeeze my eyes shut as his fangs pierce my vein.</p><p>It\u2019s far more intense than just the scrape. Blindingly intense. A body-altering intensity. I fall so fast into the dark that I can\u2019t even remember what the light looks like. I hear myself groan, however it barely sounds like me, and an invisible connection seals the inside of my body to him. It guides me forward, forcing my back to arch and I end up pressing my chest against his.</p><p>Laylen\u2019s fingers stab into my neck and I feel the skin bruising, but the pain only enhances the experience. He feeds on my blood, sucking it out of me and putting it inside himself. My hands clamp down on his legs as I whimper, my body going limp as all the energy is drained from me.</p><p>Laylen pauses, the tug from him sucking momentarily ceasing. He groans and I think he\u2019s going to stop, even though my mind is screaming at him to continue. However, then he bites down harder, and suddenly, I\u2019m being laid back toward the table. The edge of it cuts into the center of my back and I cry out as he slides me up and sprawls me down on the table, aligning his body with mine as he sucks on my neck, spilling blood all over my skin and clothes. My hands wind around his back and I stab my nails into his shoulder blades, grasping onto him. I can barely see anything anymore besides the color red. Blood red. I can smell it, taste it. It\u2019s driving me crazy. I need more of something. My body is being starved.</p><p>\u201cLaylen,\u201d I manage to choke out, my head drifting to the side as my legs fall open. His body responds, curving inward and rubbing up against me. His fangs sink deeper, plunging into the arch of my neck. Then suddenly he\u2019s pulling away. I think it\u2019s over as he wipes the blood off his face with his hand and licks it off his lips with his tongue. I don\u2019t want him to be done. I want more\u2014need it. I\u2019m not sure where the sensation is stemming from, what drives it. Regardless, I fasten my legs around his waist and cross my ankles tightly around him.</p><p>He opens his mouth and bends his arms, letting his body softly fall onto me, and his lips crash against my own. I can taste salt and rust along with a thousand different things, most of which I have no idea what they are. I open my mouth, letting his tongue slide into me as I clutch onto him for dear life. His hand glides up my ribcage and resides just below my breast, where he grips forcefully. It feels so right, yet through the fog in my head, a voice whispers at me to stop; that this is wrong and Laylen isn\u2019t who I\u2019m supposed to be with. Although, I can\u2019t remember the name of the person I belong to.</p> <p>Laylen moves his mouth away from mine, and starts trailing kisses down my neck, licking off the blood while his teeth graze my skin, barely breaking it as I feel gentle stings.</p><p>I let him, too. I\u2019d let him do anything to me at the moment. He owns my body and mind as well as my fractured soul. As he sinks his teeth into my neck again and starts to drain me of my blood, I eagerly allow him to suck my blood until I can\u2019t feel my body anymore and I fall into the dark.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>I feel so cold, like icicles have bronzed my bones, chilled my heart and frozen the veins running beneath my frosted skin. Unbelievably cold.</p><p>Am I dead?</p><p>My eyes flutter open. The first thing I notice is that the air smells less smoky. Then I notice the grey sky. I gradually sit up, the skin on my upper arm\u2019s blazing like it\u2019s on fire. I press my hand to the area as I take in the sight of my surroundings. Miles and miles of muddy land, stretching toward the grey horizon and buried beneath piles of metal objects. Some are small, some large, some with a basic structure while some are so complex it takes a few blinks of my eyes to get them into focus. Some are embedded with jewels, others dull and faded. It\u2019s like a junkyard for the collector of strange objects, but where and what is this place?</p><p>I unsteadily get to my feet and immediately reach for my neck, shocked when I find that there\u2019s no blood on me, no wounds, as if Laylen hasn\u2019t bitten me.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d I call out, making my way around a massive steel box with the lid crushed in. \u201cIs anyone here?\u201d</p> <p>Ravens flock from the heaps of misshapen metal and flee into the dusky sky, sending black feathers to the ground. I begin to walk, weaving around objects and dirt piles, hoping to find some sort of explanation of how I got here and where here is. The walk seems endless, though, and finally I sit down in the dirt.</p><p>As my skin ignites, I remove my hand from it and peek underneath it. My heart stops at the sight of a triangular symbol on my upper arm, black overlapping red. The same mark I had seen on Draven. Shit.</p><p>Panic soars inside me and something painfully alters in my heart. I feel different\u2014powerful\u2014like I can do anything. The power is stemming from the symbol on my arm. I slowly rise to my feet, ready to do whatever it takes to get out of here and knowing I mean it, even if I have to take another life.</p><p>There are so many terrible things flashing through my head right now that they practically swallow up my identity with a blanket of needles.</p><p>\u201cGemma...\u201d Someone whispers behind me.</p><p>I turn around, glancing at the land behind me. I search for what seems like forever, feathers raining down on my head. When I give up and turn around something smacks me upside the head.</p><p>My ears ring and my skull feels like it cracks as I drift into the ground, into darkness.</p><p>When I open my eyes, it takes my brain a second to process where I am. There\u2019s too much confusion. One minute I\u2019m being fed on, then I\u2019m in some weird junkyard, and the next thing I know I\u2019m lying on warm asphalt, with a very dim lamppost shining down on me as I gaze up at the stars.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Laylen\u2019s voice sedates me.</p><p>I turn my head to the side and find him kneeling next to me, the top of his shirt covered in blood, his eyes like shadows. I feel strangely calm, all things considering, and I have a suspicion Laylen has put the emotion into me.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d I croak, my fingers drifting to the area on my neck that\u2019s coated with a warm, sticky substance. I turn my shoulder inward and glance at the place where the symbol was on my skin, but it\u2019s gone.</p><p>It was just a dream. A nightmare. Thank God.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just outside of Adessa\u2019s, in the parking lot.\u201d Concern and guilt mask his face. \u201cYou blacked out.\u201d</p><p>I gradually sit up. \u201cOwe.\u201d I wince, clutching onto my tender muscles.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Laylen says, his voice soothing as he traces his fingertips up and down my spine. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt for a little bit.\u201d</p><p>I bring my hand away from my neck and hold it up in front of my face. My fingers are drenched in blood. \u201cWhat else am I going to feel?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d He struggles for words as his hand rests on the small of my back. \u201cGemma, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I slope my chin up to meet his eyes, then reach up and brush his hair away from his forehead. I move robotically, as if I\u2019m supposed to be doing what I\u2019m doing, not of my own accord, but because my body needs to touch him. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. I\u2019m the one who said to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t have to do it,\u201d he says and then shuts his eyes as I place a hand on his cheek and run my thumb along his jawline. \u201cPart of me wanted to do it,\u201d he admits, opening his eyes. \u201cPart of me has wanted to... to bite you ever since you reentered my life.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m uncertain how to take his revelation, whether I should be frightened or feel flattered. Honestly, I feel neither. I feel drained dry, subdued and emotionally empty. \u201cWhat happened exactly? I just blacked out?\u201d</p><p>He nods, smoothing his hand down my back. \u201cIt happens sometimes... from the loss of blood and emotional overload.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Draven tell you anything about my mother?\u201d I ask, praying to God that all of this didn\u2019t happen without a reason.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he... he told me... he said that she\u2019s still there, in The Underworld, fully alive.\u201d He looks like he\u2019s unsure whether he should be happy or not</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I should be happy or not, either. Yes, she\u2019s alive, but she\u2019s also been down there for a very long time. I think of the dream, although now I\u2019m starting to wonder if it was a vision I somehow entered without a crystal ball, something I\u2019ve been wondering if I can do for a while. \u201cSo she\u2019s still alive?\u201d</p><p>He nods, but then quickly adds, \u201cBut Gemma, Draven could see if she was still there, but what he couldn\u2019t tell me is what condition she\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCondition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether she\u2019s continued to be sane or if she\u2019s lost her sanity to the torture,\u201d he tells me uneasily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mouth forms an \u2018o\u2019. \u201cSo she might be crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might,\u201d he says. \u201cBut she might not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what would be worse,\u201d I mumble. \u201cFinding out she\u2019s dead or knowing she\u2019s been down they\u2019re all along, yet she\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>He sits back on his heels as he rubs his hand across the top of my head, like I\u2019m his pet or something. Emotions begin to surface inside my body again, the faint stab of the prickle is evident, but it\u2019s not completely clear how I actually feel about any of this; if maybe it\u2019s simply an illusion built on a massive abundance of stimulation I\u2019ve been feeling.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to take it easy,\u201d he tells me, helping me to my feet. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost a lot of blood.\u201d</p><p>I slowly nod my head, mesmerized by the sound of his voice. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He ducks his head to look me square in the eyes. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I clutch onto his arms when the world suddenly sways. \u201cI\u2019m just a little lightheaded and tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll wear off for the most part,\u201d he states quietly. \u201cMost of the lightheadedness and exhaustion will anyway, but a few things will stay.\u201d</p> <p>I understand way too well what he means because the other things are lingering inside my body right now, causing me to gravitate toward him. If I weren\u2019t so tired, I\u2019d probably be begging him to bite me again. \u201cNow what do we do?\u201d</p><p>He slips his hand underneath my arm and supports my weight, leaning me against his chest. \u201cNow we try to figure out how to get into The Underworld to save your mom.\u201d</p><p>I grasp onto him to keep from crumpling to the ground and we begin to make our way toward Adessa\u2019s building. \u201cAnd how are we supposed to do that? Go visit another Vampire with a unique gift?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He seals his lips together as he guides me around a parked car. \u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly how to find that one out, but I think I might know someone who does.\u201d</p><p>My shoes scuff against the gravel as I fight to keep them moving \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>We stop at the bottom of the building and he glances up at the window we jumped out of earlier. \u201cAlex,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I freeze and glance up at him. \u201cYou think Alex knows how? Why? I mean, wouldn\u2019t he have said something...\u201d I trail off, realizing that what I\u2019ve just said is probably one of the stupidest things to leave my mouth. \u201cNever mind.\u201d I pause. \u201cSo what? We just ask him and hope he tells us the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you could probably get him to.\u201d Laylen\u2019s mouth turns downward. \u201cIf you play the situation right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, Alex cares for you, and if you ask him in the right way, he might let it slip out if he knows anything.\u201d</p><p>I let out a sharp laugh and it echoes around the abandoned parking lot. \u201cI think you\u2019re a little mistaken about how much Alex really likes me. In fact, sometimes I think he hates me, yet he feels obligated to be around me, to protect me.\u201d Because of the electricity, but I keep that reason to myself since no one really knows about it.</p><p>Laylen looks at me disbelievingly. \u201cDo you really believe what you just said?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, resting my head against his shoulder as my eyelids grow heavy. I want him to wrap his arm around me and hug me so I don\u2019t feel so distorted inside. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe when it comes to Alex. He\u2019s confused me from day one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s because you\u2019re equally as confusing.\u201d As Alex\u2019s unemotional voice floats over my shoulder, every ounce of my oxygen dissipates.</p> <p>I hyperventilate as I glance up at Laylen. He doesn\u2019t look worried or upset or afraid. As a matter of fact, his face doesn\u2019t register anything and it\u2019s an eerie sight to behold.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I honestly shouldn\u2019t be surprised,\u201d Alex says, and I hear him walk up behind us. \u201cI saw it in both of your eyes the moment you saw each other; you obviously have some sort of connection.\u201d Jealousy drips into his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Laylen calls over his shoulder. \u201cYou and I both know it\u2019s inevitable. I will always screw you over, Alex.\u201d</p><p>What are you doing? I mouth to Laylen.</p><p>Laylen shrugs. \u201cAsk Alex. Ever since the day I turned, I\u2019m nothing except an evil monster.\u201d He starts to turn us around with his hand on my back. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve never actually done anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Vampire.\u201d He\u2019s right behind us, standing so close that I can feel the heat emitting from his body. That\u2019s it, though. Just heat, no sparks or overwhelming electricity magnetizing me toward him. Wait. What happened? Where\u2019s the electricity?</p><p>I plant my feet firmly to the ground to avoid turning around to face him, however Laylen has all the control at the moment and makes us turn around.</p><p>All I can do is tilt my head to the side, cover my neck with my hand, and hope that it\u2019s dark enough that Alex can\u2019t see the blood.</p><p>We face him below the stars and the crescent moon while Laylen has his arm around me. I feel out of touch with reality, unlike myself, as though I\u2019m standing in a delusional world.</p><p>Alex\u2019s attention immediately darts to my neck. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with your neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a kink in it,\u201d I say stupidly, but I\u2019m exhausted and can\u2019t come up with anything better. \u201cA really bad kink.\u201d</p><p>From beside me, Laylen shakes his head and Alex\u2019s expression hardens. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\" He reaches forward and, before I can react, he pries my fingers away from my neck.</p><p>At first he simply stands there, holding onto my hand, staring blankly at the wounds on my neck, two holes covered with dry blood. Blood is also smeared all over my chest area along with the scratches from where Laylen dragged his teeth. I can feel his pulse hammering through his fingers or maybe it\u2019s my own. Usually I can feel us together, always in tune, but I feel detached. Numb. Connected to another and so very damn perplexed.</p><p>Alex\u2019s eyes lift to Laylen. \u201cWhat the hell did you do to her?\u201d He steps forward, his grip constricting on my hand and cutting off the circulation.</p><p>\u201cWhat you always thought I was going to do,\u201d Laylen says evenly and, if I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d guess he was doing it on purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s what you\u2019ve been waiting around for.\u201d He inches closer to Alex while still holding onto my back and forcing me to move forward with him.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight I was,\u201d Alex growls and I slouch back. \u201cI always knew what you really were. A killer.\u201d</p><p>Laylen stiffens and his fingers press into my back, digging into my skin as if he\u2019s centering all his anger to that one spot. They stand tall, breathing profusely, glaring at each other. I\u2019m stuck in the middle and I know this is going to end badly if I don\u2019t do something to stop it. I decide to take charge, even though I\u2019m not sure who I\u2019m saving.</p><p>Slipping out from underneath Laylen\u2019s arm, I shuffle forward and position myself between them. I place a hand on each of their chests, the touch not fazing either of them, and then I shove them back. They barely budge, but it\u2019s enough to divert their attention to me.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I made Laylen bite me,\u201d I tell Alex, steadily holding his gaze even though it\u2019s terrifying to do so. Not just because of his anger, but because, without the electricity, I feel strangely out of my element, like I\u2019m stuck in a temporary state of vertigo.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t make me,\u201d Laylen intervenes, putting weight on my hand as he leans in.</p><p>I shoot a glare at him. \u201cBut I told you to.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes, yet keeps his lips fastened. I return my focus to Alex who looks utterly confused.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll just go inside with me,\u201d I say to him. \u201cWe can sit down and I\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d</p><p>I expect him to argue, let his rage rain down over me, however rather than do so, he shakes his head, steps back, and says, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Confused, I nod, lowering my hands from their chests. \u201cOkay then.\u201d Maybe Laylen was right. Maybe I do have more influence over him than I thought.</p><p>We head inside, Laylen on my right side and Alex on my left, with thoughts of both of them floating around in my head and, honestly, at the moment I couldn\u2019t say who I have feelings for anymore.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>I should never assume things. This is the lesson I learn the moment we step foot into Adessa\u2019s living room. It\u2019s a beautiful room that has shelves built into the walls with the black and white tile on the floor that goes well with the velvet couches. There are little knickknacks sporadically placed all over the shelves, the apothecary table is decorated with candles, and the chandelier above my head glistens. I\u2019m taking it all in when Alex turns to me and takes me all in; the blood drenching my torn shirt, the open bite marks on my neck, and the scratches on my chest. Jesus. They go all the way from the hollow of my neck to the curves of my breast. It looked less severe in the darkness, however, in the light, I look like a train wreck.</p><p>His eyes widen, his chest puffing in and out as he shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d A million different emotions flash across his expression, and for a second, I feel the tingle of the sparks reemerge. Yet, as quickly as they appear, they vanish as Alex rushes forward.</p><p>I skitter to the side as he dives into Laylen. Laylen stumbles back as Alex slams his head into his chest and both fly across the room and ram into the wall. The sheetrock cracks against the force and splits from the floor to the ceiling.</p><p>Laylen quickly regains his footing, standing up straight, and he shoves Alex. Alex recovers swiftly, his boots squeaking against the tile as he stomps toward Laylen, whose appearance I\u2019m sure is making the situation even worse. His hair is damp with sweat and a little bit of blood, his shirt soaked in it. His skin is stunningly more smooth and healthy looking than before, his lips an even deeper red, probably from my blood. His eyes are blue again, but a deeper blue, like the ocean instead of the sky.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you fucking bit her!\u201d Alex shouts as he heads for Laylen who refuses to back away. \u201cOf all people, her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you that I told him to do it!\u201d I cry, moving forward, but I gasp and step back as Laylen rams his head into Alex\u2019s chest, wrapping his arms around him, and making them fly backward onto the apothecary table. It instantly buckles beneath their weight and they roll around on the floor; a violent ball of punches, kicks, curses and bruises as they crash into the shelves and the sofas.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I demand, leaping out of the way as they roll to my feet. \u201cThis is ridiculous! You guys are acting like lunatics.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Aislin and Adessa appear in the doorway, looking sleepy-eyed and kind of annoyed. Adessa has on a long, navy blue robe and Aislin is wearing a pink plaid pajama set.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world is going on?\u201d Aislin cries, her bright green eyes extensive as she takes in the broken furniture, shattered figurines and cracked walls. Then she glances up at me and the color drains from her face. \u201cWhat on earth?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUm...I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubsisto,\u201d Adessa screams with her hands out in front of her. Sparks shower from her fingertips and soar across the room toward Alex and Laylen.</p><p>They fly away from each other, Alex landing by Aislin\u2019s bare feet and Laylen beside mine. He smacks his head on the floor and I peer down at him as he blinks up at me. There\u2019s a moment that passes between us, a need that wants to be fed, but there\u2019s still a part of me that rebels against the urge. I won\u2019t let it happen right now; not in front of an audience.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you two doing?\u201d Aislin asks as Alex stands up, dusting wood chips and glass out of his hair. He\u2019s dressed in the same t-shirt and jeans as when I saw him last, only now the jeans are torn at the knee.</p> <p>Alex wipes his bleeding lip with his arm and then shakes his head. \u201cHe fucking bit her.\u201d His voice trembles and he lacks his usual composure, alarmingly so.</p><p>Laylen gets up, brushing his hair out of his eyes, and Alex instantly moves toward him like he can\u2019t control himself.</p><p>Aislin grabs the back of Alex\u2019s shirt and holds him back. \u201cLaylen bit Gemma?\u201d</p><p>He motions his hand at us. \u201cObviously. Look at her... And him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. I thought another Vampire did that.\u201d However she lacks the confidence to be believable, as if she\u2019s in denial.</p> <p>I could try to lie, but everyone in the room knows what happened. It\u2019s written all over the both of us in blood and the euphoric state in our eyes.</p><p>\u201cLaylen,\u201d Aislin whispers, tucking strands of her golden brown hair behind her ears. \u201cIs it... is it true? Did you bite her?\u201d</p><p>Laylen looks away to the wall and I become hyperaware of how much of a mess we\u2019re really in. Not only is Alex pissed off because I\u2019ve been bit, but Aislin looks as if her heart has been crushed.</p><p>Aislin releases Alex\u2019s shirt and steps back with her chin tipped toward the floor. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Laylen drags his fingers through his hair and then, staring down at the floor, hurries out of the room. Aislin chases after Laylen, or maybe just runs off in the same direction, about to burst into tears. Adessa takes one look at Alex and me, then turns around and walks out of the room.</p><p>Smart woman. I envy her at the moment.</p> <p>I\u2019m highly aware that Alex is right behind me, standing only inches away from me. The sparks rise and then diminish as if they\u2019re trying to breathe again yet can\u2019t quite get enough air. I wonder what caused the sensation to fade; what\u2019s the reason it\u2019s barely there when they\u2019ve been so strong before?</p><p>Finally, I turn around and face Alex. He\u2019s already watching me, his hands in his pockets, and he looks strangely uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he finally says, then he waits, for what I\u2019m not sure. An explanation. For me to deny it. For me to say I\u2019m sorry and that I hated it. None of those would fit, though, because all of them would be a lie.</p><p>I sink down on the remaining upturned sofa, my legs unable to bear my weight. \u201cI needed to find out if my mother was still alive and if she was in The Underworld.\u201d</p><p>With a pucker at his brow he sits down on the other end of the sofa as far away from me as he can get. \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and shrug. \u201cSome place where Vampires feed on willing humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who bit you?\u201d he asks through gritted teeth.</p><p>I\u2019m not even sure why he\u2019s asking. \u201cI think you know who it is already, since you just tried to kick his ass.\u201d</p> <p>His muscles spasm as he works to stay calm, finally getting up and pacing in front of me. \u201cI know, but I needed to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe only did it because I told him to,\u201d I say quietly, scraping some of the dried blood off my arm with my fingernails. \u201cIt was the only way Draven would tell us about my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraven\u201d he says tightly, stopping in front of me. \u201cThat\u2019s who you went to see?\u201d</p><p>I nod once. \u201cI guess he can see stuff in different realms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d His voice is clipped as he drops back down onto the sofa, leaning against the armrest. \u201cBut what I don\u2019t get is why you two would act so stupidly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t stupid,\u201d I retort, my head snapping in his direction. \u201cI was just trying to find out about my mom... and she could help us, you know. She could know things, since your father put her there for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what,\u201d he snaps, scooting closer to me. \u201cFind another way, then. Don\u2019t go to some sketchy Vampire and Lord of the Afterlife to get your answers. Jesus, do you know how dangerous that is, especially if he figured out who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what if he does,\u201d I say. \u201cHe gave me the answer I wanted. She\u2019s alive, Alex. My mom\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter at the moment,\u201d he says and fury storms through my body. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure what the star\u2019s power is for, and until we do, we need to be careful. The more people who know about you, the easier it\u2019ll be for my father and the Death Walkers to find you. Not to mention people like Draven would love to get ahold of the power you have in you.\u201d He reaches to take my hands, but then spots the blood on my fingers and pulls away. \u201cDo you know what people would do to get ahold of that kind of power? What they would do to you?\u201d</p><p>I tap my finger against my chin, bitterness seeping into my voice. \u201cHmm... I bet I can guess. How about break my soul, my heart, my memories\u2014my whole freaking life\u2014and also ruin everyone whoever mattered to me.\u201d</p><p>His lips part in shock. \u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d he trails off, shaking his head.</p><p>I push to my feet. \u201cBesides, that\u2019s not even what you\u2019re mad about. You\u2019re pissed off because Laylen drank my blood and now I\u2019m going to be addicted to getting my blood drunk.\u201d I back toward the door, shaking with rage, but I\u2019m not quite sure where it stems from. \u201cWell, you know what. It was worth it because I know my mom\u2019s still alive and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d</p><p>He rises from the couch, and I turn to run. I think about running out the front door, running away from this mess\u2014my feelings\u2014because there\u2019s too many of them inside me. I feel so much right now, I swear I\u2019m going to explode.</p><p>The problem is that my emotions are strongly linked to people in this house and it makes running away impossible, so I do the only thing that I can. I race upstairs, lock myself in my room, and cry as confusion takes over my heart.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Alex takes my hands in his. \u201cTell me you want me.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re standing in front of the lake, the moon reflecting in the dark, still water. The chilled wind smells mossy and the water softly lulls. \u201cTell me I\u2019m the only one you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what love is,\u201d I reply, staring out at the water.</p><p>He frees one of my hands, fixes a finger under my chin, and angles my face toward him. \u201cTell me you love me, please,\u201d he begs.</p><p>I open my mouth to speak, but then someone walks up behind me and I turn around, briefly breaking Alex and mine\u2019s connection.</p><p>Laylen hikes up the shore toward us, bare foot and shirtless. \u201cGemma, I need you,\u201d he says as he reaches us. \u201cPlease, come with me.\u201d</p><p>He holds out his hand and I want to take it, but I also don\u2019t want to let go of Alex\u2019s hand. With my free hand I reach for him, but Alex tightens his hold on my other hand and pulls me away</p><p>\u201cNo, please don\u2019t,\u201d he pleads. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>I glance back and forth between them as Laylen slips his fingers through mine. I hold onto both of them, knowing I\u2019m going to have to choose, knowing that I can\u2019t have both\u2014that I don\u2019t have the right to.</p><p>I stay in my room for two days. I don\u2019t shower. I barely move, only getting out of bed to stare out the window and watch the city move through the time. Adessa brings me food, which I barely eat. Other than that, no one else comes to see me, although I sense both Alex and Laylen walk by a few times. The strange connection I have with them thrives the second they get close, but neither ever enters. It\u2019s like I\u2019m back to the old Gemma, the lonely, isolated one, and for the moment it\u2019s what I need because I don\u2019t know how to deal with everything inside me.</p><p>I watch the sun rise and set. The more time goes by, the calmer I get and I wonder if I should just stay in bed forever. Eventually, though, I start to stink and the grossness of the dried blood coating my clothes and skin gets to me.</p><p>As the sun descends behind the hills, marking the second day to pass since Laylen bit me, I climb out of bed. The lights of Vegas vibrantly sparkle through the window, lighting up the room, but it\u2019s still dark enough that it\u2019s hard to see so I flip the light on. I take a thin-strapped, black shirt from the dresser along with a cream and black striped skirt, and then I make my way out into the quiet hallway.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure which door belongs to the bathroom, but I luck out and it\u2019s the first one I open. I peel off my clothes, wincing at my stiff muscles, then turn on the water. As I wait for it to heat up, I look at my reflection.</p><p>My violet eyes are bloodshot and, even though the holes in my neck have began to heal, there\u2019s dried blood all over it. My shirt is torn, exposing more of my breast than I\u2019m comfortable with and my brown hair is tangled around my face. The only thing that is somewhat comforting is that the scratches on my neck, from where Laylen\u2019s fangs scrapped me, are almost invisible. Still, I look hideous. It\u2019s a simple as that.</p><p>I climb into the shower and scrub the blood off my body with a loofa. I scrub so hard my skin hurts. I scrub and scrub, the water beneath my feet tinting red as it whirls down the drain. I want to scrub everything off my body, including how I feel. Because, through my erratic, perplexed, emotions, I feel dirty and wrong and I want to feel right again, or as right as I\u2019ve ever felt anyway. What I want is to feel the void inside my body shrinking. I want someone to comfort me, hold me, and hug me. God, when did I get so needy? I never needed anyone before, although I also never felt so bruised and emotionally torn up, either.</p><p>Hot tears spill out of my eyes as I rinse my face off and then sink down into the tub. I hug my legs against my chest, letting the showerhead pour water on me, wishing it had the power to erase my misery\u2014erase me.</p><p>I sob into my knees, my body shaking and shivering as I try to sift through the last couple of days. I let Laylen bite me merely so I could get something I wanted. I hurt Laylen and Aislin and pissed off Alex by doing it. Am I that bad of a person? Completely greedy and selfish. Who am I? I don\u2019t know.</p><p>My head suddenly shoots up when I hear the bathroom door open. I tense as a shadow forms on the other side of the shower curtain.</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d Alex says.</p><p>I try to shut off my tears, but tears never want to seem to turn off when you want them to, so instead I work to maintain a balanced voice. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He hesitates and I can see his shadow moving, his hand rising in front of him. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My lips quiver. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He pauses. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>I let out an exhale, glad he can\u2019t see me, see what I mess I am. I allow the tears to fall freely as his shadow shrinks as he moves away. However, then the entire bathtub suddenly darkens, his shadow expanding over me when he draws back the curtain.</p><p>He grips onto the edge of the curtain, staring down at me naked in the tub, hugging my knees. There are droplets of water on my face and tears pooling in my eyes and my hair drips in tangles down my back.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look okay,\u201d he says, keeping his eyes on mine. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in your room for over two days. Aislin said you probably needed space\u2014that it would take a few days for the...\u201d He shuts his eyes, gathering himself before opening them. \u201cFor the sensations of the bite to wear off. That\u2019s how it was for her.\u201d His gaze sweeps over my face. \u201cBut now I\u2019m wondering if she was wrong.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to respond. I did need time; I chose to stay in the room, but while isolation might have been a good thing for Aislin, I don\u2019t think it was that great for me. I\u2019ve had too much of it during my life.</p><p>I want to tell him this, but when I open my lips all that comes out is a quiet sob. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I\u2019m not even sure what I\u2019m sorry for, but it feels like it needs to be said so I go with it.</p> <p>\u201cGemma...\u201d He reaches for the faucet and shuts the water off. Then he leans back and slips his hands into mine, helping me to my feet. I bite my lip as I stand naked in the bathtub before him, feeling self-conscious. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry.\u201d He tucks strands of my wet hair behind my ear. \u201cI get why you did it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a little shocked. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>He nods, smoothing my hair out of my eyes. \u201cI just wish you would have found a different way\u2014an easier way. Yet, I understand how it feels... to want to see your mom again.\u201d</p><p>The way he says it, makes me wonder. \u201cDo you not know your mom?\u201d</p><p>He presses his lips together, releases me, and then takes a step toward the towel rack. \u201cMy mom disappeared when I was younger.\u201d He grabs a towel off the rack and turns back to me</p><p>I can suddenly feel it; the sparks and the elated electricity reuniting wholly with my body. It\u2019s wonderful and heartbreaking, welcome and, yet, unwanted. \u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d</p> <p>He grips the towel in his hand. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d He lets the towel fall open. \u201cHow about we talk about what we\u2019re going to do about your mom?\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arms around my body as the cold air gets to my dewed skin. \u201cWhy? Are you going to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLift your arms up,\u201d he instructs and I hesitantly obey. \u201cI was thinking about it, but only if we do it smartly.\u201d He wraps the towel around my back and then drags it across my sides, wiping away the water.</p><p>\u201cWhy, though?\u201d I wonder, fighting my eyes to stay open as he moves the towel along my ribs, my hips, my stomach, and back, drying off my body. \u201cWhy would you all of a sudden help me? You\u2019re acting very strange right now. Too nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been helping you, Gemma. It just might not always seem like it, especially when your emotions get in the way.\u201d He pulls on the towel, moving to the front of me, and begins to wipe off my neck. \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to be nice because you deserve nice.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard as his hand holding the towel wanders toward my breast. \u201cYour emotions get in the way sometimes, too. You can be so hot and cold.\u201d</p><p>He stares at my chest as he begins to dry it off. My nipples harden and a gasp escapes my lips, even though I fight it. \u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d he says softly, moving his gaze and hands away from my chest. He wraps the towel around my body and secures it in a knot at the top. Then he moves back and holds his hand out. \u201cIt\u2019s how I\u2019ve been taught to be... detached.\u201d He stops as I set my hand in his then he helps me out of the tub. \u201cI can\u2019t help it and I don\u2019t want to help it. Besides, I\u2019m beginning to believe that everything I was taught is bullshit.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s being so cooperative and the surprising thing is that he seems genuinely nice at the moment. \u201cI want to believe you,\u201d I say. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to after everything that\u2019s happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says simply and then he winks at me even though he looks sad. \u201cGive me time, though, and I\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re always arguing, though,\u201d I point out.</p><p>He winks again and this time a smile shows through. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend like you don\u2019t like it\u2014that it doesn\u2019t get you all turned on.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything because he\u2019s partially right. We stare at each other for a moment and I can hear us both breathing erratically. Taking a step forward, he carefully backs me into the sink and sweeps a lock of my hair away from my face. When his gaze meets mine, my body nearly melts as electricity spirals through it. I decide that, despite whatever I said, I did miss it. A lot.</p><p>He leans in toward me, tracing my jawline with his fingers. \u201cYou bring it out of me, you know. Before you, I could completely control everything I feel, but you... you drive me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drive me crazy, too,\u201d I agree, my voice a lot less steady than his. \u201cYou make me so frustrated... and I don\u2019t know if I should, or if I even can, trust you.\u201d</p><p>I wait for him to get angry, but he seems to be very distracted by my neck, his gaze is glued to it as he sketches his finger back and forth across the healing teeth marks.</p><p>\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d he asks, pressing down on the marks.</p><p>I wince, but only because the contact of his skin makes my body flame hot. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glide up to mine. \u201cDid it feel... good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d I ask and he nods. My breath falters. \u201cIt felt good, bad, and... confusing.\u201d</p><p>His hands glide up the front of my neck, his skin agonizingly hot as it stops at the top. \u201cDid you do anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I don\u2019t want to tell you.\u201d</p><p>He pauses and I feel his hand tremor. \u201cI need to know. It\u2019ll drive me crazy if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cWe kissed.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightens on my neck, not enough to choke me, but enough that it\u2019s intense. \u201cJust kiss?\u201d he asks and I nod.</p><p>He loosens his grip slightly, pressing his thumb against my pulse. \u201cDoes this feel good?\u201d he asks in a husky voice. \u201cWhen I touch you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as hot tingles coil up my legs. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>His other hand touches my knee and then slips up the front of my towel, his fingers delving into my upper thigh. \u201cHow about this?\u201d</p><p>Unbearable heat spreads up my leg and causes me to tremble irrepressibly. \u201cMaybe...\u201d I fight to tell him the truth; that he gets to me in ways I can barely grasp. That no matter what happens, if he wants me, then he\u2019ll eventually get me because battling my emotions and the sparks will break me down in the long run.</p><p>I unintentionally gasp as his breath catches, and then his hand inches higher. I lean back against the mirror. \u201cAlex... what are you ....\u201d</p><p>I drift off as his fingers touch between my legs without slipping into me, merely resting just outside. I bite down on my lip as every single one of my nerve endings blaze with fiery heat and every thought inside my head dissipates</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take this anymore,\u201d he says in a breathy whisper as he leans in closer, his eyes glossed over. \u201cI want to be angry with you, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about how I need to make you mine again and how I really don\u2019t deserve you for everything I\u2019ve done to you\u2014all the lies I\u2019ve told.\u201d His lips hover above my mouth as his chest lines up with mine, burning me with ecstasy and driving me crazy. I grip onto the countertops, struggling to cling onto reality.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think I feel?\u201d I groan. Hold on, Gemma. Don\u2019t let go. You need a clear head... clear... \u201cI never know what you\u2019re thinking... what you want... what\u2019s the truth... what\u2019s right and what\u2019s...\u201d I drift off as his fingers slip inside me. My body bows into him and the towel slips loose before falling to my waist, my bare chest pressing against him.</p><p>His fingers start to gently move inside me. \u201cJust trust me okay?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head because I don\u2019t entirely trust him or myself and what I\u2019m feeling, but I don\u2019t argue because I can\u2019t. I want him to keep doing what he\u2019s doing, feeling me, touching me, diminishing the void inside me. Giving me the human connection that I crave.</p><p>His fingers keep working as I struggle to breathe. I clutch so tightly onto the counter that the edge stabs into my palms. Finally I let go and grab onto his shoulders at the same time his hands slide around my back. He pushes on it, forcing me to move closer to him.</p><p>My body arches into him so he can touch me even more, even though he\u2019s already touching me all over. It feels like there\u2019s something missing in the midst of it all. Another connection I\u2019m being deprived of. Then his lips come down on mine and I understand. I needed him to kiss me in order to breathe, function, and be whole again. The entire time the electricity was gone I felt so out of whack, so incomplete, and incredibly wrong. I need Alex, however the question is, do I need him because I want him or is it because of the electricity and whatever\u2019s causing it?</p><p>I shove the thought out of my head as his fingers push me into blissfulness. As I scream out, he trails kisses down my jawline, my neck, and my breast; sucking hard on my nipple before returning his mouth to mine. He kisses me fiercely. Forcefully. Until my lips are going to bruise. My body and mind unwind and for a moment everything seems perfect. Complete. Whole.</p><p>Then I start to regain my composure, however, I don\u2019t want to just yet. I want to lose control, drift away, feel every emotion amplify and leave.</p><p>I reach for the bottom of Alex\u2019s shirt as I pull back my lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks blinking, his lips swollen as he slips his fingers out of me.</p><p>I don\u2019t say a word as I start to tug his shirt over his head.</p><p>He opens his mouth to argue, but then clamps his jaw shut, deciding against it before he then rips his shirt over his head. My hands glide up the front of his lean muscles, trace the lines of the golden flames trimming a ring, the Mark of the Keepers branding the side of his ribcage. He crashes his lips into mine and steals the breath out of me. I writhe my body against him as I slide my hand to the top of his pounding heart. The feeling of it hitting my palm fuels me with desire and I reach for the button off his jeans. He jerks his lips away and the lack of control in his eyes is undeniable. Like the first time we had sex when he lost control of what he was doing. I\u2019m losing control, too, and I don\u2019t give a shit. I want, no, need him to be inside me now, and I don\u2019t even completely understand why. It\u2019s like I\u2019m drowning in emptiness and being with him is the only way to save me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I undo his button and slowly unzip his jeans. He moans, a deep, husky utterance of desire. There\u2019s a pause where our eyes collide and we pant, deciding what we should do next. So much has gone on and in the end I know I\u2019ll end up as confused as when this all began. Somehow, I can\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>I want this.</p><p>Him.</p><p>He must think the same thing because suddenly he\u2019s kicking off his jeans along with his boxers. He rips the towel from my body and his hands slide up my legs, spreading me open. I bite down on my lip, waiting in anticipation for him to thrust inside me. Instead of sliding into me, though, he dips his face down toward my open legs. I gasp as his tongue slides inside me, my body curving upward of it\u2019s own accord.</p> <p>\u201cAlex...\u201d I grasp handfuls of his hair, unsure what to do or where I should channel this vulnerable, helpless energy to as his tongue slips inside me, filling me like his fingers did earlier. It\u2019s almost too much, my emotions are out of my power. I writhe against his tongue, fighting to breathe and function as I\u2019m pushed over the edge. I scream so loud I\u2019m sure the whole house can hear it.</p><p>As I catch my breath, his tongue leaves me and seconds later his lips crash against mine. I barely have time to regain my breathing as our tongues twine together, our bodies welding and becoming almost one as he thrusts deep inside me. It doesn\u2019t hurt as bad as the first time, but I\u2019m still tender. I jab my nails into his back as I hold onto him, splitting the skin open on his back, clawing into reality. Our bodies dampen with sweat as they move rhythmically together and our breaths grow ragged.</p><p>I don\u2019t have any control over what I\u2019m doing or feeling. All I can do is hold onto him and, even though I\u2019m not sure I want to, trust him not to break me.</p><p>His lips leave mine as he licks and bites a path down my neck, to my collarbone as his hand grips my breast. He grazes his finger over my nipple and so much heat coils through my body that I can\u2019t even think straight.</p><p>With one final thrust, my body and mind spiral out-of-control and I grab onto him as euphoria takes me over. I let my head fall back and it slams against the mirror. I think I hear the glass shatter, though I\u2019m too far gone to care.</p> <p>Moments later, Alex buries his face into the crook of my neck, his body tensing. Once he relaxes, he places kiss after kiss onto my skin, sucking on it, making a path to my mouth.</p><p>With one last kiss, he slips out of me. His hands grip my waist as he guides me off the countertop, then he stares over my shoulder. I follow his gaze, turning my head, only to find that I did shatter the mirror. Glass is everywhere, behind me, in the sink, on the counter.</p><p>I turn my head back to look at him, opening my mouth to say something, but I can\u2019t find anything to say.</p><p>He combs his fingers through my hair, tugging my head back a little, and forcing me to look at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for that to happen,\u201d he says. \u201cI just...\u201d he trails off. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to deal with how I feel around you. You simultaneously piss me off, turn me on and frustrate me. No one\u2019s every done that to me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut then again, I\u2019ve only been able to feel those things for a few months so...\u201d I frown, unsure how I feel anymore, whether I want to be driven by a grudge or let it go.</p><p>His green eyes fill with something I can\u2019t quite place while his fingers linger in my hair. \u201cI don\u2019t want you running off to Laylen for help,\u201d he says. \u201cI want you to come to me.\u201d</p> <p>I look down at my legs wrapped around his waist, so close to him physically, yet mentally we\u2019re still incredibly far away. \u201cI honestly still don\u2019t know if I can trust you.\u201d I look up at him. \u201cI mean, sometimes I ask you questions and you give the vaguest answers. Also, when we first met... the stuff you did and said... it\u2019s hard to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he utters quietly and it\u2019s a weird moment because Alex isn\u2019t the type of guy that says sorry a lot. \u201cI\u2019m sorry all of this happened. That you had to go through everything and that I\u2019m a total douche who you have to feel this crazy electricity feeling with.\u201d</p><p>I swallow the lump lodged in my throat put there by the intensity in his voice. \u201cIt went away for a moment, you know. When Laylen... when he bit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did that... how did that feel?\u201d He seems torn with wanting to hear the answer or even asking the question.</p><p>\u201cWeird. Crazy. Unnatural.\u201d I shrug. \u201cHonestly, it kind of made me feel empty.\u201d Some of the tension leaves his face, like he\u2019s relieved by my answer. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t know exactly how I feel about you or what\u2019s driving what I do feel.\u201d</p><p>He eyes me over, seeming undecided, as if he\u2019s having an internal battle with himself. Then he grips my waist and lifts me off the counter.</p><p>He reaches for his jeans on the floor. \u201cGet dressed,\u201d he says as he slips them on.</p><p>I reach for my clean shirt folded up on the counter beside the sink. \u201cOkay.\u201d My voice is tight, figuring we\u2019re heading back to where we started. He\u2019s being distant and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to start shutting down. Goddammit. Why do I do this to myself?</p> <p>He slips his shirt on over his head and then heads for the door, and feelings of shame, guilt and irritation flood me.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I tug the shirt over my head. \u201cAre you leaving?\u201d</p><p>He pauses, glancing over his shoulder as he grasps the doorknob. \u201cI\u2019m going to go find the one person that I know of who can get us into The Underworld.\u201d</p><p>I start to smile, a full, real smile. \u201cTo find my mom?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cBut don\u2019t get so happy yet. First we have to deal with the person who\u2019s going to help us.\u201d He jerks the door open as I slip the skirt on. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be a pain in the ass.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I tie the top of the skirt.</p><p>He looks unhappy as he steps into the hall. \u201cThe only Foreseer I know who\u2019s not afraid of breaking the rules.\u201d</p><p>I point my finger at myself. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo someone who is experienced and knows the history.\u201d He steps out into the hall and I follow. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>\u201cYou want to bring Nicholas here?\u201d I frown as I trot down the stairs behind him, gathering my damp hair into a side braid \u201cLike the pervert Faerie/Foreseer/likes-to-invade-my-personal-space, Nicholas? The one who became a mirage and made me believe he was you more than a few times?\u201d</p><p>He glances over his shoulder, nodding. \u201cThat would be the one.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as we enter the living room. It\u2019s miraculously been put back into place, the walls mended, the chairs fixed, and the apothecary table looks like it\u2019s never been touched. \u201cDo we really need him, though?\u201d I ask. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anyone else who can help us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy connections in the Foreseer world are very limited.\u201d He flops down on the couch, shaking his head. \u201cTrust me, Gemma. He\u2019s the last person I ever want to go to for help, well besides someone like Draven.\u201d He glances up at my neck and I have the urge to cover my neck and hide the two small, healing bite marks on it. \u201cForeseer\u2019s can travel anywhere at any moment, which is why Nicholas was able to randomly show up back in Colorado. You remember the crystal ball he used to get us into the City of Crystal, right?\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the couch beside him. \u201cHow could I forget? I nearly broke my damn arm.\u201d</p><p>He presses his lips together, draping his arm on the back of the sofa. \u201cWell, that crystal ball allows them to travel everywhere.\u201d</p><p>I perk up a little. \u201cEverywhere as in places like The Underworld?\u201d</p><p>His fingers brush the back of my neck and begin tracing soft, circular patterns. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m not one-hundred percent sure of. I\u2019d guess yes, but I never like to guess about things. The only way to really find out is to talk to a Foreseer who knows the history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think he\u2019s going to willingly help us?\u201d I frown doubtfully. \u201cI\u2019ve only met him once, but I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s not the kind of person to just hand over information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...what do we have to do then? How do we get him to cooperate?\u201d</p><p>His fingers trail around to the front of my neck, up to my cheek where he finds a loose strand of my hair and coils it around his finger. \u201cWe have to bring him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d I wonder. \u201cWe just go down there and get my mom? I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not going to be that easy.\u201d</p><p>He offers me a sad smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not... that place is dangerous. More dangerous than anywhere you\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who\u2019s going to go to this place?\u201d I ask. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cBut I can\u2019t go, either. It\u2019s going to have to be someone we can trust to keep an eye on Nicholas since he\u2019ll have to take them there. Someone like Aislin... and Laylen, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I elevate my eyebrows at him and he releases my hair before shifting uneasily back in the chair. \u201cYou trust Laylen?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders lift and fall as he shrugs. \u201cIf he\u2019s with Aislin, then I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like you don\u2019t believe it yourself,\u201d I remark, studying him over. \u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d</p><p>He narrows his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help you. That\u2019s all. Jesus, can\u2019t you simply trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust is something earned,\u201d I say.</p><p>He glares at me, his green eyes smoldering. \u201cLike when I sacrificed myself against a memoria extracto so you\u2019d be okay?\u201d</p><p>I evade the question because he\u2019s right, yet distrust stabs at the back of my neck. I can\u2019t seem to shake the feeling for some reason, even when he proves otherwise. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll be going somewhere else.\u201d He stands to his feet and extends his hand out to me. \u201cNow come with me. Let\u2019s go get Nicholas and get this whole thing over with.\u201d</p><p>We go into the back room where Adessa stores her supplies on rows and rows of metal shelves that are stacked with boxes, elaborate objects, and glass jars filled with disturbing looking things.</p><p>Aislin joins us, seeming cheerful as ever, yet I can feel the awkward energy between us. \u201cHey, Gemma,\u201d she says.</p><p>I smile, but it feels forced. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>She glances at my clothes. \u201cYou look good in what I picked out. Very Black Angel like.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my boots, skirt, and tank top. \u201cThat\u2019s why you picked me out such a Gothic wardrobe? So I\u2019d look like a Black Angel?\u201d</p><p>She nods, picking up a box embedded with miniscule, silvery diamonds. \u201cI thought it would help you blend in.\u201d</p><p>I want to tell her I\u2019m sorry, yet now doesn\u2019t seem like the time. Maybe when Alex isn\u2019t around perhaps.</p><p>She lifts open the lid and sniffs the inside of the box. \u201cSo what are we doing exactly? Trying to figure out what my... what Stephan is doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alex quickly fills her in, letting her know his plan. Something about her reaction unsettles me to no end, especially when Alex says that I\u2019m going to use a Foreseer\u2019s crystal ball to summon Nicholas here.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d I gape at Alex. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m doing that.\u201d</p><p>Alex rolls his eyes, like I\u2019m being absurd, but I\u2019m not. \u201cYou want to get your mom back, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I reply, propping my elbow onto a shelf. \u201cBut not by using a crystal. Every time I\u2019ve used one I\u2019ve seen stuff I\u2019d rather not and, besides... didn\u2019t you make some promise to Dyvinius that I wouldn\u2019t use my power until I was trained.\u201d</p> <p>Aislin\u2019s examining a jar that looks like it has a chicken leg or something in it. When I say this, she nearly drops it on the concrete floor. \u201cYou did what? She rebalances the jar in her hand. \u201cAlex, why the heck did you do that?\u201d</p><p>I stand up straight and step toward Aislin. \u201cWait. What happens if he breaks it?\u201d</p><p>Aislin sets the jar back down on the shelf and fidgets with the straps on her floral, pink dress. \u201cHe\u2019ll end up having to go to the City of Crystal to do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAislin,\u201d Alex warns, spinning a steel ball balanced on a podium. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I scowl at him. \u201cAre you seriously trying to keep things from me?\u201d</p> <p>He stands up straight and steps in front of me. His nearness forces me to crane my neck back to look at him as he backs me against the shelf. \u201cThis is for your own good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask as the edges of the shelf press against me.</p><p>\u201cBecause you won\u2019t do it if I tell you.\u201d He puts a hand on each side of me, pinning me between his arms.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I cross my arms. \u201cMaybe I won\u2019t mind whatever\u2019s going to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes again. \u201cYes, you will because, whether you\u2019ll admit it or not, you care about me.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to protest, but I can\u2019t get any words to come out. A faint stab reveals at the back of my neck and unexpectedly I realize that I do care about Alex, despite the bad that\u2019s happened between us.</p> <p>\u201cPlease just tell me,\u201d I practically beg, gripping onto the bottom of his shirt. My knuckles brush against his muscles and the contact singes my skin. \u201cI want to know what we\u2019re getting into.\u201d</p><p>The side of his mouth crooks up into a lopsided smile. \u201cAll you need to do is use your power to get Nicholas here, then you can leave the rest to everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could go to The Underworld, you know,\u201d I tell him firmly. \u201cI\u2019m not completely incompetent. Besides, it is my mom we\u2019re going after. It should be me who goes and gets her.\u201d</p><p>He sighs and places his hand on my cheek, his thumb grazing a line across my cheekbone. \u201cRegardless of everything you\u2019ve done over the last few days... walking into a Vampire Lair... you still have the star\u2019s energy inside you, and until we know for sure what the hell it\u2019s being used for.... Why my....\u201d He swallows hard. \u201cWhy my father wants it, then we need to keep you safe. Furthermore, the last thing we need is for the Queen of The Underworld to get her hands on you. She\u2019s almost as bad as Demetrius and his Death Walkers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure there\u2019s not another way to bring him here?\u201d I ask. \u201cI mean, don\u2019t you guys use phones or something?\"</p><p>The corners of his lips quirk. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s no service in the City of Crystal.\u201d</p><p>I want to roll my eyes at him, but I don\u2019t. What I want to do is hug him because I have this feeling something really bad is about to happen. \u201cJust promise me you\u2019re not going to die,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He seems pleased by what I say. \u201cNever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the Kingdom of Fey,\u201d Laylen suggests, abruptly appearing in the doorway. He leans against the door fame and his arms flex as he crosses them. \u201cYou could always just go there and get him.\u201d</p><p>The second my eyes land on him, I know that the sensations of the bite has changed me somehow. He\u2019s wearing all black again, his standard uniform, and his lips look a little swollen as if he\u2019s been kissing someone or feeding. The thought makes me insanely jealous and, for a brief moment, I feel compelled to run to him, beg him to fold his arms around me, and sink his teeth into my veins. It actually physically hurts not to do it, yet I manage to keep my feet firmly planted to the ground.</p><p>I clear my throat, attempting to also wipe the tension building within me. \u201cKingdom of Fey?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where the Fey live,\u201d Aislin explains, staring at the spot of concrete on the floor as she shuffles her sandals against it. \u201cSince Nicholas is part Fey, he goes there sometimes, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s very fond of it because...well, because the Fey can be...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s a joke to them,\u201d Alex interrupts, his fingers possessively touching my hip as he moves around behind me. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of running around in circles.\u201d He gently guides me closer to him, his eyes fixed on Laylen as he situates my back against his chest. \u201cBesides, you know they aren\u2019t very welcoming to anyone who isn\u2019t full Fey. They even give Nicholas shit, which means he doesn\u2019t usually hang out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you what?\u201d Laylen crooks his brow and steps inside the storage room. \u201cJust summon him here, using her.\u201d He nods his head at me. \u201cThen you go pay your debt for breaking the promise and Aislin and I go with the crazy Faerie into The Underworld.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s chest presses against my back and his other hand touches my waist. \u201cUnless you have a better plan.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, stopping just in front of us, and I ball my hands into fists to keep from touching him. \u201cI just want to make sure you\u2019re good with it because you\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to have to pay the debt. Everything else is easy compared to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go so far as easy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I get what you\u2019re saying and I can handle it. Besides, it\u2019s the quickest way and we need quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d Aislin starts, but then stops when Alex shoots her a glare. \u201cFine, you know what? Do whatever you want. You always do anyway.\u201d Her voice is full of venom as she backs up to the shelf behind her with her hands up.</p><p>\u201cI really wish someone would let me in on what the hell\u2019s about to happen,\u201d I say and Alex\u2019s fingers leave my waist.</p><p>I shift uncomfortably as I turn around, very aware that Laylen is just behind me. \u201cUmmm... What if Nicholas doesn\u2019t show up as Nicholas... what if he mind fucks with my head again?\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s expression plummets. \u201cShit, the damn mirage thing.\u201d He contemplates the dilemma and then his gaze diverts to Aislin. \u201cAny ideas.\u201d</p><p>Aislin sighs and then turns toward the shelf. \u201cAlways turning to the Witch.\u201d She rummages through the unique collection of stuff stacked on the shelves and finally selects a small, bronzed box about the size of her palm. \u201cWhat would you guys do without me?\u201d she asks, turning around with the box balanced in her hand.</p><p>\u201cProbably be confused all the time,\u201d Laylen says, winking at her.</p><p>She smiles, but it\u2019s tight. Then she walks forward, her eyes glued to the box. \u201cNow I\u2019m not one-hundred percent sure if it\u2019ll work, but it\u2019s supposed to give you clear, undiluted sight, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I love you to death,\u201d Alex says. \u201cBut every time you say you\u2019re not one-hundred percent sure, it makes me worry I\u2019m going to grow a third arm or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that only happened once,\u201d Aislin protests, removing the lid from the box.</p><p>\u201cOr temporarily change into a frog,\u201d Laylen says with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cI was only trying to turn you into a prince charming,\u201d she says, her green eyes lighting up as she smiles up at them. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault I didn\u2019t read the fine print.\u201d</p><p>Laylen causally leans against the shelf. \u201cYou know, I still crave the taste of flies sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you do,\u201d Aislin\u2019s mouth threatens to turn upward as she reaches into the box.</p><p>The whole conversation reminds me again how much I\u2019ve missed out on and how I\u2019ll never get it back. I won\u2019t share moments with them of misplaced spells and games or whatever else children do. I only have now and I\u2019m not really sure what to do with it since it pretty much owns me at the moment.</p><p>Alex temporarily removes my necklace so Aislin can splash some silvery dust in my eyes and chant her magic words. he puts it back on me and Aislin splashes some in Laylen and Alex\u2019s eyes as well as hers. Then Alex moves over to a shelf and searches the bottom row. Bending down, he scoops up a crystal ball and then walks back over to me, balancing the illuminating crystal structure in his palm.</p><p>I wipe my eyes with the heels of my hands and blink against my blurry vision. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cNow shut your eyes and place you\u2019re hand on it... the sooner we get this over with, the sooner we can have answers.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard, torn. Is this what I really should be doing? Should I really risk it? Risk whatever waits for us in the future?</p><p>\u201cThink of somewhere safe to go,\u201d Alex instructs with his fingers wrapped around the glass. \u201cA safe place.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m seriously considering stepping back and really thinking about what I\u2019m about to do because I do care for Alex. I really do. The feeling I\u2019m experiencing\u2014the desire to protect him\u2014makes me hesitate.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before I can react, he grabs my hand and places my palm onto the glass. I feel a hot energy swoop up my body before it slams against my head and my heart. It feels like my limbs are being detached from my body as my pulse accelerates. Seconds later, I\u2019m engulfed by a bright, warm light and being swept away into the unknown.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what went wrong, but something is definitely wrong. All I can see is light. Everywhere. I\u2019m not falling or floating. I\u2019m not even moving, I\u2019m simply sustained somewhere within it.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d I whisper, moving my arms and legs, desperately trying to get my bearings.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in your future,\u201d someone says from behind me.</p><p>My feet suddenly plant against the ground and I spin around to squint through the light. The smell of lilacs, rain, and forest smother my nostrils and I know, even though I can\u2019t see him, that there\u2019s an extremely annoying half-Faerie standing behind me.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d I call out, wrapping my arms around myself. \u201cI know it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer, but I can feel him next to me, the heat of his body radiating all over me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d I rotate in circles, searching the light for him, but I\u2019m blind everywhere I look.</p><p>\u201cI already told you, it\u2019s your future,\u201d his voice purrs in my ear and I flinch, swinging my arm around.</p><p>I only hit air and curse under my breath. \u201cHow do you know it\u2019s my future?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His voice touches my ear again. \u201cBecause I do.\u201d</p><p>I glance around at the pale light. I can\u2019t even see my own body, can barely feel it. \u201cHow can this be my future? There\u2019s nothing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you see?\u201d Nicholas\u2019s breath encircles my face. \u201cNothing?\u201d</p><p>My instincts warn me to be cautious as I remember how far he pushed me the last time we were in a vision together; how he tried to touch me and take advantage of me.</p> <p>I open my mouth to tell him I don\u2019t know, but as if my voice no longer belongs to me I say, \u201cI see light... It\u2019s everywhere.\u201d Shit. Where the hell did that come from?</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s all you see?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>There is a pause. \u201cThen I guess that means your future\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Dead. \u201cWhat!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cHow do you reach that assumption?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back,\u201d he says, evading my question. \u201cI have some business to take care of with Alex.\u201d</p><p>Before I can respond, I feel his fingers slide through mine and he pries my arms away from me. Then I\u2019m jerked back and he slams me against him, his arms enfolding around me.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d I wiggle my shoulders and arms, but he tightens his hold, trapping me against him.</p><p>He kisses the top of my head and I hear him breathe in the scent of my hair. \u201cGod, the things I could do to you right now.\u201d His voice is deep and full of desire; it makes me want to gag.</p><p>I lift my leg, bend my knee, and swing my foot forward hoping to kick him, however all I touch is air.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, I swear to God\u2014\u201d</p> <p>His lips come down over mine and I feel vile and gross inside. I try to lean back, but he only moves with me, keeping us pinned together, as he attempts to snake his tongue into my mouth. I open my lips and bite down hard, feeling his tongue rupture open and bleed.</p><p>He only laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously going to pay for that.\u201d</p><p>His hand starts to trail down my back, groping me, and forcing me against him. The prickle stabs at the back of my leg and everything feels wrong. I\u2019m terrified. Disgusted. With him and myself.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d I beg, writhing my body as tears threaten to spill out. \u201cPlease just let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he whispers in my ear. \u201cI\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d</p><p>As his hand reaches my ass, a sharp, deafening noise echoes in my head. I hear Nicholas curse and then the lightness intensifies as I\u2019m jolted back.</p><p>When I open my eyes again the light is gone. I\u2019m lying in the velvet sofa with my head in Alex\u2019s lap and he\u2019s staring down at me with a concerned look in his expression.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks, tracing his finger down my temple.</p> <p>Panic flares through my body as I glance around the room. \u201cHow did I get here... I thought I was in the storage room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you fainted,\u201d he says, brushing my hair out of my eyes. I wince at the aching pain in my skull. I feel nauseous and sick as I try to decipher what happened. \u201cAnd you hit your head on the corner of the shelf before I could catch you.\u201d He checks my eyes, leaning closely. \u201cI\u2019m worried you might have a concussion.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head while I gradually sit up and he leans back to give me room. My eyes immediately drift to the sofa across from me where Nicholas sits.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing a navy blue T-shirt and a pair of tan cargo pants. His sandy blonde hair sweeps over his forehead, his golden eyes twinkling and his smile is devious.</p><p>I narrow my eyes at him, but he only shakes his head and smiles. Watch it, he mouths. Or I won\u2019t help.</p><p>Alex follows my line of gaze and then he stiffens. \u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe showed up in the vision,\u201d I explain through gritted teeth. I want to wring his neck, but I also need his help. It's wrong to let him have so much power over me, although there\u2019s nothing I can do about it other than succumb to him. \u201cIn grand, creepy Nicholas style.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s grin broadens and his dark gaze skims over my body. \u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not allowed,\u201d Alex interrupts, putting his hand on my knee while his fierce gaze remains on Nicholas. \u201cForeseers are not allowed to go into another Foreseer\u2019s vision without permission. Even I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I did have permission,\u201d Nicholas says with a sly grin. \u201cHow do you know for sure that I didn\u2019t? Maybe Gemma begged me to show up there?\u201d</p><p>Alex arches a brow at me, wondering what\u2019s going on. I want to tell him, so I can watch him punch Nicholas in the face because I know he will, yet then Nicholas probably won\u2019t help me, either.</p><p>I shake my head and lean into Alex, wanting to shut my eyes and let the electricity lull me to sleep. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. He\u2019s just being a creeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t like it.\u201d Nicholas winks, relaxing back in the chair with his arms spread out on the back. His attention focuses on Alex who protectively inches closer to me. \u201cSo is there a reason you let her use the crystal ball again? Or did she just decide to do it on her own and let you suffer the consequences for it? Personally, I\u2019d love to think it was the latter.\u201d</p><p>Alex and I exchange a look that seems to tell me he\u2019s preparing himself for something terrible. His expression flashes with worry, and Alex rarely looks worried. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the latter.\u201d He forces his gaze away from me and his fingers on my knee tense, his nails jabbing into my skin as his other hand clenches into a tight fist. \u201cWe need your help.\u201d It sounds like it\u2019s killing him to say it.</p><p>\u201cHelp with what?\u201d Amusement dances in Nicholas\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWith getting into The Underworld,\u201d Alex says through gritted teeth.</p><p>A smirk forms on Nicholas\u2019s face as he absentmindedly traces the Foreseer mark on his wrist, moving around the circle and ultimately the \u2018S\u2019 in the middle of it. \u201cAnd who says I know how to do that?\u201d</p><p>Alex shrugs. \u201cI know your kind have a way of getting everywhere, including to different realms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Nicholas says. \u201cBut even if I could get you there, who says I want to help you?\u201d</p><p>Alex slides his hand up the front of my leg, finds my hand in my lap, and laces our fingers together. I catch Nicholas watching the movement and for a moment jealousy burns in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s some sort of bargain we can work out.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s attention transfers to me. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could figure out something that you have that I want.\u201d</p><p>Alex angles himself in front of me, obscuring me from Nicholas\u2019s view. \u201cNot her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I said that was the only thing I\u2019d take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d kill you.\u201d</p><p>My head whips in Alex\u2019s direction, but his eyes stay on Nicholas. Nicholas holds the gaze steadily, though the longer it goes on, the more uncertain Nicholas gets, and finally, he slumps back looking really fidgety.</p><p>\u201cThere is one thing I\u2019d love to have,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you can get it for me, then I\u2019ll be your golden ticket into the land where torture is welcomed with opened arms along with insanity.\u201d He pauses, bringing his foot up onto his knee. \u201cBut I have to ask, why The Underworld?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important.\u201d Alex squeezes my hand, sending sparks up my arm. \u201cJust tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>He dithers, thrumming his finger against his lip. \u201cI\u2019d like some fraxinus invisibili.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s that?\u201d Alex asks.</p><p>\u201cAsk your Witch,\u201d Nicholas replies. \u201cShe\u2019ll know what it is.\u201d</p><p>Alex glances at the doorway. \u201cAislin, can you come in here?\u201d</p><p>A minute later Aislin enters the room with Laylen trailing at her heels. I discount the pull toward him the best that I can, especially since Aislin looks like she\u2019s been crying, her eyes red and her cheeks swollen.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up,\u201d she says, sounding hoarse as she reaches the middle of the room, keeping her distance from Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what fraxinus invisibili is?\u201d he asks her.</p><p>Her expression plummets as she sits down on the edge of the apothecary table and Laylen sinks down on the armrest of the sofa right beside Nicholas. \u201cYeah, its invisibility ash.\u201d</p><p>Alex looks confused. \u201cWhy the hell do you want that?\u201d he asks Nicholas.</p><p>Nicholas shrugs, jiggling his foot that\u2019s on his knee. \u201cWho knows when it\u2019ll come in handy?\u201d</p><p>Alex and Aislin trade a look. \u201cIt\u2019s what he wants in exchange for his help,\u201d he explains to her.</p><p>\u201cBut what if he can\u2019t help us?\u201d Aislin turns to the side so she\u2019s facing Alex. \u201cWhat if I give it to him and then he runs?\u201d</p><p>Alex glances at Nicholas and then demands, \u201cTell us how to get into The Underworld and then we\u2019ll talk deals.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas lowers his feet to the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t really think you\u2019re in a place to give orders since I\u2019m going to be taking you away soon, but if you must know, getting into The Underworld requires a lot of Foreseer power and an Ira.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s an Ira?\u201d Alex asks.</p><p>Nicholas shrugs, nonchalantly kicking his feet up onto the apothecary table. \u201cA very powerful crystal ball. One that can take you to and from forbidden places, like The Underworld, and in present time, too, without any of the laws being broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019ll work?\u201d Alex pulls me even closer to him, as if he can\u2019t get enough of touching me, as if he\u2019s about to go soon.</p><p>I bite my nails, nervous at what lies ahead for us. What\u2019ll happen to him? To me? To us?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Nicholas corrects him. \u201cBut it\u2019s your best bet.\u201d</p><p>Alex exchanges another look with Aislin. \u201cHow much damage can he do with something like fraxinus invisibili?\u201d he asks her.</p><p>\u201cWell, if he can get a Witch to help him use it,\u201d she replies. \u201cThen probably a lot. He\u2019ll be able to go invisible whenever he wants which means he\u2019ll be harder to find, yet it\u2019ll be easier for him to find us.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s forehead creases as he frowns at Nicholas. \u201cShe\u2019s not helping you use it.\u201d</p><p>Nicolas raises his hands in front of him. \u201cI never asked her to. All I said is that I need it.\u201d</p><p>Alex scoots forward in the chair, still holding onto me so I have to move forward with him. \u201cYou know I could just beat you up and force you to help us.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s eyes darken with a challenge as his fingers curl around the armrest. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how much pain I can endure. Besides, you don\u2019t have that long before you\u2019re officially considered to be going back on your promise.\u201d He releases the armrest and taps a watch on his wrist. \u201cTime is ticking.\u201d</p><p>Alex puffs out a frustrated breath and glances at an antique clock on the wall across from us. \u201cFine. Aislin will give you the ash after you take me to the City of Crystal. That way you have to come back.\u201d</p><p>Even though I knew it was coming, I panic, grabbing onto his arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to that God awful place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have to go... its part of the promise I made with Dyvinius... you already knew this,\u201d he says simply.</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d I trail off as he leans in and rests his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t trust him,\u201d he whispers. \u201cHe\u2019ll stab you in the back as soon as he gets a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming back, right?\u201d I whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would never leave you forever.\u201d He lets out a faltering breath. \u201cEventually I\u2019ll be back, however I have to stay there for a while.\u201d</p><p>Panic owns me at the moment and I can\u2019t seem to control it.

Promise me you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>My skin swelters and I\u2019m unable to help myself when I graze my lips across his. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I whisper against his mouth. I\u2019m about to pull away when he cups the back of my head, tugging gently on my hair, and kisses me hard with every ounce of passion he possesses. Again I wonder just how much control we have over our emotions and how much control the electricity has. I kiss him back with an everlasting hunger. I\u2019m breathless by the time I pull away and I\u2019ve completely forgotten we\u2019re in a room full of people.</p><p>Aislin covers her mouth as Laylen clears his throat, staring at the doorway. Alex\u2019s lips are swollen as he turns to Nicholas.</p> <p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Nicholas says and slips a ruby-filled crystal ball from the pocket of his pants. He rises to his feet with it palmed in his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He winds around the apothecary table and holds it out in front of him.</p><p>Alex gives me one last kiss on the cheek and then releases my hand, getting to his feet. I want to grab onto him, pull him back to me, and hold him against me. I fight the urge to do so, trying to decide what\u2019s right and what is wrong while fearing what\u2019s going to happen to him when he goes. Is this what caring for someone feels like? All this worry and fear floating around inside me, only it\u2019s not for me.</p><p>\u201cAnd one last thing,\u201d Alex says to Nicholas as he reaches for the crystal.</p><p>Nicholas sighs begrudgingly. \u201cWhat now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you try anything, and I mean anything with Gemma while I\u2019m gone.\u201d He jabs a finger against Nicholas\u2019s chest. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to deal with two very powerful Witches and a Vampire who will do anything to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Nicholas rolls his eyes, though he looks a little worried.</p> <p>Alex doesn\u2019t say anything else as he places his hand on the glowing crystal ball. There\u2019s a loud swoosh, then a blink of light and they\u2019re gone, along with the electricity.</p><p>I miss him the second he disappears.</p><p>I miss him so much it hurts.</p><p>I\u2019ve never missed anyone before and I\u2019m not fully sure that I like it.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>I ask where Adessa is and Aislin tells me she\u2019s tending to her store. Aislin quickly leaves the room to go find some fraxinus invisibili from Adessa\u2019s storage room.</p><p>Once she\u2019s gone, Laylen and I sit on the sofa and wait for Nicholas to return. There\u2019s an awkward silence between us as the memories of bites and blood linger in our heads.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Laylen finally starts, bringing his knee up onto the spot of sofa to fill up the space between us. \u201cHow have you been feeling?\u201d He rakes his fingers through his hair and doesn\u2019t bother to fix it, leaving it sticking up all over the place. \u201cGod, that was a stupid question. It sounded so much better in my head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I pluck at a loose thread on the sofa, forcing myself to focus on the conversation and not memories of him sinking his teeth into me and blood or anything else that\u2019s bringing me down. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t a stupid question. It was a much needed question... things have been really weird between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have,\u201d he agrees and then scoots forward on the sofa until our knees touch, invading the safe zone. I need space, otherwise I\u2019m going to do or say something stupid; like please, pretty please bite me again. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d I agree, blowing out a stressed breath. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever felt normal around.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows lift in doubt. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really,\u201d I say. \u201cMinus what happened back with Draven, you\u2019ve always made me feel like a person instead of a star.\u201d</p><p>He puts a hand on my knee. \u201cCan we forget about what happened and go back to being friends?\u201d</p><p>I nod, relieved even though I can still feel a faint pull toward him and his fangs. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, but there\u2019s reluctance behind it and he lacks the confidence that his words portray. \u201cThen it\u2019s settled. No more kissing or biting,\u201d he jokes, but his voice is sad and full of guilt. I have a feeling that despite how nonchalant we\u2019re both being about it, down the road sometime, it\u2019s going to end up being a huge problem.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never ask you to do that again,\u201d I say and then unable to take it anymore, I lean in and give him a hug. \u201cI\u2019ll never make you do anything that will hurt you ever again.\u201d God, he smells so good, I need to lean back. I give myself a few more seconds and then I pull away. I shake off the sensation to lean against him and tilt my neck to the side. It makes me feel so guilty because of Alex.</p><p>Alex. I should be thinking of Alex, shouldn\u2019t I? I have no idea anymore. Alex or Laylen? How about both? What the hell is wrong with me?</p><p>As I sift through my thoughts of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, images begin to flicker through my mind as the prickle lightly begins to poke at the back of my neck At first it\u2019s stuff I can already remember, but then suddenly they start to reveal lost thoughts from a place and time I once was forced to forget.</p><p>Alex and me picking lilacs in a field; watching other Keepers practice sword fighting in the castle; playing, having fun, smiling.</p><p>\u201cGemma, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Laylen\u2019s voice is far away as I begin to feel disembodied.</p><p>\u201cI think I can remember some stuff...about my childhood...about Alex and I being friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember?\u201d he asks. \u201cLike actually remember?\u201d</p><p>I nod as my vision goes in and out of focus. \u201cThey\u2019re real memories... And I can feel how I felt when I was there... God, this is so strange....\u201d</p><p>The emotions I experienced during each memory link to my heart, mind, body, and conclusively my soul, the most important part. In the end, it\u2019s just Alex and me. Together. Like we were never supposed to be apart and all I can do is drift into the memory, letting it take me over.</p><p>When my sight returns to me, I\u2019m no longer at Adessa\u2019s. I panic as I look around at the trees of a forest even though this has happened before. I\u2019ve gone into a vision without a crystal. But how? How is this even possible?</p><p>Thick trees enclose me from every side and a grey stone castle peeks through the top while, far in the distance, the sun shines behind it. It has to be the forest near the lake\u2014the entrance to The Underworld. I can feel it in the air, in my mind, in my body.</p><p>The sky is a clear blue and the air smells like earth and musk. Not knowing what else to do, I head for the castle, wondering why I\u2019m here. What am I supposed to see exactly?</p><p>I\u2019m about halfway there when a cool breeze sweeps through my hair and kisses at my cheeks. The impulse to go to the castle floats away. Suddenly, I\u2019m turning around, heading in the opposite direction, and going deeper into the forest, my feet moving as if they have their own mind.</p><p>I hike for what seems like forever, stumbling over fallen tree trunks and fighting against the unruly, blooming branches. Finally, I come to a stop in front of a steep hill. I need to go up it, yet I don\u2019t understand why. Obeying, I move to the side and start searching for something I know is hidden on the hill. After a while, I get frustrated because I have no clue what I\u2019m looking for or how long I\u2019m going to have to keep looking, but then I spot something that makes me pause. A bush budding with violet flowers, growing out of the middle of the hill. I hike up to it, my boots battling the loose, rocky dirt, and then I pick one of the violet flowers. The smell is intoxicating and causes more images of my past to spin in my head. I\u2019ve been to this place before and picked these flowers... I remember the flower in Alex\u2019s car and how he told me I used to pick them for him when we were younger.</p><p>I squat down and start digging through the damp soil as I inch around to the back of the bush. Behind it is a small hole in the ground. I hoist myself up to it and peer down. There\u2019s a ladder that leads to a bottom where a light filters from somewhere.</p><p>I take a deep breath and lower my feet to the top step of the ladder. Then I start to climb down, my hands sweating against the cool metal until my feet reach the floor. I immediately spin around, fearing what I\u2019m going to see. Visions have never been kind to me and I half expect Stephan to come charging out to stab me.</p><p>I\u2019m standing in a hollowed out room, made of dirt as well as the roots of a tree. There\u2019s a rustic wooden table against the back wall where a candle is burning. Next to the table is a metal trunk, and in front of the trunk is a young girl with long, brown hair, violet eyes, and wearing a purple dress. It\u2019s me, the younger version anyway. I\u2019m probably around four years old, which means there\u2019s a good chance that my soul and memories are still intact.</p><p>Sitting across from me is a little boy with his legs crisscrossed and a pocketknife in his hand. He has dark brown hair and bright green eyes that shine like emeralds. It\u2019s Alex when he was younger. Alex and me. Together.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think\u2019s going to happen?\u201d the younger version of me asks as she plays with a large sapphire, rolling it in the dirt. \u201cAfter they take me away?\u201d</p><p>Alex shakes his head and gently takes the sapphire from her, tossing it across the room into the trunk in the corner. It lands inside, making a soft thud as it hits the bottom. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Gemma. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll ever see each other again?\u201d she asks, tracing circles in the dirt with her fingers.</p><p>He nods, scraping the blade of the pocketknife into the dirt. \u201cI promise we will, no matter what anyone says.\u201d</p><p>Tears bubble in the corner of her eyes, and I can actually feel her fear, worry, and sadness stirring with in me as I remember this exact moment. \u201cDo you think Marco and Sophia will be nice to me?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cHow could they not be nice to you?\u201d Alex says. \u201cNo one could ever be mean to you, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>My mouth turns downward at his words. It\u2019s such a nice, free moment between us and I\u2019m a little shocked. This is what we were like together? So comfortable. I almost feel sorry for us, we were too na\u00efve to see what was going to happen to us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Alex says, holding the pocketknife up in front of him. \u201cHow about you and I become blood brothers?\u201d</p><p>She scowls at him and folds her arms. \u201cI\u2019m not a boy.\u201d</p><p>Alex laughs and I do, too. \u201cOkay, how about blood friends?\u201d</p><p>Tears escape her eyes and roll down her cheeks. \u201cWhat do I have to do to become one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a little cut on my hand and on yours, then we press them together and make a promise, okay?\u201d</p><p>She looks wary. \u201cWill it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly for a minute,\u201d he promises.</p><p>She wipes the tears away from her cheeks with her hands. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>She stretches her hand to Alex and he carefully makes a small incision in her palm with the tip of the knife. She winces and I glance down at the small scar on my palm. I never knew where it came from and I once made a joke to Alex about it, saying a guy cut me there. He\u2019s known all along what it was from and never said anything.</p> <p>Alex makes a tiny cut in his palm, then drops the knife to the ground and raises his hand out in front of him. \u201cOkay, put yours up to mine.\u201d</p><p>She presses her palms to his with a beaming grin on her lips.</p><p>\u201cForem,\u201d Alex utters. \u201cNow you say it.\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep breath. \u201cForem.\u201d</p><p>Alex smiles as he drops his hand to his lap. \u201cThere, that\u2019s all it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what does forem mean?\u201d she asks, wiping the blood form her hand with her finger.</p> <p>\u201cIt means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex!\u201d Someone yells from above the ground.</p><p>The children\u2019s eyes become round and Alex jumps to his feet. \u201cWe have to go.\u201d He holds out his hand and helps her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cDo you think your dad will be mad at us,\u201d she asks, panicking as they head past me toward the ladder. \u201cFor disappearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Alex says. \u201cLet\u2019s just hurry up, okay?\u201d</p><p>She glances around at the little hideout with a sad look on her face, like she\u2019ll never see the place again, and then she nods. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>They climb up the ladder and I follow them. As I step out from the behind the violet bush, I see Stephan waving his finger as he scolds them. I don\u2019t want to see what happens next because I have a feeling I already know. The friendship will get crushed, a soul will be broken, and I\u2019ll forget that it ever happened. I know because I can pretty much feel it coming. It\u2019s heartbreaking to think about and know that this is what will be destroyed. For a second I find myself wishing I could forget it again and go back to unknowing.</p><p>I shut my eyes and sink down into the ground, waiting to be yanked away, thinking I\u2019m going back, but suddenly I\u2019m drowning in darkness.</p> <p>Evil darkness.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>My skin is on fire, raging like a desert storm. The heat claws at my skin, bites at it, gnawing it\u2019s way into my soul as I fly helplessly through the seemingly endless darkness.</p><p>The further I go, the hotter I get until I can\u2019t take it anymore. I stretch out my arms, glancing at them, however the darkness is too thick and weighted to see them at all. I open my mouth to shout for help, but my voice is lost in my own head.</p><p>I get dragged further into the desolate place and start to give up hope of ever seeing the light of day again. Yet then a light forms around me, lighting up my ghostly pale skin and orbing through the darkness, allowing me to see where I am.</p><p>I\u2019m nowhere. Lost in nothingness. Destined to be no one.</p><p>As a triangular shape forms on my skin, swirling upward before dipping down in a ray of light, I realize that I could become someone. A strong someone. A powerful someone.</p><p>I could become the darkness.</p><p>My eyes shoot open and I gasp for air, my skin is covered with sweat. Laylen\u2019s face appears in my line of vision, kneeling to the side of the sofa where I lie flat on my back. He looks horrified, his skin a sickly green.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d he asks, his blue eyes wide beneath his blond hair.</p><p>I start to sit up, scratching my arm, even though there\u2019s no triangular shape on it. \u201cI have no idea.</p><p>He puts his hand on my shoulder and pins me down to the sofa. \u201cDon\u2019t sit up until we figure out why you passed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t pass out,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI went into a vision... I think, anyway\u201d At least with the first thing I saw. The second one I\u2019m not sure of, but the idea that it could be a vision scares the living daylights out of me.</p><p>He leans away, taken aback. \u201cBut you weren\u2019t touching a crystal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I think I might be able to go in them without a crystal.\u201d</p><p>He gapes at me unfathomably. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI\u2019m not sure... All I know is that I enter things sometimes, just like I enter a vision, only I don\u2019t have a crystal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone else know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Laylen shakes his head incredulously. \u201cJesus, one minute you were sitting here and the next thing you fell over.\u201d His lips quirk upward. \u201cDo you know how much of a pain in the ass it was to catch your dead weight?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to fall over.\u201d I swing my legs to the floor, preparing to sit up. \u201cFor a second I thought I was just remembering stuff about my childhood, but then, the next thing I knew, I\u2019d entered a vision about my past.\u201d I let out a breath, preparing to tell him what else I saw and to ask him about the triangular symbol. I want to know what it represents and if it\u2019s a Mark.</p><p>\u201cSo you went into a vision?\u201d Nicholas asks and Laylen and I jump, startled by his sudden appearance on the sofa across from us. Damn it. \u201cWithout a crystal?\u201d</p><p>This is bad, very, very bad. Nicholas should not have this kind of information on me and I have a feeling he\u2019s going to use it against me.</p><p>I lift Laylen\u2019s hand off my shoulder, sit up, and get a head rush. I blink a few times while I wait for the room to stop spinning in blurs and streaks of color. \u201cDid I hit my head?\u201d I ask Laylen. \u201cWhen I blacked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I caught you before you did.\u201d He helps me sit up and then examines my eyes. \u201cBut didn\u2019t Alex say you hit your head when you went to get him.\u201d He nods his head in Nicholas\u2019s direction.</p><p>I press my fingertips to my head and wince at the tender spot on the temple. \u201cI have a really bad headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Nicholas interrupts, marveling at me as though I am the most fascinating thing he has ever laid eyes on. He inclines forward in the sofa and overlaps his hands on his knee \u201cYou can go into a vision without the help of a crystal...how fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s what I did,\u201d I mutter, racking my brain for a way out of this, but my mind\u2019s foggy with pain from the earlier fall as well as from the memory I\u2019ve just witnessed.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known you could do it?\u201d Nicholas asks with way too much interest.</p><p>I shrug as I scratch my head. \u201cNot too long I don\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how rare that is?\u201d Nicholas asks. \u201cJesus, I\u2019ve never even met a Foreseer who could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not one-hundred percent sure that\u2019s what I can do.\u201d I shrug, unsure what to say that would make the situation better. \u201cI\u2019m just guessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can... I can sense it all over you now that I know what to look for.\u201d Nicholas\u2019s eyes devour me, drifting over my entire body, and I wrap my arms around myself as I squirm from his unrelenting gaze. \u201cI\u2019ve only heard of one other Foreseer who could do it and that\u2019s Dyvinius\u2019s younger brother,\u201d he says. \u201cWho\u2019s been a Foreseer for a really long time, and comes from a line of many, many powerful Foreseers. He isn\u2019t some girl who just got her Foreseer\u2019s mark only a couple of days ago. Do you know how unlikely it is for anyone to be able to do that? You would have to be...\u201d He trails off, mulling over something, his forehead furrowing.</p><p>\u201cHave to be what?\u201d I wonder, glancing at Laylen. We exchange a curious glance and then Laylen chimes in.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, just finish the damn sentence,\u201d he says in a low, commanding tone.</p><p>\u201cVery powerful,\u201d Nicholas finishes, glaring at him. \u201cYou better watch it, Vampire boy. I might be here to help, but I can very easily leave.\u201d</p><p>Laylen\u2019s expression darkens and I note that his lip twitches. For a second, I swear his fangs descend, though then I blink and he looks normal.</p><p>\u201cSo about the Ira?\u201d I ask, changing the subject, knowing the clock is ticking. The longer I sit and argue, the more time my mom spends down in The Underworld. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas smirks as he pats the pocket of his pants. \u201cSafe and sound.\u201d</p><p>I stick out my hand. \u201cCan I see it?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNot until I get my fraxinus invisibili.\u201d His eyes wander to the doorway and I\u2019m surprised to find Aislin\u2019s there with a small, velvet bag in her hand. \u201cDo you have it?\u201d he asks her.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t respond right away, and then, reluctantly, she stomps across the room and drops the bag into Nicholas\u2019s lap. He grins and she turns away, looking at Laylen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the store if you need anything.\u201d He eyes glide over me as she turns to leave the room. There\u2019s something about her; sadness and pain along with longing in her eyes. It hurts my heart and I turn to Laylen the moment she walks out.</p><p>\u201cGo check on her,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>He glances at Nicholas. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d I say, waving him off. \u201cNow go.\u201d</p><p>He dithers momentarily then gets up and hurries out of the room.</p><p>\u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d Nicholas wonders, getting comfy on the sofa. \u201cLet me guess, your beautiful eyes have gotten in the way of their love.\u201d</p><p>I scowl at him, placing my hands on my hips. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>His expression lights up with enthusiasm. \u201cSo it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not true you asshole,\u201d I say. \u201cNow show me the Ira.\u201d</p><p>He picks up the bag on his lap, unlaces the golden ribbon on it, and glances inside, looking pleased before he ties it back up and sets it aside on the apothecary table.</p><p>\u201cShow me the Ira,\u201d I repeat firmly.</p><p>He rolls his eyes yet tolerates me, slipping a shimmering teal crystal ball out of the pocket of his pants. He gives me a quick glimpse of the Ira and by simply looking at it I can feel the power humming off of it, my fingers are itching to touch it to see what I can do with it. \u201cThere, satisfied?\u201d he asks, stuffing it back into his pocket.</p><p>I nod. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>His brow curves upward. \u201cCould you feel the power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say coolly, even though my body is still humming from the energy more powerfully than even the electricity.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s not as easy as seeing,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to use your Foreseer energy to even get it to work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you use yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to use that, too... it\u2019s going to take a lot of power\u2014power that you don\u2019t even know how to use yet.\u201d</p><p>My lips bow downward into a disappointed frown. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know how to use it yet, then how the hell are you going to get into The Underworld?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst off, we\u2019re going to go there.

That\u2019s why you won\u2019t try it again.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t argue, but he doesn\u2019t appear happy about it, either. \u201cYou know, I doubt you\u2019d be so confident if you knew where he really was right now.\u201d He shakes his head and I detect a slight flash of light under his skin as his body vibrates. I think he\u2019s trying to change into the mirage, but luckily it\u2019s not working. \u201cWould it help if I looked like him? You could kiss me and pretend I was him.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and slump back in the sofa. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to do the tricky mirage thing it\u2019s not working.\u201d</p><p>He glances down at his arms, rotating his hands over. \u201cWhat did you do,\u201d he growls.</p><p>I smirk at him, but deep down my heart and mind are entering a painful state, as if they miss the electricity\u2014miss Alex. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know?\u201d</p><p>We exchange defiant grins as we stare each other down and he drops his hands to his lap.</p><p>\u201cYou know that confidence is going to come in real handy when I train you. It\u2019ll channel your inner energy,\u201d he says.</p> <p>If only he knew just how much energy was inside me. It\u2019s a good thing he doesn\u2019t, though, because I have the feeling he\u2019s the kind of person that would do anything to get his hands on it.</p><p>I\u2019m quickly learning that Nicholas has the attention span of a child. After our little argument, we sit down on the living room floor amongst the table and the sofa, as if we\u2019re doing a s\u00e9ance. Our legs are crisscrossed as we face each other with an ordinary violet ribbon crystal ball between us. It\u2019s the teaching ball, he told me. He said that once I\u2019d been trained properly he\u2019d bring out the Ira, that it was too powerful to train on</p><p>He also told me that it would only be him and I going into The Underworld and that it wasn\u2019t possible to bring anyone with us besides Foreseers because they\u2019d need their own Seer energy. I asked if I could go alone and he said no. I honestly have no idea whether the words that come out of his mouth are true, but there\u2019s no real way to find out.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to go to The Underworld?\u201d he asks as he rotates the crystal ball in his hand.</p><p>I hesitate, not sure what to say. Lie. Probably not since he is going to end up finding out when he goes down to The Underworld with me. \u201cTo get my mom.\u201d</p><p>He glances up at me with inquisitiveness. \u201cI met her once. She disappeared quite a few years ago, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen years ago,\u201d I say, my voice uneven.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s where she ended up?\u201d Nicholas sets the ball down on the tile floor and it wobbles a little, rolling back and forth.</p> <p>I nod and wait for him to ask how she got there, but he never does and I wonder if he already knows, if maybe he saw it through a vision.</p><p>He spins the crystal ball on the floor. \u201cSo who\u2019s your father?\u201d</p><p>Good question. \u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly.\u201d</p><p>He quizzically raises his eyebrows as he slams his palm down on the crystal ball, stilling it. \u201cYou\u2019re not sure? How\u2019s that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen your mother refuses to tell anyone before she gets trapped in The Underworld,\u201d I reply dryly.</p><p>\u201cSo, for all you know, your father could have been some almighty and great Foreseer.\u201d He pauses and a mocking grin plays at his lips. \u201cYour father could be Dyvinius.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s disturbing. He\u2019s like sixty.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shrugs. \u201cYou never know. Some girls have a thing for older guys. Like you and Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only a few years older than me.\u201d I move my feet out of the way as the crystal rolls toward them. \u201cAnd how can you touch that thing without being sucked into it.\u201d</p><p>He presses two fingers to his temple, his lips curving upward. \u201cMental talent.\u201d</p><p>I let out a slow breath, tired of playing games. \u201cCan we just get on with this? The longer I\u2019m up here, the longer my mother\u2019s stuck down there.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me blankly, cupping the crystal in his hand. \u201cI want you to ask nicely first.\u201d</p><p>I bite down on my tongue. \u201cPretty please.\u201d</p><p>He drops the crystal onto the floor so hard I\u2019m surprised it doesn\u2019t break. \u201cSo, until we can get you going into and out of visions that you\u2019re intentionally trying to go into,\u201d he starts in a bored tone as if he\u2019s done this many times. \u201cThere\u2019s really no point in us trying to travel into The Underworld... One false move and we could end up in the bottom of the lake, where we\u2019d either drown or get taken to The Underworld by the Water Faeries which means we\u2019d be prisoners there\u2014we have to go in a specific way or we\u2019re in trouble. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cSo how does it work, exactly? We enter The Underworld through that ball. Then what?\u201d I lean back on my hands. \u201cHow do we get the Queen to let my mom go? And how do we get her to let us go? Wouldn\u2019t we just end up prisoners anyways?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cThe Queen can\u2019t keep us there\u2014it\u2019s the law that comes with using the Ira.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds kind of difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be,\u201d he says matter-of-factly. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a lot of power and control to pull it off, and I have no idea how you\u2019re going to get the Queen to let your mother go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d I mumble. \u201cBut I\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>He stretches his legs out in front of him. \u201cSure you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I stare down at the crystal ball only inches away from my feet. \u201cSo what do I do first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first thing that\u2019s going to happen is I\u2019m going to go into a vision with you,\u201d Nicholas explains, sitting up straight. He holds out his hand toward me as he carries the crystal ball in the other. \u201cGive me your hand so we can go into one together,\u201d he says. With reluctance, I take his hand, his skin clammy and cold against mine. \u201cGood, now we need a simple vision to go into. I think it would probably be best if you just thought of a memory. Maybe something from your childhood.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not simple at all. \u201cDoes it have to be from my childhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s simple, it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cOkay....\u201d I search for something simple to picture, but all I can see are broken images and darkness.</p><p>\u201cGemma, place your hand on the crystal ball,\u201d he instructs, growing impatient. \u201cAnd channel your energy.\u201d</p><p>A brief glimpse of my mother and me in a field flashes through my head and I reach out to touch the crystal ball in Nicholas\u2019s hand, but I pause. \u201cWait, how do I channel my energy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best way is to use your emotions, despite what Dyvinius says,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s quicker and easier, so whatever you\u2019re feeling right now, channel it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a little surprised at his answer, and suddenly, I begin to wonder if the appearance of my Foreseer ability came from the fact that I\u2019d started to experience so much emotion.</p><p>I do what he says and channel what I\u2019m feeling, which is a combination of irritation, fear, and longing. As soon as my skin brushes the glass, I\u2019m yanked forward into a tunnel of light. Nicholas clutches my hand and we sink and spin while it feels like I\u2019m being ripped apart. Finally, we reach the bottom and I immediately let go of Nicholas\u2019s hand.</p><p>I sigh in relief until I take in my surroundings. I\u2019m not in my past, but I think in the future, standing on the main street of Vegas beside a massive pirate ship. The busy city is no longer busy, instead it\u2019s dead quiet. A layer of glistening ice covers everything as if a million Death Walkers had marched through and breathed their Chill of Death on everything.</p><p>Just like they would if the portal opened up.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>I stand in the empty streets as shock seeps into my bones. This can\u2019t be right. It can\u2019t be. Because, if it\u2019s true, then the portal opens up. We don\u2019t save the world or the star and everything ends.</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d Nicholas\u2019s voice carries caution as if he can sense something\u2019s up.</p><p>I tear my eyes off the frozen streets and look over at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks, stuffing his hands into his pockets, examining me intently. \u201cYou\u2019ve been standing there staring at whatever it is you\u2019re seeing for over five minutes.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cI...um...\u201d I don\u2019t know what to say to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Nicholas glances around, even though he can\u2019t see anything. It\u2019s a rule of seeing visions: only the seer can see what\u2019s actually taking place.</p><p>To Nicholas everything looks blank and I envy him in a way. I want to erase the image from my mind so I can have my hope back; hope that the world can be saved.</p><p>The sky is gray and a frost-bitten wind gusts across streets, blowing snow all over the ground. The buildings still stand tall, though they\u2019re glazed with ice and some structures are cracking from the pressure.</p><p>\u201cGemma?\u201d Nicholas says, waving his hand in front of my face. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and blink. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>He raises his eyebrows at me. \u201cIf it\u2019s nothing, then why do you look like you just saw someone die?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to answer when a loud shriek cuts the air. The sound echoes, vibrating the ice, and my body goes rigid as the fog creeps out from the buildings.</p><p>\u201cI think we should go,\u201d I say, slipping backwards as I move away from the fog. \u201cI think something really bad is about to happen.\u201d</p><p>Seconds later, a herd of Death Walkers emerge from behind and inside the buildings. Their black cloaks are pulled over their heads, their skin rotting and mapped with bits of muscle as well as veins. Their eyes are like fireflies and their breaths are made of death as they march toward me.</p><p>Stay calm. Stay calm. \u201cCan we just go back to the house? Please.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas watches me as I walk backwards, trembling, remembering what the monsters can do. \u201cYou know whatever\u2019s out there can\u2019t harm you, right?\u201d he reminds me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I blink my eyes a few times, trying to takes us away, but it doesn\u2019t work. \u201cNicholas, quit being an ass and just take us back. I know they can\u2019t hurt me, but I don\u2019t want to see them,\u201d</p><p>Nicholas taps his finger on his lip, glancing in the direction of the Death Walkers, his shoes scuffing against the icy road as he takes a step forward and the fog winds around his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Whatever\u2019s scaring you, I think you should face it. It\u2019ll be good practice for when we go to The Underworld.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him, my heart thumping in my chest as the Death Walkers march closer. Fog twists around us, spinning in circles, clouding the buildings surround us. I hold my breath, backing away, but they move faster and end up hurrying by me, one by one. My breath fogs out in front of me as I stay as still as a statue with my arms tucked inward. Deep down, I know they can\u2019t touch or see me, however there\u2019s too much fear inside my body to risk otherwise.</p><p>They all manage to walk by me without so much as glancing in my direction and I\u2019m about to let out my breath when two tall men wearing black cloaks step out into the streets. The taller one with darker hair and eyes has a scar in his cheek and I immediately recognize him as Stephan. The shorter one with longer hair and a slouchier posture, though, I\u2019m not sure of.</p> <p>Their cloaks swish behind them as they stride toward me. Stephan carries something in his hand; something razor sharp and made of shimmering metal... The Sword of Immortality.</p><p>\u201cShit...\u201d I breathe. Nicholas starts yammering about something, but I zone out, watching the vision play out before me.</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t carry that around,\u201d the man says to Stephan as they walk down the middle of the road lined with frozen cars. \u201cIt makes me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me nervous when I\u2019m not carrying it around,\u201d Stephan replies, rotating the sword in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing that could end all of this.\u201d He gestures around at the frozen, desolate street. \u201cAnd this is what you wanted, isn\u2019t it Demetrius. To end the world and rule it.\u201d</p><p>Demetrius. Oh my God. Demetrius and Stephan together. I think deep down I knew this is how things would end up, but the question is why? Why did Stephan end up siding with him? Why did he start seeking the star for bad instead of protecting it? And how can I stop him from making all this happen?</p> <p>\u201cYes, but who is left to get ahold of it?\u201d Demetrius laughs as he swishes his cloak behind him. \u201cThe ice killed everyone off who was still left around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a few Keepers around who might try.\u201d Stephan says. \u201cDo you remember when Octavian made this after the vision was first seen?\u201d</p><p>Demetrius laughs again, throwing back his head. \u201cHe was so convinced that if he created it, I\u2019d never be able to pull off what he\u2019d seen. Too bad for him, he didn\u2019t see you coming. Jesus, Foreseers think they can see everything and make some sort of difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was the doing of my parents.\u201d Stephan touches the scar on his left cheek as they stop just short of where Nicholas and I stand. \u201cThey though if they cut off the mark, it would change things\u2014change who I was\u2013but they couldn\u2019t change the blood that runs through my veins, could they? Although, it did help keep my hidden from Octavian. Once the mark was gone, my part in it couldn\u2019t be seen.\u201d</p><p>The scar on his cheek is a mark that was cut off by his parents? I cringe at the idea, and then cringe again at the idea of what kind of mark would make a parent cut their child\u2019s face just to get rid of it.</p><p>\u201cThat mark is a gift,\u201d Demetrius tells Stephan as he turns to face him and reaches out to touch the blade of the sword in Stephan\u2019s hand. He pricks his finger on the end of the blade and smiles as he spills his blood on the snow below his feet. \u201cMy parents seemed to understand this\u2014understand who I am and what I was meant to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but your parents weren\u2019t Keepers,\u201d Stephan replies venomously as he wrenches the sword away from Demetrius\u2019s reach. \u201cMine were. In their eyes, to have a child who bears the mark was a disgrace, which is why they so stupidly tried to cut it off.\u201d His jaw sets tight as he stabs the sword into the ground and the ice cracks below the blade.</p><p>They continue to walk again, heading past us, and I turn to follow them with my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift,\u201d Demetrius says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been chosen since birth by the mark\u2014since before birth\u2014to free him and everyone else who was bound by his sentencing.\u201d He raises his hand in the air and his expression glazes over as he shuts his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd now we have,\u201d Stephan says thoughtfully as he lightly traces his finger down his scar.</p><p>\u201cYes, and now we have,\u201d Demetrius agrees, opening his eyes and lowering his hand to his side.</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d Nicholas says and I gasp, almost forgetting he is there.</p><p>I fling my hand over my mouth and hold my breath. Suddenly, Stephan stops, his head tilting to the side and he glances over his shoulder.</p><p>He holds up his hand, signaling for Demetrius to stop. \u201cJust a second.\u201d</p> <p>Demetrius pauses, his gaze sweeping the buildings. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, get us out of here,\u201d I hiss at Nicholas as Stephan starts walking back toward us.</p><p>Nicholas wavers. \u201cI don\u2019t know... I kind of like being alone with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d I hiss again, grabbing onto his arm. \u201cGet us out of here. Now.\u201d</p><p>Stephan\u2019s getting closer and I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. He\u2019s not supposed to be able to see or hear me, but I swear he can sense that I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Demetrius calls out, but Stephan doesn\u2019t reply as he continues moving toward us, grasping the sword as his eyes scan from side to side as if he\u2019s searching for something\u2014for us.</p><p>I dig my fingers into Nicholas\u2019s arm and jerk him closer to me. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in this vision that I\u2019m pretty sure can either see or sense that we\u2019re here and, if he can, then it\u2019s very, very bad.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen as he takes my hand, abruptly looking anxious. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I cast one last glance at Stephan as he picks up his pace, charging at us and I know something\u2018s very wrong. It doesn\u2019t look like he can see us because he\u2019s looking in the wrong direction, but he can obviously sense us.</p><p>\u201cNicholas...\u201d I say, tripping backwards as Stephan reaches out for me. I open my mouth to scream, but then Stephan abruptly stops.</p><p>He\u2019s only inches away from me and his eyes fasten right on mine as a slow smile curls up his lips. He touches the scar on his cheek with the tip of the knife, cutting a thin layer of skin off, and drawing blood. \u201cYou have it, too,\u201d he whispers, then his eyes divert to my upper arm.</p><p>My skin ignites as I\u2019m hauled backward, fading from the vision, but it\u2019s enough time to see it. The red and black triangular mark on my arm.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>I trip over my feet, but quickly regain my balance as I land back in Adessa\u2019s living room. The fear of what just happened still lingers in my body and has me gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d Nicholas asks with very little patience as he gets into my face. \u201cWho was in the vision?\u201d He still has ahold of my hand and I try to wrench it out of his, but he refuses to let me go. \u201cGemma, talk to me.\u201d He puts a hand on each of my shoulders and looks me directly in the eyes. \u201cTell me who it was that could sense us... It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>My chest heaves as I work to compose my breathing. \u201cWhy would anyone be able to sense us like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d He pauses, eyeing me over. \u201cBecause it means the vision has already been seen or told to the person who was in the vision.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not surprised. I know Stephan has been told visions of the future and how the world will end, which is why he was supposedly protecting the star. Now, though, it\u2019s beginning to make more sense. He wasn\u2019t protecting the star, he was holding onto it for himself.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you saw,\u201d Nicholas commands, roughly squeezing my shoulders. \u201cAnd tell me how you saw it. Normal Foreseers aren\u2019t able to just walk into other Foreseers\u2019 visions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go ask Laylen something.\u201d I duck out from his hands and head for the doorway.</p><p>He catches me by the arm and his fingernails pierce into my skin. \u201cWho was in the vision, Gemma? You need to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I don\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat I saw... it doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d</p><p>I tug my arm away from him and scurry out of the room. Nicholas doesn\u2019t follow me, surprisingly, but I\u2019m glad. I need to talk to Laylen alone. I find him in one of the rooms upstairs on a bed, reading a book. He\u2019s on his side, propped up on his elbow, his boots kicked up on the footboard. His legs are too long for the twin bed and he\u2019s nearly falling out of it.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, shutting the door, checking my skin in the light to make certain there\u2019s no symbol on my skin. Thankfully it\u2019s bare, the only thing there is a cluster of freckles. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He peers up from his book. \u201cHey, what\u2019s...\u201d He quickly sits up, shutting the book as he lowers his feet to the floor. \u201cWhat happened? You look upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething bad happened when we went into a vision.\u201d I drop down on the bed beside him. \u201cAnd Nicholas is getting suspicious that there might be something wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>Laylen sets his book down on the nightstand. \u201cYou think he knows about the star\u2019s power?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think he knows what exactly it is, only that there\u2019s something different about me and my Foreseer power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell as long as he doesn\u2019t know exactly what it is, then I think we\u2019re okay.\u201d Laylen pauses, sucking his lip ring into his teeth. \u201cAlthough, I\u2019m not really sure it\u2019s so great that he knows so much about you.\u201d</p><p>I nod in agreement, but then remember I have bigger problems to discuss than Nicholas. \u201cThere\u2019s something else I need to talk to you about... something I just saw in the vision.\u201d I shiver as I remember what I just left. \u201cLaylen, I think I just saw the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>It gets so quiet; I can hear the sound of our breaths and our hearts.</p><p>\u201cThe end of the world,\u201d Laylen whispers, rubbing a hand tensely down his face. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cCovered in ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the portal opens up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least from what I saw it does,\u201d I say. \u201cBut then again, Alex already told me another Foreseer told the same vision, which is the same thing Nicholas said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I always thought maybe he was lying,\u201d he mutters, staring the floor. \u201cBut I guess not... the portal opens and the world ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless we change it...somehow.\u201d I recollect the vision and Demetrius\u2019s conversation with Stephan. \u201cWhy would someone try to cut a mark off their child?</p><p>Laylen\u2019s head snaps up. \u201cWhy would you ask that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn the vision,\u201d I say. \u201cDemetrius and Stephan were talking and they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Laylen cuts me off, lifting his hand in front of us. \u201cHold on. They were there\u2014Demetrius and Stephan were there together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I give him a quick recap of what I\u2019ve just seen.</p><p>Laylen looks utterly shocked when I finish. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that the scar on Stephan\u2019s face used to be a mark? One that he was born with?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but what\u2019s the mark for?\u201d I ask. \u201cAnd why would his parents cut it off?\u201d</p><p>Laylen swallows hard, his throat muscles bobbing up and down. \u201cMaybe it was his Immortal mark... but I\u2019m not sure. From what I know, you have to have some sort of supernatural blood in you to bear the mark; such as Vampire.\u201d He glances down at the Mark of Immortality on his arm.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he is something,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd he\u2019s hiding it... maybe that\u2019s what the mark is.\u201d I pause, summoning the courage to ask. \u201cWhat exactly does a red and black triangle represent.\u201d</p><p>His face twists with puzzlement. \u201cI have no idea. I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing... why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I first saw it on Draven and then, when I blacked out, I saw it on me,\u201d I tell him, my voice shaking with my nerves. \u201cAnd then, just barely, when I was going out of the vision, Stephan stopped in front of me, touched the scar on his cheek, and told me I had one on me, too.\u201d My hands tremble as I fear what this all might mean. \u201cAnd when I looked down on my warm, it was there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d Laylen rubs his hand across his jawline, deliberating my words with worry lacing his demeanor. \u201cGemma, I honestly don\u2019t remember seeing it on Draven, either.\u2019</p><p>I touch my forearm. \u201cHe had it right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I missed it.\u201d He sounds unconvinced, though, and it makes me uneasy, like he either thinks I\u2019m crazy or is worried that there might be something wrong with me.</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a symbol of Immortality, could it? Maybe it\u2019s the one that makes him Immortal amongst the Immortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>I sit in silence, trying to figure out what it all means, not just with the symbol in question, but also with the future. The fact that Stephan wants to end the world, using me, and the fact that he can\u2019t be killed... what other option does this leave me with except that I\u2019ll end up being the person solely responsible for ending the world? And then what? I\u2019ll either die in the frozen streets or be killed with the use of the star\u2019s energy.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Laylen asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I sound hollow and I\u2019m not sure why. Yes, I just saw the end of the world, but Alex has told me about it before this. Still, he made it seem possible that we could stop it and now it doesn\u2019t seem realistic. I\u2019m going to be the thing that makes it happen.</p><p>\u201cGemma, we\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d he assures me, brushing his finger across my jawline. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to your mom and maybe she\u2019ll know something... how to stop Stephan. I mean, he put her in the lake for a reason. I can have Aislin look around to see if we can figure out what kind of marks there are that would be bad enough that someone\u2019s parents might cut it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I better get back to Nicholas and my training.\u201d I stand up from the bed and trudge for the door.</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d Laylen gets to his feet and trails behind me. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay? You\u2019ve been through a lot within the last few weeks. I\u2019m worried you\u2019re going to break apart.\u201d</p><p>I force a tight smile, letting the hollowness seep into my body. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I repeat and walk out. However, what I really want to say is that I think I\u2019m already broken.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>I\u2019ve started having this reoccurring nightmare, but it doesn\u2019t just happen at night. It goes on during the day as well. In it, my mom is begging me to help her, save her from the treacherous place she\u2019s been imprisoned in. Each time I can see The Underworld and what it looks like, a secret cave buried beneath the lake; a place sculpted out of rocks, mud, vines, and a home for water Fey that thrive on torturing. Every time I manage to make it there, to my mother, who\u2019s trapped in chains and secured to a wall. Yet, as soon as I come close to reaching her, the triangular mark appears on my arm and, instead of saving her, I suddenly want to kill her.</p> <p>When I wake up, I sometimes continue to feel the dark filling me.</p><p>This isn\u2019t my only problem. I also have to deal with Nicholas who is a pain in the ass. It\u2019s been two days of excruciating training, falling into and out of visions. I need a break from seeing things I don\u2019t want to see and I need a break from perverted Faeries. What I really want is for this to all be over and I\u2019m doing everything I can to make that happen, even if it means taking a risk or two.</p><p>Aislin and Laylen have been spending a lot of time together, looking through books and asking around about marks and the strange triangular symbol that no one seems to know about. Laylen even asked some of the Vampires if they knew that Draven had one and either they don\u2019t know or are denying it.</p><p>The biggest void is inside me, though, created from the absence of Alex and the electricity. Two days without it and I swear I\u2019m feeling more sluggish, less enthusiastic, and emotionally drained.</p><p>Nicholas and I are sitting on the black and white tile floor of Adessa\u2019s living room with a simple crystal ball between us. He\u2019s wearing stonewashed jeans, a green shirt that makes his golden eyes look brown, and his sandy hair is fluffed up at the top because he keeps messing with it. I have my hair down today because I couldn\u2019t find anything to put it up with and no makeup on as usual. My black shorts are too short while the purple and black striped tank top is a little too tight; both selected from the Black Angel themed wardrobe Aislin picked out for me.</p><p>\u201cTry again,\u201d Nicolas demandingly commands, motioning at the crystal ball. He\u2019s growing impatient and I\u2019m growing flustered, a bad combination.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I take a deep breath and extend my hand out to Nicholas, my other hand hovering over the crystal ball. \u201cStop being so bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t like it.\u201d Nicholas takes hold of my hand and unnecessarily intertwines our fingers, making my blood boil. \u201cDo you have an idea where you\u2019re going to take us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have an idea.\u201d I shut my eyes and brush my fingers across the cold glass of the crystal ball, knowing that what I\u2019m about to do is wrong. I need to know, though; I need to see her.</p><p>I pictured what I\u2019ve been seeing in my nightmares over and over again because I need to see if my mom is still my mom or if her sanity is too far-gone.</p><p>I need to know how it all ends.</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019d you take us?\u201d Nicholas rubs his hands together, appearing intrigued as he glances around. \u201cSomewhere good I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I\u2019m at-a-loss for words.</p><p>We\u2019re standing in a tunnel, the muddy walls dripping with musty water and moss. Vines hang from the ceiling and water flows below our feet. It looks much different from in my dreams, strangely more unrealistic than anything as if it was created from a haunting fairytale</p><p>\u201cI think I...I think we might be in The Underworld.\u201d</p><p>His face reddens with anger as he shuffles toward me. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to tell him that I\u2019m sorry, even though I\u2019m really not, when a shriek reverberates through the tunnel and my head snaps in the direction it came from.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Nicholas follows my line of gaze, even though he can\u2019t see anything. \u201cIs it a Water Faerie?\u201d</p><p>I squint through the darkness at something white. \u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d I move forward, straining my vision. \u201cIt\u2019s something white and wavy and... or more like Ghostly and boney...\u201d My face falls as I step back. \u201cShit, I think it is.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas tugs on the back of my shirt and pulls me to the side of the tunnel. He presses his back against the wall and then shoves me back by flattening an arm over my chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d I hiss. \u201cWe\u2019re in a vision, so they can\u2019t see us.\u201d</p><p>He quickly shakes his head, his wide eyes searching around us in terror. \u201cIt\u2019ll be able to sense I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater Faeries are Fey, so it\u2019ll be able to sense I\u2019m here because I\u2019m part Fey.\u201d He presses himself against the dirt wall as far as he can go with his hands flat out to his sides. \u201cAnd if it does....\u201d He shudders.</p><p>\u201cAnd if it does then what?\u201d I press, eyeing the Fey heading toward us. Its face is a skull, its fingers bone, and its feet are hidden by wispy pieces of fabric that brush against the dirt as it floats.</p><p>His chest descends as he releases a breath. \u201cLook, there are certain reasons\u2014rules\u2014that don\u2019t allow me down here. And I can\u2019t take us out of here, because I can\u2019t\u2014my Foreseer power is no use down here.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him, stepping away from the wall and moving in front of him. \u201cThen how did you ever plan on helping me save my mom?\u201d His silence says everything and I shake my head, putting my hands on my hips. \u201cYou weren\u2019t ever planning on it, were you?\u201d</p><p>More silence and I want to smack him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d I say, pacing the area in front of him \u201cYou know what, actually I can. Still, though.\u201d I huff in frustration, the prickle stabbing violently at the back of my neck while I feel like wrapping my fingers around his. \u201cYou are seriously the cruelest person I\u2019ve ever met... playing me like that... over my mother.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cYou should have known better than to believe someone like me.\u201d He glances down the tunnel as if he senses something. \u201cFerries are a tricky breed.\u201d</p><p>I look over at the water Faerie nearing us, and then return my attention to Nicholas with a dark look in my eyes. \u201cYou know what, I think I\u2019m just going to sit here and let it find you. You deserve it, you know, for messing with my head.\u201d</p><p>He scowls at me, but there\u2019s fear in his eyes. \u201cLook at you... you\u2019re starting to sound as cruel as me.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cBut only with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re new at this and you\u2019re going to lose,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d I question, pointing over my shoulder. \u201cBecause the water Faerie\u2019s right behind us.\u201d</p><p>His eyes snap wide and he takes off down the tunnel. Shaking my head, I run after him, leaving the water Faerie in the distance. He continues to run with me chasing at his heels until we reach a dead-end, the tunnel opening up onto a wide room carved out of rock. In the middle of the hollowed out space is a throne made of stone that has a back spiraling up to the ceiling like a slide.</p><p>Nicholas keeps running until he trips over his feet and I slow to a stop, I laugh at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, that was smooth,\u201d I say, staring down at him with my hands on my hips.</p><p>He glares at me, opening his mouth as he gets to his feet, but I hold my finger up as someone walks into the cave.</p><p>Her head is hung low, her brown hair tied in a bun on the top of her head, and she\u2019s wearing ratty pants with a t-shirt. She walks up to the throne and starts dusting it off with a white cloth. As she glances up, I catch the sight of her bright blue eyes. It\u2019s my mother.</p><p>I gasp. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholas brushes the dirt form his jeans as he steps up beside me. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom,\u201d I whisper, inching forward.</p><p>Moments later another woman enters the cave. She\u2019s wearing a long, elegant, white dress and her eyes are two sunken holes. Her frosty hair veils down her back and she holds her head high as she crosses the cave floor</p><p>My mom bows as she walks by her, and then backs away as the woman sinks into her throne. She has to be the Queen of The Underworld.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d The Queen\u2019s voice echoes out.</p> <p>\u201cI think Sarabella is bringing them in,\u201d my mom answers quietly with her head still bowed as she stands in front of the throne.</p><p>The Queen stares at the arched entryway of the cave. \u201cDoes anyone know why they\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>My mother shakes her head. \u201cThey haven\u2019t said anything yet.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas taps me on the shoulder, and demands for me to take us away, but I disregard him, my eyes are glued to the vision unfolding in front of me. When does this vision take place?</p><p>Another scream rings out and then a tall, thin-framed woman with the same frosted hair and pale skin as the Queen, strides into the cave accompanied by a tall, lean guy with messy brown hair and green eyes. On the other side of her is a brown haired, violet eyed me.</p><p>\u201cAlex and me...\u201d I gape. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p> <p>Alex remains close to me as we follow the woman across the cave and to the throne.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sarabella,\u201d the Queen says.</p><p>Sarabella smiles, her mouth a toothless hole. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome my Queen,\u201d she breathes, and then sweeps the tail of her white dress across the floor before she turns around, exiting the cave.</p><p>The Queen taps her fingers together, her eyes secured on Alex and me, her mouth set firmly in a line. \u201cSo, you two are the humans who dared to enter my world without my permission.\u201d Alex starts to speak, but the Queen holds up her hand. \u201cSilence. I do not want to hear your excuses. All that\u2019s important is that there are going to be consequences for what you\u2019ve done.\u201d She glances us over. \u201cYou look familiar,\u201d the Queen remarks to Alex. \u201cHave you been here before?\u201d</p><p>Alex shakes his head and intertwines his fingers through mine. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d The Queen\u2019s empty gaze bores into Alex. \u201cThere\u2019s something about you that\u2019s so...familiar.\u201d</p><p>Alex shakes his head again. \u201cI swear, I\u2019ve never been here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me then, why you\u2019ve entered my world?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>My mother steps out from behind the throne and the vision version of me smiles, my violet eyes lighting up with excitement.</p><p>\u201cFor her,\u201d Alex tells the Queen, giving a nod at my mother.</p><p>My mother stares robotically at us. \u201cI have no idea who they are, my Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know who you are,\u201d the Queen says with a grin.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Alex steps forward, pulling me with him. \u201cWe need to take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d the Queen roars, hammering her fist on the armrest of the throne. The ceiling shakes from the bellowing sound and pieces of loose rock fall to the ground. \u201cNo one ever leaves The Underworld. Ever! Something you probably should have considered before you entered here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe entered here in a way that you have no control over whether we get to leave or not,\u201d Alex says with an arrogant grin.</p><p>\u201cYou better watch your tone, boy,\u201d the Queen warns, leaning forward in the throne. \u201cI\u2019ve cut off the tongues of those who dared show such disrespect to me.\u201d But then her grin fades. \u201cWhich one of you is the Foreseer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Alex asks, discretely inching himself in front of me to block me out of the Queens restless gaze.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid with me, boy. The only way you could enter my world and still get out is by entering with the Ira, something that can only be used by a Foreseer. So, is it you? Or is it her?\u201d The Queen\u2019s gaze lands on the vision version of me. \u201cTell me, girl, what is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d I tell her in a surprisingly confident tone as I step forward.</p><p>\u201cGemma, would you please explain to me what your interest in this woman is?\u201d She gestures her hand at my mother who\u2019s knelt down on the ground.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...\u201d she trails off. \u201cWe just know her,\u201d</p><p>She glances at my mother. \u201cWhy would I let you take my best slave? Are you really that stupid? Did you really think you could simply walk in here and persuade me to hand over someone because you know her?\u201d</p><p>Alex reaches in the pocket of his jeans and retrieves a sparkly blue object. I shuffle forward into the cave, squinting to see what it is. I need to find out so that Alex and I can come do this exact same thing and free my mother, which is hopefully the end to this vision.</p><p>It\u2019s sparkling blue and I\u2019ve seen it before... somewhere. Oh my God. I saw it in the mysterious hideout. I was holding a large, sapphire gem and Alex took it from me and tossed in into a trunk. Is that what I need? When I come here to save her?</p><p>I\u2019m waiting to find out when Nicholas lurches up behind me and shoves me against the wall, his fingers wrapping around my throat. I\u2019d almost forgotten he was there and he takes me completely off guard.</p><p>\u201cTake me back,\u201d he demands, leaning into my face as his nails cut through my neck. \u201cOr I\u2019ll kill you where you stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d I choke as I shove my hands against Nicholas\u2019s chest, but it barely fazes him. I try to glance into the cave, but he tightens his grip and my air supply is nearly cut off.</p><p>\u201cTake. Us. Back.\u201d He demands. \u201cI swear to God, Gemma, if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Determined to win, I hold on for as long as I can, trying to watch what\u2019s going on in the cave, knowing that I\u2019m missing something important. As my vision starts to spot and I can feel myself verging to the point of blacking out and probably dying, I give up and blink us away, knowing there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ll never find out how it ends until I have to go through it in reality.</p><p>Whether we\u2019re able to free my mother or not will have to remain a mystery till then.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>As soon as we land in Adessa\u2019s living room, I take off in a mad sprint toward the doorway, but Nicholas grabs onto the back of my shirt and jerks me back. The force gives me whiplash and I trip backwards, landing on the floor hard.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Nicholas breathes hotly as he lowers himself down on top of me, trapping me on the floor beneath his body. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going anywhere until we get something straight.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to scream as I buck my body beneath his weight, but he slaps his hand down on my mouth and places his arm over my neck so my airflow is limited. I raise my arm up and elbow him in the ribs, yet he only laughs.</p><p>\u201cNice try,\u201d he says, bending down to bring his face closer to mine \u201cBut it\u2019s going to take a lot more effort than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you! You\u2019re a liar and the cruelest person I know!\u201d I attempt to scream against his hand as I lift my leg managing to kick him pretty hard in the shin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d He releases his arm from my neck, infuriated, and slaps a hand across my cheek. My skin stings and my ears ring while he grins wickedly. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I could do this all day,\u201d he says. \u201cIn fact, I think I might take you back home with me and tie you to the bed for a while.\u201d He presses his nose to my cheek and smiles at me. \u201cGod, the things I could do to you.\u201d</p><p>Panicking, I bite down on his hand, sinking my teeth into his clammy skin. He lets out a high-pitched shriek and his grip loosens enough to allow me to get my leg up a little and I quickly knee him between the legs as hard as I can. He cries out in pain, his face reddening as he falls to the side, grabbing his manly parts.</p><p>I slip out from under him and run for the doorway. \u201cLaylen!\u201d I shout.</p><p>Nicholas staggers to his feet and chases after me. I feel his fingers graze my back right as I step up the stairs and then suddenly he\u2019s wrenching me back toward him again by the back of my shirt. I fall on my knees on the first stair and slam my head against the wooden step.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d I scream, clawing my way away from him as my head throbs. \u201cGoddammit let me go!\u201d</p><p>Laylen appears at the bottom step as if out of thin air. He takes one quick look at Nicholas lying on top of me as I try to crawl my way up the stairs and grabs Nicholas by the back of the neck, prying him off me. I skitter to the side of the banister as Laylen shoves Nicholas down to the floor on his back.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever touch her again,\u201d Laylen stands over him, \u201cI\u2019ll fucking break your legs off.\u201d</p><p>I could hug Laylen right now and maybe in a few minutes I will. I work to catch my breath as I cup the bottom of my neck that I\u2019m sure is going to have fingertip sized bruises on it when morning rolls around.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Laylen glances over my body, shaking his head at the wounds on my neck.</p><p>I nod, rubbing my cheek that Nicolas slapped. \u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fucking kill him,\u201d Laylen says when he sees my swollen cheek, and then he turns back to Nicholas.</p><p>As Laylen reaches for Nicholas he rolls to the side and hops to his feet before running into the living room. He stands in the corner, putting the crystal ball into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you even think about it!\" Laylen runs for him, knocking over the sofa as he leaps over it.</p><p>Laylen lands only feet away from him, Nicholas winks at me, and then evaporates from the living room, taking the Ira and my ticket to The Underworld\u2014and my mother\u2014with him.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>After Nicholas leaves with the Ira, Laylen makes us some coffee and we sit down in the kitchen while I explain to him in detail what happened, not just with the vision, but how Nicholas isn\u2019t even supposed to be in The Underworld and he was pretty much playing us all along for God knows what reason.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Laylen mumbles, shaking his head. \u201cWhy would he go through all that trouble to hang around here if he was never planning on taking you there? It\u2019s such a waste of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he did get that invisibility powder stuff out of it, but still... he got that in the beginning so why stick around?\u201d I shake my head, feeling so Goddamn frustrated and powerless. My head and cheek are swollen, and I\u2019m so damn jittery it\u2019s ridiculous. \u201cAnd I never got the Ira... yet I know we get in there somehow.... I saw Alex and myself in The Underworld trying to save my mom, so there\u2019s got to be a way to do it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laylen contemplates while fiddling with his lip ring, twisting it back and forth. \u201cAlex was there...\u201d He takes a sip of his coffee, dazing off into space. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s where we need to start, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Alex?\u201d I give him a quizzical look as I take a gulp of coffee from my mug and the warm liquid spills down my throat, soothing my insides. \u201cBut he\u2019s in the City of Crystal and I\u2019m not sure how to get him out of there since I have no idea what he\u2019s doing down there.\u201d</p><p>He tenses. \u201cWell, with what you saw, he kind of has to be here to make it happen. He also has to have that gem you saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich, from what my memories are telling me, Alex and I had once in a hideout hidden in the forest, but I don\u2019t know exactly where it is because my memories haven\u2019t connected that part yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlex should know, though,\u201d Laylen points out. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope the gem\u2019s still there.\u201d</p><p>I frown as I set my mug on the table. \u201cThe frustrating thing is that Alex is in the City of Crystal for pretty much no reason.\u201d</p><p>Laylen shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not completely true. Because of Nicholas\u2019s involvement, you now know that you need to have the Ira to get into The Underworld. It just sucks that he has it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I mutter and sip on my coffee.</p><p>Laylen adds a spoonful of sugar to his coffee and stirs it. \u201cI say we start with Alex and get him back here. Then we\u2019ll make a plan to get the Ira and the gem. We just need to find a way to get into the City of Crystal.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of going there again doesn\u2019t make me happy, but saving Alex does. So does the idea that he and I will be going into The Underworld to save my mother, even if she did look completely hollow, I still have hope that somehow, through all this, she\u2019ll come back to me and be able to help figure out what Stephan\u2019s up to. Or maybe, if I\u2019m lucky, get the star\u2019s energy out of me.</p><p>I set the cup down and take a deep breath. \u201cI can probably get us into the City of Crystal, but I\u2019ll need one of those ruby-filled crystal balls Nicholas is always using.\u201d</p><p>Laylen cocks his head to the side. \u201cYou think you\u2019ve learned enough about your power to be able to do that?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, pretending to be casual, although on the inside I\u2019m terrified that I won\u2019t be able to do it or I\u2019ll mess something up. If I can\u2019t get it right, then what? My mom and Alex stay trapped wherever they are. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>Laylen gets up from the chair, deeply thinking as he takes our empty mugs over to the sink. He rinses them off and turns around, leaning against the counter. \u201cI know someone who probably has a lot of them.\u201d</p><p>I get up from the chair. \u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>He gives me a small smile. \u201cThe person who owns the house we\u2019re staying in. I think she\u2019s got a whole room full of crystal balls.\u201d</p><p>Laylen was right. Adessa does have a whole room full of crystal balls and she more than willingly lets us into it. I have the suspicion, though, that Laylen might be messing around with her emotions since at first Adessa seems reluctant, then suddenly she\u2019s all too happy about the idea of taking us into the room concealed behind the shelves lining the walls of her store.</p><p>Once we\u2019re in it she begins searching the seemingly endless amount of shelves that line the walls from front to back. Every time she dips down to look at the bottom row on the shelf her braided hair that runs halfway down her back brushes against the concrete floor. She\u2019s also wearing heels with a patterned dress that make clicking sounds as she walks around and the noise reverberates around the room deafeningly.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need this?\u201d she asks, sliding a few jars and unique figurines out of the way.</p><p>I open my mouth to explain our dilemma to her, but Laylen shakes his head, exchanging a secretive glance with me as I pick up a strange looking clay eye. \u201cGemma just needs to look at one, for her training.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows dip down as I set the clay eye back on the shelf. I don\u2019t get why he\u2019s being so secretive with her when it\u2019s obvious that she\u2019s helping us.</p><p>Laylen crosses the narrow room and stops beside me. \u201cWe need to be careful who we tell,\u201d he says. \u201cAdessa doesn\u2019t know about you, Stephan, or the star.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Adessa as she wanders to the back section of the room and then I lean into Laylen. \u201cWhy does she think we\u2019re staying with her?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugs, collecting up a two-headed horse statue from the shelf, and peeks under the bottom like he\u2019s checking for a price sticker. \u201cI just told her we needed help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I do, but it\u2019s always better to be careful.\u201d</p><p>I nod as he sets the statue down. \u201cYou know what, you\u2019re right. I need to start working on doing the same... I let Nicholas know too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he has the power to fuck with your head,\u201d Laylen tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s always running around in circles and talking in vague sentences. It confuses people and makes it easy to slip up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I need to work on it,\u201d I insist. \u201cRegardless of how tricky he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I found it,\u201d Adessa declares and we look in her direction as she walks toward us, carrying a miniature crystal ball with rubies floating in it. Red rays of light shimmer around the tiny storage area as the ceiling lights reflect against the glass.</p><p>Adessa offers me a small smile as she gives the crystal ball to me and I try not to grin as I take it from her because, for the first time, things actually seem like they\u2019re going to be easy.</p><p>I spoke too soon. Way too soon. Yes, we got the crystal ball, but using it is turning out to be a pain in the ass. After Adessa gives us the crystal, Laylen and I return to the living. We ask Aislin to join us, figuring we all should go to The Underworld together because there\u2019s power in numbers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d I shake the crystal ball like a magic eight ball and on the inside the rubies swirl in a funnel. \u201cI\u2019ve gone into a crystal ball completely by accident, but this feels impossible.\u201d</p><p>Aislin flips the page of the book she has opened up on her lap and tucks a strand of her golden brown hair behind her ear. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a lot more marks that I\u2019m sure a lot of people would want to remove. However, there\u2019s nothing on this mysterious triangular symbol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Laylen agrees. \u201cI can\u2019t even think of one off the top of my head. Usually they appear later in life or something happens and they...\u201d He drifts off, stretching his arm out on his lap and staring down at the Mark of Immortality.</p><p>Aislin glances up from the book and gives a fleeting glance at the mark. Then, looking guilty, she quickly sets the book down on the table between the three of us. \u201cI\u2019m going to go up to the library and get another book.\u201d She stands to her feet. \u201cThis one\u2019s getting me nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdessa has a library?\u201d I ask after Aislin leaves.</p><p>Laylen bends his arm back and wraps it around his stomach so his mark is hidden. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s up in the attic. Nothing too fancy, but there\u2019s a lot of books. The problem is that most of them stick strictly to the Wiccan history and there\u2019s not much about other marks in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of book do you think you\u2019d need for something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019d go with a Keeper\u2019s book, since Stephan\u2019s a Keeper and a lot of the Keepers\u2019 history is mixed with other marks. In fact, there was once a mark of evil. It had a different name, but that\u2019s pretty much what it stood for. It was directly related to the Keepers\u2019 blood. I think the man who had it, though, died or something and it killed all the bloodlines linked to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think it\u2019s extinct?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He nods. \u201cYeah, from what I\u2019ve been taught it is.\u201d</p><p>I set the crystal ball down on the apothecary table and give it a good spin, causing the rubies to clink against the glass. \u201cI can\u2019t even feel any energy from it.\u201d</p><p>Laylen reaches for the crystal ball. \u201cDid Nicholas say anything while he was training you?\u201d He scoops it up and turns it in his hand. \u201cLike maybe there\u2019s some magic words,\u201d he teases, but he looks sullen, which is exactly how I feel. The more time we\u2019re up here messing around with this thing, the more time everyone stays trapped. It\u2019s also more time that the star remains inside me, which means the more time the Death Walkers and Stephan remain at our heels.</p><p>\u201cWhen he was training me with the regular Foreseer crystal ball, he said something about channeling emotions,\u201d I say. \u201cThat it would help.\u201d</p><p>Laylen encounters my gaze and we exchange a penetrating look before our concentration focuses on the crystal in his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to try, right?\u201d he asks, peering up at me.</p><p>I waver because it might not hurt to try, but it could hurt for me to channel up certain emotions around him. Sure, things have been okay lately, but I\u2019m still concerned that the tie I felt with him will surface.</p><p>He pats the sofa. \u201cCome sit down by me. Let\u2019s see if we can try something.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m nervous, but I still get up and meander around the table to the couch, dropping down beside him. \u201cWhat emotion should we aim for?\u201d</p><p>I tuck my hands underneath my legs and shrug, anxious over how many ideas pop into my mind, ranging from an orgasmic feeling to an idyllic state of rapture. \u201cYou pick one.\u201d</p><p>He dithers, his eyes all over me, then ultimately he sweeps my hair off my shoulder. \u201cWe could go for calm because I really do think you need it, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to channel up much energy.\u201d</p><p>I tense as he inclines inward toward me until his chin lightly grazes my shoulder. \u201cI agree...\u201d I lose my voice as his lips gently caress my skin.</p><p>\u201cI really tried,\u201d he whispers hoarsely. \u201cI know I should stay away... and there\u2019s Aislin... and so many other reason, but God you smell so good... I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about your scent since I tasted your blood.\u201d He breathes a path up my shoulder, heading toward my neck.</p><p>My head falls to the side. All this time I\u2019ve been so curious to know what it feels like to be bit and now, well, I sort of regret it. Yet I can\u2019t go back from what\u2019s already happened.</p><p>I slip my hands out from under my legs and grip onto his legs as his lips move across my skin, hardly touching yet it\u2019s enough to send flutters throughout my body. It feels so wonderful, to the point that it steals my breath away, and I end up gasping for air.</p><p>He groans and then drops the crystal ball onto my lap so his fingers can find my waist. \u201cWe should stop...\u201d he trails off as he presses his nose into the arch of my neck.</p><p>My eyes slip shut and I start to helplessly fall into his arms. \u201cWe should....\u201d I agree, telling my body to move away, but I feel the prickle poke at the back and I know I need to let whatever\u2019s emerging make an appearance.</p><p>I hold my breath and wait as Laylen\u2019s fingers reach my rib cage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wait as his mouth heads for my lips.</p><p>I wait until a vile sensation builds inside my stomach.</p><p>I wait until I can feel it, the heavy weight crashing upon my chest, pressing me down\u2014the weight of my guilt.</p><p>I gasp, realizing just how wrong this is and that I shouldn\u2019t be doing this, not when I have feelings for Alex and Aislin has feelings for Laylen.</p> <p>\u201cThis is wrong,\u201d I say and start to lean away when I feel the hot energy surging through my bloodstream like liquid fire \u201cI think I...I...\u201d My body goes limp as something deep within me roars. There\u2019s a rough tug and I hold onto Laylen\u2019s hand as he moves his mouth away from me. I hear him say something, but then we\u2019re sucked away into the crystal ball, falling down, down, down into the unknown.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>I manage to land somewhat gracefully, catching myself with a very minor stumble and Laylen lands effortlessly beside me, gripping onto my hand. We\u2019re standing in a cave with charcoal ceilings and a translucent crystal floor. A midnight river with bits and pieces of gold in it flows beneath the floor. Maroon crystals hang from the ceiling and rubies wave across the snow-white walls.</p><p>\u201cIs this the City of Crystal?\u201d Laylen asks in awe as he glances around.</p><p>I shake my head in disbelief as I put the crystal ball into my pocket. \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect to actually get us here... but this has to be it. I mean, I haven\u2019t been in this area before.\u201d I slip my fingers from Laylen\u2019s and stroll up to the wall, feeling the smoothness of the porcelain. \u201cBut where else could we be?\u201d</p> <p>Laylen strides up to the side of me and picks at a chipped section in the wall. \u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>I step back, looking from left to right. Each side is the same, paved with broken multicolored pieces of glass, but the one to my right heads toward a bridge. Beside the path is an edge that leads to a very short drop off.</p><p>\u201cThe question is, which way?\u201d I say. \u201cAnd what are we even looking for exactly?\u201d</p><p>He studies both directions, his head turning from left to right. \u201cI just want to say first, that it\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not pretty?\u201d</p><p>He locks eyes with me. \u201cWhere Alex is.\u201d</p> <p>I swallow the lump forming in my throat. \u201cWhy? Where is he?\u201d</p><p>He circles around me and then drapes an arm around my shoulder. Guilt immediately soars through me from his touch because I want him to touch me more intimately. \u201cThere\u2019s this crystal ball in the center of the city that channels the energy to all the other crystals. That\u2019s where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the crystal ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, outside it.\u201d</p><p>I pull a perplexed face. \u201cSo what\u2019s the point of him being down here, then?\u201d</p><p>He tugs on my shoulder and guides me closer to him and I have the strangest compulsion to ask him to let me go, yet conflicted by my desire, I keep my lips sealed. \u201cThe crystal ball uses human energy to fuel it,\u201d he explains.</p><p>I crane my neck, tipping my chin up, and meet his blue eyes. \u201cWhat? And no one bothered to mention this to me?\u201d</p><p>He offers me an apologetic look. \u201cAlex had his reasons for doing it, I\u2019m sure. He wanted to help you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut not like this,\u201d I say, shaking my head. \u201cNot by fueling a crystal ball. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d My heart aches inside my chest, not just at the multiple ideas of what exactly is required to fuel a crystal ball, but also because the electricity has been missing for days now and I desperately miss it for reasons I both do and don\u2019t understand.</p><p>Laylen searches my eyes with a creased forehead and then he removes his arm from around me. \u201cWe should get looking for him.\u201d He veers toward the left, away from the bridge. \u201cIt\u2019s a big city and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to take a lot of time.\u201d</p><p>We walk in silence for a while, following the glass path. He looks like something\u2019s really troubling him and, despite the fact that I don\u2019t want to admit it, I think I might know what it is.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to open my mouth and tell him that we should probably talk about what we\u2019re feeling because it\u2019s getting really complicated\u2014at least for me\u2014when I detect the sound of approaching footsteps.</p><p>Laylen and I freeze simultaneously then we whirl around, looking behind us to where the noise is coming from.</p><p>\u201cIs someone coming?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Motioning his hand at me, he scoots us over to the side of the path, where we step off the ledge and down onto a frosty blue, smooth surface that\u2019s as slippery as ice. He takes my hand, and we hurry over to one of the short pillars rising out of the ground and point up at the top. We cower down behind it and hold our breaths as we wait.</p><p>The longer we wait, though, the quieter it gets. Finally, Laylen ducks his head low and, placing his fingers on the ground he peeks around the side of the pillar.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s there,\u201d he hisses.</p><p>\u201cThey must have gone somewhere else,\u201d I whisper, hovering over him to look for myself.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d show up here,\u201d Nicholas breathes in my ear.</p><p>Every single one of my nerve endings tingle and my back stiffens as I jolt away from his nearness. I end up landing on Laylen\u2019s back. Luckily, he\u2019s strong and he flips us around, grabbing my hand, and pulling us to our feet.</p><p>I start to spin around toward the Faerie, when he grabs me by the waist and an overwhelming floral sent stenches up the air.</p><p>\u201cTry anything funny,\u201d Nicholas hauls me against him, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have you out of here before you can even take your next blink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I say and bend my arms up so my fingers reach his hands, then I aim them downward and dig hard.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t so much as budge. \u201cFeisty, I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d Laylen says calmly as he stations himself in front of us with his arms slightly out to the side. \u201cLet her go now before you end up getting hurt\u201d</p><p>He spurts a laugh. \u201cHurt me how? I can have us out of here before you even take your next step.\u201d Keeping one arm secured around my waist, he holds up a crystal ball filled with rubies.</p><p>Laylen steps forward, but then halts, debating what to do.</p><p>\u201cWise choice,\u201d Nicholas says, putting the crystal ball into his pocket and then wrapping both his arms around me. Our bodies are aligned completely and I can feel things that I really don\u2019t want to feel... bulging in certain places. It\u2019s disgusting and vomit burns at the back of my throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Laylen asks with his hands just to the side of him. He appears composed, but I can see that he\u2019s flexing his fingers, as though he\u2019s considering taking a hit at Nicolas. He could probably reach him in a few more steps, the pillar being the only thing between us. However it\u2019s still enough time for Nicholas to take us out of here and the last thing I want to do is end up alone somewhere with him.</p><p>Sliding his hand up my ribs and then my neck, he sketches a finger across my cheek. \u201cI have what I want right here.\u201d He dips his mouth next my ear. \u201cAre the nightmares getting worse?\u201d he breathes, stroking my upper arm. \u201cCan you see the symbol clearly?\u201d</p><p>I go rigid. \u201cW-What?\u201d</p><p>He laughs against my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for this,\u201d Laylen says in a low tone that conveys so much warning it actually sends a chill down my spine.</p><p>Nicholas strengthens his hold on me, his chest rising and falling as it repeatedly crashes against my back. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try, you pathetic excuse for a Vampire. You can\u2019t even bring yourself to drink blood.\u201d</p><p>Laylen\u2019s lips expand to a slow grin. \u201cWant to bet?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re so enter\u2014\u201d</p><p>Laylen launches forward so fast he\u2019s nothing except a blur and, seconds later, Nicholas is jerked from my grasp. Laylen doesn\u2019t bite him, but he does bring his fist up against the side of his head and knock him out cold. Nicholas\u2019s body slumps to the ground and Laylen steps back, wiping the sweat off his forehead.</p><p>His fangs descend and then retract as if he\u2019s deciding whether he wants to bite him. Then choosing not to, he slumps over, grabs onto Nicholas\u2019s arms, and drags him behind the pillar.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I ever want to do is taste his foul blood,\u201d He says, standing upright.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d I pause, watching Nicholas\u2019s chest rise and fall as he sleeps off Laylen\u2019s punch. I can\u2019t help thinking about what he whispered moments before Laylen leapt on him, though. How did he know? Not just about the nightmares, but about the symbol? \u201cWe should probably hurry before he wakes up.\u201d</p><p>Laylen nods and then takes my hand as we head back to the path. We walk for what seems like an eternity and the more time that passes, the more worried I get that someone\u2019s going to discover us. I\u2019m starting to get discouraged, which is a horrible feeling, when I feel it. A spark. It\u2019s soft at first, like a delicate kiss, but it increases in intensity the further we continue to go down the path until finally my body is drowning in heat.</p><p>\u201cAlex is close,\u201d I whisper, glancing around at the walls and floor. \u201cI can feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Laylen asks, studying me with a mystified expression.</p><p>I\u2019m completely engulfed in feeling it again, so welcoming and familiar. I\u2019ve never had familiar before and it makes me feel content. \u201cI can feel him through the electricity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe electricity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a story for another time.\u201d I tug on his hand as I start to speed up down the path. \u201cNow come on. We have to hurry.\u201d</p><p>We run, following the invisible current of electricity, going further into the cave. With each step, the current grows and becomes more charged and at the same time I become more eager and excited. God, I\u2019ve missed this. I\u2019ve never really missed something before and knowing I\u2019m going to have it back soon pumps adrenaline through my body at a toxic dose.</p><p>By the time we reach a door, the current is flowing so powerfully that I know Alex has to be behind it. I\u2019m actually shaking from the energy coursing through me, it owns me, consumes me, possesses me to the point that nothing else matters.</p><p>I need to feel more of it.</p><p>I need to see Alex.</p><p>What I need is to feel like I\u2019m breathing again.</p><p>I let go of Laylen\u2019s hand, turn the door handle, and push the door open, starting to smile. However, what\u2019s on the other side makes my mouth turn back down and my stomach churn. All the excitement evaporates and my eagerness alters to paralyzing fear.</p><p>There\u2019s a massive crystal ball about the size of a football stadium flaring brightly within the enormous space of the cave. Attached to the crystal, solely by chains, are people. Alex is front and center, chains wrapped around him from head to toe, binding him to the crystal ball.</p><p>And he looks dead.</p><p>All of them do.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>They\u2019re all dead. Alex is dead. I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t live.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Gemma.\u201d Laylen\u2019s voice is soothing, yet distant. I feel my legs turning into rubber and the room begins to sway. \u201cThey\u2019re not dead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I straighten my legs back up. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d I choke out while I stare at Alex\u2019s slackened body; his shirt\u2019s off and his jeans hang loosely at his hips. His head is tipped down so all I can see is his hair. Is he awake? Dead? Alive? \u201cThey look... he looks dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure. The crystal\u2019s collecting energy from them,\u201d he explains, his hand brushing my back. \u201cIf they were dead, they wouldn\u2019t be useful.\u201d</p><p>I nod and then I\u2019m running to Alex at a pace I didn\u2019t even know I was capable of. When I get closer, I realize that not only are chains securing him to the crystal ball, but so are tubes. They\u2019re embedded all over his body, sucking his life and blood.</p><p>I immediately start pulling the tubes out of his skin. \u201cLaylen, can you break through these chains?\u201d I ask as he moves up beside me. With each tube I remove, a hole and blood trail is left on Alex\u2019s skin. They\u2019re not too deep, though with so many, they have to be painful.</p> <p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Laylen says, gripping onto the chains.</p><p>Alex\u2019s eyelids suddenly shoot open and my breath catches. His normally bright green eyes are dull and he looks incredibly weak. I\u2019ve never seen Alex look so weak. It is strange and heartbreaking as well as completely disconcerting. It makes me realize how much I like the confidence he portrays most of the time and how safe it makes me feel. I realize a lot of things at that moment; about me, about him, about us. I can feel something shifting inside me; chains breaking, my body drifting closer to him and farther from another.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, cupping his cheek.</p><p>He opens his mouth to speak, but no sound comes out and his head bobbles around, like his neck is too weak to support it.</p><p>Laylen bends the metal links and snaps the chains like twigs. I reach up to help Alex and he falls onto me like a hundred and eighty pound bag of bricks. I almost buckle to the floor, but Laylen catches him and supports the majority of his weight.</p> <p>\u201cExcellent catching skills,\u201d Laylen jokes, flopping Alex\u2019s arm over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey, I never claimed to have them,\u201d I protest, grunting as I attempt to carry some of Alex\u2019s weight. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m not a half-Vampire, half-Keeper who is freakishly strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you two stop joking around,\u201d Alex says with a smidgeon of humor in his voice as he leans against me and I slip his free arm around my waist. \u201cCan you get us out of here before we get caught?\u201d</p><p>I start to retrieve the crystal ball from my pocket, but Alex shakes his head and then nods at the massive crystal ball exploding with energy, a enormous glowing orb radiating around the pallid, seemingly lifeless people. \u201cDon\u2019t use your power too close to this... it could kill you.\u201d</p><p>I nod and we head for the door, Alex dragging his feet as we walk. Laylen holds up most of Alex\u2019s weight and we move quickly, distancing ourselves from the gigantic crystal ball. Once we\u2019re a safe distance away, I retrieve the crystal ball from my pocket while Alex works to hold himself up and gather his own balance. Laylen grabs onto my arm and I touch Alex, making sure they both go with me.</p><p>I\u2019m getting ready to shut my eyes when the glass of the crystal frosts over with flakes of crisp ice. I hear a crackle moments later and I glance up just in time to see a stampede of black-cloaked Death Walkers storming our way, glazing the land with a sheet of ice and rapidly dropping the temperature to well below freezing.</p> <p>I start to shake and chatter, the electricity simmering to a murmur as they ascend toward us, their yellow eyes glowing fiercely.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Laylen says when he turns and notices them. \u201cGemma, get us out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m t-trying,\u201d I chatter as I fight to hold my hand steady, noting the tint of blue my skin is taking on. The Chill of Death. I\u2019ve experienced it once and I don\u2019t want to ever experience it again.</p><p>As I attempt to find my energy and some sort of emotion to feed off of, I spot a blond haired, golden-eyed half-Faerie in the midst of the Death Walkers. Traitor! Not only does he play us, but now he\u2019s also siding with evil.</p><p>I grasp tighter to Alex as his skin starts turning and alarming shade of purple. He\u2019s too fragile, even with his Keeper blood, to withstand the cold and I need to get us out of here. I shut my eyes and picture Adessa\u2019s living room, the purple velvet couches, the strange figurines everywhere, and the black and white checkerboard floor. Then I let my mind and body sync with the faint spark still thriving between Alex and me. It\u2019s so weak, yet the emotions it brings out of me are more potent than any other emotion I\u2019ve ever felt.</p><p>I want to hold him. Make him feel better. Kiss him. Touch him. Breathe in his scent. Feel him rocking inside me, being part of me, being connected with me in every way possible.</p><p>\u201cGemma...\u201d Laylen\u2019s voice is full of fear and panic. \u201cJesus, please...\u201d</p><p>I hear a sharp noise like a thousand glass cups shattering against concrete and I open my eyes. Fragments of porcelain crack apart from the ground and fly through the air, unable to withstand the pressure of the ice.</p> <p>My eyes open wider as the porcelain rushes towards us in a wave of sharp glass, the ground breaking apart. I hear Alex and Laylen shout out my name as the pillars snap in half and topple over, slamming against the ground and bursting across the ground.</p><p>We\u2019re running out of time and soon we\u2019re going to be sucked into the floor or taken out by the Death Walkers who are managing to avoid the opening with little effort, their feet hovering over the floor. Nicholas has disappeared and I wonder if he has gotten sucked down into the hole that\u2019s forming.</p><p>Alex suddenly slides his arm off Laylen. Laylen continues to watch the wave of glass roaring closer to us with wide eyes as Alex limps toward me. My heart rate starts to still, my breath suffocating as my blood pressure drops with the temperature.</p><p>My breath puffs out in a cloud and envelops my face as Alex places a hand on each of my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cPretend they\u2019re not there,\u201d he says. \u201cPretend it\u2019s just you and me and no one else.\u201d</p><p>The look in his eyes and the delicacy in his words send a torrent of calmness through my body along with the desire to be near him. I can feel us being magnetized together as my body and mind connecting with the energy of the crystal.</p><p>I reach out and find Laylen\u2019s arm as Alex continues to hold onto my face. I think I\u2019ve done it, but a set of bony, stone cold fingers seize hold of my arm and the energy is blown out by a vapor of cold.</p><p>I scream as the Death Walker wrenches on me and my Foreseer power counters, strengthening. I feel like I\u2019m going to rip apart and I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m still holding onto Laylen and Alex. My body becomes numb, brittle, tired, and worn.</p><p>I let out another scream as images pound through my head. Mountains... Adessa\u2019s... desert... snow... lake.</p><p>They move so fast I lose complete control and disappear into the midst of them.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>When I open my eyes again, I\u2019m lying face first in a field of grass. I push up, brush the dirt off my legs and arms, and then glance around at the lake, the cloudy sky, and the shallow hill as well as the stony castle near the horizon.</p><p>I start to walk forward, wondering where everyone else is when Laylen rises from the grass. His blond hair shimmers in the sunlight snaking through the cracks in the clouds.</p><p>\u201cJesus, how the hell did we get here,\u201d he says then makes a repulsed face when he spots the grey stone castle towering in the distance. \u201cAnd why here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I say, stepping in front of him, the grass circling around us. \u201cI lost control or something... the Death Walkers\u2019 ice was making my power shaky.\u201d I shield my eyes with my hand and glance around at the field and then the trees. \u201cWhere\u2019s Alex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here.\u201d Alex coughs. He stands up in the grass just a little ways away from us and then hobbles toward us. There are dark circles under his eyes and he, of course, still doesn\u2019t have a shirt on. The holes in his skin are more defined and his Keeper\u2019s Mark is bright against his somewhat pale skin. His brown hair is damp with sweat and he looks like he\u2019s about to hurl.</p><p>He spits in the grass and then hunches over, bracing his hands on his knees when he reaches us. \u201cWhat the hell happened back there? And why was Nicholas with the damn Death Walkers in the City of Crystal?\u201d</p><p>I can tell he\u2019s in a lot of pain. I\u2019ve never really understood compassion or giving comfort. I went years and years without being touched, feeling nothing, and then when I finally did, I was too old and all of my emotions left me confused. However I step forward and start rubbing Alex\u2019s back, tracing my fingers up and down his spine. Laylen tries to ignore the fact as much as possible, but I catch him noting it. Alex tenses momentarily, but then his muscles unravel as he embraces and melts into my affection.</p><p>\u201cIt might have something do to with the fact that Nicholas was playing us.\u201d I sketch a line up and down his spine. \u201cHe never even intended to help me get to The Underworld\u2014he\u2019s not even supposed to be there, which means he\u2019s pretty much been lying and will probably continue to lie about everything. He could have been working with the Death Walkers this entire time.\u201d</p><p>Alex elevates his head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I sigh and the three of us sit in the grass as I begin explaining what has been going on for the last week while he was trapped in the City of Crystal. I tell him about the visions, how I saw us freeing my mom. I tell him about my nightmares and the triangular symbol. He doesn\u2019t know what it is, either, but he doesn\u2019t seem too surprised by the fact that his father\u2019s scar is actually from a mark that\u2019s been cut off. He says he didn\u2019t know, but that he\u2019s sort of glad, at least that way he has something to justify what his father\u2019s doing\u2014going to do. There are a few times where I swear he looks like he\u2019s tearing up, but he shuts it off quickly, a true pro at hiding his emotions. As I watch him battle them, I start to notice just how similar we are. We both fight our emotions and act as if we don\u2019t understand them. While I understand my reason, I can\u2019t help thinking about what could have caused him to want to turn his own emotions off.</p><p>As soon as I get done telling him about what happened in The Underworld, Alex takes us straight to the hideout. It\u2019s like he can remember it as if we\u2019ve been playing in it only yesterday. When we climb up to the flourishing violet bush on the hill, we climb down the ladder and step into the dark. Memories instantly flood me and I realize that we spent a lot of time down here together.</p><p>Alex disappears into the darkness and seconds later I hear a match strike. He blows the dust off a candle and lights the wick. The glow orbs around the room and he places the candle down on top of a table, and then heads over to the trunk in the corner.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still in the same spot?\u201d I ask, peering over his shoulder.</p><p>He lifts the lid up and begins rummaging through it. \u201cThat was the last time I ever came down here. You went to live with Marco and Sophia and I just didn\u2019t see the point anymore.\u201d He avoids eye contact with me as he searches for the gem. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There are a lot of silly objects inside it; a rock, a leather bracelet, and what looks like a bouquet of pressed flowers. At one time all of this stuff meant something to us, tied us together along with our friendship.</p><p>I lean back and trace my finger down the palm of my hand. \u201cAlex, what does forem mean?\u201d</p><p>The muscles in Alex\u2019s back wind up as his entire body stiffens. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we said to each other when we were in here.\u201d I reach around him, take his hand, and then turn it over. I brush my finger along the minor scar in the center of his palm. \u201cYou said we were becoming blood brothers and then we said forem.\u201d</p> <p>I hear Laylen clear his throat fairly loudly. I look over at him and he appears uncomfortable, shifting his weight as he stares at the floor. I open my mouth to say... well, I\u2019m not really sure. And I never do get to find out because he abruptly wanders over to the ladder and climbs up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his problem?\u201d I ask Alex as he turns around, clutching something in his hand.</p><p>He shakes his head and lowers himself onto the dirt floor, pulling on my arm and steering me to sit with him. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d He takes a deep breath and then opens his hand, showing me a shimmering blue gem.</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d I skim my fingers on the clean-cut edges. \u201cWhat is it exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Cruciatus diamond.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes it do anything?\u201d</p><p>He encloses his fingers around the gemstone. \u201cThe Queen used it to suck the fear out of people before one of the Keepers took it from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did they get it from her if it\u2019s so hard to get into The Underworld?\u201d I wonder.</p><p>\u201cA long time ago things worked differently,\u201d Alex sighs tiredly. \u201cThe Queen used to be able to come up to the castle to discuss matters of business and to make truces with the Keepers. That\u2019s how the Keepers ended up sending people down there as a punishment. This,\u201d he pinches the gemstone between his thumb and his finger, \u201cwas used during a bargain between the Queen and the leader of the Keepers at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you and I end up with it?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his tongue in his mouth as he tries not to smile. \u201cYou and I stole it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen we were friends?\u201d I question, letting him know that I\u2019ve been remembering more and more.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you exactly remember?\u201d he wonders curiously.</p><p>\u201cNot that much,\u201d I answer. \u201cJust a few images here and there, but there seems to be a lot of us together when we were young.\u201d</p><p>Alex squeezes his eyes shut and drops the gem onto his lap, exhausted and looking like he\u2019s about to tip over.</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d I say softly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He remains silent, leaning his weight on his arm as he props it against the ground.</p><p>I place a hand on his shoulder and give him a gentle shake, concerned with how weak he looks. \u201cAlex, can you hear me?\u201d The electricity pulsates through us as I watch his chest lift and then descend with each frail breath he takes.</p><p>Then his eyelids lift open and his eyes collide with mine. A rush of relief sweeps through me and I start to pull my hand back, but he slips his hand over mine and positions my palm over his heart.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I whisper, loving that he\u2019s touching me, but still worried about how exhausted he looks. The holes in his skin aren\u2019t healing, either, they\u2019re fully open, and some of them are still bleeding while others are mixed with dirt.</p><p>\u201cShhh...\u201d He shuts his eyes again and his other hand finds the back of my neck. He draws me forward and presses our foreheads together. \u201cI just need a minute, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod my head and then shut my eyes, too, the electricity elevating in voltage. My breathing becomes ragged the longer we stay touching and my hands itch to do things to him, inappropriate things.</p><p>When I feel him finally shift back, I open my eyes, only to find that he\u2019s leaning in again.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how hard it was?\u201d he breathes, his palm resting on my neck, his thumb smoothing across the sensitive area.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to do that.\u201d I place my finger over a small hole in his chest where one of the tubes was embedded. \u201cI really am, especially since you had to go there pretty much for nothing.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNot that... I\u2019ve already told you that pain isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d He brushes his lips across mine. \u201cBeing away from you... it gets harder and harder... I swear to God it actually feels like I\u2019m dying.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say at his honestly raw admittance and he doesn\u2019t give me time as he crashes his lips against mine. I gasp while I glide my hands up the front of his chest, feeling his soft skin, which gets hotter the longer we kiss. He threads his fingers through my hair, tugging on the roots so he can tip my head back. Deep down I know that now is not the time or place, but then again I\u2019ve seen the end of the world; I know it\u2019s coming and moments like these will come to an end.</p><p>I let him lie me back into the dirt and lower his body over mine, pinning an arm on each side of my head as his tongue explores every inch of my mouth. I bite at his lip, but ball my hands into fists, resisting the compulsion to stab my nails into his flesh\u2014he\u2019s already got too many wounds at the moment.</p><p>The feel of his chest heats something deep within me and, as he positions his hands over my wrist, enfolding his fingers around them and restraining then down beside my head, I about come undone. I writhe my hips against his, lust and desire flooding my body at the intensity that is so overwhelming I can barely think of anything. Nothing other than him and I exist in this moment. Together. Something inside of me whispers that this is how it\u2019s supposed to be.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>He pulls back a little, his lips red and swollen, his hair a mess, but his skin looks healthier. Strangely the holes in his skin have sealed together so there are nothing more than tiny, fingernail sized scratches.</p><p>I wiggle one of my arms out of his grasp and run my fingers over his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re healing.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me softly. \u201cI know...\u201d Another light-as-a-feather kiss and then another and I can barely breathe through the fog in my head and the lack of oxygen in my system. \u201cI can feel the energy healing me... Keepers heal quickly anyway, but this...\u201d His tongue slips inside mine and I knot my fingers through his hair, pulling him closer. He puts a sliver of space between our lips, yet it\u2019s only to utter, \u201cThe electricity makes it so much better.\u201d</p><p>His weight pushes down on me again and I return my arm to the side of my head so he can wrap his fingers around my wrist and pin me down once more. Knowing what I\u2019m doing, he briefly smiles against my lips before he kisses me with so much force it feels like my body blazes as brightly as a shimmering piece of silver in the sunlight.</p><p>We kiss until our bodies liquefy from the red-hot heat, until we\u2019re verging on the point of ripping each other's clothes off. I\u2019m just about to undo the button of his jeans when a scream rips through the air. I freeze. I know the sounds far too well.</p><p>Death Walkers.</p><p>Alex is on his feet before I can even register what\u2019s happening, then grabbing ahold of my hand, he lifts me to my feet, his strength suddenly back.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Laylen,\u201d I say, glancing around at the dimly lit cave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d He looks worried as he stuffs the gem into his pocket and rushes over to the trunk. He selects a small, silver-bladed pocketknife from the bottom, and then dashes over to the ladder, glancing up at the land above.</p><p>\u201cStay behind me at all times,\u201d he commands, gripping the knife in one hand and the step of the ladder in the other.</p><p>I nod and follow him up the ladder, wishing I had a knife of my own so I could at least try to protect myself. I hate this feeling of being helpless yet I seem to experience it a lot.</p><p>I stay behind him as he told me to while he slides down the rocky hill and then winds through the bushes and trees. We can\u2019t find Laylen anywhere and the farther we walk, the more worried I get that he might be in some serious trouble.</p><p>More clouds have rolled in and the sky is nearly black. I can hear the sound of thunder rumbling and the snap of lightening as it blazes across the sky. As we reach the heart of the trees, rain begins to trickle down from the sky and splatter on the leaves and dirt, making the ground a muddy mess. Shriek after shriek echoes through the forest, growing louder as we hike further.</p><p>Finally it becomes so deafening that it\u2019s evident we\u2019re close to one of them. Stopping behind a large tree, Alex sticks his hand out to hold me back, pressing the knife out in front of him.</p><p>\u201cGemma, if anything happens\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. Run. Hide. Save myself,\u201d I say because he\u2019s always telling me this. Usually it\u2019s because of the star, but now I wonder if his concern for me might be deeper.</p><p>His mouth quirks in amusement. \u201cYou and your sarcasm\u2014\u201d A shriek silences him.</p><p>Then we hear it. The voice. A very familiar one belonging to a traitorous, tricky, devious half-Faerie, half-Foreseer. Alex puts a finger up to his lips and then pushes me back behind him so I\u2019m pressed up against the rough bark of the tree trunk.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Nicholas says. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she managed to drag all of us here with her.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause.</p><p>\u201cWell, it would have been a lot better if she hadn\u2019t dropped us in the middle of the lake,\u201d Nicholas says, fuming.</p><p>There\u2019s another long pause and then he starts cursing under his breath. Raindrops pour down on top of us, soaking our skin and clothes at the same time that it pitter-patters against the canopy of leaves and branches above our heads. I\u2019m drenched and it\u2019s smothering a lot of the noises, but I clearly hear a shriek on the other side of the tree.</p><p>With the knife to the side of him, Alex peeks around the corner of the tree trunk then quickly leans back and shakes his head.</p><p>Who is it? I mouth.</p><p>He shakes his head, and then rubs his hand across his face, attempting to erase the uneasiness in it.</p><p>\u201cI know, but where are they?\u201d Nicholas continues on.</p><p>Another shriek shakes the trees and ground around us, causing leaves to break from the branches. The temperature rapidly shifts and the raindrops turn to ice droplets that ping against our skin. Alex holds his arm above my head, shielding me from them, but many of them still hit me and welts begin to form all over my skin.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop doing that!\u201d Nicholas screams and I\u2019m starting to question if he\u2019s having a one-sided conversation.</p><p>Either that or he speaks Death Walker.</p><p>My eyes widen at the thought. Shit, does he? I aim a pressing look at Alex and mouth, Death Walkers.</p><p>He looks reluctant as he presses his lips together, refusing to answer me. The strangest fear starts to rouse inside me as I realize that we still haven\u2019t found Laylen and that Alex looks like he\u2019s going to be sick.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop smelling the blood!\u201d Nicholas cries as thunder booms and lightening snaps.</p><p>Blood! Oh, no, please, please don\u2019t let it be Laylen. I start to run around the tree trunk and dive headfirst into the madness, not caring about anything but making sure that Laylen\u2019s okay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alex snags me by the arm and drags me back to him. I fight to get away, but he cradles me against his frozen wet chest and I bury my face into it listening to his heart as I feel my own heart pleading to stop beating. Not Laylen. This can\u2019t be happening. He means too much to me. So much and I need him.</p><p>\u201cHe tried to attack me first.\u201d Nicholas snaps and it\u2019s overlapped by the sound of the crisp raindrops. \u201cIt was self-defense. Besides, you would have frozen him to death anyway.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause and it becomes pretty clear that Nicholas can be verbal with the Death Walkers. The only other person I\u2019ve seen do this is Stephan and it makes me wonder why? Why can they communicate with them and the rest of us can\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cSo what if Stephan created Laylen?\u201d Nicholas growls venomously. \u201cCreating another Vampire isn\u2019t that complicated.\u201d</p> <p>My head snaps up to Alex and he looks down at me. Sympathy and confusion float between us as we try to figure out what to do and what this all could mean.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not messing around,\u201d Nicholas insists. \u201cI know what has to be done.... I know, but it might be a little difficult to find her. She\u2019s powerful and getting more powerful by the day. She can do things normal Foreseers can\u2019t... Fine, whatever. Let\u2019s go back and I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a faint swoosh and I swear I can feel energy building and then dissipating before the ice droplets turn back to rain. Minutes later, Alex peers around the corner of the tree trunk as he lets go of me.</p><p>Unable to stand it any longer, I shove my way past him and run out into the open.</p><p>\u201cGemma wait!\u201d he calls out, following after me.</p> <p>I sprint through the rain, splashing puddles and breaking the ice apart on the ground as I run toward a figure lying on the ground. I think I know who it is before I get there, but the irrational side of my mind is telling me I\u2019m wrong</p><p>As I approach the lifeless body, Laylen\u2019s blond hair comes into view, and I slam to a stop beside him, dropping to my knees in the mud while Alex stops just behind me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not... he\u2019s not dead...\u201d Tears sting at my eyes as I press a hand to Laylen\u2019s heart where a small, wooden stick is lodged. His arms and legs are sprawled out and he looks pallid. Rain soaks his shirt along with blood, and the harder it pours, the further his body sinks into the unstable ground, almost as if it\u2019s quicksand. The prickle gnaws at the back of my neck and I start to sink, too. I beg for it to simply take us because feeling this massive hole burrowing into my heart is exceedingly painful, too painful for me to be able to bear life anymore.</p><p>Alex crouches down and examines Laylen\u2019s body. \u201cHe\u2019s not dead,\u201d Alex says, putting his hands on the stick, and wrapping his fingers around it. \u201cNot yet anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet anyway,\u201d I repeat, horrified, shielding my eyes from the rain as I gape at him. \u201cDoes that mean he\u2019s going to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if we can get him some...\u201d Alex\u2019s face contorts as he yanks the stick out of Laylen\u2019s chest and tosses it aside into the wet grass</p> <p>It leaves behind a gaping hole in his chest and I swear to God my own chest\u2014or at least heart\u2014is working to match it. Alex presses his hand over the wound, putting pressure on it as blood gushes out.</p><p>\u201cHow do we heal him?\u201d I ask, touching Laylen\u2019s forehead. His eyes are shut and his skin is icy cold, more than it normally is</p><p>\u201cWe need blood,\u201d Alex states without looking at me.</p><p>I glance down at my wrist, rubbing my thumb across my vein. \u201cI can do it,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>I expect him to argue, but he only nods, pushing to his feet. \u201cFine.\u201d He heads for the trees and I turn my head to look at him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going!\u201d I call out.</p><p>He pauses with his back to me, rain showering down his body, droplets beading across his back muscles. \u201cI...I can\u2019t watch you like that... with him...\u201d He hikes through the mud and vanishes into the trees.</p><p>I turn back to Laylen, feeling the slightest pang of guilt, but then I jump back, startled. Laylen\u2019s eyes are open and he doesn\u2019t say anything as he reaches for my arm. His body\u2019s need to feed and rejuvenate his frail state is overcoming everything else. His fangs immediately slip out from his mouth. He doesn\u2019t speak as he lifts his head up, parts his lips, and lets out a weak growl before his fangs plunge into the vein on my wrist. I feel the jolt to my heart instantly and the need to be with him only moments later. I want him to feed off me, need him to do it. His eyes lock on mine as he drinks my blood, savoring the taste of it. His skin looks less and less pale, his blue eyes regaining some of their luster with each swallow and his chest stiches back up. Eventually, I lie down on top of him and let myself head to a place that\u2019s only going to bring heartbreak.</p> <p>A place where I\u2019ll eventually have to make a choice about what I want.</p><p>Or who.</p><p>Once we\u2019re finished, we lay side by side in the mud, gathering our strength while we sink further into the forest ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, staring up at the sky, his eyelids blinking against the drizzle of the rain. \u201cI know this has to be hard for you.\u201d</p><p>I find his hand and place mine over it, watching the lightening in the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is,\u201d he insists. \u201cI should have been stronger than to let some stupid Faerie stake me... the Death Walkers threw me off, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I press, slanting my head to the side to look at him.</p><p>He refuses to look at me, however, fixated on the raindrops falling down to the earth instead. \u201cWhere\u2019s Alex.\u201d</p><p>I let out a faltering breath. \u201cHe wandered off... said he couldn\u2019t watch.\u201d</p><p>He squeezes my hand. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he says, but I\u2019m not sure who he\u2019s trying to convince. Him or me. Regardless, the invisible, magnetic connection that I felt with him the last time he bit me is twice as powerful now and I can only feel it growing with each beat of my heart.</p><p>The weight of the rain and my guilt pile on me more and I just keep thinking: if only I could shut it off. I try a few times, very pathetically, but give up when the feeling almost builds. Rain crashes down and thunder booms as I keep sinking further and further into the ground.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to let it bury me when I realize that it actually is. I\u2019m being buried alive by the mud and rain. Laylen rolls to his side and I hear him say something, but his voice is muddled with the mud oozing into my ears.</p><p>\u201cLaylen!\u201d I cry and I feel him grab onto my arm, but the ground only opens up and swallows me whole.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>\u201cFeel it, Gemma,\u201d someone whispers. \u201cFeel what you really are...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Gemma, don\u2019t...\u201d a soft voice whispers. I know that voice. It\u2019s my mother\u2019s.</p><p>I open my eyes to the yard covered with metal objects surrounding me. \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re cold,\u201d someone says as I sit up and glance around the junkyard. \u201cAnd heartless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not,\u201d my mother says and she emerges out from behind some metal crates. \u201cShe\u2019s good and that\u2019s why you\u2019re so worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d the voice purrs. \u201cShe\u2019s bad and you\u2019ll soon see that I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d I argue as ravens flock around my head. \u201cI\u2019m just confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfused.\u201d The voice grows louder and then laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re messing with everyone\u2019s head and playing with their emotions. You\u2019re downright evil, which is good... it\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>I suddenly recognize the voice. \u201cStephan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, don\u2019t listen to him,\u201d my mom begs, not moving toward me, reaching out to me instead. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you never seem to learn from your mistakes,\u201d Stephan talks over my mom as he steps out into the open. \u201cYou repeat them...which is beneficial for me and what I have planned. It\u2019ll make it easier to turn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn me,\u201d I say. \u201cAs in evil? Because that\u2019ll never happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he states with confidence as my upper arm begins to burn. \u201cI know you have it in you. That\u2019s why I chose you.\u201d</p><p>My head is throbbing and I could swear my skull has been cracked open. When I open my eyes, I expect to be buried in the mud, but instead I\u2019m in a small room with sunshine yellow walls, which is decorated with masks, pictures, and a colorful rain stick. The air smells lavishly of rain and forest.</p><p>I quickly start to sit up, but I\u2019m jerked back down. I bounce against the mattress, restricted by metal cuffs and chains that are secured to my wrists and legs and tied to the bedposts.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I curse. My legs are spread out and my arms are above my head, locked and losing circulation. My clothes are caked in mud and my hair feels crusty.</p><p>Where am I? And how the hell did I get here? I don\u2019t have an answer for either since the last thing I can remember is sinking into the dirt.</p><p>The crystal ball is still in my pocket and I close my eyes to try to Foresee my way out of here, but I can\u2019t even so much as feel a charge of energy; despite how much I let my emotions own me. I give up and start jerking on my arms and legs, but the cuffs only bite at my skin. I use every ounce of my energy, trying to get away, until my wrist and ankles rupture open and bleed all over the bed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no use trying to get away.\u201d Nicholas\u2019s face appears above me. His arms are crossed, the sleeves of his red shirt shoved up to his elbows, and he has a cut just above his right eyebrow as well as a bruise on his cheek bone.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d I ask derisively. \u201cDid one of the Death Walkers beat you up?\u201d</p><p>He makes sure to keep his distance from me, leaving just enough room that I can\u2019t slam my head against his. \u201cWatch what you say. Remember, I\u2019ve got all the control here.\u201d</p><p>I let out an unsteady breath. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d I aim for a composed voice, however the fact that he has all the power at the moment makes me extremely nervous. Nicholas is the kind of guy who will do things to me.</p><p>\u201cMy house,\u201d he says simple, motioning at a nightstand beside the bed and an antique oval mirror on the door. There\u2019s also a window, but the curtain blocks my view to the outside. I wonder where his home is? In the City of Crystal? The Kingdom of Fey? Somewhere else?</p><p>\u201cHow did I get here?\u201d I ask. \u201cHow did you drag me through the mud like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already explained this to you,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s called mind manipulation, Gemma. You could do it too\u2014make people see things that aren\u2019t really there\u2014if you\u2019d just train as a Foreseer.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. I\u2019d almost forgotten how Nicholas could make me see things that weren\u2019t real. \u201cBut I blocked your mirage power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my mirage power. God, you know nothing about what you can do.\u201d He fakes a pout. \u201cIt\u2019s quite tragic, really.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201d I make my hand as narrow as possible and attempt to squeeze it out of the cuff, but the metal only bites my skin and I wince. \u201cAnd what did you do to my power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t use your power because of the praesidium.\u201d He points around at tiny marble sized lavender balls scattered all over the floorboards, the windowsill, and the footboard of the bed. \u201cThey trap your Foreseer energy within you,\u201d he says, sinking down to the bed.</p><p>I arch my back and wiggle my body so forcefully that the bed thumps against the wall. \u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>He slams his hand down on my stomach, hard enough that it knocks the wind out of me and I cough as I struggle for air.</p> <p>\u201cI think you know why... you understand now, what I am and who I work for.\u201d He squats down on the floor so that he\u2019s eye level with me and starts playing with my hair hanging over the side of the bed. \u201cI tried to do things the easy way, but you just wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet you what?\u201d I ask, inching my head to the side to get out of his reach. \u201cOne minute you\u2019re trying to teach me how to be a better Foreseer and the next you\u2019re attacking me and chasing me down with a herd of Death Walkers. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>He laughs at my pathetic attempt when I yank so hard on the chains they make a loud snapping noise. I bend my neck up, and aim my forehead for his, but he leaps to his feet and hops back, fury flashing across his face. But then he quickly collects himself and smiles again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so feisty,\u201d he says, his fingers seeking the nightstand.</p><p>I glare at him. \u201cLet me go you sick, perverted asshole!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, why would I do a stupid thing like that?\u201d He opens the top drawer and retrieves a teal crystal ball that shimmers even in the inadequate light.</p><p>I freeze. \u201cThe Ira.\u201d Suddenly there\u2019s a spark of light in this very dim, grey situation. I could get it from him. I just need to figure out how to escape with it.</p><p>He glances down at it in his hand and then amusement dances in his eyes as he tosses it back and forth between his hands, like he\u2019s playing catch. \u201cOh, I almost completely forgot that you wanted this.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. You know exactly what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>He catches the Ira and then taps his finger against his lip. \u201cYou know, I could make a bargain with you.\u201d He extends his hand toward my face and I twist my neck to the side, cringing as he strokes my temple with his fingers. \u201cYou know Stephan wants you really badly.\u201d He ravels a strand of my hair around his finger. \u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to give him to you... but I might break the rules and keep you.\u201d He leans down and sticks his nose in my hair, smelling it. \u201cYou smell so utterly delicious.\u201d</p><p>I fling my head in his direction and click my teeth together, trying to bite his finger, but he quickly withdraws his face and hands from my hair. \u201cYou know he\u2019s going to end the world with me.\u201d I know it\u2019s a long shot, but perhaps if he understands what\u2019s going to happen and the severity of it, then he won\u2019t want to help Stephan anymore. \u201cEveryone will die. Even you... I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to explain what Stephan is planning to do,\u201d He snaps, yanking down the sleeves of his shirt. \u201cI understand more than you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re simply okay with letting him kill everyone?\u201d I shake my head at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you even have a heart or are you seriously that cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the real question is just how heartless and cold you are,\u201d he sneers.</p><p>My jaw nearly drops. His words almost match what Stephan said to me in the dream I had right before I woke up here. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a dream, though. Maybe it was a vision.</p><p>He leans over me, his eyes nearly glowing like cinders. \u201cWhich I think is what this whole thing is about.\u201d</p><p>My stomach rolls. He knows more than I thought he did. \u201cWhy are you doing this? There has to be a reason... you can\u2019t... there\u2019s no way you just decided to be evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ve always been evil. I mean, you barely even know me and, from what you do know, I\u2019m a sick, twisted, perverted asshole.\u201d He tucks the Ira under his arm and makes air quotes. \u201cBut before you making assumptions, maybe you should consider how much you know about Stephan. Or about his precious son, Alex. You trust him so much, yet he is the son of the man who ruined your life and so many other peoples that it\u2019s absurd. He\u2019s supposedly some high and mighty Keeper, yet he has more darkness in him that anyone can comprehend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he ruin your life?\u201d I ask. \u201cIs that why?\u201d</p> <p>He shifts his weight, uncomfortable, and I get the impression that I\u2019ve struck a nerve.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d I press.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go take a walk.\u201d He evades my question and stuffs his hands into the pockets of his pants, rocking back on his heels. \u201cI\u2019d say wait here, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be going anywhere.\u201d He turns his back on me and walks out of the room, taking the Ira with him. He shuts and locks the door behind him as well.</p><p>I let out a frustrated scream, tugging on the chains. The praesidium rolls off the footboard and onto the floor, but stays close enough that my energy is uselessly trapped inside me. My battle against the chains goes on for hours until I can barely move my legs or arms and I\u2019m dripping with sweat. Exhaustion takes me over and all I want to do is shut my eyes.</p><p>So I do, not knowing where I\u2019ll end up, what I\u2019ll see, or what I\u2019ll feel. However, it doesn\u2019t really matter, does it? Because at the moment I don\u2019t have control over anything.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>I\u2019m beginning to learn what rage is. I didn\u2019t fully understand it like I thought I did because what\u2019s stirring within me is definitely rage. It\u2019s like a building storm; rolling clouds and thunder, but lightning hasn\u2019t arrived yet. It\u2019s getting ready to snap its raging energy against the ground, though, and make the world rumble with its bellowing echo.</p><p>I\u2019m losing track of time as well as my grip on sanity. Hours stack upon hours, then days upon days. I\u2019m thirsty and hungry while I\u2019m still in my disgustingly muddy clothes, so I smell repulsive.</p><p>Nicholas comes in and checks on me occasionally, only unhooking my chains to let me go to the bathroom, which he gives me no privacy for. It makes me feel revolting inside, like something has been taken that I\u2019ll never be able to get back. He always makes vulgar comments about me and he feeds me only bread and water. He also likes to keep the Ira on the nightstand, close enough that I can feel the vibrant energy exuding from it, but far enough away that I can\u2019t channel it; even though it\u2019s useless since the praesidium remains close enough to lock my powers within me.</p><p>I try to make several attempts to escape, but always fail and end up paying for it. I quickly learn that Nicholas has a violent streak in him after he hit me a couple of times when I said and did the wrong thing. It doesn\u2019t make me back down at all, though. In fact, it makes me more determined to get away and pay him back in full for what he\u2019s doing to me.</p><p>In the beginning I expected Alex or Laylen to show up and save me. I made a comment about it once and Nicholas informed me that no one could save me. That his house is merely an illusion in the mind and only those he allows to see it can.</p><p>There doesn\u2019t even seem to be a point in what he\u2019s doing. Stephan never shows up to collect me and when I ask him about it, he says he\u2019s been detained. Although I think he might be enjoying having me here a little too much.</p><p>The strange thing is that he appears to be growing weaker by the day; pallid, his eyes tinting yellow, while his skin looks cracked and dry. It\u2019s repulsive to look at and even he seems disgusted by himself. His connection and obsession with me, however, seems to be growing stronger. He\u2019s always touching me, trying to kiss me and grope me. I have no idea where his fixation with me is coming from, but I\u2019m starting to think it might be to my benefit if I can find the right moment</p><p>Around the six or seventh day, I begin to connive a plan to get away. The one that I create makes me utterly sick, but I don\u2019t think I have another choice other than to stay here forever and sink further into my rage.</p><p>I mentally prepare myself for what I\u2019m about to do when he walks into the room. He drags a chair from the corner and puts it beside the bed, sitting down.</p><p>He slants his head to the side and examines me with curiosity as he props his foot up against the side of the bed. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re very talented and I have to say I\u2019m quite surprised that you haven\u2019t found a way out of this yet.</p><p>Oh, I have. I\u2019m just waiting for the perfect moment.</p><p>\u201cYou can go into and out of visions without a crystal ball,\u201d he says enviously. \u201cWith a little practice and enough emotion, you could travel anywhere without a crystal ball as well.\u201d He pauses, assessing me. \u201cI could teach you... we could work together\u2014we\u2019d be amazing together.\u201d</p><p>I stare blankly at him. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>He studies me with a distrusting look on his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>I remain neutral. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me no reason to trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve barely gotten to know me,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m different than what you think. Maybe there\u2019s a reason for everything bad that I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d I challenge.</p><p>He stares me down defiantly. \u201cHow much do you know about the Fey?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I bend my fingers downward and itch beneath the cold metal cuff, the skin has been rubbed raw underneath it. \u201cNot much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t, since you\u2019ve been spending most of your time with Keepers, Witches, and Vampires.\u201d His lips twitch. \u201cAnd of course there was all that time you spent by yourself unemotionally detached.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cYou know about that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m a Foreseer and can see anything I want, something you should learn... but that\u2019s a story for another time.\u201d He drops his foot to the ground and transfers from the chair to the bed, the mattress concaving beneath his weight as he sinks down beside me. \u201cThe Fey have been around forever, you know. Most people think of us as tricksters, which we are, but we can be very serious as well, given the right circumstances, like if our kind are suffering.\u201d He brushes his hand over the top of my head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve heard of him or not, but there used to be a man called Malefiscus who was the personification of evil.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, letting him pet me because it helps me with my plan. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his golden eyes. \u201cHaven\u2019t the Keepers taught you anything?\u201d He withdraws his hand from my hair, but only to tap his fingers on his chapped lips. \u201cThen again, they might not want you to know about it since Malefiscus started out as a Keeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe personification of evil started out as a Keeper?\u201d I ask, remembering what Laylen told me about the Mark of Evil and how it used to exist and was directly related to the Keepers\u2019 blood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you surprised?\u201d</p><p>I want to say yes but the more I learn about the Keepers, the more I realize they aren\u2019t as good as they portray themselves to be.</p><p>He smiles, pleased, and begins petting my head again. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll fill you in on the story of Malefiscus so you can get a better understanding of what he was\u2014what a Keeper could become if they ended up switching sides and getting branded by evil.\u201d His fingers drift to my cheek and I refuse to look away, knowing I have to do this.</p><p>\u201cDuring Malefiscus\u2019s time, there was sheer and utter chaos in the world,\u201d Nicholas explains. \u201cHe tortured everyone\u2014Vampires, Witches, Faeries. Even humans. He had a whole army of followers and they would go around on killing sprees or trying to persuade people he saw fit to join him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere was so much death and blood as well as pain that the Fey leader of that time decided he\u2019d had enough. There were too many Faeries dying and so he made a bargain with Malefiscus to try to save lives.\u201d His fingers roam to my mouth and he strokes his thumb against my lips as he licks his own. \u201cHe told Malefiscus that if he would leave the Fey alone, that we would forever be indebted to him\u2014that we would exchange a favor for the Fey's freedom from his chaos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he agree?\u201d I ask, my lips brushing against the pad of his thumb. He tastes salty while he smells like dirt and murky water.</p><p>He nods, sticking his thumb into my mouth, and I just about gag. \u201cMalefiscus agreed to it since the Fey are very powerful and he loved power. So the leader of the Fey and Malefiscus made a Blood Promise.\u201d He removes his thumb from my mouth, although he keeps it resting on my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Blood Promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too long after the promise was made, though,\u201d he continues on with his story, discounting my question. \u201cMalefiscus was caught and sentenced to his death. The Keepers made the sentence and supposedly they executed him, but deep down people wondered whether they really did or not. There were a lot of traitors at the time and rumors started flooding that someone had snuck him out the day before he was supposed to be hanged.\u201d He pauses and then lies down on the bed beside me, his fingers tracing a path across my stomach, his skin feeling as rough as sandpaper. My gut churns and a slimy chill slithers down my spine, but this is right where I want him; close and distracted.</p> <p>\u201cAlive or dead, it doesn\u2019t really matter because his bloodline didn\u2019t die with him,\u201d He continues while sketching circles around my belly button as he props up on his elbow and watches my reaction. \u201cIt carried through the decades, going completely unnoticed for a while and so no one really knew about it until just recently.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt carried on and now resides in a man named Stephan Avery.\u201d</p><p>He stills and I\u2019m too shocked to breathe. Stephan is the descendant of evil. Alex\u2019s father. God, what does that make Alex?</p><p>\u201cBecause his bloodline carried on, so did the Fey\u2019s promise to grant him a favor. Only now the favor is owed to Stephan.\u201d His fingernails plunge into my stomach and slice my flesh open. Blood oozes out, but I tell myself to shut out the pain. Shut down. \u201cI had barely heard of this story and I think a lot of Fey had forgotten as well until surprise, surprise, Stephan came to collect a few days ago,\u201d he says venomously. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t want just any member of the Fey to fulfill the promise. He wanted the Faerie who has the gift of a Foreseer as well.\u201d</p><p>My eyes enlarge as the severity of the situation that I\u2019m in registers in my head. \u201cHe asked you... to do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you already know that.\u201d He pivots on his hip and aligns himself over me, his fingers stroking the section of my stomach that he had clawed moments ago. I feel my chance arriving and I try to get myself ready for the wretched place I\u2019m about to go. \u201cHe wanted me to track down a very beautiful, feisty, and very tortured girl with the most magnificent violet eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he want you to do with me?\u201d Stay calm. You can do this. You\u2019re strong.</p> <p>\u201cBring you to him.\u201d He inches closer to me like he\u2019s about to kiss me.</p><p>I stay as still as I can, despite my initial reaction to squirm and head-butt him. \u201cAnd why haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t seem to let you go.\u201d He tucks a strand of hair behind my hair and wets his chaffed lips with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou could just let me go,\u201d I dare to suggest. \u201cYou could come with me... go into hiding with us.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cAlex would never let that happen and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could make him,\u201d I say in an even voice. \u201cI have ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a devious thing,\u201d he remarks and places a sloppy kiss on my cheek. My heart thrashes and my throat burns with the taste of vomit. \u201cBut even if you could convince him, I still couldn\u2019t... I don\u2019t have a choice anymore with what I can do to you.\u201d He leans back a little and rolls up the sleeve of his shirt all the way to the top of his arm. On the side of his arm, branded in red and black ink is a triangular mark.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I whisper, although I think deep down I already know. I\u2019ve seen it before in my dream, on Draven, and with all the talk about the Mark of Evil, it\u2019s pretty clear what it is; even if I don\u2019t want to believe it.</p> <p>\u201cThe Mark of Malefiscus, also known as the Mark of Evil,\u201d Nicholas growls, wrenching his sleeve back over it. \u201cI\u2019m branded with the Mark of Evil and I can make you stay all I want, but eventually the power of it\u2019s going to take over. It will make me give you to Stephan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you... how did you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStephan.\u201d</p><p>My body jolts upward as horror slams through me. \u201cWhat!\u201d</p><p>He smiles and it almost looks like a sad smile. For a brief instant, he looks almost human. \u201cStephan can do a lot more than what people think.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and open my mouth to ask more questions, but he places his finger over my lips, shushing me. \u201cNo more questions. My time is running out...\u201d he looks down at his pale, cracked arm and then his eyes lock back on me. \u201cI have to take you away soon.\u201d He leans in to kiss me.</p><p>I shove every ounce of revulsion down and lock it in a box inside me. I become a different person, one that doesn\u2019t feel, and for a second I feel at home. I kiss him, holding everything in me, and pretending like I\u2019m somewhere else. Somewhere the sun shines and my mood matches it. Maybe on a beach. Even though I\u2019ve never been to one; the idea of the sand, the ocean, and the heat seem like it would be a wonderful, relaxing experience. I picture myself there, lying in the sand. Someone is with me, but I can\u2019t tell who yet. A sturdy male figure with skin as smooth as porcelain. I hold myself there as Nicholas\u2019s hands digress all over my body.</p><p>He gets more intense the further he goes, but my bound legs and arms are making it hard for me to do anything except lie there.</p><p>As he tries to draw our bodies closer, my legs get in the way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I apologize with as much sincerity as I can.</p><p>His lips are puffy as he leans back with his eyes unfocused, like he\u2019s stoned. It\u2019s almost like I have some sort of power over him and I wonder what it is. Regardless, I\u2019m using it to my advantage.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says and leans back in to kiss me. After a lot of time passes\u2014time where I zone out and my body just moves on its own\u2014Nicholas finally gets frustrated and undoes the cuffs from my ankles and wrists.</p><p>\u201cTry anything at all,\u201d he threatens, lowering himself down onto me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll pay severely.\u201d</p><p>I keep my expression blank as he begins kissing me again. I allow him to relax as much as possible, and then, when he\u2019s about to shove his hands down the front of my jeans, I finally open the box inside me, letting emotions flood out. I lean back and then slam my head forward, ramming our skulls together hard. There\u2019s a sickening crack and then Nicholas screams out in pain. I give him no time to recover, kicking him between the legs. His face screws up in pain and he slumps to the side of the bed. I leap to my feet and immediately the blood rushes from my head. The room violently spins in indistinct hues and shapes as I stumble toward the bed and make a run for the door. Halfway there, though, I turn back and stare at the nightstand, at the Ira.</p><p>\u201cYou know you want it,\u201d Nicholas grunts, clutching his goods. \u201cIf you leave without it, you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m weak and hungry and I feel like shit, but I do want it. Badly. The only thing standing between it and me is Nicholas. I glance around the room for a weapon and spot the rain stick on the wall. I snatch it down and position it in front of me.</p><p>Nicholas climbs off the bed, hobbling a little as he winds around to the foot of the bed. He grins at me, raising his eyebrows and spanning his arms out to the side.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he says with an arrogant grin. \u201cTake your best shot.\u201d</p><p>Trembling, I shuffle forward and swing the stick at his head. He ducks down and the force of the movement sends me sideways. My feet scuff against the floor, but I ungracefully manage to recompose my balance. I walk a half-circle around him, positioning the stick out in front of me.</p><p>He laughs at me as he turns to the side with me, making sure that his eyes stay targeted on mine. \u201cCome on, Gemma. You\u2019re a Keeper. You can do better.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, redirecting myself to the other side. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not... I have no mark.\u201d</p><p>He leans back against the footboard and causally props his elbows against it, unafraid of me to the point that it\u2019s almost insulting. \u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it hasn\u2019t appeared yet.\u201d</p><p>I want to ask him what he knows because it looks like he knows something, but it\u2019ll only get me distracted. Taking a step backward, I charge at him. He laughs, skittering to the side like he\u2019s dancing, however I twirl around right at the last second and extend the stick out so it comes straight out in front of him. The heavy material slams against his gut and the stuff inside the stick makes it sound like it\u2019s raining.</p><p>He lets out a sharp cough as he crumples over and I seize the opportunity to bring the stick over my head and ram it down on top of his. The sound is sickening and it makes me feel barbaric, but I\u2019ve entered survival mode and all that matters is getting the hell out of here alive with the Ira.</p><p>I hit him again and again until he\u2019s lying on the floor in a pool of his own blood. He\u2019s not dead, his chest is still feebly rising and falling, but I\u2019ve beaten him pretty badly. I drop the rain stick to the floor and back away. I have blood on my hands and even some on my face. I\u2019m a terrible, wretched person. I really am.</p><p>I grab the Ira off the nightstand, feeling a thorny vine twist inside my stomach. By the time I step out of the house and away from the praesidium, I don\u2019t feel like Gemma anymore. I feel dead inside and I let the numbing feeling stay because sometimes, when it all comes down to it, being emotionally detached is better than feeling what really lies inside the darkest spots of our hearts, the one\u2019s that we want to deny exist. Yet sometimes they\u2019re impossible to ignore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walk to the center of the crystal-trimmed yard in front of Nicholas\u2019s illusion house. There\u2019s a fence carved of rubies and a large tree that grows miniscule pink diamonds. It\u2019s beautiful, yet as Nicholas\u2019s said, the beauty is just a delusion.</p><p>Taking the ruby-filled ball out of my pocket. I hold onto the Ira and shut my eyes. I\u2019m not sure where to go since so much time has gone by, so I do the only thing I can think of.</p><p>I shut my eyes and think of the one thing that brings emotion out of me.</p><p>I think of Alex.</p> <p>Chapter 22</p><p>When I land in the living room of Adessa\u2019s, I start to feel alive again, my bones and muscles not hurting so much and my head clears. The air smells intoxicatingly of cinnamon and spices, and the velvet couch looks very welcoming. So does the person on it.</p><p>Alex is staring at a book that\u2019s open on his lap, but when my feet hit the floor his head whips up. A blistering flame of need combines with desire and I start to run to him, but my knees give out on me and I slow down, bracing onto the armrest of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d He takes in the traumatized state of me as he rises to his feet, dropping the book on the cushion. \u201cAnd what the hell happened to you?\u201d</p><p>I collapse onto the nearest couch and lie down on my side, cuddling the Ira to my chest. \u201cNicholas.\u201d</p> <p>Alex shakes his head and then storms over to the wall, slamming his fist through the drywall. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill him,\u201d he growls with so much fury in him it vibrates across the room and into me, stealing some of my already fading energy.</p><p>I struggle to keep my eyes open. \u201cI\u2019m so tired.\u201d I raise my arm in the air and hold up the Ira. \u201cI got this from him.\u201d</p><p>His green eyes widen as he strides across the room and kneels down beside the couch. \u201cYou have the Ira?\u201d</p><p>I nod, gazing off into empty space as I remember the hell I\u2019ve been through the last few days. My ankles and wrists are ripped apart from the cuffs while my legs and arms feel stretched. \u201cYeah, I stole it from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? One minute I left you with Laylen so you could... so he could... and then Laylen said you just vanished. At first I thought he did something to you, but then I realized that he...\u201d he summons a deep breath and shuts his eyes. \u201cThat he cares for you. So we searched the forest, however we couldn\u2019t find you anywhere, so we came back here.\u201d He opens his eyes and sadness abounds within each of them. He hitches his thumb over his shoulder, pointing at the book. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading and reading on why the hell someone would just disappear, but I was starting to arrive to the conclusion that... that you ran away.\u201d He pauses, waiting for an answer.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNicholas was playing fucking mind games with me.\u201d I drape my arm over my head to block out the sting from the bright light. What\u2019s been done to me... what I did continues to possess my fractured soul. \u201cHe took me to his illusion house and tied me to the bed. At first he said it was because of your father, but as the days kept passing and passing, I really started to believe it was for his own benefit.\u201d</p> <p>Alex remains silent for a while, deeply breathing in and out. Finally, the silence becomes maddening and I peer out from under my arm. His gaze penetrates me; my filthy clothes, the warm blood on my hands, along with the purplish blue bruises and deep red scratches covering my body. \u201cGemma, I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re talking about. I mean I can tell by the way that you look that you obvious went through something really bad, but...\u201d He struggles, leaning in over me and sweeping my hair out of my face. \u201cBut you\u2019ve only been gone for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>I swiftly shake my head. \u201cNo... no there\u2019s no way. I was gone for days. I know it.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows furrow as I wince from a sore area on the center of my forehead. \u201cGemma, I promise you that\u2019s not true. I can even get Laylen in here to back me up.\u201d</p><p>My head pounds as I rack my mind for what the hell could be happening. \u201cBut it felt like days. There\u2019s no way it could have been only a few hours.\u201d</p><p>He draws a line back and forth below each of my violet eyes. \u201cMaybe he was messing with you... maybe he was making it seem like days had gone by. He could easily do that, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, thinking of how my sanity bolt had unscrewed. \u201cMaybe...\u201dI shake my head and sit up as he slants back to give me room. \u201cI hate him. I really do.\u201d</p><p>Alex slides up on the couch and turns to face me. His fingers find my hips and he carefully lifts me onto his lap so I\u2019m straddling him. \u201cTell me what he did to you.\u201d He scans over my clothes, my wounds, stealing my breath away the longer he stays focused on me. Electricity within me stirs and arouses, along with my emotions that I turned off.</p><p>I take a deep breath and tell him what happened, minus the making out details because I\u2019d vomit if I had to say them aloud. There are some things that are better left unsaid and forgotten. The person I became is someone I want to forget.</p> <p>It takes Alex about a minute before he speaks again. \u201cI\u2019d like to say that I\u2019m surprised,\u201d he says, slouching back in the sofa with his hands still on my hips. \u201cBut I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve heard of this Malefiscus?\u201d</p><p>He wavers and then hesitantly nods. \u201cWhen I was little, my father would tell me stories of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew?\u201d Stunned, I slide back to leave his lap, but his fingers press downward, securing me in place.</p><p>\u201cJust stories,\u201d he insists. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me he was a descendant, only the story of who Malefiscus was and what became of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew about the mark?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, his pupils like black marbles as he begins to panic. \u201cNo, I really didn\u2019t. I just knew who he was and what he did... my father started telling me stories of him right after my mother left and they kind of became like bedtime stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you of evil as a way to get you to go to sleep.\u201d I\u2019m stunned. Shocked. And kind of disgusted. All this time I\u2019d felt pity for myself for everything I\u2019d went through when I was younger, but I haven\u2019t really thought about what it must have been like to grow up with a murderous traitor. \u201cAlex, that\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs it off, staring over my shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s minor compared to some of the other shit he\u2019s done to me.\u201d His eyebrows dip together as he zones out on some distant memory.</p><p>I place my hand on his stubbly cheek and he flinches. \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>His gaze slides to me as his fingers travel up my side, along each bump of my aching ribcage, finally resting on my shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that. It\u2019s in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to know,\u201d I say. \u201cI-I want to understand you more.\u201d</p><p>He smiles sadly. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. No normal person wants to hear about the bad things that were done to someone by their father. They\u2019d rather stay in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not normal,\u201d I say as his hand covers my hand that\u2019s on his cheek. He traces the folds of my fingers and I shiver from his affectionate touch, experiencing a fleeting moment where I feel like myself again, whoever she was. \u201cTell me,\u201d I plead.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another story for another time,\u201d he says gloomily. \u201cRight now we need to work on getting you hidden better, especially if my father can brand people. Jesus, there could be a ton of people out there who have the mark. I mean, who knows how many people he branded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think it\u2019s true?\u201d I say, sounding strangled, recollecting all the visions I had about the mark appearing on me. I casually glance over at the spot on my arm where it always appears to make sure I\u2019m still good inside.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know... maybe...\u201d He shuts his eyes and his nostrils flare as he inhales sharply. \u201cIf it\u2019s true, then my childhood would make much more sense.\u201d</p><p>For a split second, I wonder if Stephan marked Alex, but I\u2019ve seen him naked and he doesn\u2019t have the mark anywhere or a severe scar where one might have been cut off.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he says, sensing my thoughts. He doesn\u2019t sound angry, merely hurt and lost.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I mutter, tipping my chin down and staring at my lap while using my hair to veil my face. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I thought it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of everything I\u2019ve done to you,\u201d he says straightforwardly. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me or anyone really.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and lift my gaze to his eyes. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t trust anyone, but I\u2019m starting to.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flare lustrously as he grabs the back of my neck and pulls me toward him, his tongue slipping out to wet his lips. I think he\u2019s going to kiss me, however all he does is shake his head.</p><p>\u201cDid he do this to you? Nicholas.\u201d His fingers gently outline a pattern down the bruises dotting on my arm and then his fingers circle my torn up wrist.</p><p>I nod, the feel of his touch soothing me. \u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>He clenches his jaw, anger storming through him, and his muscles constrict. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill him for it,\u201d he growls.</p><p>I nuzzle my cheek against his. \u201cHe already paid for it... I beat him up really badly.\u201d</p><p>He pushes me back by the shoulders a little and then lifts my wrist to his lips and kisses my injury. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of hard to believe,\u201d he says between kisses.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d I shrug, shivering from his kisses. \u201cI beat him with a rain stick.\u201d</p><p>He seals his lips tightly to refrain from laughing. \u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it then, but if I do cross paths with him again, I\u2019ll beat him unconscious.\u201d</p><p>I want to say too late, though all I do is nod because I\u2019m too tired to do or say anything else. Tired of fighting. Of running. Of simply existing. All I want to do at the moment is shut my eyes and go to sleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201d I ask, my eyelids fluttering shut as I yawn. \u201cI\u2019m guessing we have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019re going to get you out of here,\u201d he replies. \u201cGo somewhere safe\u2014somewhere hidden. Nicholas knows where this is and now that we know he\u2019s helping my father, we can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>I nod and bury my face into his chest while he smoothes his hand up and down my back. \u201cLet me go get Aislin and Laylen to see if we can come up with a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He stands up and secures me to the front of him, carrying me with him as he leaves the room. My energy fizzles with each step he takes as I cling onto him. I keep seeing little images of objects and the color red. I see the mark. I see Death Walkers. I see the end of the world. The images are pulling at me to join them and I keep thinking what if I did? Join them? Join the easy side, the one that chases instead of runs.</p><p>\u201cI think something\u2019s... wrong with me,\u201d I tell him drearily.</p><p>He says something about everything being okay and that he\u2019ll protect me. I keep nodding, but eventually I have to admit to myself the truth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That in the end this might not work out. That he can try to protect me, but it doesn\u2019t mean that things will always end up in my favor. Once I admit that, I sink into a deep state of sleep.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Through all of this, I end up losing myself for a moment. I zone out; not asleep, but not really awake, either. I see a thousand images, dream a thousand horrific daydreams. It feels like I die and come back to life again, over and over. I swear I break and then heal... break and then heal.</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d</p> <p>The sound of Alex\u2019s voice forces me out of my own head and back to reality. I jolt upright as I realize I\u2019m lying in a bathtub, submerged in warm water with my head resting against the porcelain. The faucet is on and a light steam rises around me.</p><p>Alex is kneeling down on the tile floor, his arm resting on the side of the bathtub. \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p><p>I rub my hand over my face as I sit up and the water beads down my skin. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d I have bruises and open scratches on my skin, along with traces of dirt.</p><p>\u201cAt a friend of Adessa\u2019s beach house,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Maryland.\u201d</p><p>I hunch over, drawing my knees up to my chest. \u201cDid Aislin transport us here?\u201d</p> <p>He nods, rubbing his hand down my back. \u201cShe did\u2014you passed out before she even got started.\u201d Water drips from his hand onto my skin as he rubs the dirt off me. \u201cOr more like zoned out. Your eyes were open, but you... but you were gone.\u201d His hand wanders to my arms where he begins washing off the dirt off there, too. \u201cI think you might need to take it easy for a while.\u201d</p><p>I rest my head on my knees. \u201cI need to save my mom and then maybe I can get this stupid star\u2019s energy out of me and be normal for once.\u201d</p><p>His hand slides over my cheek and I stare at him as he combs my damp locks out of my face. \u201cYou need to rest. You\u2019re doing too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, please,\u201d I beg. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about her... I dream about her all the time and she needs my help... she needs me. She could help us, too. She could know something about the mark and your father\u2014she could know a way to stop the vision I saw from happening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what if she doesn\u2019t?\u201d He shuts the faucet off. \u201cIt\u2019s such a long shot.\u201d</p><p>I raise my head and turn sideways in the bathtub, grasping onto the sides. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamt about her and I\u2019m not even sure if it was a dream. It could have been real. She said she could help me\u2014that she knew things. Just like she told your father before he forced her into the lake.\u201d</p><p>He wipes away some of the water dripping from my eyelashes with his thumb. \u201cBut they might just be dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they might not,\u201d I whisper. \u201cNicholas said I was powerful and could do amazing things with my power if I was taught right, like travel and see visions without a crystal. What if I can communicate through them to? What is she\u2019s communicating with me?\u201d</p><p>His finger slides down the brim of my nose and to my bottom lip. \u201cAll right, but I\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI know. Since you were in the vision with me when we were bargaining with the Queen, I\u2019m assuming you need to be there.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for a washcloth on a small shelf tucked in the corner near the sink. \u201cAnd I\u2019m making you rest for a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He places a finger over my lips, the washcloth balled in his hand. \u201cRest, or no deal.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes, but on the inside I\u2019m less irritated, understanding that he\u2019s worried about me. \u201cOkay, one day,\u201d I say against his lips.</p><p>He nods and then dips the washcloth into the bathtub of water. \u201cNow, lean back.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the soaked washcloth in his hand. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he leans in and brushes his lips across mine. \u201cI\u2019m going to wash off all those cuts that damn Faerie put all over you,\u201d he says in a low voice.</p><p>I do what he says and lean back, resting my head against the back of the tub, the water flowing over my body. I\u2019m completely naked except for my locket and my muscles feel like I\u2019ve just ran a marathon. Yet, with each touch of his hand, I start to feel better as he moves the washcloth over my body, wiping away the dried blood and mud as he cleans off the cuts. I swear it feels like he\u2019s washing away the icky feelings I\u2019ve been experiencing and the memories of what I did to Nicholas. I feel cleaner, more relaxed, more in tune with him. He\u2019s touching me everywhere, even when he\u2019s not, the magnetic bond syncing our bodies together.</p><p>I shut my eyes as he works the cloth over my neck, down my chest, over my breasts. I groan, curving upward, but I don\u2019t open my eyes, even when his hand moves to the inside of my thighs. Just when I think I can\u2019t take it anymore, his hand and the cloth leave my body. Seconds later, he combs his fingers through my hair and begins washing it as he tenderly tugs at the roots.</p><p>When he finishes I open my eyes and look up at him.</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d he asks, tossing the cloth aside.</p><p>I nod, unable to look away from the longing in his eyes. \u201cI do. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He stands to his feet and reaches for a towel on the hook near the door, and then he takes my hands to help me to my feet. Like he did back at Adessa\u2019s house, he helps me out of the tub and then dries me off. After he secures the towel around me, he carries me to a bed in a room with floral walls and French doors that open out to a deck. The view from the deck is breathtaking; golden sand, amazingly blue ocean and the glistening sunshine. Although I barely get to appreciate it because, as soon as he lays me down on the bed and my head hits the pillow, exhaustion overcomes me and I fall into a deep, dreamless sleep for the first time in a very, very long time.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Maryland is very humid. The air is so heavy and dense that it feels like being in a sauna. The little blue house is secluded near a rocky beach where the ocean constantly roars against the shore. It\u2019s my first time seeing it and, while I enjoy it, I know that there are many other things to worry about at the moment. Like saving my mom.</p><p>Aislin puts up countless charms all over the house, so many that I even set off a few by accident when I simply walked into the wrong areas of the house. One of them turned my skin purple and, when I asked her what the point was, she said it was a distraction. I still didn\u2019t get it, though. We also put praesidium all over the house and yard and even close areas of the beach; so there won\u2019t be any surprise visits from Foreseers.</p><p>I\u2019ve been working my ass off to get the Ira to work, but I can\u2019t channel enough energy. It frustrates me to no end and forces me to push past my limits. I\u2019ve passed out a few times from using too much energy and Alex is getting more and more reluctant to help me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt yourself,\u201d he said one day after I\u2019d passed out while clutching onto the Ira. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not healthy being the star, either,\u201d I replied, turning the teal crystal ball in my hand. \u201cI need to be normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever be normal,\u201d he said begrudgingly. \u201cNone of us will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then I want to be weird without the star in me,\u201d I told him.</p><p>That got him to smile, something I\u2019ve started noticing he doesn\u2019t do very often and, whenever I manage to get him to crack one, it seems to lighten his mood.</p><p>On top of the Ira problems, Laylen\u2019s been getting mood swings a lot, having violent outburst. He even threw a cup across the room because he couldn\u2019t find the coffeemaker. It\u2019s been happening ever since he almost died and my blood brought him back. I\u2019m beginning to worry that between death and all the blood drinking, his caring, laid-back personality has been altered.</p><p>I tried to talk to him about it once, when we crossed paths inside the kitchen. He\u2019s been avoiding me; he even went so far as to try to turn around when I walked up to him while he was searching for a plate, but I stepped into his path.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked, reaching for a mug on the counter. I wasn\u2019t really thirsty. In fact, I\u2019d kind of planned it out so he\u2019d have to talk to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve seemed a little distant the last few days.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his black jeans. \u201cAs good as I always am.\u201d</p><p>I rotated the mug in my hand and leaned in. \u201cLaylen, what happened in the forest. That was no one\u2019s fault. It had to be done to save you.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for a moment and, at first, his expression was unreadable, but then he cut me with a harsh look. \u201cWhat would have saved me, Gemma, is if you\u2019d have simply let me die,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how I want to be saved.\u201d He walked around me, bumping his shoulder into mine and leaving me stunned.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about him. It\u2019s been over a day and the pain in his eyes when he said those God-awful words remains imprinted into my mind. Not want to be saved? Did he want to die? Does he hate himself that much? The thought hurts at my heart. I can\u2019t even imagine what would happen if I told him what I\u2019d overheard Nicholas saying about Stephan creating him. It would break him and luckily Alex seems to agree with me because he\u2019s kept his mouth shut. The biggest question I have is why, though? Why would he create a Vampire when there are ton of them wandering around?</p><p>It\u2019s late, the full moon an orb against the charcoaled sky and the darkened ocean water. I\u2019m sitting out on the deck that extends out from my bedroom, the French doors swinging in the light breeze while Alex sleeps soundly in the bed just inside the room. The stars are glimmering with it and I can\u2019t help thinking that this is where it all started. This entire mess. One single star fell from the sky, or a piece of it anyway, and all hell has broken loose. Lives were shattered. Souls detached.</p><p>I have a hoodie and boxer shorts on as I sit in one of the chairs, sipping a soda. I\u2019m lost in my thoughts when a tall figure emerges on the beach. It\u2019s strange because the beach becomes vacant usually after sunset and I wonder if maybe it\u2019s a homeless person looking for a place to stay. Then the light of the moon hits the person\u2019s blond hair and highlights his figure even more.</p><p>I feel a slight pull toward him and I set my soda down, jumping to my feet. \u201cLaylen!\u201d</p><p>He stops, turns to look at me, and then he takes off running down the beach. When he reaches a cluster of cliffy rocks, he makes a sharp veer to the left and heads toward the street that curves beside the ocean and leads to the city limits.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I run into my room, slip on my flip-flops, and hurry over to the bed where Alex is fast asleep on top of the comforter.</p><p>I give him a soft shake. \u201cAlex, wake up. \u201c</p><p>He jolts awake, blinking his eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He sits up quickly.</p><p>\u201cI just saw Laylen leaving,\u201d I tell him. \u201cDown the beach. When I called his name, he ran.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he reaches over to the nightstand and flips on the lamp. \u201cWhat direction was he heading?\u201d He blinks wearily at me with some serious bedhead going on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I point over at the north side of the house. \u201cThat way... he\u2019s been acting kind of weird since he...since he almost died and then drank my blood.\u201d</p><p>He swings his bare feet to the floor as he tosses the blanket aside, stretching out his arms. \u201cYou\u2019ve noticed that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve noticed it?\u201d I ask, averting my gaze from his muscles because if I stare at them for too long I\u2019ll have no self-control and get completely caught up in him to the point that I\u2019ll forget about everything else.</p><p>He nods and then stands up from the bed and reaches for his shirt draped over the back of a chair in front of the vanity. He refastens the tie on his drawstring pajama bottoms and then scoops up the keys from the coffee table.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go look for him,\u201d he says and heads for the front door. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we really should, because I don\u2019t really think he\u2019s running away or anything.\u201d He opens the door for me.</p><p>We step outside and he locks the door up. The chilly air hits my skin and I pull the hood of my hoodie over my head, jumping to the side when a stream of sparks shoots out of the bushes and threatens to land on my toes.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Aislin,\u201d Alex says, pulling me onto the grass out of the way. \u201cI get that we need to be protected, but it doesn\u2019t do any good if we get hit by one of her charms.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything as we hurry for the driveway. The house is in a fairly secluded neighborhood, where most of the houses on the block have their porch lights on.</p><p>\u201cAlex, what if Laylen\u2019s...\u201d I trail off as Alex opens the car door for me. I climb in and he rounds the front of the SUV that belongs to the person that owns the house. They\u2019re letting us borrow it to get around, but most of the time, whenever anyone wants to go anywhere, Aislin just transports them there.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if he\u2019s looking for blood?\u201d I ask as he hops into the driver\u2019s seat and shuts the door. I can\u2019t stop thinking about how he said he didn\u2019t want to be saved. \u201cWhat if... what if he\u2019s suicidal? Or what if he\u2019s trying to hurt himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might be,\u201d he says once the engine is running. \u201cIt\u2019s in his nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hurt himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, to drink blood.\u201d</p><p>I reach back and draw the seatbelt over my shoulder, clicking the buckle into place. \u201cOnly because of me. If I wouldn\u2019t have made him bite me back at Draven\u2019s, none of this would be happening.\u201d</p><p>He backs the car down the driveway, his hands gripping on the wheel as he straightens the car onto the road. \u201cHe\u2019s drank blood before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly a few times,\u201d I point out. \u201cHe told me that biting me would be different... that I was too innocent and pure; that it would make for a bad addiction.\u201d</p><p>He swallows hard and drives down the main road, flying well above the speed limit. The houses whiz by and the roar of the tires fills up the quiet cab. I can tell he\u2019s upset and I realize that I should have kept my mouth shut. Too much information is not a good thing when it comes to things like blood, innocence, and me.</p><p>I watch out the window as we drive past houses, stores, gas stations, and even sections of the beach. An hour passes and I\u2019m about to give up and tell Alex to go back to the house\u2014that maybe Laylen went back\u2014when Alex makes an abrupt swerve to the right and ramps the SUV over the curb. He skids it across the parking lot, slamming it to a stop in front of the back exit of an older building lit up with neon signs and twinkle lights flashing from the grimy windows. I spot Laylen by the back door, tall and lean with his skin gleaming red beneath the glow of the lighting.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s he with?\u201d I ask, clicking my seat belt loose.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Alex turns off the engine and we hop out of the car, running around to the front of the vehicle.</p><p>Alex immediately snatches ahold of my hand when we walk by a group of men loitering next to a rusty truck with the tailgate dropped. The smell of cigarettes pollutes the air and the men make catcalls at me as we pass by them. Alex turns toward them when one of them makes a remark about my ass, but I tug on his arm.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I say, dragging him across the parking lot. \u201cNow is not the time.\u201d</p><p>He shoots a dirty look at me, but continues walking in the direction of Laylen, taking long strides, and I have to jog to keep up. I start to run when we get close. I\u2019m worried who it could be and what they could be doing hidden in the corner of this rundown place. I think deep down I might really know what\u2019s happening, however I won\u2019t believe it until I see it for myself.</p> <p>When I reach him, it feels like all the wind has been knocked out of me. I collapse to my knees, struggling to breathe as I watch him feed off another woman, savoring her blood in pure ecstasy as he drinks it from her veins.</p><p>It takes me a few minutes to gather myself enough to stand up and, by the time I rise to my feet again, Alex has already gotten Laylen\u2019s attention. He is standing cautiously in front of Laylen with his hands out to the side and Laylen has the woman\u2019s neck grasped in his hand, her body slumped back like he\u2019s about to dip her. Her black hair is dripping with blood and there are bite marks on her neck and arms.</p><p>When Laylen spots me, his eyes bulge wide, his pupils are possessed by darkness as blood drips from his fangs and lips to the front of his shirt. Alex takes a vigilant step toward him, but Laylen puts up a hand and backs up to the side of the building with the woman in tow.</p><p>\u201cStay away from me,\u201d he hisses and smears the blood from his lips with the back of his arm.</p><p>Alex stops with his hands up in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m just going to check to see if she\u2019s okay.\u201d He nods his head at the woman and dares another step forward.</p><p>Laylen growls at him and snaps his fangs as the woman whimpers, clutching onto his arm for support. \u201cI swear to God, man, if you come any closer, I\u2019ll break your fucking neck.\u201d</p><p>Alex rolls his eyes. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d he says, lowering his hands to his sides.</p><p>Laylen shakes his head and his lip curls up as he snarls. \u201cOh, I will. I\u2019d be more than happy to in fact. Maybe it would finally put you in your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what place would that be?\u201d Alex asks coolly.</p><p>\u201cThe place where we all live,\u201d Laylen spits. \u201cThe place of self-hatred. The place where I live.\u201d His dark eyes skim to me. \u201cWhere Gemma lives. The place where you feel miserable all the time and utterly hate who you are inside and out. The place where you wish you could get away from, even if it means being dead.\u201d</p><p>I get what he\u2019s saying way too well. There were countless times where I thought about ending it, not seeing a point. Every fucking day was exactly the same, no feeling, no movement inside, no emotion. Then I finally felt it, sadness, for the very first time. The emotion was overwhelming and hard to cope with. It is the same, even now, like how I felt when I was with Nicholas. I sometimes wish I could get rid of it, even if it means giving up everything forever.</p><p>\u201cEveryone lives there,\u201d Alex says, rocking forward and reducing the space between them. \u201cEveryone in their own way knows what it\u2019s like to hate themselves. Look at all the shit I\u2019ve done to people over the years... how could I not hate myself?\u201d</p><p>The rawness of the moment makes me glad I\u2019m here to witness it, even though there\u2019s so much pain and anguish carried in it. It reminds me that everyone feels pain and sometimes they try to turn it off because it\u2019s easier than feeling it. Ultimately, though, our emotions own us and we have to take the good in with the bad.</p><p>Laylen shakes his head, but then releases the woman go. She crumbles to the ground and he sinks to his knees with her, sitting in the gravel and dirt. He cradles his head in his hands, brings his knees to his chest and it sounds like he\u2019s sobbing.</p><p>Alex glances at me and then nods his head at Laylen. \u201cCheck on him and I\u2019ll see if she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I nod and sit down beside Laylen while Alex makes sure the woman\u2019s all right. I place a hand on Laylen\u2019s shoulder and he tenses. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask cautiously.</p><p>He sucks in a sharp breath and then leans away from my touch, his fangs retreating back into his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me... I think I killed her... I could feel her blood running out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s okay.\u201d Alex walks over and stands behind me. \u201cShe\u2019s unconscious, but still breathing and has a pulse.\u201d</p><p>Laylen elevates his head and I instantly notice how watery his eyes are. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s still there.\u201d A tear drifts down his cheek and I watch it slide to his jaw.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s still there?\u201d I reach forward and wipe the tear away.</p><p>\u201cThe...the hunger and need to feed.\u201d He chokes. \u201cGod, I can\u2019t get it out of my head. It\u2019s worse than before... something about almost dying changed me.\u201d There\u2019s so much torture in his voice; my heart aches to take it away from him and bear it myself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d I repeat, rubbing his tear between my thumb and my finger. He may be part Vampire, but I\u2019d like to see Alex or Aislin question his humanity now. His tears are as real a mine\u2014as real as anyone\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>He rests his forehead on his knees. \u201cYou and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I brush my fingers through his hair. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been there for me and now I\u2019m there for you.\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take much convincing after that. We prop the woman up against the door where someone\u2019s sure to find her and then we get back in the car to drive a way. No one speaks the entire drive and I tell myself that everything will be okay. That we got him back and that he didn\u2019t kill the woman, although I can\u2019t help worrying that he\u2019s forever changed. And what if he is? What if the Laylen I met is gone?</p><p>When we arrive back at the beach house, morning is kissing the land. Laylen goes straight into his room and says he is going to bed. I\u2019m afraid he might leave again, but Alex promises that we\u2019ll all take turns watching him. We wake up Aislin and reluctantly fill her in on what\u2019s been going on. She\u2019s upset, however she still wants to help Laylen. I sit in the living room for about an hour listening to Alex and Aislin argue over what to do while the seashell clock on the living room wall ticks the wasted time away.</p><p>\u201cI might know a spell,\u201d Aislin says, crossing her legs and leaning back in the chair. She has a tank top on and a pair of pajama bottoms with little pink hearts on them. \u201cOne that might help him get in the right state of mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight state of mind?\u201d I ask, unzipping my hoodie to take it off as the heat of the day gets to me. \u201cYou mean out of the Vampire state of mind?\u201d</p><p>She narrows her green eyes at me. \u201cLook, he hasn\u2019t always been like this. He didn\u2019t used to crave blood until you came along.</p><p>\u201cAislin,\u201d Alex warns, helping me slip off my jacket. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s true,\u201d she says. \u201cI can tell that you think it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can think whatever you want.\u201d I get to my feet as the prickle does a nagging dance on the back of my neck and I fill vindictive. \u201cBut I\u2019ve actually talked to him about this long before he even bit me, and he told me the craving is always there.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a cold, hard stare. \u201cWell, you forced him to delve into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, you\u2019re right.\u201d I head around the couch and toward the hallway. \u201cBut you\u2019ve also done a lot of shitty things, too, like help everyone make sure my soul is detached. \u201c</p><p>It\u2019s a great exit line and I take the opportunity to leave the room. I go to Laylen\u2019s room and find him out on the deck with the blood of the woman still on his hands, shirt, and jeans. His arms are resting on the wood railing as he stares out at the ocean waves rolling up against the sandy shore.</p><p>I walk up beside him and put my own arms on the railing. I gaze out at the ocean, waiting for him to speak first because I can sense that it\u2019s one of those moments. He needs to say what\u2019s on his mind first before I can plan what I\u2019m going to say, so it\u2019ll be the right words.</p><p>\u201cFor the last few years,\u201d he finally starts with his eyes fixed on the ocean, \u201cI\u2019ve felt so empty. After I was turned into a Vampire, Alex and Aislin wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with me\u2014none of the Keepers would. My parents were already gone, so...I was basically all alone.\u201d He turns his head to the side and then meets my gaze. \u201cI pretended it was okay. I shut down and it helped, but all that crap I\u2019ve kept bottled is slipping out and I don\u2019t know what else to do other than feed because that\u2019s what my instincts are telling me to do.\u201d</p><p>I place my hand on his arm in a comforting gesture. \u201cLaylen I\u2019m so sorry for making you bite me... I didn\u2019t realize how bad things would get.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m really screwing everything up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to bite you. It was my fault.\u201d</p><p>The prickle emerges and suddenly I know I need to say something important. I turn to face him and he moves with me so we\u2019re facing each other, my neck angled up to actually look at him. The sun shines from behind him and I blink against the brightness.</p><p>\u201cI know you want to take responsibility for this,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I kind of need to, you know. It\u2019s part of learning and I need to learn because I spent so much time in this dark, subdued, hindering place. It makes it hard to know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. I need to learn from this and I need you to accept that if I wouldn\u2019t have been there to make you do it, then we wouldn\u2019t be in this place.\u201d</p><p>He opens his mouth, but then quickly shuts it when he spots tears forming in my eyes as my guilt becomes too much to keep bottled inside me. He lets out a sad sigh and then wraps his arms around me, tensing just a little before relaxing into me.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Gemma Lucas,\u201d he says, kissing the top of my head. \u201cYou can take the blame for this one, but the next thing we screw up together is all on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d I whisper against his chest as hot tears stream down my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be many more. At least on my part.\u201d I listen to his heartbeat. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, right?\u201d</p><p>It takes him a moment to answer. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d He carries doubt, yet I don\u2019t anymore. I\u2019ll make sure to help him, no matter what sacrifices I have to make. I will make up for what I did to him.</p><p>We don\u2019t move. We barely breathe as we hold onto each other and stand in the sunlight out on the deck. We stay that way for a long time, just two friends who understand each other. Two people who know what it feels like to have no one. Maybe that is no longer the case, though.</p><p>Maybe we have each other.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>\u201cI feel like today is the day,\u201d I tell Alex as we sit down on the bed, cross-legged, facing each other with the Ira positioned between us on the white comforter.</p><p>It\u2019s been two days since Laylen\u2019s episode and he seems to be feeling better, for the most part. He\u2019s talking to me again and I even caught him smiling, which has so much beauty in it that it\u2019s almost heart stopping to witness. I in no way think he\u2019s completely gotten over it, however. I know it will take time. A lot of time. But I\u2019ll make sure to be there for him through it.</p><p>Alex crooks an eyebrow as he leans back on his hands. \u201cWow, someone\u2019s really cheerful today.\u201d</p><p>I skim my fingers across the sparkling, teal glass. \u201cWell, it\u2019s about time, right?\u201d</p><p>The French doors are agape, letting the sea breeze blow into the room and the white curtains surrounding the canopy bed flap around us.</p><p>\u201cI love the spout of confidence,\u201d he says. \u201cBut can I ask where it\u2019s coming from?\u201d</p> <p>I shrug, putting my hand onto my lap. \u201cNowhere in particular.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s actually a lie. The feeling was seeded and started sprouting when I\u2019d gotten done hugging Laylen for hours, then I\u2019d gone back to my room and cried. Cried for him. For me. For my mother. For Alex and Aislin who can\u2019t help who they are\u2014or were. I cry for everyone\u2019s lives that have been messed up because of this stupid star inside me and the tears were liberating. I woke up feeling everything again; not just the heat of the sun or the touch of the air. I could feel what was inside my heart and who I really was.</p><p>A girl with a lot of power.</p><p>A girl who was going to save her mom and the world so people like Laylen, who are genuinely good at heart, can have a chance at life.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting weird,\u201d Alex states with curiosity.</p><p>I put both of my hands on the Ira and watch the outer shell glow. \u201cAs weird as I always am.\u201d I stare at my reflection in the glass, my brown hair hanging to my shoulders, my violet eyes radiating the life within them. Most of the cuts and bruises on my face have healed. On the inside of me, though, deep beneath my skin, I still feel torn.</p><p>Alex hooks a finger under my chin and tips my face up to his. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay? You\u2019ve been through a lot over the last few weeks and I\u2019m worried you\u2019re going to break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I should be asking you the same question since a few weeks ago your main concern was that I\u2019d go back to being soulless.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, frowning. \u201cI may have done stuff to make you think that, but only because I thought it was what I was supposed to do. Deep down I was secretly hoping that you\u2019d be stronger than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what verdict did you reach on that one?\u201d I hold his gaze, waiting for his answer.</p><p>\u201cI got exactly what I was hoping for.\u201d He slides his finger up my chin and touches my lips as one of the curtains flaps over our heads like a canopy. \u201cNow will you please quit being stubborn and kiss me? You haven\u2019t kissed me all day.\u201d</p><p>The strange thing about all of this is after Laylen\u2019s and my talk, things went back to friendly with us. The connection drawing me to him, sexually anyway was broken. I wonder if it\u2019s because we finally talked about the problem out loud. If maybe admitting what we did freed us from everything we were trapping inside.</p><p>I give Alex what he asks and lean over the Ira to kiss him. Our tongues twine together as I knot my fingers through his hair, pulling him closer while he presses on the small of my back. Our lips spark like firecrackers and drive my body to the edge of wanting more than just a kiss. It feels like it\u2019s starved and I realize that it\u2019s been forever since he\u2019s been inside me. Jesus, I want to feel it again. So damn badly.</p><p>He consumes every part of my body with his hands until I can\u2019t take it anymore. Finally, I climb on his lap and straddle him. He groans as our bodies conform together and I feel his hardness pressing between my legs. We kiss for an eternity, our bodies and tongues melting together and the spark of electricity combusts with eagerness. It wants to be near him just as much as I do and I moan from the heat and need of my sexually deprived body.</p><p>His fingers leisurely stray up the back of my shirt, leaving a searing hot path on my skin. I put my hands on his shoulders, pulling myself closer, and rocking my hips against him, rubbing against his hardness. His touch becomes rougher as his hands travel to the front of my body and his fingers graze my stomach, drifting downwards to my hips. He grips me, pressing his fingertips into my skin as I continue to rock against him. His lips make a fervent path from my mouth to the front of my neck, his teeth gently grazing in an echo of his kisses.</p><p>My head willingly falls back as he sucks on my skin and a possessive heat swells through my body, building between my legs. I rock my hips faster and he moves with me perfectly in tune. He groans and bites at my skin while I slip my hands under the top of his shirt and stab my nails into his back.</p><p>He responds with a shudder as his skin splits open. \u201cFuck.... Gemma... that feels so good...\u201d</p><p>My body climbs higher and higher into bliss until I feel like I\u2019m on the verge of exploding. I tremble, my skin dampening with sweat as fireworks shower through my entire body and the prickle goes wild on the back of my neck. I\u2019m panting as his hand moves up to my chest, slipping under my bra. He cups my breast, grazing his finger across my nipple, adding more heat to the bursting sensation.</p><p>I scream out in utter and complete bliss, clutching onto the nearest thing and I end up making more scratches on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI want to be inside you so fucking bad,\u201d Alex moans against my neck as he grips my hip with one hand and pinches softly on my nipple with his other. He continues feeling me, basking me with kisses and soft nicks until I start to relax and come down from the high he put in my body. He leans back and looks at me with glazed over eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he whispers and moves in for another kiss.</p><p>I catch my breath and lean back, breaking the moment as I hurry to climb off his lap</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving me high and dry after that?\u201d He fakes a sexy pout. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>I hold up my finger as I stare down at the Ira iridescent from the energy radiating off me. \u201cIt\u2019s for a good reason,\u201d I say. He keeps pouting as I place my hands on the glass ball, grasping onto the emotions he instilled in me by kissing me and making me orgasm. Lust, desire, pure and heavenly elation are mixing inside my bloodstream, along with electricity. There\u2019s so much power inside me and I let it drain out, heating the glass of the Ira.</p><p>\u201cAlex hold onto me,\u201d I whisper as the glass begins to glow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting smarter by the second. You know that?\u201d He places a hand on my knee, scooting closer. The contact only amplifies the voltage of my emotions and makes the crystal ball glow brighter. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>I nod as a teal glow bursts throughout the room and the curtains float above us. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m about as sure as the last time you asked me.\u201d</p><p>He cracks a smile, but it\u2019s a nervous one. He\u2019s anxious as hell.</p><p>I\u2019m nervous as hell as well, and the feeling only magnifies as more energy pours through me. \u201cDo you have the diamond?\u201d</p><p>He pats the pocket of his jeans with his free hand. \u201cYep, it\u2019s right here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper and then I take a deep breath as light and energy expand, consuming every inch of space existing around us. The curtains singe from the blinding glow and scattered ashes fall over the floor while smoke begins to swarm around us in a whirlwind.</p><p>Alex tenses as the heat of the Ira raises our own temperature to the point where we start to sweat. \u201cAre you sure you want to keep going?\u201d he questions.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I reply with confidence and then close my eyes.</p><p>The first thing that appears in my mind is a clear picture of the lake. Panicking, I shove the image out of my mind, not wanting to drop us there. I focus on the tunnel I went in during the vision I entered with Nicholas; dirt walls that leak water, damp air, darkness, and Water Fey. The ground begins to vibrate and I feel the world shift apart, open up, and swallow us whole.</p> <p>The tunnel is as dark as I remember. The damp air causes my clothes to cling to my skin while the dirty water seeps from the ceiling to drip down on our heads. If what Nicholas said was true about the Ira, then we\u2019re not in vision form, but we\u2019ll only know if that\u2019s true when we cross paths with someone.</p><p>\u201cDo you know which way to go?\u201d Alex asks, wiping some dirty water off his forehead as I tuck the Ira into the side pocket of my denim shorts. \u201cWhere we first went in the vision when we arrived?\u201d</p><p>I glance left and then right. \u201cNo, the only reason I found the cave where the vision took place was because Nicholas was running from a Water Faerie... \u201cI head to my left, inspecting the muddy ground and watery walls, hoping something will spark a memory. \u201cI can\u2019t remember which way we went...I don\u2019t even know if we\u2019re in the same place.\u201d</p><p>Alex releases my hand and drags his fingers through his damp hair, leaving it sticking up all over. \u201cOkay, left or right?\u201d</p><p>An abrupt scream reverberates from the left side of the tunnel and the vines growing from the ceiling move with the sound.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say quickly and we dash down the right side of the tunnel, leaving the noise behind.</p><p>Alex takes my hand again as we hike through the dimly lit tunnel, listening to the horrific screams shooting at us in every direction. His touch brings me a little comfort, though not much. I can\u2019t help thinking how I\u2019ve only been down here for a few minutes and I already feel like leaving while my mom\u2019s been down here for years.</p><p>God, how does she feel? How broken is she?</p><p>I\u2019m telling myself that I have to be strong, that I can do this, when a white, wispy Water Fey appears in the distance. I tense as its hollow eyes lock in our direction</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d I hiss, pointing at it as I continue to walk through the mud.</p><p>He puts his finger to his lips, shushing me, and we keep moving, one foot in front of the other. As we get closer to it, my heart thumps, upping my adrenaline and amplifying up the sparks. My legs tremble, my knees knocking together, and my breathing becomes erratic and loud.</p> <p>The Water Faerie doesn\u2019t budge, watching us as it floats in the same space it appeared in. When we pass by it, it opens its gaping mouth and lets out a breathless scream that rings loudly inside my ears. The vines above our heads move again and brush the top of my head. I clutch onto Alex\u2019s arm as the Water Faerie rotates around and trails after us, the bottom of its fabric body dragging along the ground.</p><p>The farther we get into the tunnel, the more the Water Faeries multiply, flying out from every angle and direction. Pieces of their fabric bodies touch our faces and head as they fly back and forth above us, their boney fingers reaching down in our direction, but never touching. The longer it goes on, the more afraid I get. The fear only seems to encourage them and they get rowdier by the minute. Then I remember Alex said they feed on fear, so I try to calm down, however it\u2019s difficult.</p><p>Just when I think that I can\u2019t take it anymore, the tunnel opens up to a cave. A rock-shaped throne is in the center, the back coiling up to the ceiling. But the Queen isn\u2019t sitting in it like she was when I saw the vision. That\u2019s when I realize something about all of this is terribly wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He gives me a quizzical look. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t how it works.\u201d I look over my shoulder at the herd of Water Faeries floating behind us, making raspy noises and taunting screams. \u201cWe don\u2019t come in here by ourselves. We\u2019re brought in by some sort of Water Faerie... This isn\u2019t what I saw in the vision.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s brows furrow. \u201cBut how can that be? If you saw it, then it should happen, right?\u201d</p><p>Someone\u2014or something\u2014clears their throat from behind us and we spin around. Standing in the cluster of white fabric covered bodies is the Queen. Her frosty hair veils down her back and her eyes are soulless, yet I detect a hint of amusement in her desolate character.</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks like I have some unexpected visitors,\u201d she says and the Water Faeries begin to swarm around our heads like bees. We hunch over as the Queen steps toward us, holding the bottom of her dress. \u201cComing here willingly to be tortured in my world? Let the Fey take you and torture you? I have to say, you two are brave souls.\u201d</p> <p>This is all wrong. This is not how I saw it. This is not how it\u2019s supposed to go.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>If I can\u2019t fix it, then Alex, my mom, myself and the world are screwed.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>During my first visit to the City of Crystal, Dyvinius had explained to me how visions work. He said if a vision wasn\u2019t seen correctly then the world as we knew it could shift. I never considered the depth of what he\u2019d said until now. The vision that I took Nicholas into, the one where we entered The Underworld, never really was finished. Nicholas had flipped out and choked me until I nearly blacked out and took us back. I\u2019m assuming it means I didn\u2019t read it clearly, and now I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen.</p><p>I\u2019m the worst hero of all time. I really am.</p><p>\u201cI have to say,\u201d says the Queen as she circles around us with her dress dragging in the mud, \u201cIt isn\u2019t every day that someone voluntarily enters my world. Usually it\u2019s with much force and fussing on my Faeries\u2019 part. Yet the two of you enter it at your own free will.\u201d She stops in front of us with her hands behind her back. \u201cTell me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came here to get something,\u201d I tell her in a firm voice as I grasp onto Alex\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d She turns around toward the tunnel. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>We follow her down the tunnel in the direction we\u2019d just come from, the mob of Water Faeries trailing behind us, some daring to touch our heads. The Queen is taller than Alex, her head clips each one of the vines dangling from the ceiling. With the contact, they shrivel and die, the browned pieces fluttering to the ground like ash. In each of their places a new vine regrows. This pattern continues on and on, death and life repeating itself.</p><p>We finally enter a room. There\u2019s a slender, antique table and an eccentric chandelier made of thorns with vines in it. The chairs around the table have backs that look like thorny rose bushes and the idea of sitting on them makes me cringe.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat.\u201d The Queen gestures at the chairs, gathering her dress as she sits down at the head of the table.</p><p>Alex and I reluctantly sit down, making sure to keep our backs straight so no thorns stab us. The Water Faeries linger in the arched doorway where water cascades down the sides of the wall and floods the floor of the room, making the floor sopping wet.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve come here for something?\u201d The Queen asks, tapping her long, black fingernails on the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cSomeone, actually,\u201d Alex tells her, exchanging a glance with me as he holds my hand below the table. \u201cHer name is Jocelyn Lucas.\u201d</p><p>I can tell she knows who we\u2019re talking about by the way her posture briefly stiffens. \u201cTell me, boy, what is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex Avery,\u201d Alex says with some hesitance as he runs a finger along the back of my hand.</p><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re a Keeper.\u201d She continues to thrum her nails against the table, her eyes moving from him to me. I unintentionally cower back and get disciplined for doing so as a thorn enters the center of my back. \u201cAnd you? What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>I lean forward, pushing past the pain, too worried to reach around and pluck the thorn out of my back. \u201cGemma Lucas.\u201d</p><p>She ceases thrumming her fingers. \u201cSo you are, what?\u201d she asks. \u201cThe daughter of Jocelyn?\u201d</p><p>I nod and then breathe inwardly as Alex reaches around and picks the thorn out of my back. \u201cI am,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The Queen muses over something. \u201cWhat did you expect exactly? That you\u2019d come down here and demand I give you my best slave all because you asked really, really nicely?\u201d Her hollow mouth forms a pout and it\u2019s unsettling to look at.</p><p>Alex reaches for his pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought something to trade for Jocelyn\u2019s freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can assure you that you have nothing I want,\u201d the Queen replies with her gaunt chin tipped up in arrogance.</p><p>Alex slips the flawlessly cut sapphire out and drops it down on the table. \u201cNot even for this?\u201d</p><p>She looks shocked, but then she starts to chortle and the chandelier above us shakes and flickers along with the puddles on the ground. The Queen finally stops laughing, wiping tears from her eyes, and then her laughter rapidly shifts to anger.</p><p>She pounds her fist on the table and a few of the chairs topple over while the Water Faeries flee. \u201cYou think that you can come down here and make a bargain with something the Keepers took from me to begin with?\u201d She rises from her chair, towering over us as she swishes her dress behind her. \u201cHow dare you insult me? You are just like your father. Taking whatever you want and doing whatever you please.\u201d</p><p>I want to bang my head against the table. It\u2019s ridiculous how Stephan can haunt us when he\u2019s not even here.</p><p>\u201cI have been waiting for the day when I\u2019d see your father again.\u201d She strides toward us and reaches us in only a few steps. \u201cSo I can settle what he started a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Alex holds her petrifying gaze. \u201cI understand that you have had some issues with my father, but I can assure you that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence.\u201d The Queen tips her head back and roars, making the whole room quake. The walls begin to cave in as she pants ravenously and the roof cracks. The power in her is clearly evident and it makes me nervous of what else she can do. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear excuses. I always swore that one day I\u2019d get even with Stephan, whatever it took, and here you are. It\u2019s the perfect opportunity. A much smaller version of him.\u201d She makes a pinching motion with her boney finger. \u201cHowever, it\u2019ll still do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not his father,\u201d I interrupt, but then shrink back when the Queen\u2019s attention focuses entirely on me. \u201cA-And he only came down here because I asked him to, so if you want to take this out on anyone, take it out on me.\u201d</p><p>The Queen\u2019s face alters from anger to inquisitiveness. She suddenly calms and walks back toward her chair. \u201cYou know, Jocelyn never mentioned having a daughter, so I find it peculiar that someone would show up with the son of one of my sworn enemies and claim to be her daughter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I am,\u201d I assure her in a surprisingly steady voice. \u201cAnd I want to take her back with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake her back?\u201d She throws her head back and laughs. \u201cOh, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no way I can do that because you yourself are never leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can leave,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI came here through the Ira, and you can\u2019t keep us here\u2014there are laws that say you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her grin deepens and then she swats her hand through the air. I feel a tug on my pocket and the Ira abruptly shoots out and flies across the room, smacking into the wall where it shatters. Shards of teal glass land on the floor and table and I swear I feel pieces of my own heart join them. I leap from my chair, ready to wring her neck and hopefully kill her, but Alex grabs the tail of my shirt and quickly pulls me back down.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit!\u201d I cry, flipping a piece of glass off my arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do whatever I want.\u201d She smiles before motioning her hand around the room. \u201cNow, let me welcome you to your new home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>I want to get the hell out of here. Run. Flee. However the Ira is gone, destroyed back on the table, and I don\u2019t know another way out of The Underworld.</p><p>The Queen locks us in a cement chamber that has a single metal-framed bed with a ratty mattress on it. There are bars on the door, which allow light to filter in. We have no water. No food. No toilet. It\u2019s basically jail except for there aren\u2019t any guards, only crazy Water Fey who feed off torment and fear.</p> <p>After the Queen leaves, Alex and I lie down on the bed, side by side with our feet up on the wall, waiting for whatever comes next. Torture? Death? Something worse? Surprisingly, we\u2019re both pretty calm, but I think we\u2019ve entered some weird state were we\u2019re too shocked to panic.</p><p>\u201cLet me welcome you to your new home.\u201d I mimic the Queens tone with bitterness in my voice. I kick the side if the wall. \u201cWhat a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really starting to wonder just how long the list of people who my father has pissed off is,\u201d Alex says with an exhausted sigh as he stretches out his arms above his head.</p><p>\u201cProbably pretty long,\u201d I say, yawning. I\u2019m exhausted\u2014the energy I used to come here took a lot out of me. If it weren\u2019t for the screams from outside, I might close my eyes and go to sleep</p><p>\u201cWe should find a way out.\u201d He props up on his arms and looks over at me. His hair is wet from the water drizzling from the ceiling and so is the collar of his shirt</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I motion at the room. \u201cI mean, look at this place. There\u2019s no way out except for the door.\u201d</p> <p>He lies back down on the mattress and turns his head toward me. \u201cDo you have any idea why this didn\u2019t work out like the vision you saw?\u201d</p><p>I massage the sides of my temples and shut my eyes. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t finish seeing the vision, at least that\u2019s what I think happened. Nicholas forced me to take us back before I saw the whole damn thing play out.\u201d A screams echoes from close by and I shudder, opening my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, crossing my arms over my stomach.</p><p>\u201cSorry for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor messing this up.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and rotates to his side, supporting his elbow against the mattress and resting his head against his hand. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mess this up, Gemma. You were simply taking a risk to try to do something that was right and things didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I screwed up and didn\u2019t plan things well enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes things are kind of out of our hands.\u201d</p><p>I turn to my side and face him, my arm tucked under my head. Our faces are mere inches away and it\u2019s comforting knowing he\u2019s close. \u201cBut I do it so often and I\u2019ve just barely started actually living my life,\u201d I say. \u201cImagine how bad my screw up list is going to be in like five years... if I get that far.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he insists, tucking strands of my hair behind my ear. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll get better\u2014things will get better. I promise.\u201d Once he gets my hair out of the way, he strokes my cheeks with his fingers until I feel like I\u2019m going to doze off.</p><p>\u201cWhat will she do to us?\u201d I murmur tucking my hands under my head.</p><p>His fingers briefly stop moving. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d He\u2019s lying. I can tell by the unevenness in his voice and the way the current of the electricity speeds up.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me.\u201d I yawn, forcing my eyes to stay open. \u201cI need to know what I\u2019m in store for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want to know?\u201d His fingers delicately caress my cheek in soft, consistent patterns. I nod, letting his touch calm me. \u201cUnbearable pain,\u201d he says.</p><p>I feel strangled, hands wrapping around my neck, suffocating me. Pain? What kind of pain? \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>It gets quiet. Water drips on the mattress and us. Alex keeps touching my face; my chin, my lips, my jawline, as if he\u2019s worried he\u2019ll never touch me again. I start wondering what death is like, too. Whether it\u2019s better than getting tortured. Better than feeling unbearable pain. Better than feeling the burden of my mistakes.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Alex says unexpectedly, rolling on top of me, his warm body flawlessly settling over mine. \u201cNo matter what happens, you try to hold on, okay? Turn it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn it off?\u201d I open my eyes to find him passionately staring down at me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just like you used to,\u201d he whispers and tenderly kisses my lips. \u201cJust turn off anything you\u2019re feeling. They thrive on fear and the less they get from you the weaker they\u2019ll get.\u201d He kisses me again and again until I can barely breathe or think straight. Maybe that\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to do. Distract me from my worry. Or maybe he just loves kissing me.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d I say between his breathless kisses. \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d</p><p>He pauses, offering me a sad smile. \u201cYou remember all those times I was around you and I was a douche?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cHow could I forget? I hated you because you were an ass, but the damn electricity made it impossible to actually hate you for real.\u201d</p><p>His smile turns to a real one. \u201cThat entire time I hated doing that to you. In fact, I swear to God it killed me, but I did it because I had to.\u201d He slants closer to me, so we strategically touch in all the right places. \u201cI can control what I feel, Gemma. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been taught to do. The only exception to this is you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how can anyone know what you\u2019re really feeling?\u201d I question, gripping his lean arms. \u201cIf you\u2019re shutting it off and saying contradicting things.\u201d</p><p>He considers what I said then leans down and covers his lips over mine. He kisses me until I\u2019m desperately gasping for air, until my heart\u2019s pumping blood at an unhealthy rate.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel that?\u201d he whispers against my lips. \u201cDo you feel how I make you feel inside?\u201d</p><p>I blink dazedly through emotions of yearning, elation, and contentment. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s exactly how you make me feel inside.\u201d He looks me in the eyes and I can almost see my reflection in his overly large pupils.</p><p>He could be lying, but he might not be. Maybe I do make him feel the same as I do inside. Maybe he\u2019s just as confused as me. Maybe he\u2019s erratic on the inside, unstable. Perhaps it\u2019s the hardest thing in the world not to be close to me. I choose to believe that he\u2019s being genuinely honest because it\u2019d be the perfect ending to my sad story. The one where the guy falls in love with the girl and the girl falls equally in love with the guy. The flaw to this story, however, is that at the moment, there\u2019s no prickle on the back of my neck confirming I\u2019ve felt love before, so in the end it\u2019s only a story.</p><p>Nothing more.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Stephan says, propping a hand on each side of my head.</p><p>Alex is gone and I don\u2019t know where he is. He left me. No he wouldn\u2019t do that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already felt the evil and you\u2019re going to change,\u201d Stephan says, his black eyes glinting wickedly.</p><p>I try to sit up, but I\u2019m glued to the mattress by an unseen force, my arms kinked to the side and my legs stuck together like melting wax. \u201cI\u2019m not evil! I\u2019m good! I know I am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou about beat Nicholas to death,\u201d he reminds. \u201cHow does it feel to have blood on your hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible,\u201d I say, but the red and black triangle singes onto my upper arm, revealing the lie. I can smell the scent of burning flesh and feel the good in me dissolving \u201cI hated every second of it.\u201d</p><p>He leans back and sits down on the mattress, \u201cNow we know that\u2019s a lie. You loved it and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, denying what lies deep inside me; darkness, a shadow opposing the good. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He grins as he elevates his hand and a razor-sharp knife appears in it. \u201cIf that\u2019s true, then I guess I have no use for you.\u201d He moves to swing the knife down.</p><p>I scream as it dives for my heart. As it plummets closer, I shut my eyes and picture the blue beach house while I channel my Foreseer power. As the blade grazes my skin, almost splitting my heart open, I blink myself away from this place.</p><p>My eyelids spring open. \u201cHoly shit!\u201d I gasp. \u201cI know how to get us out of here.\u201d</p><p>Alex is lying on his side, watching me with his arm draped across my stomach. \u201cHow?\u201d he asks and we both sit up on the bed. \u201cGemma, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I catch my breath, wiping the sweat from my forehead. \u201cI can use my power to get us out of here.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, looking lost. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have a crystal ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve gone into visions without them before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but those are visions, not present time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d I say, sitting up. \u201cBut I can try. It pretty much works the same way. I just need to feel enough emotion and try to remember things... memories seem to get it going pretty well.\u201d</p><p>He opens his mouth to protest as he sits up. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d His eyes dodge do the door and he quickly stands to his feet, grabbing my hand and pulling me behind him.</p><p>A Water Fey watches us from the open doorway, interweaving through the ceiling vines as it heads toward us. It stops when it\u2019s about to reach the bed and seconds later the Queen appears behind it. She\u2019s changed into a black, mermaid-shaped dress that has red roses growing on vines, which trim the bottom half. Her frosty hair has been braided up on the top of her head and is woven with black ribbons and her lips are tinted purple.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d she says and snaps her fingers. \u201cBoth of you, follow me.\u201d</p><p>Alex and I trade a look and then we follow the Queen out of the cell. We quietly walk just behind her as she struts down the tunnel lined with jail doors. Water Fey enclose us, floating in curving paths. I consider shutting my eyes and seeing if I can really pull it off\u2014take us out of this place in the blink of an eye\u2014but I can\u2019t just yet, not until I find my mom. As I glance over at Alex, however, guilt begins to rot in my stomach. I drag him into this mess and look where it gets him. Now what\u2019s going to happen to us? Will we get tortured until we go insane? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All thoughts of what\u2019s right and wrong leave my mind when we reach the end of the tunnel. As I take in the square space only one thought remains inside my mind.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>It\u2019s worse than I\u2019d expected. Water Faeries are everywhere along with what look like ordinary humans, but I\u2019m guessing not all of them are. Each one of the humans is strapped to a wooden plank perched on a steel stand. They\u2019re being tortured in different ways, some with knives inserted into their arms, others getting their bodies stretched with ropes attached to a large wooden wheel. Some have Water Fey hovering over them and it looks like they\u2019re trying to kiss them, but I think they might be doing something worse.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at them,\u201d Alex whispers in my ear and I jump, startled. \u201cFocus on turning it off.\u201d</p> <p>I try my best, but it\u2019s hard to block out the sounds...the cries...the anguish and suffering. It\u2019s pretty much impossible and I end up being overwhelmed by it.</p><p>The Queen leads us to a back room that has dirt walls and a stone floor. The ceiling arches up toward what looks like a skylight, but the glass is frosted so I can\u2019t see what\u2019s on the other side. A single wooden chair that has straps attached to the arms and legs is perched in the center of the room.</p><p>The Queen shuts the door and then turns to face us. \u201cTell me, Gemma. What are you most afraid of in this world?\u201d</p><p>Love. I blink at my mind\u2019s declaration. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, shifting my weight uneasily.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d She taps her lips and a toothless grin spreads across her face. \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s time we found out. Don\u2019t you agree?\" She raises her arms in the air and claps her hands together. \u201cThink about it. Finally discovering the one thing that will make you lose your sanity. Isn\u2019t it exciting?\u201d</p> <p>Two Water Faeries zoom up behind me and wrap their boney fingers around my arms. Alex grabs my hand and holds onto me as tightly as he can, attempting to pull me away from them.</p><p>\u201cLet me go first,\u201d he says, tugging on my arm. He reaches up and tries to punch one of the Water Fey.</p><p>It swerves out of his reach, opens its mouth, and screams so loudly the room rattles and dirt crumbles from the walls.</p><p>The Queen shakes her head as she ambles around the chair, tracing her finger along the back. \u201cI have a feeling that forcing you to watch her get tortured is going to provide a very great amount of fear in you.\u201d</p><p>Two more Water Faeries come flying up behind us and wrap their fingers around Alex\u2019s arms. He tries to shove them off, but Water Fey are impressively strong for such boney creatures.</p><p>The Water Faeries drag me over to the chair, separating Alex and I from each other. I sink into their hold, and challenged their strength against my dead weight as I plant the heels of my shoes into the ground. But it\u2019s a worthless effort.</p> <p>Once we reach the chair, they shove me down into it and the Queen stands behind me as she snakes an arm around my neck. The Fey secure my legs and wrists to the chair with the straps before the Queen leans over my shoulder, putting her lips near my ear.</p><p>\u201cFear is the most powerful emotion,\u201d she whispers, her foul breath startling icy against my cheek. \u201cAnd the most painful.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s where she\u2019s wrong. Fear is just fear in my eyes and I\u2019ve experienced it many times. There are so many more emotions that can be so much more painful; sadness, anger, caring for someone that in return can split your heart open and stomp on it.</p><p>\u201cNow, which way to go here?\u201d the Queen dithers as she struts around the chair and stands in front of me. \u201cOh, I know.\u201d She sticks out her hand and one of the Water Fey swoops down from the ceiling and drops a sapphire in her hand. \u201cSince you guys were so kind to bring it back to me, I\u2019ll let you be the first person I use it on again.\u201d She slams her hands down on the armrests and hunches her back as she leans down into my face. \u201cWhat do you say, Gemma. Shall we torture your soul?\u201d</p><p>Laughter slips though my lips. \u201cTorture my soul,\u201d I say, inching closer so our foreheads almost touch. \u201cBeen there. Done that.\u201d</p><p>She snarls and forcefully shakes the chair, letting me feel her wrath. \u201cAre you mocking me? Me? The Queen of the Underworld?\u201d</p><p>No. I\u2019m just trying to stay calm, but the irony of what she\u2019s going to do is kind of amusing.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your sanity already?\u201d she snaps, the tight grip of her fingers rupturing the wooden armrest of the chair. \u201cAre you worthless?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say dryly.</p><p>She gapes at me, but then all shock and rage erase from her expression as she holds the sapphire up in front of my face. \u201cHow about I take that smirk off your face?\u201d</p><p>I try to turn off anything that I\u2019m feeling as the sapphire begins to shimmer and vibrantly glow, but then an image of Alex lying in a pool of his own blood beside the lake presses into my head and fear starts to surface. I shove it down, yet then I see my mom rotting away in this awful place. The Queen\u2019s laughter echoes inside my head as I see myself in a room alone, secluded, and detached. Then it shifts to a different room, one where I\u2019m with Alex and he tells me he loves me and I can\u2019t say it back.</p><p>Fear floods through me as I see myself killing Nicholas, slitting his throat, and liking it. I see the mark on my arm. I see myself standing by Stephan and the Death Walkers. It\u2019s too much and I let out a scream wanting to rip my heart out of my chest so I don\u2019t have to feel the pain anymore.</p><p>The Queen laughs as I scream again when I picture myself burning into ash. The speed of the images only quickens the more time goes by, flipping at such a swift rate they start to muddle together.</p><p>Then suddenly it stops; the noise in my head and the ache in my heart. When I open my eyes, the Queen and the sapphire have dropped to the floor.</p><p>Seconds later, the Water Fey also drop to the floor in piles that encompass the Queen\u2019s slackened body. Time freezes for a moment as Alex and I take in what happened.</p><p>We both stare at the heaps of boney bodies and then Alex rushes toward me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d I ask as he crouches down and unlatches the straps around my ankles.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he says.</p><p>I glance down at my locket. \u201cDid this do it?\u201d</p><p>He eyes the violet-stoned pedant. \u201cI\u2019m not sure... It could be... or it might have something to do with you... with your soul.\u201d He slips the last buckle loose from my wrist and then pulls me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s broken,\u201d I state, massaging my aching chest with my hand. \u201cMaybe it broke her, too.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me with remorse. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here before they wake up.\u201d</p><p>I nod and we run past the bodies of the Fey and out the door. The Water Fey in the torture chamber are out cold, too, slumped all over the floor and the tables; even on the humans who are awake and instantly beg us to free them.</p><p>\u201cCome on, little girl,\u201d one guy with blonde, shaggy hair and sullen eyes purrs from his restraints. \u201cJust undo the straps, okay? I promise I don\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d The sound of Alex\u2019s voice brings me back to reality as he tugs on my arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Remember they\u2019re here for a reason.\u201d</p><p>We hurry away from the guy and I sprint to keep up with Alex as he dashes into the tunnel. The vines above our heads are charred and aren\u2019t re-growing, bits and pieces are all over the ground, floating in the mud puddles.</p><p>\u201cWe have to try and find water,\u201d Alex says as we race past the cell doors. \u201cThey have to get into the lake somehow and, if we can find out how, then maybe we can swim up through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t swim, though,\u201d I say, my shoes splashing in the puddles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d he replies, curving us to the right. We round a sharp corner and more doors appear.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I skid to a stop, tugging on his arm, forcing him to stop. \u201cWe have to find my mom first.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, looking at me sympathetically, but there\u2019s stubbornness in him as well. \u201cWe have to go,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long they\u2019ll be out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going without her.\u201d I refuse to budge, digging my shoes into the dirt and holding my ground. Alex shakes his head and I quickly add, \u201cAlex, it\u2019s my mom.\u201d</p><p>He wavers, his expression softening, and then he grudgingly nods. \u201cAll right, but as soon as I hear any sign that they\u2019re waking up, we\u2019re leaving without her. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I stand on my tiptoes to place a kiss on his cheek.</p><p>We hastily start to unlatch doors and check inside the cells. Most of them are empty. A few have humans in them, most are sickly looking, scrawny and underweight. A few of them scream at us the instant we open the door while others look comatose.</p><p>I\u2019m growing frustrated with each dead-end, wondering where else the Queen would keep my mom. However, then I open the last door on the right side and my frustration turns to anxiousness. My heart drops to my stomach as the door swings open all the way.</p><p>Inside the tiny cell is a woman, her back hunched over as she sits on the edge of the bed. She\u2019s wearing ratty, torn pants and a shirt. Her brown hair is braided behind her head and her blue irises are fixed on the cement floor in front of her bare feet.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I whisper from the doorway. The word feels strange coming out of my mouth, like it doesn\u2019t belong there.</p><p>She blinks up at me, and then looks back down at the ground.</p><p>\u201cJocelyn.\u201d Alex inches around me and enters the cell. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>My mother only blinks her eyes, refusing to look up or speak. Tears burn in my eyes as pain and the feeling of being unwanted flood me, but I suck them back. Summoning courage I didn\u2019t know I had in me, I step into the room and up to the bed then kneel down in front of her.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I say, lowering my face into her line of vision. \u201cIt\u2019s Gemma...your daughter.\u201d</p><p>She glances at my violet eyes, curiosity and confusion emitting from her own. Then something flickers in her expression and, suddenly, she\u2019s really looking at me instead of through me. She leaps to her feet and starts to hug me, but then quickly retracts and wraps her arms around herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing down here?\u201d Her voice is tight and unwelcoming. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came here for you.\u201d I glance warily at Alex and then back at her. \u201cTo save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never should have come here,\u201d she says, rocking back and forth as she hugs herself. \u201cHow did you even get down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith an Ira,\u201d I explain, trying not to go into shock over her detached state of mind. She\u2019s been here for a while. She\u2019s been through so much. I ball my hands into fists and stab my fingernails into my palms, shifting the emotional pain inside me to physical.</p><p>She frowns up at me. \u201cSo you got your father\u2019s power.\u201d She says it with such hatred.</p><p>A thousand questions run through my mind, but I bite them back and grab her arm. \u201cWe have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to get to water,\u201d Alex tells her, moving up beside me. \u201cThere\u2019s supposed to be a place somewhere down here that will take us up through the lake. A water route maybe? Do you know where it is?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d She shakes her head and shuffles back until the backs of her legs bump into the bed. \u201cThe Fey will make us suffer if we try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJocelyn, no one\u2019s going to hurt you anymore,\u201d Alex says. \u201cWe\u2019re taking you home.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and then spins in a circle with her arms out to the side. \u201cYou think you can escape here? We\u2019re trapped. Forever.\u201d</p><p>Great. She\u2019s crazy.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about my Foreseer power?\u201d I ask, reaching out to touch her, but fear of rejection forces me to pull back. \u201cCan it get us out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a crystal,\u201d Alex points out. \u201cWe need to find water.\u201d</p><p>My mom stops spinning in circles and chews on a strand of her hair as she assesses me, tapping her foot on the floor. \u201cShe might not need one if she\u2019s entirely like her father, but if that\u2019s also the case, she\u2019s doomed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoomed for what?\u201d I ask in horror. \u201cWhat else could I possibly be doomed for?\"</p><p>She lets go of the strand of her hair and strides forward, placing her hands on my shoulders. \u201cEvil.\u201d Her smile radiates her insanity.</p> <p>\u201cI-I\u2019m not evil,\u201d I stutter, though a voice inside my head laughs at me. I don\u2019t know what to say or do. She isn\u2019t the person I\u2019ve seen in the visions. She\u2019s cruel, insane and derisive. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to show you right now by getting us out of here, which is a good thing.\u201d</p><p>She only laughs, moving away, but she doesn\u2019t argue when I take her hand. \u201cWell, you can try,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say determinedly, yet I falter when I realize I only have a vague idea of how to do it. \u201cNow how do I do it? Channel the energy without the crystal and get us to present time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmotion,\u201d she says simply. \u201cYour father used to do it all the time by getting really angry.\u201d Her gaze skims to Alex. \u201cOr when I would tell him that I love him.\u201d</p><p>I shift uneasily. \u201cIs that it? Just feel a lot of emotion?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cThat and you need to have the ability to look a split second into the future then drop yourself into the vision a second behind what you saw, so by the time you make us drop, we\u2019ll have aligned with present time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Alex and I say at the same time.</p><p>She ruthlessly grins as she swings our arms back and forth between us. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a lot of skill. Seeing things quicker than the human eye and placing all of us in the right spot. One false move and we\u2019ll be stuck in either the future or the past. Maybe forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds pretty simple to me,\u201d I say sarcastically.</p><p>She shrugs again, as though she doesn\u2019t care about anything, and it makes me want to bawl my eyes out. \u201cI told you it was hard.\u201d She rubs her hand across her face. \u201cHonestly, we\u2019d be better off here anyways, rotting in our own heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way. I\u2019d rather die.\u201d I summon a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m going to try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad idea,\u201d Alex says as I lace my fingers through his and tug him closer. \u201cUsing your power like this... it\u2019s too risky and unknown.\u201d</p><p>A scream rings through the air and we all flinch, glancing at the door in panic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more risky staying down here.\u201d I cup the side of his neck and guide him closer as my mom holds my hand from behind me. \u201cNow kiss me.\u201d</p> <p>His brows furrow as I lean in and crash my lips against his. I channel every emotion he instills in me as I taste him and let his tongue feel mine. I feel a gentle tug, but it\u2019s not enough. I need something more powerful\u2014something I\u2019ve never felt before.</p><p>I pull away and Alex opens his eyes when the high-pitched shrieks of the Fey grow louder as they get closer to the cell.</p><p>\u201cI need something more,\u201d I say, my eyes glued to the doorway, my pulse hammering with fear. I bet the Water Fey can sense it. I bet they\u2019re devouring it as they search for us. \u201cI need to feel something new; that\u2019s when it\u2019s most intense.\u201d</p><p>Alex rakes his free hand through his hair, leaving his arm on the back of his neck, his elbow bent upward. \u201cWhat haven\u2019t you felt yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, ignoring my mother\u2019s laughs of hysteria. \u201cI felt so many already.\u201d</p><p>He swallows hard, his hand falling to the side. The screams of the Water Fey quake around the room and the vines are starting to revive, turning back to a healthy shade of green. They\u2019re close and so is the Queen. If I don\u2019t get us out of here, then we\u2019re doomed just like my mom said.</p><p>\u201cHow about this.\u201d Alex puts a hand on the side of my face and gazes deep into my eyes. His chest rises and falls with his ragged breath and his pulse throbs though his fingertips. \u201cGemma, I love you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if he means it, if they\u2019re just desperate words or not. The idea of love scares the hell out of me, though.</p><p>It\u2019s not the reaction I was expecting, but it does the trick. As a new brand of fear emerges in me, one based on something that\u2019s potentially good, but also terrifying, the prickle stabs the back of my neck. The electricity devours my soul, fractures it open, and leaves it vulnerable and exposed. Alex leans forward to kiss me, feeding the sensation even more. The longer we kiss, the more energy develops between us; until I feel like I\u2019m going to erupt like a volcano full of liquid hot magma. Then I let my mind see what it needs to.</p><p>I picture myself sitting on the bed in the room at the beach house, the ocean right outside. I let myself see it happen, us dropping right into the place, safely in the middle of the room with the sunlight spilling through the windows and open doors.</p><p>Then I jump a second back and drop us into the world, praying to God I\u2019ve got it right.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>This isn\u2019t how I pictured my reunion with my mom. Maybe it was a delusional thought process, but I\u2019d imagined more hugs and happy tears. Instead I get insane laughter and looks of disdain as well as loathing.</p><p>Things only get worse the second I drop us down into the bedroom of the beach house. I land on my ass on the bed and Alex lands across from me still holding my hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my mom,\u201d I say, uncrossing my legs and pushing to my feet. I spring off the bed, the ashes of the curtains still scattered all over the comforter and floor, and spot her lifelessly laying just to the side of a large metal trunk. I drop down on my knees beside her. Her eyes are sealed shut, her skin lined with veins that contrast with her pale skin. She\u2019s breathing, but barely.</p><p>\u201cNo... no... no... no...\u201d I shake my head in denial. She looks like she\u2019s sleeping, even when I lift her head up and place it on my lap.</p><p>Alex crouches down beside me and for a second he just looks at me. I wonder if he\u2019s thinking about how he said he loved me. Did he mean it? Why did he do it?</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be okay?\u201d I ask him, forcing him to focus on the bigger problem.</p><p>Alex picks up my mom\u2019s arm, presses two fingers to her wrist, and then relief washes over his face. \u201cShe\u2019s alive.\u201d He sets her arm down over her stomach. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with her, though.\u201d He rests his arms on his knees, leaning back on his heels as he glances at the open French doors, the sunlight filtering in.</p><p>\u201cAre we even in present time?\u201d he wonders, assessing the room. \u201cEverything looks the same as when we left.\u201d</p><p>I point over my shoulder at the empty bed. \u201cExcept the Ira is gone.\u201d I straighten my knees and stand up. \u201cThere\u2019s one way to find out for sure, though... Aislin! Laylen! Can you come in here?\u201d</p><p>A few moments later, Aislin and Laylen come running into the bedroom. They screech to a halt when they spot my mom on the floor with Alex and I beside her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Aislin asks, working to catch her breath as she presses her hand to her heart.</p><p>\u201cYou can see us?\u201d I ask them and they both nod, looking baffled.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I sink down to the floor and breathe in relief. \u201cThat means I did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the present?\u201d Alex asks hopefully as he straightens his legs and stands to his feet.</p><p>I nod, letting a small smile seep through. \u201cYeah, we made it.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m thankful for my unique Foreseer ability. Without it, we\u2019d probably still be imprisoned, if not crazy or dead. Alex and Laylen move my unconscious mother to the bed where I cover her up with a blanket and shut the French doors. The four of us quietly sneak out of the room, letting her sleep, hoping she\u2019ll wake up and tell us something that will make all this trouble worth it.</p><p>In the warped, concealed part of me, I don\u2019t want her to wake up. The woman I saw in the visions and memories, the kind and enduring person, doesn\u2019t seem to exist in her anymore. It saddens me to the point that I feel like sobbing my heart out. But these thoughts I keep to myself, because I know how wrong they are.</p><p>We go into the small kitchen and Aislin makes us coffee while Alex and I fill the two of them in on what happened. All the curtains are shut, blocking out the beach right outside, although I can still hear the ocean crashing against the shore as it carries pieces of sand away.</p><p>\u201cSo all the Water Faeries just passed out?\u201d Aislin asks, lowering into a chair next to Laylen. \u201cAnd the Queen?\u201d</p><p>I take a gulp of my coffee, the heat of it simmering the inside of my throat, but in a good way. \"Yeah, one minute she was trying to torture my soul with that diamond we took down there, and the next moment her and all her Fey were on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it because they were trying to do something to your...soul?\u201d Aislin asks and then hurries and takes a gulp of her coffee, then leaves the mug in front of her mouth to conceal her expression.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened exactly.\u201d I add some milk to my coffee and stir it with a spoon. \u201cIt could have been my locket or maybe it was my soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was either, honestly,\u201d Alex interrupts, pulling a chair out and sitting down beside me. \u201cNow that I think about it, I\u2019m guessing that it was from the overload of fear you shot at them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat overload of fear?\u201d I wonder, but I can clearly remember how I felt about everything I saw and how it scared the shit out of me; more than even the Death Walkers.</p><p>He chooses his next words carefully as he picks up his coffee pot and pours some coffee into a mug. \u201cI think because your emotions are so new, they sometimes come off a little.... strong. Maybe a little too strong for the Fey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrong,\u201d I say, scowling at him, insulted. \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a bad thing, yet it\u2019s what saved us back in the cell...\u201d I clear my throat and quickly fill my mouth with coffee before I can bring up any more uncomfortable subjects.</p><p>He smashes his lips together, his gaze boring into me. \u201cYeah... it did.\u201d He gives a long pause, like he\u2019s expecting me to say something. But what? That I love him. Is that what he wants? Because I can\u2019t give it to him at the moment. Not when I haven\u2019t felt it yet. They\u2019d just be empty words associated with the fractured part of my soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go check on my mom,\u201d I mutter, scooting the chair away from the table. I get up and put my mug in the sink then leave them in the kitchen, fully aware that Alex\u2019s eyes are following me the entire way.</p><p>I hurry back to the room, scared and relieved to find that my mom\u2019s still passed out in the bed. She looks dead, a corpse in a coffin waiting to be buried. Maybe she kind of is. Maybe The Underworld has practically killed her. Possibly that\u2019s why she was so cold toward me.</p><p>I inch toward the bed, taking slow steps until I reach the side. \u201cMom,\u201d I whisper, staring down at her. The word still feels strange coming from my lips. I always called Marco and Sophia by their first names and always said them formally. However saying \u201cmom\u201d is different. It means something. \u201cMom.\u201d The prickle traces down my neck. \u201cMom,\u201d I say louder, tears dripping from my eyes. \u201cMom.\u201d I reach up and touch the wet tears, trying to figure out what I\u2019m feeling. Sadness. Pain. Abandonment.</p><p>As more gush out, I collapse to the bed on my stomach, bury my face into the pillow, and bawl my eyes out until I fall asleep.</p> <p>I don\u2019t dream at all. I see nothing except blackness the entire time my eyes are shut. When I wake up, the curtains are open and the French doors are agape. Someone\u2019s been in here.</p><p>I bolt upright, rubbing my puffy eyes as the pinkish glow of sunset creeps in through the open doors.</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d The sound of my mom\u2019s voice scares me to death, and I fall out of the bed, smacking my elbow on the floor and my head on the side of the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d I rub my elbow as I turn over and get to my feet.</p><p>My mom is sitting on the edge of the bed, looking over her shoulder at me like I\u2019m a nut job. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d There\u2019s no scorn in her voice, only sincerity.</p> <p>I nod, get to my feet, and sit down on the bed on the side opposite from her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She swallows hard and then starts hacking, covering her mouth with her hand. \u201cI think I need some water,\u201d she chokes, leaning over like she\u2019s going to vomit on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get you some,\u201d I jump to my feet, knowing that what I\u2019m really doing is running away from my problems.</p><p>I rush into the kitchen and fill up a glass with water. While I\u2019m shutting off the faucet, I think I hear someone behind me. When I whirl around I come face to face with a tall, blue-eyed, blond-haired Vampire/Keeper.</p><p>\u201cShit, Laylen.\u201d I press my hand to my racing heart, steadying the glass in my hand. \u201cYou scared me to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He has on a pair of dark jeans and a navy blue t-shirt that brings out the blue in his eyes. \u201cBut you are kind of jumpy.\u201d He sucks his lip ring into his mouth and nibbles on it, analyzing me over, looking as though he wants to say something more.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I did just get out of The Underworld.\u201d My mouth plunges to a frown. \u201cI think it might have scarred me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d He crosses his arms and relaxes his hip against the edge of the tile countertop. \u201cYou seemed kind of distant at the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just some stuff going on,\u201d I say. \u201cBut the good news is, my mom\u2019s awake.\u201d</p><p>He stands up straight, uncrossing his arms, his defined muscles flexing. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m about to find out.\u201d I wind around him to leave, but I stop at the doorway, glancing back over my shoulder. \u201cDo you want to come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather take Alex?\u201d he says, sorrow lacing his tone. \u201cI\u2019m sure he has a ton of questions for her.\u201d</p><p>I turn around and tell him the truth. \u201cLaylen I want you there just as much as I want him there.\u201d</p><p>He offers me a half smile as he walks toward me. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>My mom has wandered out to the deck by the time I make it back to the room. She\u2019s standing near the railing, gazing out at the ocean, still wearing her tattered pants and shirt. I need to get her some clean clothes.</p><p>I carefully approach her with Laylen at my heels, and the cup of water in my hand. I stop beside her and set the glass of water down on the railing in front of her, accidentally spilling some of the water out.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says, picking the glass up. She takes a few large swallows and then puts the glass back down on the railing. I wait for her to say something\u2014anything\u2014but all she does is stare out at the ocean.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I start. \u201cAre you okay? Is there anything else I can get you? Like maybe something to eat?\u201d</p><p>She finally looks at me, sighs, and then her gaze suddenly darts to Laylen. \u201cLaylen, is that you?\u201d she asks, shocked.</p><p>He nods, brushing his hair out of his eyes, as he steps away from the doorway and onto the deck. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me, Jocelyn.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, however it looks morbidly wrong, like she\u2019s working really hard to make the corners of her mouth move upward. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up so much.\u201d She stares at me, her forehead furrowed, her eyes full of desolation. \u201cAnd you...\u201d She abruptly bursts into tears, shaking her head, her lips quivering. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re still...\u201d She trails off, sobbing hysterically into her hands. \u201cYou\u2019re still you. Oh my God, I thought he\u2019d ruin you... turn you into him.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what to say to her; that I\u2019m not the girl she left behind, but someone trying to figure out who she is. I\u2019m afraid if I dare utter those words, she might break apart completely. I let her cry for a moment, feeling awkward.</p><p>Finally, the tears cease and she dabs the remaining ones away with the corner of her shirt. \u201cSo what\u2019s been going on?\u201d She clears her throat and takes another sip of water. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve been gone for the last fourteen years.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, where do I begin? So much has happened, especially over the last few weeks. I\u2019m not sure what to tell her, and honestly, I don\u2019t have all the answers since I can barely remember anything.</p><p>I do my best and start at the beginning, though, at least the beginning for me.</p><p>I try my best to get all the details right and fill her in on everything that has happened. I tell her about my lifeless years with Marco and Sophia and then college. I tell her how the prickle miraculously showed up and freed me from my solitude. I tell her about the Death Walkers and how Stephan is working with them as well as Demetrius, which she knew already. How he can create the Mark of Malefiscus and that he put the mark on Nicholas. I explain my special Foreseer gift and the visions I\u2019ve seen, at least to an extent, minus the fact that I\u2019ve seen myself bearing the Mark of Evil. I tell her about how Stephan tried to erase my mind with that stupid rock and how the locket she gave me saved me.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, it\u2019s nearly dark and most of the beach has cleared. The ocean roars in the distance and a few stars speckle the greying sky.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d my mom says after I\u2019ve given her the rundown. She reaches over and takes my hand with a slight tremor in her grip. I wince, but don\u2019t pull away. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly sorry you had to go through all of this. God, it must have been terrible for you\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard as I sit down on the railing. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault...I\u2014I know you tried to protect me.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, freeing my hand, and then sinks down in a chair. \u201cI should have tried harder. I should have tried to run away sooner. I let it go on for too long, knowing what he was going to do to you... We need to stop it\u2014stop him.\u201d She glances over at Laylen sitting on the railing near the open French doors. \u201cI need to talk to Alex and Aislin. Could you go get them for me?\u201d</p><p>Laylen nods and hops off the railing, his boots scuffing the wood. \u201cOf course.\u201d He shoots me a confused look before walking into the house.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to talk to them?\u201d I give her a quizzical look as I slide off the railing and land on my feet.</p><p>\u201cBecause, I need all of you here,\u201d she says, crossing her arms over her stomach like she feels sick. \u201cBecause this\u2014all of this\u2014involves all of you. Each of you plays a part in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlays a part in what?\u201d I ask. \u201cStephan trying to open the portal? Because I thought he just needed the star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gemma.\u201d She extends her hand toward my face and then brushes some of my hair out of my eyes; her first motherly gesture and I\u2019ll admit that it\u2019s strange. \u201cThere is so much more to Stephan\u2019s plan than just you and the star. So much more.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>Time seems to stop. I\u2019d always assumed it was me, based on what I\u2019d been told. Simply me and the star and the end of the world. I guess I was wrong, though. We all were. Which makes me wonder just how much more we were wrong about.</p><p>Laylen returns a few minutes later with a very sleepy-eyed Aislin dressed in pink yoga pants and a fitted white tank top. Tagging along behind her is a very stressed out Alex wearing jeans and a black t-shirt. They each grab a chair and drag them closer so we\u2019re all sitting in a circle. Alex avoids eye contact with me, stretching his legs out and staring at his bare feet. The deck light is on as well as the bedroom light and it lights up the night around us.</p><p>Aislin fidgets nervously, wringing her fingers in her lap. \u201cJocelyn, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here...It\u2019s just really... great.\u201d She struggles for words she never does quite find.</p><p>My mother gives her a tight smile. \u201cThanks. I\u2019m glad to see all of you... you\u2019ve grown up so much.\u201d She talks almost robotically and I wonder if this is what I sounded like back when I was emotionless.</p><p>\u201cLaylen says there\u2019s something you wanted to tell us?\u201d Alex asks impatiently, picking at a loose thread on a torn area of his jeans.</p><p>My mother nods and finishes the last of her water. \u201cThere is.\u201d She sets the empty glass down beside her feet and relaxes back in the chair, her shoulders curling inward. \u201cBut I need you to tell me what you know first. Gemma\u2019s already told me what she knows about your father\u2019s plans and what not, however I think you might know a little more than her.\u201d</p><p>I burn a hole into the side of his head as he presses his lips together with guilt written all over his face. He crosses his arms and shifts his weight while his eyes quickly sweep across the four of us.</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d my mom says and I\u2019m a little shocked at the warmness in her tone. \u201cI understand your initial reaction is to keep things a bottled up. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve been taught to do, but I need to know what you know\u2014it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>He tugs on the bottom of his shirt, staring at the floor. \u201cWhere do you want me to start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about from the beginning,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cBut where is the beginning?\u201d Alex mumbles, his gaze flicking to mine.</p><p>I can tell that even after everything, he still has secrets. Maybe he always will. Perhaps I\u2019ll never know him. The raw thought clenches at my heart. I want to know him. Every part of him. Inside and out... what does that mean exactly? About me? About us? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you start with the day that Gemma\u2019s soul was detached,\u201d my mom patiently suggests. \u201cDo you remember what happened that day?\u201d</p><p>He glances at me and I raise my eyebrows at him as I lean back in the chair, thrumming my fingers against the armrests, implying to go ahead because I\u2019m dying to hear what he has to say about this.</p><p>He shuts his eyes, his chest expanding as he breathes in the ocean air. \u201cShe and I were hiding out in that little fort in the side of the hill,\u201d he says, his eyelids fluttering open. \u201cBecause earlier my father told us that Gemma had to go away and I didn\u2019t want her to. So I ran away with her, very stupidly thinking that if we did, he wouldn\u2019t make her go when he found us.\u201d</p><p>I touch the palm of my hand and outline the faint scar, remembering the vision I saw. He\u2019d cut my hand and his, saying the words forem as we pressed our palms together. What does the damn word mean?</p> <p>Alex balls up his own hand as if he\u2019s trying to hide his scar. \u201cHe ended up taking her away from me and I never saw her again... Well, until my dad made me enroll in college so I could try to get to the bottom of why her emotions were surfacing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened during all those years when you didn\u2019t see Gemma?\u201d my mother asks.</p><p>His jaw goes taught and he clenches his hands even tighter, yet his expression is surprisingly stoic. \u201cBasically, my father beat the shit out of me so I\u2019d learn to feel pain over emotion. He said it was an important part of being a Keeper or whatever.\u201d He slumps back in the chair and flexes out his fingers. \u201cWho the fuck cares?\u201d</p><p>Laylen and I trade an astonished look, seeming equally as surprised, though my mom and Aislin appear rationally calm, like they expected it.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you Aislin?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhat was your life like?\u201d</p> <p>Aislin scrapes at her nail polish and tucks a leg underneath her. \u201cI was taught to be a very confident Witch. I didn\u2019t go to Wicca school, though. I was trained at home by a Witch named Estella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEstella Evernandy?\u201d my mom says sullenly. \u201cOf the Evernandy Clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the one,\u201d Aislin replies, coiling a strand of her hair around her finger. \u201cBut why do you sound so upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about the Evernandy Clan?\u201d my mom asks, her voice attentive.</p><p>Aislin shrugs, putting her foot back onto the floor as she unwinds the hair from her finger. \u201cYeah, that they come from a very powerful bloodline.\u201d She gathers her golden blonde hair and secures it in a messy bun with a rubber band that\u2019s on her wrist.</p><p>\u201cA black magic bloodline,\u201d my mom explains. \u201cAislin, your father had you taught to learn black magic.\u201d</p> <p>Aislin shakes her head in denial. \u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d she insists. \u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he would,\u201d Alex mutters, staring at his lap with his brows furrowed. \u201cDon\u2019t deny things that are clearly possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Aislin slumps back in the chair and stomps her foot on the deck. \u201cWe don\u2019t know her. She might be lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d Alex frowns at my mom. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t get what any of this has to do with the star\u2019s power and the end of the world, which is what we should be focusing on; not Aislin and mine's fucked up pasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis stuff has everything to do with it\u2014you two have just as much to do with it as Gemma does,\u201d my mother tells him. She rolls up the sleeves of her shirt and crosses her legs, fanning the front of her face with her hand as the heat overwhelms her. \u201cI have one more question and then I\u2019ll get to the point.\u201d She pauses. \u201cWere you near Gemma the day her emotions first came back to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would you think that?\u201d Alex\u2019s voice is sharp and rumbles with fury as he sits up straight, slamming his hands down on the handles of the chair. \u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that.\u201d My mom\u2019s demeanor is professionally calm. \u201cHowever, I need to know if you went behind Stephan\u2019s back and snuck off to see her almost as though it was out of your control.\u201d</p><p>Alex glances out at the ocean, his eyes pools of black in the moonlight. \u201cIt was something I couldn\u2019t help...going there, I mean. I didn\u2019t think anything would happen.\u201d He rips his concentration away from the water and rotates in the chair to look at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you sooner.\u201d There\u2019s genuine honesty in his voice.</p> <p>I gape at him unfathomably. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d I lean in and lower my voice. \u201cAfter everything we\u2019ve been through, it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>He lets his knee fall to the side and rests it against mine as his back bends and his body moves closer to mine. \u201cAt first it was because I thought I couldn\u2019t\u2014because I was still my father\u2019s puppet. Then... well, I had just left you there, crying in the middle of the parking lot surrounded by a ton of strangers. I didn\u2019t want to own up to doing that. \u201d</p><p>I swallow hard, remembering the day when I fell to my knees and cried for the very first time in the middle of the University of Wyoming\u2019s parking lot, my chest feeling like it\u2019d been ripped open. I could barely get up afterward and I had such a hard time dealing with it that when I got home I thought about taking very drastic measures to turn it off\u2014I thought about ending my life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he repeats, lacing our fingers as he takes ahold of my hand. His skin is deliciously warm and is humming with electric sparks that briefly make everything around us\u2014problems and people\u2014vanish. \u201cI wish I could take it back\u2014do things differently\u2014but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d It\u2019s all I say\u2014all I can say. Not because I\u2019m angry with him, either. I actually feel very sorry for him. Beaten up by his father and taught to be unemotional. No wonder he\u2019s so complicated.</p><p>I turn to my mother. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of all of this? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is that all of you are connected,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that connection is why you\u2019ve all had such messed up paths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the connection?\u201d Alex asks, looking at me and not her, as though he\u2019s trying to see into my thoughts.</p><p>My mom takes a deep breath and glances up at the starry sky. \u201cThe star.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>\u201cThe star,\u201d Alex, Aislin, and I say simultaneously while Laylen opts to stay quiet, his eyes locked on the space of deck in front of his feet, his expression undecipherable.</p><p>\u201cHow does that connect to all of us?\u201d I question. \u201cIt\u2019s only in me, so...\u201d I trail off as a gut-wrenching thought occurs to me. Electricity that flows between two people. Sparks. An irrational, overwhelming, obsession with each other. Always melting into each other\u2019s arms. Every time I\u2019m around Alex it\u2019s there. I can feel it buzzing right now, a gentle current flowing off his fingers and onto mine as he holds my hand.</p><p>\u201cDoes... Does Alex have a star\u2019s power in him, too?\u201d I ask and I feel his fingers tremble.</p><p>Alex\u2019s head whips in my direction. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say and then hold my breath as I wait for my mom to answer.</p><p>She reluctantly nods. \u201cNot a separate star, but the same one.\u201d</p><p>Alex shakes his head in refusal of accepting the ugly truth. He tugs his fingers through his hair, forgetting to let go of my hand and my fingers end up going with his hair too. \u201cNo... There\u2019s no way.\u201d He stands to his feet and pulls me with him, then sits back down and I fall back into my chair. I think about taking my hand away from him, but I\u2019m worried he might break apart if I do. He looks so defenseless and lost right now. After a lot of heavy breathing and cursing, he collects himself and says, \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause what happened with the star wasn\u2019t an accident,\u201d my mother explains, gesturing at all of us. \u201cNone of this was. All of this\u2014all of you\u2014happened for a reason. The star being split up and placed inside you two, Aislin learning black magic, and Laylen turning into a Vampire. None of that was an accident.\u201d</p><p>My heart thuds in my chest as I remember what Nicholas said in the forest. I glance over Laylen and his head is hung low, his elbows stationed on his knees. He almost looks like a statue cut from marble, created to portray the definition of anguish.</p><p>\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Laylen says, looking up, and the lack of emotion on his face is frightening, \u201cis that I was changed into a fucking monster on purpose\u2014that Stephan had me turned?\u201d</p><p>Pressing her lips together, my mom nods. \u201cStephan has been planning for years, ever since he found out the portal could be opened... He\u2019s been looking for a way to free Malefiscus almost forever because of the mark. No one knew about his mark, though, because his parents cut it off and tried to keep it hidden. I didn\u2019t even know he had it until it was too late.\u201d She swallows hard. \u201cStephan is a descendent of Malefiscus, but I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy have all the Keepers thought the mark died with Malefiscus?\u201d Alex asks.</p><p>\u201cBecause there are no records saying he had any offspring to pass the mark to,\u201d my mother replies gravely.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it just appeared on him,\u201d I say. \u201cLike it did on Malefiscus. I mean, marks have to start from somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he has the bloodline,\u201d my mother insists. \u201cI heard him talking about it right before he... he threw me into the lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, Demetrius is a descendant of him, too,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI saw it in a vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says and I wonder just how much she does know, not to mention how she learned about it. How did she find all this out? \u201cBut the question is: how? We need to find out so we know what we\u2019re going up against.\u201d Her blue eyes momentarily flick to Alex. \u201cAnd we need to find out how the marks surface without Stephan putting it on them.\u201d</p><p>Alex slips his hand out of mine and starts anxiously tapping his foot against the floor. \u201cI still don\u2019t get it, though. You say all of us play a part in this, but play a part in what exactly? Opening the portal?\u201d</p><p>My mom nods. \u201cAnd freeing Malefiscus,\u201d she explains. \u201cHe\u2019s been trapped in the portal since the sentencing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought he died.\u201d I scoot forward in the chair. \u201cI thought he was hung.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNot a lot of people know this, but during Malefiscus\u2019s reign, it wasn\u2019t just the Death Walkers who were terrorizing people. There were Witches, Vampires, Fey, and even a couple of Foreseers who had joined his reign of terror because Malefiscus has Fey, Witch, Vampire, and Foreseer blood in him,\u201d she says, recapping most of what Nicholas has already told me. \u201cWhen his brother, Hektor, finally captured Malefiscus, the Keepers had to come up with a way to make his followers surrender with him and be free of their Mark of Evil, so they put Malefiscus in a portal and sealed it with the blood of three individuals; a Keeper who also was a Vampire, a Keeper who was also a Witch, and a Keeper who was also a Faerie. That way the Fey, Witches, and Vampires who followed Malefiscus would be bound to the portal as well, without the Keepers having to track them all down.\u201d She gazes up at the luminous moon. \u201cThe final step was to seal the portal with the energy of a fallen star.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo there was another fallen star once?\u201d I ask, glancing at Alex. He meets my eyes and the electricity ignites between us before we can even take our next breath. There\u2019s so much power in it\u2014in us\u2014and it frightens me how much I hate it and like it at the same time. \u201c</p><p>My mother yanks her attention off the moon and forces it back onto us. \u201cNo. The star\u2019s energy you and Alex carry is the same one as the Keepers used those hundreds of years ago. After they sealed the portal, they hid it because no one knew how to destroy it... The star was also never supposed to be put in any Keepers.\u201d She pauses, considering something. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that I\u2019ve never have been able to figure out. Why Stephan split the star and put its energy in you two.\u201d She lets out a heavy sigh. \u201cBut what I do know, is that in order for Stephan to be able to open the portal, he needs his Vampire, his Witch, and his Faerie that also have Keeper blood in them, so he created them\u2014created you two.\u201d She looks from Aislin to Laylen. \u201cThen he got his hands on the star, and for some reason he put it in you and Alex.\u201d</p><p>I feel like I\u2019ve been run over by a truck, my guts splattered all over the pavement, my body mangled. I\u2019d never realized how easy it was to bear the burden of carrying the star in me, but now Alex, Aislin, and Laylen are carrying their own burdens and I realize that things just got a hell of a lot more complicated.</p><p>\u201cSo if he opens the portal, then what happens?\u201d I ask, sounding strangled. \u201cMalefiscus is freed, along with a shit load of Death Walkers and the whole damn world turns to ice?\u201d</p> <p>My mother unenthusiastically nods. \u201cHe\u2019ll be able to enter our world again. Every Death Walker will come out of hiding and even more will come out of the portal. He controls them because the mark binds them together in blood, which is the same reason why Stephan has control over them.\u201d She pauses. \u201cAnd every Witch, Faerie, and Vampire who are the descendants of his first followers will be under his control, so what you saw in the vision, Gemma\u2014the world ending in ice\u2014is probably at the very end of what\u2019s going to happen to the world, after the massacre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMassacre,\u201d I breathe and then shove the bloody images away from my head. \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m still confused on and that\u2019s how does Stephan knows how to do all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was told what to do by a Foreseer,\u201d she says with a hint of anger in her tone.</p><p>\u201cIs my father that Foreseer?\u201d I ask, shocking her and everyone else, although it\u2019s not that ridiculous of a question. She mentioned him back in The Underworld and I could hear the loathing in her tone.</p><p>My mother leaps from her chair and it topples to the ground. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not your father!\u201d she screams, crouching over and savagely moving toward me. \u201cShut your mouth this instant!\u201d</p> <p>I hover back in the chair, realizing how temperamental she really is. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She glances at all of us and the rage in her eyes diminishes as she tips the chair back up and lowers down in it. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Gemma. I have no idea why I yelled at you like that.\u201d She smoothes her hands over her hair, trying to comb it back into place, however the braid is slipping loose and strands of her brown hair are sticking up. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say numbly, shutting myself down by choice because I don\u2019t want to feel the pain from knowing that the mother I have now is not the mother I had\u2014she\u2019ll probably never be the same. None of us will. There are things in life that happen that change who we are, things that are hard to come back from, and in the end we never really are the same.</p><p>Aislin jumps to her feet. \u201cI think I need to go lie down. This is a lot to take in.\u201d She\u2019s on the verge of crying as she hurries into the house before anyone can say anything.</p><p>Laylen sighs and gets to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll go check on her.\u201d He follows after her, leaving the door open.</p><p>A moment of silence passes between us and all I can hear are the waves and Aislin\u2019s sobs from inside the house.</p> <p>My mother\u2019s blue irises drift back and forth between Alex and me. \u201cI really want to understand, why he separated the star and why he detached Gemma\u2019s soul and raised you to be unemotional. I know what he told all the other Keepers, but I want to find out the real reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the opposite reason of when we thought he was protecting the world,\u201d I suggest with a shrug. \u201cMaybe he needs to preserve the power inside me... and Alex so it would be useful for the portal. Maybe if we... if we felt too much the star\u2019s power would die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be right,\u201d my mom says, her forehead creasing as she deliberates. \u201cBut we need to find out for sure.\u201d She slumps back in her chair. \u201cWe need to find out a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike why he created Aislin and Laylen,\u201d I say, biting my lip as I gaze out at the waves. \u201cWhy not just find a Vampire and Witch who are also Keepers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause their kind are not easy to find,\u201d my mother answers. \u201cI think it was also so he could keep an eye on them and make sure everything turned out the way that he wanted.\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, the electricity surges to a nearly unbearable temperature, putting more power in me than it ever has, to the point that it\u2019s suffocating.</p><p>\u201cAlex, are you okay?\u201d I lean over in the chair and put a hand on his knee, hoping to calm him down.</p><p>He looks at me and I mean really looks at me, with fire in his eyes. Then he stands to his feet, throws the chair over the deck, and storms inside the house, slamming the door behind him. The glass shatters and scatters all over the cracks in the deck.</p> <p>I start to get up, but then sit back down, not wanting to leave my mom alone just yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she assures me, motioning at me to go after him. \u201cNow go check on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I ask hesitantly.</p><p>She nods, cracking a smile. \u201cGemma, I\u2019ve been surrounded by screams and torture for the last fourteen years. I\u2019d love a little break from the noise and drama. Maybe just a few minutes of peace and quiet.\u201d</p><p>I nod and leave her alone on the deck, wondering what I\u2019m leaving behind and what I\u2019m about to walk into.</p><p>As well as whether or not I can handle any of it.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>I find Alex out on the front steps, the porch light shining down on his back. He doesn\u2019t look up at me when I walk out the door, but I know that he knows I\u2019m behind him, thanks to the electricity. The connection feels different now that I know why it\u2019s there. It\u2019s almost painful, the sparks now feeling more like prickly needles, yet somehow it still feels so damn good.</p><p>The salty sea air kisses my cheeks and my hair as I shut the screen door. I sit down on the cement step beside Alex, pull my legs up, and rest my arms on my knees. He rolls his tongue in his mouth as he taps his foot against the step with his arms on his knees. His hair is disheveled, a sign that he\u2019s been raking his fingers through it, a stressful habit of his.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I ask and then shake my head at the absurdity of my ridiculous question. \u201cSorry, dumb question.\u201d</p><p>His expression softens, his muscles slightly unraveling. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not a dumb question. I just...\u201d He blows out a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to answer it because I don\u2019t know how I feel. I really don\u2019t.\u201d He kicks a rock on the step and it shoots across the grass. \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t know anything anymore\u2014I never really knew anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s insane, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I say. \u201cHow all of us fit into this\u2014how we were all created.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d His voice holds uncertainty as he angles his face toward me, staring at me remorsefully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything. I really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I tell him, shrugging it off the best that I can. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. Besides,\u201d I stare down at my hands. \u201cI think we\u2019re past needing to say we\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p><p>He turns to the side to face me, takes my hands, and pulls them to him. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not,\u201d he says in a low, meaningful tone and I look up at him. \u201cI think you\u2019re letting me off a little because of the electricity\u2014or the star anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I repeat, thinking about how he was beaten by his father. I may have been abused by neglect and demeaning words, but Alex had been physically abused. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s suffered.\u201d I pause as he grazes the scar on my palm. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, go ahead.\u201d There\u2019s an edge in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Forem mean?\u201d</p><p>He sighs heavy heartedly and looks up from my hand. \u201cI had a feeling you were going to ask that.\u201d He pauses, deliberating as he searches my eyes. \u201cYou remember how Nicholas told you about the Blood Promise the Fey made to Malefiscus?\u201d he asks, sketching his finger along the scar on my palm.</p><p>I nod, shivering from his touch as my skin tingles. \u201cYeah, I remember, though he never did explain to me what it was.\u201d</p><p>He slips his hand over mine, presses our palms together and his hand nearly swallows mine. \u201cRemember in the vision how I cut our hands?\u201d</p><p>It clicks like a lock unlatching. \u201cDid we make a Blood Promise?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cWe did.\u201d</p><p>Forem. \u201cWhat kind of promise exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForem or...\u201d His exhale is shaky, conveying his insecurity. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a little lost still. \u201cSo Forem means Forever, but I still don\u2019t get what exactly a Blood Promises is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an unbreakable promise,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cAnd it means we\u2019re bonded together... forever.\u201d</p><p>Forever. Forever. What the hell? How is that even possible? We were...were so...</p><p>\u201cBut we were so young,\u201d I finally manage to say through my racing thoughts and heart. \u201cWhy the hell would we do that?\u201d</p><p>He closes his hand around mine, brings my hand to his mouth, and grazes my knuckles with his lips. \u201cBecause we were really weird kids,\u201d he states amusedly. \u201cAnd honestly, I didn\u2019t really know what I was getting into when I did it. I think I said it more as a lets-be-best friends-forever kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>I explore his face for what\u2019s hidden inside him. Did he mean what he said in The Underworld? Does he really love me? \u201cAnd what does it mean now to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d he says, staring out at the road.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d I utter softly and then the silence drowns us.</p><p>I want to ask him so many things. Like what he\u2019s thinking and feeling. Does he think it\u2019s the electricity that\u2019s pulling us toward each other? Does he really love me?</p><p>In the end I keep my lips sealed because I\u2019m afraid to find out the truth. Then I\u2019ll have to admit what I\u2019m really feeling and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for that.</p><p>\u201cGemma, I...\u201d he starts, struggling to keep his voice balanced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can tell by the way that he looks that he\u2019s either going to crush my heart or send me running, so I cut him off, rapidly leaning in and silencing him with my lips.</p><p>I gasp from the spark of our lips and then moan at the warmth of his tongue as he urges my lips open and kisses me ardently. I readily liquefy into the kisses, opening up and letting him completely in. He meticulously explores every inch of my mouth as he grips at my waist, his hands just under the hem of my shirt; flesh burning flesh.</p><p>At first the kiss is innocent, simply two confused people making out on a porch, however the longer it goes on, the more intense it becomes until something snaps in both of us and the faint sparks blaze into a scorching fire. Before I can even acknowledge what he\u2019s doing, he scoops me up in his arms and carries me into the house. Passion and heat take over and we no longer have control, but we never really did anyway. We\u2019ve both been helpless against our emotions, without them and with them. The drives of our lives and our decisions have solely been based on what we didn\u2019t and did feel.</p><p>I secure my arms and legs around him as he maneuvers through the screen door and into the living room, his lips staying fastened to mine the entire time. He trips over the threshold and my back slams against the wall as his weight crashes against me. He leaves me pressed up to it for a moment, his tongue slipping deeply into my mouth, and then he moves us away. He manages to find his way to the hall without breaking the kiss and starts to head to the room we\u2019ve been sleeping in.</p> <p>\u201cNot in there,\u201d I murmur against his lips as I thread my fingers through his soft hair. \u201cMy mom\u2019s in there.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, he turns the other way and stumbles into the vacant spare room across the hall. It\u2019s smaller than the one we\u2019re staying in and doesn\u2019t have a view of the ocean, but I could care less at the moment what the hell the room looks like as long as it has a bed.</p><p>He continues to kiss me as he moves for the bed and then he turns around at the last second so we collapses onto the mattress with me on top of him. I straddle him as he presses his hands to my back, enfolding me against him. We kiss recklessly through our pain and confusion and the longer our lips remain sealed together, the easier it is to forget that this all might be an deception based on stars and misguided emotions.</p><p>Alex ultimately breaks the kiss, but only to remove my shirt. It\u2019s tight fitting, though, and has a ribbon up the front that makes it complex to get off. Finally he threads his fingers through the laces and rips the fabric in half. Then he tosses the pieces aside on the floor, his green eyes blazing with uncontrollable hunger as he reaches around my back and unclasps my bra. My breasts spring free as he discards it to the floor beside my ruined shirt, then I reach forward and grab the bottom of his shirt. He helps me take it off him, roughly tugging it over his head, and throwing it aside. I leisurely glide my fingers up his chest and defined abs before I groan at the mouthwatering hardness of his lean muscles, his skin making my skin burn. When I reach the top of his chest, I slip my hands around to his shoulders blades while his travel up my back.</p><p>Halfway up my back, he presses his hand inward, forcing my back to bow up and my breasts to move closer to him. With neediness in his eyes, he lowers his mouth to devour my nipple, sucking hard while his tongue traces eager circles. I allow my head fall back as I moan in ecstasy and my thighs tingle as my stomach coils. He keeps sucking and sucking, moving back and forth between my breasts and right when I can\u2019t take anymore, my body about to combust from emotional overload, he pulls back.</p> <p>I start to stammer a protest when he lifts me up with one hand and jerks my shorts and panties off. I fumble to undo the button of his jeans and then he slips them off and kicks them aside. When I sit back down on his lap with a leg on each side of him, his hardness presses between my legs. I wait for him to slip inside me, raggedly breathing in anticipation, but his fingers wind around the back of my neck and he entices my lips to his while his finger slips up between my legs and slides into me.</p><p>He starts moving his fingers, harder and harder, feeling me thoroughly and pushing me toward blissful elation. His tongue and fingers move rhythmically and then he sucks my bottom lip into his mouth and grazes his teeth along it. His fingers push me higher until I\u2019m drifting away from reality, lost in the sweltering feelings I barely recognize. I finally scream out, completely letting go as I grasp forcefully onto his shoulders. I\u2019m barely coming back down when he slips his fingers out of me and with one final kiss, he thrusts himself into me.</p><p>I cry out again as a thousand different emotions soar through me and speed up my heart rate. My pulse throbs and my body pulsates more erratically with each of his thrusts. I start to move with him, wanting more, needing him to be as close as possible so we\u2019re linked together. My skin beads with sweat as he pushes harder, his hips meeting mine as he sinks into me, driving me farther into blissfulness. He grabs my arms, guides them behind my back, and secures my wrists together with one hand, forcing my chest outward. With each penetrating movement of his hips, my chest presses against his and it makes my nipples go hard. His lips find my neck where he kisses and licks a path down to my collarbone while his other hand grips at the flesh on my waist.</p><p>He lifts his hips higher as he holds my wrists together and leaves me vulnerable and trapped in the most insanely good way. I want to hold onto him, dig my nails in and feel his skin split open, letting out some of the overpowering passion inside me. But I can\u2019t do anything except let the feeling build as he pushes me closer the edge of reality. I get more lost with each connection of our bodies until I feel like I\u2019m going to explode. I scream out as I lose it completely and it feels like I\u2019m breaking apart on the inside, crumpling, falling into the dark.</p><p>Seconds later, Alex movements slow down. He gives one last deep press into me and we both cry out in unison. His fingers press against my wrist to the point where I wonder if they\u2019ll bruise and he pulls my waist forward so our bodies align perfectly together.</p><p>As we both gradually return to reality, we work to catch our breaths and slow our heart rates. His fingers loosen on my wrists and he finally frees me from his dominating hold. I move my arms forward and lean back, massaging my wrist with my fingers.</p> <p>Alex falls back against the mattress, his chest sheen with sweat. He places a kiss on my wrist before putting his hand on my cheek. \u201cAre you okay... I was a little rough?\u201d he asks, tracing my cheek.</p><p>I nod as he searches my eyes. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine... Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He nods then removes his hand from my face. Then he lies down and draws me down with him, pressing our foreheads together. \u201cAbout what I said in The Underworld.\u201d</p><p>I hold my breath, too afraid to speak. What if he says he didn\u2019t mean it? Can I handle it? Can I manage it if he says he loves me? I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll do, and honestly, I wish he\u2019d just keep his mouth shut so I can bask in the euphoric sensations he put inside me moments ago.</p><p>He takes an uneven breath and then releases it, the warmth hitting my cheeks. \u201cI think I... we need to... Jesus, Gemma I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Someone bangs on the door. \u201cAlex! Gemma!\u201d Aislin cries from the other side of the door. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Alex leans back and calls out, \u201cNot now, Aislin. Go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Laylen\u2019s missing!\u201d she yells. \u201cWe were talking and he was upset and then...\u201d she starts to sob, choking on her tears and her voice is muffled. \u201cHe took off and I can\u2019t find him anywhere. I\u2019m worried about what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right there,\u201d I call out as fear ascends in me. Laylen was already in the wrong place before, fighting his blood thirst and now he\u2019s hurting over his past. The combination is a deadly mix and I\u2019m worried he\u2019s either going to hurt himself or someone else.</p><p>I instantly climb off Alex\u2019s lap and he slips out of me. \u201cShit, this is bad.\u201d I reach for my panties balled up on the floor. \u201cHe looked so upset when my mom told him he was created on purpose.\u201d</p><p>Alex sits on the edge of the bed, watching me put my panties and shorts on. \u201cWe were all upset.\u201d</p><p>I fasten the button on my shorts. \u201cYeah, but he\u2019s been completely alone.\u201d</p><p>Alex stands to his feet and stretches his arms above his head, like he has no intention of hurrying. \u201cSo have you.\u201d</p><p>I pick up my bra. \u201cAlex, aren\u2019t you worried about him?\u201d</p><p>He collects his boxers and jeans from the floor. \u201cApparently not as much as you.\u201d</p><p>I frown as I hook my bra. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>He picks up his boxers and slips them on. \u201cIt means you\u2019re awfully upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d His blunt honesty throws me off a little.</p><p>I go to pick up my shirt and realize it\u2019s in pieces. \u201cAlex, if you lo... care for me at all, then you\u2019ll help us find him.\u201d I bite my tongue at my stupid blunder.</p><p>He slips his jeans on, studying me with an unreadable expression as he does up the button. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll help you find him,\u201d he says simply.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what it means exactly, yet it feels like it means something. The prickle is starting to emerge, but it quickly vanishes as Aislin bangs on the door again.</p><p>Alex tosses me his shirt. \u201cHere, put this on.\u201d</p><p>I catch it and tug it over my head, the smell of his cologne mixed with the calming scent of him overwhelming me. There\u2019s so much that\u2019s unsaid between us; so much that needs to be said. But I think we might be afraid of the truth in ourselves and each other. As he opens the door so we can walk out, I think about asking him how he feels about me, but in the end, fear owns me and my lips end up staying shut.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>Alex, Aislin, and I split up, Alex heading to town while Aislin and I go out onto the beach. With flashlights in our hands and cell phones in our pockets, Aislin hikes up the left side of the beach and I take the right.</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, either scream or call me,\u201d she says as she hurries down the shore, sweeping her flashlight across the sand.</p><p>I nod and turn away, aiming the flashlight in front of me as the waves rush over my feet. The moon is glistening down on the water, making it look oily and the stars twinkle so brightly they look like diamonds.</p><p>I walk swiftly, shouting out Laylen\u2019s name as I leave my footprints in the sand. I check behind rocks, in the backyard of nearby houses, and I even stare at the water a few times, fearing that\u2019s where he went. Hours go by and dawn arrives, kissing the land with shades of pink and orange, making the ocean blue again.</p><p>I\u2019m about to head back to the house when my phone rings. I slip it out of my pocket and answer it.</p><p>\u201cDid you find him?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Alex says. \u201cBut there are a lot of places he could still be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Aislin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m going to call her after I get off the phone with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, I\u2019ll keep looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back to the house first,\u201d he says as I start to head further up the shore. \u201cI don\u2019t like you out alone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit around and do nothing,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut I\u2019ll come back and check on my mother, then I\u2019m going out again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can come look with me,\u201d he replies with a silent plea in his voice. \u201cI need you... I need you close to me. I can barely concentrate because all I keep thinking about is that something is going to happen to you.\u201d He\u2019s acting strange and I wonder if something\u2019s wrong with him, like maybe he\u2019s found Laylen and it\u2019s bad.</p><p>I\u2019m about to tell him I\u2019ll head back, when I hear Aislin call out my name. It sounds like it came from somewhere down the shore behind me so I turn around and head in that direction. \u201cI gotta go. I just heard Aislin call out my name...\u201d I scan the shore with my hand shielding my eyes to block the glare of the sunrise. \u201cShe might need my help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he warns as I run up the shore. \u201cAnd call me back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will.\u201d I hang up as I reach an assembly of cliffy rocks that the waves crash into. There\u2019s a slender, sandy path that winds between them, disappearing around a corner a ways in.</p><p>\u201cGemma!\u201d Her voice is as clear as day and is coming from inside the rocks. \u201cGemma, I need your help. I fell off the rocks and I think I might have broken my leg.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m coming!\u201d I put my phone in my back pocket along with my flashlight and dash down the path. Sand seeps between my toes and the echo of the waves shatter against the jagged rocks. The farther I get, the narrower the path becomes until I have to maneuver over sections of the rock that are nearly touching.</p><p>\u201cAislin!\u201d I yell as I grab onto a lip on the rock and hop over it onto the path.</p><p>\u201cBack here!\u201d she hollers. \u201cPlease hurry. It hurts so badly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d I split my knee open as I climb over a larger rock and then twist my ankle as I dismount onto the path. I hobble up the rest of the path, clutching onto the rock wall, until I reach a dead end.</p><p>I glance around at the empty space. \u201cAislin, where are you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here!\u201d He voice floats over my shoulder and I spin around, with my arms out into front of me.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing behind me other than rocks and sand. I start to panic, reaching for my pocket and my phone, but something bumps my elbow. The impact lurches me forward and I trip over my feet then stumble to the ground, landing on my hands and knees.</p><p>I push up to my feet and quickly turn in a circle with my hands out to the sides of me. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Aislin says and her voice sounds like it\u2019s everywhere. \u201cI need your help, Gemma.\u201d</p> <p>I need to get the hell out of here. I run toward the path and bend my knees to leap over the rock, but an invisible force rams me in the stomach. I fall back down into the sand and land on my back, my head slamming against the side of the rough sandpaper rock.</p><p>My scalp splits open and blood oozes out, drenching my hair. As I blink up at the sky, my ears ring and my thoughts jumble together in incoherent images. There\u2019s a glimmer of light from the afterglow of the sun and then Aislin appears above me. Her green eyes shine like two lustrous emeralds, her smile is cheerful, and her golden brown hair blows in the breeze.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says cheerfully and then her smile plummets to a scowl. There\u2019s another flash of light and then her green eyes shift gold and her golden brown hair morphs to sandy blond as it shortens to the top of his head. \u201cBeautiful day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Nicholas says, hovering above me with a shovel in his hand. \u201cGlad to see that damn spell that Witch put on you finally wore off. God, I\u2019ve missed fucking with your head.\u201d</p><p>I moan, clutching my head as I roll to my side. \u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet I know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy, oh why did I hit Nicholas over the head with a rain stick.\u201d He raises the shovel over his head. \u201cPayback\u2019s a bitch.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to scream, but it gets cut off as he slams the shovel against my skull. The vibration of the impact reverberates through my brain. I cry out, but the sound of my voice quickly fades along with the world and my body as I disappear into darkness.</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>When I open my eyes again, I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be buried alive in the sand. What I see, though, makes me wish I was. I\u2019ve been to this place before, when Laylen bit me and I passed out. Also in a few of my dreams. I\u2019ve seen myself trapped in this land with Stephan as he turns me into something evil.</p> <p>Acres of muddy land stretch as far as my eye can see and are buried beneath piles of twisted and warped metal objects. Some look like junk and others like art and the deep shades of grey in the sky blend well with everything.</p><p>I slowly sit up, fighting the excruciating ache inside my skull, and glance around, knowing that something bad is about to happen. I can sense it in the metallic air, feel it in my aching bones, and I\u2019ve also seen it, way too clearly before.</p><p>Black ravens caw above my head and shower black feathers all over like ash. I push to my feet and check my pockets for my phone, but not surprisingly, they\u2019re empty. I try to summon the energy inside my body to Foresee my way out of here, but I can\u2019t so much as feel a spark. There\u2019s praesidium nearby; I can feel it hindering my power.</p><p>I place my hand on top of my head and wince at the large lump where the shovel hit me. \u201cDamn bastard Faerie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the Fey can be conniving little creatures,\u201d Stephan\u2019s cold voice rises over my shoulders and I whirl around before instantly stepping back.</p><p>He\u2019s leaning against a shiny, metallic sphere about the size of a compact car with his arms crossed. He\u2019s dressed in a black shirt and slacks, a golden chain hangs around his neck, and his dark eyes match his hair. His scar is also more evident than ever. He\u2019s not carrying a weapon, but I doubt he thinks he needs one. I wish he was wrong, however I know I\u2019m nothing but an ordinary girl who has a lot of useless power trapped inside her.</p><p>\u201cGemma Lucas, my star and the girl who\u2019s caused me a great amount of trouble over the last few weeks.\u201d Stephan\u2019s coal eyes study me, his face carrying confusion and intrigue. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a busy girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been a busy villain.\u201d I take a step back and my elbow bumps against a stack of crinkled metal boxes. \u201cCreating stars, destroying your children, ruining lives.\u201d</p><p>He only smiles as he stands up straight, squaring his broad shoulders. \u201cSo I see you\u2019ve discovered some of my secrets.\u201d He weaves around a pile of wire and then stations himself in front of it, only a few steps away from me. \u201cTell me, Gemma,\u201d he stuffs his hands into his pockets and his grin widens. \u201cHave the nightmares and power been getting to you?</p><p>\u201cWhat nightmares and power.\u201d I play dumb, dodging to the side, but end up smacking into a stack of iron rod spears.</p><p>\u201cSmart girl,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot smarter than that son of mine.\u201d He shuffles closer to me, removing his hands from his pockets and starts unbuttoning the sleeves of his shirt. \u201cI tried and tried to teach him to be more like you, so accepting to being emotionally detached, yet he just couldn\u2019t seem to get the hang of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean by beating him?\u201d I question daringly, glancing around for an escape route.</p><p>He shrugs, rolling up his sleeve. \u201cI had to do it some way, since his damn soul refused to take to Sophia\u2019s gift, the unus quisnam aufero animus. Such a beautiful thing, watching someone\u2019s soul getting detached,\u201d he muses. \u201cBut I never could figure out why it wouldn\u2019t work on Alex,\u201d he says as he rolls up his other sleeve. \u201cOther than maybe he was in love with you and too weak to succumb to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make him weak. It makes him strong,\u201d I say, staring at the mark on his arm. It\u2019s strange looking, not quite like Laylen\u2019s Mark of Immortality, but similar. The lines are just a little more angled and the black bleeds out on his skin.</p><p>He laughs as he turns his other arm over, revealing the black and red triangle inked on his forearm. \u201cWe\u2019ll see who\u2019s really weak here in a few moments, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>I quickly step back, but crash into the sizeable pile of steel cubes. I skitter out of the way as they clatter down to the ground, then dodge to my left and sprint across the dirt, winding through the loads of metal objects and bolting for the hill. I climb up it and then slide down it before racing off toward a section of antique cars are wasting away. It\u2019s like a maze where every turn leads to another turn until I finally reach a dead end. The ravens are thick and cloud the sky as more feathers rain down.</p><p>\u201cOh, Gemma,\u201d Stephan calls out and his voice sounds like it\u2019s everywhere; beneath me, above me, behind me. \u201cYou and I both know how this is going to end. We\u2019ve both seen how this is going to go.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard as I sprint in other direction toward a mid-sized car with a concaved roof. I pry open the door, then duck inside, lying down on the torn leather bench seat and then maneuver the door shut. The fact that Stephan knows about my nightmares and knows what I\u2019ve been seeing makes me wonder if Nicholas has been tapping into my future and replaying it to Stephan.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d just come out, it\u2019d be simpler,\u201d Stephan says and I hold my breath at the nearness of his voice. \u201cI\u2019ll make it quick. I promise.\u201d</p><p>My chest heaves as I struggle for air and fight to remain still. Nervous energy is charging through me and my heart is beating so loudly I\u2019m worried Stephan can hear it.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it could be beneficial,\u201d he tells me, his footsteps loudening. \u201cFeeling evil is a lot easier than feeling things like love. Although, I know you don\u2019t understand that emotion yet.\u201d</p><p>I throw my hands over my mouth as I spot him through the window with his back turned toward me. How does he know that I haven\u2019t felt love yet?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering how I know you haven\u2019t felt that appalling emotion that only belongs to the weak minded.\u201d He angles his neck back and stares up at the ravens in the sky, a halo of black feathers around his head. \u201cHow could I possibly know that you haven\u2019t been in love with anyone, even my son... although, I think he\u2019s probably getting there with you.\" He turns to the right and starts walking toward a small dirt hill rolling in the distance. \u201cSee, here\u2019s the thing. You two were never meant to be with each other.\u201d</p><p>I touch the scar on the palm of my hand, telling myself that he\u2019s wrong, that he has no idea what he\u2019s talking about. Forem. We belong together. Forever... maybe.</p><p>\u201cBut just because you weren\u2019t meant to be together,\u201d he says. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t going to try. Let me tell you something, though, love is way overrated. It makes humans weak and stupid.\u201d He starts to climb up the hill, his voice growing louder as he brings himself higher toward the grey sky. \u201cIt makes you do stupid things like go against everything you\u2019ve been taught. Alex giving you that locket was very wrong of him and made it impossible for me to get to you, at least for a while.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What the hell is he talking about? Impossible to get to me for a while. Why?</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t try,\u201d he says, standing on the hill with his arms folded. \u201cAlthough, trusting the Fey to bring you to me might have been a stupid mistake. They always did like to dither around. Keeping you at his house like that; I should have had you here days ago. I knew where you were, but Alex\u2019s sacrifice\u2014taking the impact of the memoria extracto like that\u2014made it impossible for me to get near you.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what\u2019s going on. Alex\u2019s sacrifice kept Stephen away from me. How?</p><p>I can\u2019t see him anymore and it\u2019s making me even more nervous, especially since he\u2019s stopped talking. I can\u2019t even track his voice. I remain as still as I can, breathing through my nose while trying to stay calm as raven\u2019s caw and litter the land with feathers. Then I hear the car door opening, metal bending and cringing, and then a hand grabs my ankle. I scream as I\u2019m jerked out of the car and land heavily on the ground.</p> <p>Stephan drags me toward the stack of metal boxes, whistling under his breath. I attempt to flip over onto my stomach as I claw at the dirt, but it does no good and the ground ends up tearing a few of my fingernails off. The pain is blinding and for a moment all I see are spots.</p><p>Finally, Stephan stops and lets me go. I swiftly roll over and push to my feet to run away, but he slams his foot down onto my back and I fall flat on my face, dirt entering my nose and mouth and I gasp for air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better off this way,\u201d he says as I turn over to my back, coughing to catch my breath. He gives me a kick to the side and I hear a bone crack as the tip of his boot collides with my ribs. He kicks me again and again until my whole body aches and starts to swell and turn black and blue.</p><p>I lie in the dirt, tired and heavily sore, gasping to breath and stay alive. He smiles, pleased at my beaten state, as he reaches into his pocket. Then he crouches down to the side of me, holding up a silvery sharp object with distinct engravings on the sides of it that almost take the shapes of letters but not quite. It looks the like a chunk of metal, but I have a feeling it\u2019s more than that.</p><p>\u201cYou can never love him, you know.\u201d He sets the rigid piece of metal down on my stomach, the engravings along the flat sides smoldering neon green. \u201cEvery time you two are close to each other, it ignites the power. Once you actually fall in love\u2014in actual, real, genuine, pure, true love\u2014you\u2019ll kill the power and yourselves.\u201d</p> <p>I gasp, shaking my head. \u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d I choke, wiping blood from my nose.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d He raises the piece of metal in front of my face. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019ve been so dead set on keeping you two unemotional and apart from each other? If you fall in love my star is ruined. It\u2019s been told in a vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess you lose,\u201d I hack, clutching my side.</p><p>\u201cI never lose,\u201d he growls, pricking his finger with the metal and drawing blood, which drips down on me, disgustingly warm and sticky against my skin. \u201cThe vision said that it could happen, but that I stop it somehow.\u201d He grabs my arm and I struggle to get away as he aims the tip of the metal at my upper arm and then pricks it. \u201cI always win.\u201d He drips his blood on my open wound and I gag. \u201cI thought detaching your soul would do it, but apparently not. This way\u2019s better anyway. You\u2019ll enjoy being evil, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work.\u201d I bring my knee up to kick him, but he stomps down on my swollen shin and then strikes me across the head with his arm. I can barely see or feel past the unbearable pain. I just want to die. Fall in love and die. Would it be a good way to go?</p><p>\u201cIt will work,\u201d he assures me and then stabs the piece of scorching metal into the incision on my arm, inserting it straight into a vein. I let out a earsplitting scream as the energy of it violently streams through my blood and singes my skin. \u201cAnd you want to know why?\u201d He slopes over me, his eyes darkening, showing the evil inside him. \u201cBecause you already have evil blood in you, thanks to your father. It\u2019s the only way I can put the mark on you.\u201d</p> <p>I open my mouth to protest, but a foul, sinister feeling slithers through my veins and my blood suddenly feels thick like tar. The feeling continues to build, a vile sensation burning feverishly underneath my flesh. It sears into my bones, turns my heart into a pile of ash, and leaves my soul empty.</p><p>Empty. My heart keeps beating, my lungs seeking air, but everything else is dead.</p><p>When I open my eyes again, Stephan has risen to his feet. I turn my head to the side to see the red and black triangular symbol permanently branded on my skin. It\u2019s surprising how easy it is to accept, like it\u2019s always belonged there. The more accepting I become to it, the less pain I feel, and I finally just give in and let it own me.</p><p>Stephan searches my eyes for life, but there\u2019s nothing in me except a shadow of myself, a rotting corpse, the soulless girl I\u2019ve become accustom to. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d He asks, tugging his sleeves down.</p><p>I search my brain for a response. \u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cGood.\u201d He buttons the bottom of his sleeves back up and steps back from me. \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to stay here for a while, just until I can figure out one more thing; then I\u2019ll come back for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say simply, staring into the sky at the ravens swooping above me. \u201cBut where am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Wasteland,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich ironically enough is a place for broken, discarded, magical objects.\u201d</p> <p>I nod, obeying. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he remarks with a clever smirk. \u201cI know that you can with that power of yours, however I need you to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I agree. \u201cI won\u2019t go anywhere. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He walks off toward a pile of knotted barbed wire and then he disappears, leaving me alone with my new mark.</p><p>I remain lying in the dirt, beaten and bruised, watching and listening to the ravens flap their wings as they cry out to each other. Inky black feathers drift down from the sky and surround me in stacks as time aimlessly drifts by. I count the seconds to pass the time, but somewhere I lose track. Everything begins to blend together and the sky becomes lighter then darker as the days change. The ravens grow tired and so do I. Suddenly I\u2019m tired of sitting here and obeying. I don\u2019t want to obey. I want to feed the darkness stirring inside me. It\u2019s hungry and needs to feed.</p><p>Every once in a while I do feel a dim spark flicker inside my heart, begging me to come back, and it briefly warms my chilled core. I know who\u2019s causing it and the more it happens, the more frustrated I get.</p><p>Finally, I get up and hike across the land, scooping up a saber with a bent blade that\u2019s resting in a heap of swords and knives. The ravens fly after me, circling my head as I stride over shallow hills toward the skyline. I stop only when I\u2019m far enough away, then I can open up the box locked inside me. I let the darkness inside me flood out and consume my mind, allowing any trace of my old self to dissipate. Then I shut my eyes and channel my Foreseer energy, fueling it with the evil living beneath my skin.</p><p>I picture Alex\u2019s sturdy body, dark brown hair, and green eyes as clearly as I can. Once I see him perfectly, I clutch onto him and let my Foreseer power pull me to him, holding onto the saber as I prepare myself to see him soon. Prepare myself to kill him. Kill the electric spark concealed inside my soul, the last speck of good inside me.</p><p>Then I\u2019ll be nothing other than a shell. A hollow, evil shell. </p> </body></html>"]
