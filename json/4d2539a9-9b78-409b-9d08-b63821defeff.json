For a momentthey waited, staring breathlessly up theside of the large galleon and holding the lines, allowing their craft to be dragged along bythe larger ship's momentum. At last, whenahueandcryfailedto arise, all eyesslowlyreturned to Valoree.</p><p>Shestared back, knowing these menallsaw her asa slender youngman - little more than a boy, really.All of them butHenry.</p><p>He alone knew that their deceased captain's younger brother Valerian, who had served as acabinboy These last eight years, was reallya girl. Of coursehe knew;he'd been the one who had suggestedthe charade so manyyears before, when he'd realized thatJeremy - hiscaptain and herbrother - intended tokeep her aboard aship full of pirates.</p><p>Aye, thesemen allthought hera lad, young and untried. And yet, they hadvowedto followher. Only a desire forvengeance could make these two dozenmen, cutthroats andhooligans all, follow someone they had always looked uponas a green lad, a little brother or son to be coddledand spoiled. Andvengeance they wouldhave.</p><p>Glancing down into thewater, Valoree took inherreflection.</p> <p>Her bodywas slim - she waslean rather than muscular - and it trembledwith anticipation. For a momentshe imagined that her eyes were nolonger those of the youthwho hadmoved easily among these men, laughing and chatting as she'd gone about her chores. Nay, her eyesnow seemed old, hard, bitter with fresh loss. A lossthesemen sharedas well.</p><p>Herbrother had been a good manandafair captain, and his ship, theValor, had been the onlyhome most of his crew had knownforthe last eight years. The men who now accompanied her were thelastof that crew.She glanced aroundat them, then back at herreflection.</p><p>Thoughher shirt was her own, she now wore her brother's breeches, along with his hatand jacket. Jeremy's boarding ax and pike were hooked through the thick belt at her waist, and a brass-barreled flintlock was sticking out ofthose baggy, too-large pants.The captain'scutlass rested in its sheath where ithungat her side. She had taken his clothing when she had sworn' vengeance for his death - andshe had notbathed since.</p><p>Everyinchof her body, every item, every inch of cloth, wood, and metal was covered with its owner's dried blood, as were Valoree's face, hands, and feet.Evenher longhair was crusty with the stuff.Though it wasnormally avibrant, fiery red - as her brother's had been - it was now streaked through with crimson, marked by the red blood of her brother's death - a reminder of her vow.</p><p>Herbrother had notdied easily. He had notdied quickly.He, along with the majority of his men, had died slowly and in torment. And for that, Valoree and the remainder of Jeremy's crewhad vowed, these Spaniardswould pay.</p><p>Sheglanced toward Skullyandnodded. The cadaverous man immediately reached for histools, and Valoreeturnedher back as he began to bore holes in thebottomof theircraft. She regarded her crew, awaitingtheirreaction.She did nothave long to wait.</p> <p>Skully wasstillworkingon the second hole when the last of them turned toherin understanding. In their faces she read approval and a grudgingrespect. To reassurethem of her intent, she half hissed, half whispered, \"We take this shiporwedie. There is no escape. We fight not onlyto avenge the deaths of goodmen, but for our lives.\"</p><p>\"Forour lives and vengeance, \" Henry vowed beside her in a hushed tone. His words were immediately taken up by the others.</p><p>\"Lifeand vengeance!\"</p><p>She relaxed somewhat at their acceptance, an odd calm overtaking heras shesilently watched Skullyfinishboringthe holes in the bottom of their boat. The holes were relatively small, butevenso, by the timehe hadstartedon thesixth, theboat was alreadygathering water andbeginning tosink.</p><p>As Skully hurriedly returned his tools to hissatchel, Valoree drew her brother'scutlass from its sheath. Moving to theside of their slowly sinking ship, she led the men inastealthyclimb up the side of the Spanish galleon. Her bare hands and feet moved surely up the rope until she reached the top, the others close behind. Pausing there, Valoree peered over the side and glared about.</p><p>Several men, taking advantage of the night breeze, were sleepingout in theopen airof the deck. Valoree glanced toward thehelm andsmiled grimly uponseeing thehelmsman. The man, while still athis post, hadnodded off and was nowdozing away his shift, senseless. There was no one to give an alarm. The Spaniards would betaken completely by surprise.</p><p>Slipping silently over the side, Valoree hunkered low, sticking totheshadows. Her men followed. As thelastof them slid tothe deck, she gestured silently, dividing them intotwo groupswith onesimplewave of herhand, then gesturingfor one group to stay abovedeck, while directing the otherstoward the darkhole that was theentrance to thecabins. Theyall beganto moveat once, separating andmoving all over the ship. The men above deck positionedthemselves amongthe sleeping Spaniards, ready to set to work, butwaiting the few moments necessary to allow those men slipping through the hole to reach their targets, lest some sound ordeath crywarn theirenemiesbelow.</p><p>Leaving the rest of the crew to the others, Valoree moved stealthily toward the helmsman. She had nearly reached him when something startled the man awake.</p> <p>Drawing a sword, the Spaniard peered blearily at her. She froze, but his gaze found her anyway. Takingin Jeremy'sbloody clothesandherredhair flowing about her blood-streaked face, heblinked.</p><p>\"Rojo ...El Capitan Rojo? \"</p><p>Valoree stiffened at the words, recognizing the name the Spanish used for herbrother. Captain Red, because of his red hair.</p><p>\"Regresadelmuerto... El Rojo, \" the man whispered faintly, then straightened abruptly, shrieking.\"Regresa del muerto. El Rojo!\"</p><p>His cry awokeothers nearby, and thesleepy-eyed menturned to gape at herin horror. Thehelmsman's cry was taken up again andagain. \"Regresa del muerto.ElRojo!\"</p><p>For a moment, everyone was still. The others she'd brought withher, startled by the shouting, turned to peerat Valoree. She drew back, annoyed, then peeredaboutatthefrozen tableau. Her crewmates seemedastransfixedasthe Spaniards. With aglance atthe nearest of the men, she snappedirritably, \"What the devil ishe saying, Henry? \"</p><p>Drawn out of his startled state by the question, the quartermaster relaxed andgrimly smiled. Thenhe shrugged. \"He's thinkin' ye're yer own brother, Captain Red.He's thinkin'ye're backfrom the dead. He'sscreamin' 'Back-from-the-Dead Red, '\"</p><p>heexplained. Thecry continued around them.</p><p>\"Regresadelmuerto. El Rojo!\"</p><p>\"Back-from-the-Dead Red? \" Valoree repeated, then frownedat theterrified Spaniards.\"Well, atleastthey shall know whythey die.\" Raising Jeremy's cutlass, she advancedon the helmsman, but much to her consternation, the man immediatelydropped his weapon. For a moment, Valoree wasnonplussed, butthe sudden chorus of metal against wood drew her attention to thefact that every Spaniard aboard the ship was nowgivingup his weapon unasked, all dropping themto the deck floor.</p><p>\"What the devil are they doing? \" Valoree cried in dismay.\"Are they notgoing to fight? \"</p><p>Henry glanced around, then turned to face her. \"Well, \" he drawled, scratching at his ear. \"I'mthinkin' they'rethinkin' that since ye're a ghostand all, there ain't no sense in afightin' ye.</p><p>Most like they think we're the restof the men that were kilt... and yecain't kill someonewhat's already dead.\"</p><p>\"El Rojo.\"</p><p>Valoree glanced up at hearingagain the helmsman's terrified murmur. The Spaniard was now tugging his pistol free and dropping it on the deck beside his sword. Throughout, he continuedmumbling, \"Regresa del muerto.ElRojo.\"</p><p>Before shecoulddecide on a course of action, a scuffle atthe entrance to the cabinsdrewherattention.Valoreeglanced over as the men who had gone below returned, pushing several captives ahead of them. The first wasobviously the captain, and helooked angry. He also looked willingto fight, Valoree saw withrelief. At least someone would. It was hard to take revenge when the enemy refused to fight. She wouldn't simply kill unarmed men; thatwas not fair. She was just about to move to confront the Spanish captain when the helmsman spotted his commander. He immediately shrieked, \"El Rojo! Regresa del muerto!\"</p><p>The captain started to glance toward the man, but his gaze caught and stayed onValoree.Thewhipping wind filled the cloth ofJeremy's jacket, making her appear larger thanshe was, and She hadtofight to keepherbloody red hair from covering her eyes. She pulledJeremy'shatdown further ontoher head and glared at the Spaniard with hatred. The man gaped, then murmured, \"ElRojo? \"</p><p>\"Si, \" the helmsman cried. \"ElRojo, regresa del muerto.\"</p><p>\"Shut up!\" Valoree saidin a growl tothemouthy sailor. She was sick ofhearing those words.Starkterrorentered the captain's face aswell.\"Tell him toshut up, Henry, \"she said hurriedly.</p><p>Henry translated the order into Spanish, but the panicked helmsmancould nothave obeyedhad he wished to. He seemed able only to repeathimself over and over. Irritated, Valoree drew Jeremy's flintlock pistol andshot him.</p><p>The mandroppedtothe deck with a shriek, grabbing forthe wound in his leg.</p><p>As if that were the signal for somepreplanned form of action, the Spaniards all made asuddenexodustowardthe sides of the ship. Taken bysurprise, Valoree andthe others could onlywatch inamazementas thecrew of the galleon, as one, castthemselves screaming into shark-infested water.</p><p>Cursingunder her breath, Valoreestalked to the side of the ship and peered down at the men in the sea below.They were thrashing about in the water, moving in the generaldirection of the nearest island. \"The gunnycowards, \" shemuttered.</p><p>\"Aye, \" Henry agreed.Heandthe rest of the men had moved closer to peer down at theirfleeing adversaries.</p><p>Slamming a palm down on the rail in frustration, Valoree cursed. \"Jumping rather than fighting, can youimagine? \"</p><p>Henry shook his head.\"SpinelessSpanishbastards.\"</p><p>Sighing, she frowned at the water below. A moment later, One-Eye let out a dismayed oath.Glancingup, Valoree peered over at where he waspointing. The helmsman wason his feet, and had hopped to the side of the ship. Hewas now balancing himself precariously on the railing. As she watched in amazement, theman hefted himselfover the sideof theboat to land withasplashin the water behind his comrades. It seemed that swimming with sharks was more attractive than keeping company with ghosts, even for the wounded man.</p><p>\"Ye want we should shootthem? \" One-Eye asked with little enthusiasm.</p><p>Valoree shookher head in disgust. \"Leave go. They are not likely to make itto shore. 'Sides, noneof thembore the scar.\" She desired revenge, but there was no pleasure in killing cowards.</p><p>The othersnodded in agreement. Besides, this wasapparently not the shipof their trueenemy. One of thefewthings they had learnedfromJeremy, ere he took hislast breath, was that the Spaniard whohad ordered the torturous deaths ofher brother and somany of hismen borea scar inthe shape of aquestion mark onhisneck. Andthecaptainof this vessel had borneno such scar.</p><p>Sighing, Valoree straightened and turnedto survey theSpanish galleon.\"Well, \" shesaidsoftly, \"it wouldseem we have a ship.\"</p><p>\"Aye, \"Henry murmured. \"That itwould.\"</p><p>\"Have we enough mento sail it? \"</p><p>Henry surveyed the small number of their remaining crew.</p><p>\"Aye, \"he said. \"Enoughto getto port and pick up more men...</p><p>Captain.\"</p><p>Valoree glanced at him sharply. \"Captain? \"</p><p>He nodded solemnly. \"Aye. Of this, the Valor II. I'm thinkin' we'vegot us a fine captain. Ye've the spirit, the courage, the determination... and, better yet, ye've already got yerself a reputationand title.\"When she looked bewildered, he shrugged.</p><p>\"Ye've already taken yer firstship.If any ofthose men out there survive their swim, all will hearabout theirterrifying encounter with Back-from-the-Dead Red.\"</p><p>Valoree rolled hereyes and glancedat theothers. All of them were standing about, nodding in agreement. It seemed she had not only stepped into her brother's clothes, but she had also stepped into his command. Back-from-the-Dead Red, indeed.</p><p>Thanks to a load of superstitious Spaniards, she was now the captain of some of the most bloodthirsty cutthroatsit hadever beenher misfortuneto meet - ifshewanted them.She wasonly nineteen. That was young to bea captain. But then, Jeremy had beenonly eighteen whenshe had helpedhim purchaseand outfit the Valor. And asfor her gender, theyalready thoughther a boy.</p><p>Seeingherhesitation, Henry moved closer. \"Now, thinkon it for aminute before yego making up your mind. Cap'nRed - yer brother Jeremy - he did this only to make somemoney;then he planned to go claim your familyestate, set it to rights, settle down, and start a family.\"</p><p>\"Aye, but - \"</p><p>\"But nothing. Now that dreamis yours.\"</p><p>Valoreeblinkedat that. \"What meanyou, now that dream is mine? \"she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\"I mean, with him gone, ye haveto make hisdreamcometrue for him. Claimtheinheritance, settledown, start a family.\"</p><p>Valoree wassilent for a moment, thenfrowned. \"But I do not have the money to - \"</p><p>\"Well, that there is true enough.That was what Jeremy was doin', earnin' the money toclaim theestate. It'snot been livedin since ye was a weebabe. He said heneededa fair sumto putthe placeto rights.\"</p><p>\"Andhehadearned it, \"One-Eye put in bitterly.\"Morethan enough to claimthe land and set it to rights.

It occurs to me that out there somewhereis a Spanishgalleon with yer brother's treasureon it - or someonewhoknows where it is.

It don'tlookgood.\"</p> <p>\"Aye, but the captain's in need of some real feminine-type colors tomake her look less.. .\" Another glare from Valoree made the manhesitate, then murmurdiplomatically, \"To make her look lesscaptainlike. 'Sides, her hair'skind ofa brown-red. It might work.\"</p><p>\"Forgetit, \" Valoreesnapped. \"I amnotwearing pink. It's bad enough I have to put on a damn dress. It willnot be a pink one.\"</p><p>The two men traversing the dark London streetswith her fell silentfor a moment; thenOne-Eye murmured, \"Well, whatabout yellow then? Yellow's real feminine. Maybe - \"</p><p>\"One-Eye, \" Skullyinterrupted, then paused in hiswalking.</p><p>\"What? \" One-Eye asked irritably. Heand Valoree paused, too.</p><p>\"Ain't this the place? \"</p><p>One-Eye andValoree both turned to peer up at the building they now stood before. It was small, two levels, squeezed in between two other storefronts. The building's lower windows were dark, but the upper ones were filledwith the soft glow of candlelight.</p><p>\"Aye, this is it. Them lights upstairs is where they live, \"</p> <p>One-Eye announced unnecessarily.</p><p>Nodding, Valoree gestured toward the door and waited. Her two crewmen glanced ateach other, shrugged, then charged like twobulls spotting a red cape. Herangrycry of realization was lost in thesound of splinteringwood.The doorcaved in under their combined weight, fragments flying in every direction.</p><p>Grimacing, Valoree glanced quicklyupand downthe street to be sureno one had witnessed the deed then followed the men into the dark interior. Inside, shefound thetwo lying in atangled heap on the floor.</p><p>\"You were supposed to knock, you blathering idiots.\"</p><p>\"Well, how wasweto know? \"One-Eye sputtered, jumping to hisfeet andreachingup to besure the patch thatcovered his missingeyewas still in place.</p><p>\"Aye, \" Skullyadded, regaining hisfeetnearly as quicklyas his friend, despite his peg leg. \"Andif that wasall ye were wantin', why didn't ye doit yerself? \"</p><p>\"Why, indeed? \" Valoree sighed as the sound of feet pounding down the stairs somewhereatthebackof the building echoed through the quiet shop. The bright light of a lantern appeared a moment later, and Valoree stepped forward to stop hermenfrom drawing their swords as the man carrying it paused in the entranceto the room. He wasdressed in a long nightshirt.</p><p>For amoment itlooked as if the man might swallow his own tongueashe took inthe scenebefore him, and Valoree couldn't blamehim. Hisshopwasa shambles. Not only was there a great gaping hole where thedoorhad once stood, but whenthat door had given way, Valoree'smen hadfallen inward, crashing into a tableholding piles offabric. All of these were now strewn across the floor. Added to that, the intimidating presence of three disreputable-looking characters now filled up the little space therewas left in his smallshop.The fellow took all this in, and swayed slightlyas if he might swoon.</p><p>The man's reaction was understandable, Valoreesupposedwith a wrygrimace, her gaze moving over her men. She herself was small and not very intimidating.She wore a billowing white shirt, black breeches and waistcoat, boots, and a wide belt. But One-Eyeand Skully more thanmadeupforher, whatwith their owndirty, less respectable clothes, Skully's oft-broken nose and peg leg, andOne-Eye's patch.</p><p>\"There was a bit of a mishap with your knocker, \" she said pleasantly in aneffort to calm the man.Hewas shaking so hard that the light from hislantern was wavering, makingshadows dance onthewall.One-Eyegave aguffaw at that, and sheturned to glare at him briefly, then glanced back to the shopkeeper.</p><p>Rather than appearing reassured, the man had merely stepped warily back theway he had come, looking fit to burst into a run at any moment. And most likely he'd be screaming for the authorities at the top of his lungs.</p><p>Shifting impatiently, Valoreeheldout ahand toward One-Eye, whoimmediately unhooked the bag that hung from his belt and dropped it intoher hand.She promptly sent it sailing acrossthe room. The coins inthe bag jangled merrily as they sailedthrough the air, and the man's backward motions stoppedabruptly.</p><p>Nearly dropping his lantern, the shopkeeper reached instinctively to catch the purse.</p><p>\"Iam in need of some dresses, \"Valoree announceddryly.</p><p>The little tailor looked startled at that announcement, then weighed the bagin his hand, eyeing his guests a little lesswarily.</p><p>\"Ye brokeme door.\"</p><p>\"My menwill fix it.\"</p><p>Themanshiftedon his feet, a calculating lookcoming into his eyes.\"Decentfolk cometome shopduring the day;they don't drag abody out of his bed in the middle of thenight.\"</p><p>There was a tense silence during which One-Eye reached for his cutlass, butValoree stopped him witha gesture. Instead, she held a handout toward Skully.The cadaverous man muttered something about people disrespecting their betters, but he unhooked the bag at his own waist andhanded it over.She sent that hurtling toward the greedy shopkeeper aswell.</p><p>Amazingly enough, the man managedto catch the secondbag without losingeither the first orthe lantern. Holdingmoregoldin his handsthan he had probably seen atonetime in hislife, he nodded accommodatingly. \"Ye'll have to be bringingthe wench here ye want gowned. Iffen ye don't, I cain't guarantee the dresses'll fit.\"</p><p>\"The dressesarefor me, \" Valoree announced grimly.</p><p>The shopkeeper froze at that announcement, amazement covering his face.The expression was followedby a sneer, and hebegan toshake his head.</p><p>\"Now, that there is another situation altogether. I'll not be dressing aman in - \" His words died asOne-Eyedrew his sword.</p><p>Sighing, Valoree caught her crewman's arm as he started forward. \"Leave off, \" she muttered. \"You men thought me a man for years, too.\"</p><p>\"Aye, but we knew you as a boy. I mean, we thought we did.</p><p>We just thought youwas kind of a fey anddelicate type.\"</p><p>Valoree rolled her eyes. She supposedshe should be flattered that they had at least thoughther fey and delicate.</p><p>\"'Sides, wewouldn'thavethought that if Henry hadtoldusthe truth instead of keepingit allto himself fer so long.\"</p><p>\"Henrydidwhat he had todo, \" Valoree snapped, then drew off thehat She had been wearing lowon her brow. Stepping forward sothat the light couldreach her face, she calmlyaddressedthe shopkeeper. \"I amnot a man.\"</p><p>Herface hadbeen castin shadow by the brim of her hat, but wasnow revealed. As she felt her hair spill down from where it hadbeenpiled, Valoree caught the dressmaker leering slightly before he saw the expressions of the men accompanying her.</p><p>Swallowing anycomment, he forced a blank expression to his face and nodded beforeturning his eyesupward.\"Wife!Wife, there's work to bedone!\"</p><p>Valoree turned then to take in Skully and One-Eye with a glance. \"Fix that door and - \" Herwords were cut off in surprise when the gaping hole in question was suddenly filled by a behemoth ofaman.He was taller eventhanSkully, and much wider.There was a kerchief onhisbald head, an earring in his ear, and he wore tighttan pants anda billowingwhite shirt that contrasted with his dark skin. \"Bull, \" Valoree said.</p><p>The man's dark eyes swept overthe peoplein the room;then hesteppedaside, revealing anoldhaghe had in tow.</p><p>\"Yeraunt, \"thegiant rumbled, pushing the reluctant woman forward.</p><p>Valoree, One-Eye, andSkullywere all silent as they staredat the woman. She looked to be in herfifties.</p><p>Herdress was torn andfilthy, andher hairwas thecolor of a dirtyLondon street. The woman looked like an aging prostitute.</p><p>Cometo that, she mostlikely wasone. Valoree shookherhead grimly, turning ontheman holdingthecreature still with one arm.</p><p>\"Isaidsomeone decent, Bull, \" she chided.</p><p>\"Thisisas decent as it gets at the docksatnight, \" came his answer. \"She'll clean up good.\"</p><p>Sighing, Valoree took a step toward the woman, then paused, stepping back as she got a whiff of her. The action didn't go unnoticedby Bull's captive, who immediately drew her shoulders up defiantly. The action touched something in Valoree.</p><p>Turning to One-Eye, she held out her hand. A third bag of coins hit her palm. Valoree tossed it across the room to the already weighed-down tailor. None of them were terribly surprised whenhe managed to catchit without difficulty, though it required some deftreadjustments. They hadbeen told the man loved gold better than anything in the world, and itappearedthe rumors were true. Good. Honestly, those rumors were why Valoree had chosen to use this tailor's services. That andthe fact that themanwasas crookedas Skully's nose.A man who would take customers whovisited in the wee hours of the night, and were accompanied by such a rough lot, would be unlikely to gossip - oratleast to bebelieved.</p><p>\"The old woman will need dresses as well, \" Valoree announced.\"And a bath.\"</p><p>The shop ownerstiffened indignantly. \"This ain'tno inn.\"</p><p>Skully had more gold out before Valoree could signal. Thistime she tossed the bagat theman's feet. Cursing, hejumped quickly back, then bent to retrieve it. Straightening then, he raised his head, and bellowed again. \"Wife! Get yerarse out ofbed! Now!\"</p><p>**** Three hours later the shopkeeper's bellows had mellowed to tired sighsashe and his wife finished measuring Valoreeforthe three gowns upon which she had decided. It had taken sometime to dealwith the old woman, so they had done that first; dumping herina tub, scrubbing her to a shining glow, then taking the measurements they needed before dressing her in one of the shopkeeper'swife's old gowns. Valoree was pleasedto see she didn't look nearly as cheap cleanedupand in aborrowedgown.</p><p>In fact, ifit weren't for her surly manner, Valoree was surethe woman would be perfect for the role ofher aunt. Perhaps she was not apoor choice after all.</p><p>\"Arms up, please, \" the shopkeeper's wife instructed, smiling with gentle sympathy at Valoree's impatient frown. \"This isthe last measurement, \" the woman added quietly as she drew the tape around herchest.</p><p>Valoreesighed in relief. She was exhausted, so tiredshe felt sure she could sleep for a week, and it wasn't thehour. She was more than usedto late nights - it was impossibleto run a boat full of pirates without half your nights beinglate ones. It was this task she'd been busywiththat hadworn herout. There was nothing so boring to hermind asfussing over gownsand cloaks and just which material went withwhat. Itwas alla lot of bother, and a task she would have been more than happy to hand over to One-Eye or Skully ... if she hadn't feared being stuck in something pink andfrilly. \"Very good, \" the tailorannouncedwith relief as he wrote down thenumber his wife spoke. He looked tired himself, and was likely eager tohave Valoree and herburly companions depart. But before she went, she needed to clear things up.</p><p>\"I'llneedone day gownfor each of us bytomorrow. I wantthe other gowns thedayafter.The menwillreturn forthem. Make sure they are ready by noon.\"</p><p>\"Noon tomorrow? \" the mansquawkedat oncein horror. \"But that is mere hoursaway! I cannot possibly - \"</p><p>\"You can and you will, \" Valoree interrupted mildly as she began to walk towardthefront of the building.</p><p>\"You don't understand - \" the shopkeeper began, following closelybehind her.</p><p>\"Aye, I do.\" Valoree paused andturnedto glowerathim.\"I understandthat I have paidyouwell, and that I wish for two of the gowns to bedone by noon tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"Aye, my lady, butI cannot - \"</p><p>\"Did I not giveyou enough coins foratleast ten times that many garments? \"</p><p>\"Well, aye, \"he admitted reluctantly.</p><p>\"Exactly.Now, ifyou cannot have the gowns done when I wish, I can takemybusiness, and my coins, elsewhere.\"</p><p>The threat got the reaction she'd expected. The shopkeeper took a stepback, abject horror on his face.He began to stutter.</p><p>\"N-nay. I-I w-will have them done. I-I w-willhire extrawomen tosew.\"</p><p>\"Good.\" Turningback, Valoree glancedaround the frontroom of the man's shop. Hersailors wereplayingcards on the table they'd crashed into when they'd busted the door down.</p><p>Apparently they hadfixedthat, too, though she hadn't thought to order it. In addition, all the fabric that had originally rested on it andbeenstrewn onthefloorhad been gathered and restacked on the tableadjacent. Theold hag, her soon-to-be aunt, was sound asleep on anoldmat in a corner of the room.</p><p>Though Valoreebriefly wondered howthe woman couldbear to sleep on the hard wooden floor with only a thin rug for cushioning, she quickly pushed the questionaside.

Taking a small but painfully sharp knife from his boot, he slammed it into the counter beside the tailor.</p><p>Valoree glanced at the shopkeeperandhiswife meaningfully.</p> <p>\"One-Eye's leaving thatas a gift. And a reminder.\"</p><p>\"A reminder? \" The shopkeeper was beginning to get the nervous look he'd had when he'd first comedownstairs.</p><p>\"Aye. A reminder not to mention this night. To anyone.\"</p><p>One-Eye smiledwidely then, an expression that did not quite reach his one good eye. \"Keepit nice andsharp, \" he said in a menacing growl. \"Orkeepyour tongue from wagging.\"</p><p>The shopkeeper seemed to understand at once; he was nodding vigorously when his wife suddenly piped up with a nervous, \"Why? \"</p> <p>\"Because I'll becuttin' your tongues outwithit if I hear ye donegoneand mentionedus toanyone. Anyoneatall.\"</p><p>Valoreealmostsighed aloud at his words. One-Eye trulydid enjoyhis work. And he did itwell, too. Toowell. Withasmall gurgle, the shopkeeper's wife went intoafull swoon, hittingthe floor with aresounding crash.</p><p>Shaking her headat One-Eye in reproof, Valoree turned and led the wayout. Ittook them verylittle time in the empty London streets tofindtheir waybackto the ship.</p><p>Themoment Valoree awoke and stepped out of her cabin into the sunlight, abarrel-chested olderman hurried toward her. At his approach, she sighed.Henry. Her quartermaster. He had held the position for her brother when Jeremy was captain, and continued to hold itfor her. The rank put him right below her, second in command. Insome ways, it gave him morepower. He was her right hand, and though she was loath to admit it, she doubted she could control the men without him. She had left him in charge of them last nightwhile She had gone in search of a dressmaker, and he'dsurely had his hands fulltrying to prevent anyonefrom slipping overthe side to follow thelure of rum and womenthatgoing ashore promised. Theyhad been at sea a long time, and mostof the crew were eager for leave. But ifanyone knew howto helpcontrol these cutthroats, it wasHenry.</p><p>\"Some of the men are wanting to go ashore, \" the man announced at once, barring her way onto the deck.</p><p>\"No.\"</p> <p>\"Ah, now, Cap'n, girl, \"hewheedled, tuckinghis thumbs into the frontofhis belt and rolling backon his heels. \"Yeknow as well as I thattheboys have worked right hardthe last fewweeks, and they been real patient'bout goin'ashore, waitin'till you was ready toletthem. But I'm thinkin' ifye're awantin' them to stay patient, ye best belettin' em have a littleleave.\"</p><p>Drumming her fingers against her leg, Valoreeglancedatthe crew gathered on deck. They were all looking pathetically hopeful. She supposed She had kept them aboard long enough.</p><p>But she'dwanted to avoid trouble, andonce the mengotsome drink into them, they could be a whole passel of that.Still, they were going to bein port only one more day. If her appointment withthe lawyer hadn't been set for so late in the afternoon, they would have left already. However, she had not been able to secure an earlier meeting, and none but a handful had been allowed leave since they had left the Caribbean more than a month ago.It wasno wondertheboys werelooking sohopeful.</p><p>Pushing Henrybacktoward the men, she looked them over slowly. \"No stealing, no brawling, and no killing. If you break anything, you fix it or pay for it. And leave all but tavern wenches alone. If I hear of any ofyou bothering shopkeepers' daughters, you're off the ship. Understand? \"</p><p>She suspected bytheir eager nods that they would have agreed tonearly anythingto goashore.Her gaze moved to thelargest of the men, a Scot nearly as largeas Bull, with hair thecolor of a carrot. \"You're in charge, Jasper. Anyonegets outofline and I'll beafter your hide.\"</p><p>She waited untilhe nodded, then continued. \"Leave enough men behind to guard the ship; let the rest go. Then switch.</p><p>Richard.\" Her secondmate stepped quickly forward. \"You decide who goes first.\"</p><p>Henry moved forwardto join the groupas Richardbegan to pick and choose, but Valoreeshook herhead. \"Not you, Henry.\"</p> <p>\"Ah, now, Cap'n, girl - \"</p><p>\"I need you.\" It was all shesaid, then turnedand headedback belowdecks. It was all she hadtosay, and sheknew it. Henry's wheedlingdied at once, and she heard him follow her to her cabin. He would dowhatever she requested without complaint.</p><p>He always had. He, Bull, Skully, Pete theGreek, One-Eye, and Richard were the most loyal of hercrew.She wouldn't havebeen able to manage the men without them, and she was just as grateful as they were trustworthy.</p><p>Stepping intothe captain's cabin, Valoree glancedat the dress lying onthe small cot built into the wall, thenturned to glanceat herquartermaster. \"Canyou drive a carriage, Henry? \"</p><p>The man's face scrunched up at the question, his doubt obvious. \"Well, now, I ain't never had no reason to drive a carriage - but I reckon if Skully can drive one of them things, so can I.\"</p><p>Arare smile briefly touched her lips atthat. Skully and Henry werethebest of friends, but it wasa competitiverelationship.</p><p>They were constantly trying to outdo each other. Shaking her head, Valoree pulled herpistolout of her belt and laid it onthe table, then began to shrug out ofhervest. \"There's no need for you to try if Skully knows how.Take him with you andgo rent a carriageand horses. The best you canfind.It must be a quality carriage, \" she emphasized. \"Then I want youto getclothes for yourself, Bull, Skully, and One-Eye.Make sure they fit.\"</p><p>\"What kind of clothes? \" Henry askedsuspiciously.</p><p>\"Servant's clothes. Livery.\"</p><p>Henry openedhis mouth torefuse, but Valoree forestalled him with one sentence. \"Ineed men I can trust withme, and Ican trustyou four.\"</p><p>Closing his mouth, Henry nodded andturnedtoward the door.</p><p>\"Havethe men bring me a bathbefore yougo, \" Valoree called as the door closed behind him. She wasn'tsure he'd heard her untilthemen brought in an old wooden tub, followed by pail after pail of hot water.Once the tub was full, Valoree slipped quickly out of the rest of her clothes and slipped inside. She bathed herself quickly and abit impatiently, then started to dress.</p><p>Halfan hour latershe was grateful that she had left herself plenty of time for the task.It wasn'tas ifValoree hadnever worn a gown before, butthat had been somethirteen years ago.And good Lord! She didn't recall donning a gown to be such a complicated task. There were stockings, and the fussy little garters that held them up; the chemise; the petticoat; the farthingale;the corset - a nasty pieceofwork, that; the part-let; the kirtle; theoverskirt; and finally the bodice and sleeves. Good Lord! And with allthose clothes on, she was still catching adraft up her skirt!It wasindecent to be walking around with nothing covering her nether regions under those damned voluminous skirts.Atleast, it certainly felt indecent to a girl whohadbeen well trussed up in breechesfor thirteen years.</p><p>Muttering under her breath, she grabbed her trousers and attempted topull them back on underher skirt, finding it quite a chore with allthebinding upperclothes, and thelayer upon layer oflower clothing. Dragging skirt afterskirtlaboriouslyupward, shetried to holdthem withherchin so thatshe could don her breeches, but that simply did not work. Giving that up, she droppedto the floor, dragged her skirts up, andtried again. A moment later, panting with the effort, she stuckonefootin one leg of herbreeches, then her other foot in the other.</p><p>\"Nexttime I'llput these damn things on first, \" she muttered to herself, dropping flaton her back.Archingher buttoffthe floor, she proceeded to wiggle, squirm, tug, and pullin an effortto don the damn pants.</p><p>\"Captain? \"One-Eye's voice driftedthrough thedoor, followed by a brief tap.</p><p>\"Hold yerarse!\" Valoreeroared, rolling onto her sidebutstill struggling with her clothes.</p><p>There was a brief silence; then One-Eye spoke again. \"Ah, Captain? Are ye all right in there? There's an awful lot of bumpingand huffinggoing on.\"</p><p>\"Thank God!\" Valoree gasped as her breeches finally pulled intoplace. Letting her skirtsslide backdown over her legs, she droppedflat onthefloorand tried to catchher breath.Amoment later thedooropened and One-Eye popped his head in. Valoree gave hima surly look.\"Itold yeto - \"</p><p>\"Holdmearse.Aye, Iheard ye, \"One-Eye said, peering at her flushed face withconcern, then aroundthe empty room. \"And I am, see? \"</p><p>Lettingthe doorslide farther open, he showedher thathe had onehand planted firmly onhis left arse cheek. Valoree released a weary laugh. That was the beauty of One-Eye. He would follow anorder literally, ifit would gain himhis purpose. She could hardlyflog him for entering when She hadnotsaid 'don't enter.' He had done as she hadordered, after all.</p><p>Seeing her smile, he eased into the room, giving it a more thorough examination. \"It sounded like there was a bit of excitement goin' oninhere.\"</p><p>\"Aye. If you call trying to get into me breechesexcitement, \"</p><p>Valoreeadmitted dryly.</p><p>One-Eye's hand went to his cutlass, his charming smile replaced with deadly intent ina heartbeat. \"Who was it? I'llkill the bastard for ye.\"</p><p>Valoree blinked in confusion at him before understanding struck; then she grabbedone of the boots onthe floor nearby and whipped itat him. \"Itwas me, ye silly souse!\" she roared. The boot slammed into the door. Then she jerked her skirts up, revealing her breeches. \"I was tryingto getmybreeches on!\"</p><p>One-Eye blinked atthat, then relaxed with a grin. \"Well, now, it's a sad day whenacaptain can't evenmanage to don her - \"</p><p>His voice died as her eyesnarrowed grimlyonhim. He changed the subject. \"Ah, well, Henrysent meto - \"</p><p>\"What the hellare youwearing? \" Valoree snapped, sitting up on the floorsuddenly asshe took note that hisusual attire - tight breeches, flowing white shirt, andleathervest- - was gone. It had beenreplaced withpink hose, pink kneebreeches, and themost God-awfulpinkwaistcoat ithad ever been her misfortune tosee.</p><p>Sighing heavily, One-Eye immediately began to nod inmisery.</p><p>\"Livery, \" hesaidwithdisgust. 'That's what Henrycalled it. Said it was all hecould find.\"</p><p>\"Dear God, \" she said softly, shaking her head in horrified wonderat the uglinessof the outfit. Onewould thinkthepink clothes wouldmake One-Eyelook effeminateand dandified, but that was hardly the case. If anything, the fancy dress simply seemed to make him look more disreputable - like a pirate dressedup inthe fancy clothes ofaservant. Which he was, of course.</p><p>\"See! Iknew you'd see that this was wrong. Shall I just go change back intome own clothes? \"</p><p>Valoreeactually almost nodded atthe suggestion, then shook herheadwitha sigh.</p><p>\"Nay. You cannotrunaround London looking likea pirate on the prowl.\"</p><p>\"Oh, but - \"</p><p>\"Nay, \"Valoree repeated firmly.\"You'll wear these clothes.\"</p><p>At her tone, One-Eye nodded, though still appearing a bit disgruntled. \"Well, I'dbest go tellHenryand Skully thatye'll be along directly.\"</p><p>\"Wait!\"Valoreecalled as he started to backout. He paused, andshe gestured to the object lyingby the door. \"My boot.\"</p><p>Eyebrows rising, he bentto retrieve the footwear, then moved tohand itto her.</p><p>\"Nay. Put iton forme, \" she ordered instead of tak-, ing it. She'd had enoughtroubleputting on the breeches. She coulduse help lacing uptheboots.</p><p>One-Eye'seyebrows rose sohigh, Valoreethought they were going to fly offhis forehead. \"Do you not think some slippers might bemore appropriate? \"</p><p>\"Well, aye, they would. And if I had some, surely I'd wear them, wouldn't I? ButI don't recall stopping by a cobbler's shop, do you? \"</p><p>The corner of his mouth twisting at her testiness, One-Eyebent tograbthesecond boot as well, thenmovedto herfeetand knelt there.</p><p>Valoree watched him set to work with disinterest, her eyes wandering over Henry's choice of livery. It really wasatrocious, and shewould guess it was just about killing One-Eye towear it.</p><p>Theman hadalways fancied himself a bit of a heartbreaker. He was tall, with dark hair and aswarthy complexion, and was as lean and strongasa captain could want for afirst mate. He had all his limbs and, really, other than a small scar or two from injuries gained working the ropes in storms, was stillin one piece - otherthan his missing eye, of course. And theeye patch didn't seem to detract from his attractiveness to the ladies. In truth, whateverport they'd come to, One-Eye had alwaysmanaged to findmanywomen who foundhis rugged goodlooks and maimed face the object of desire.</p><p>Valoreedidn't share thatattraction, herself. From the ages of ten tonineteen, she had beentreatedlikeayounger brother by the pirate, withall the harassment andteasing that included. And while she had alwaysknown in an objective way that he was a handsome fellow, She had lookedon him asanotherolderbrother as well. So seeinghim now, dressed in Henry's awful choice of pink finery, Valoree couldhardly stifle her chuckle. It might do him good to bedressed in such.</p><p>\"Thereye are, Cap'n, \" One-Eyeannounced, straighteningfrom his task andgetting tohis feet. He eyedher with amusement.\"I suppose ye'll beneeding helpup now, too, huh? \"</p><p>She raised herhand in answer.Reaching down, he grasped her at the wrist instead, waiting until herfingers closed around his ownwristbefore pulling her to her feet. With that, she leftthe cabin.</p><p>\"Ye look real pretty in that gown, \" One-Eye commented as he followed her across the deck a moment later. \"But I never thought I'd see the day that Back-from-the-Dead Red needed help putting hisown boots on.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His taunt did not go unnoticed. \"One-Eye, \"she said.</p><p>\"Aye? \"</p><p>\"Unless ye're wanting to don one of the other two gowns I bought and spendthe day inithere with the men, ye'd be best to close yer trap now.\"</p> <p>\"Aye, Cap'n.\"</p><p>\"Yelookreal fine in that there getup, \" Henrysaid ashe helped her out of the dinghy and uponto the dock. Valoree was amused to note that the crusty old salt was blushing, andhisvoice was gruff.</p><p>\"Like a real lady. Pretty, too. Never noticed ye lookin' so pretty in breeches.\"</p><p>Valoreefound herself embarrassed by the compliment to her looks, whereas a compliment on her skill at swordplayor such had never given heranything but pleasure.Flustered, she waved ahand vaguely in the air as if swatting the words away, then turned to stomp toward the carriage where Skully waited.</p><p>One-Eye leapedto the dock behind her.</p> <p>\"Well, \" Henrygrunted after her. \"Ye'renot so much like a lady when ye stomp about like that.\"</p><p>Pausing, Valoreeturnedto glare at him, then sighed and started towalkagain, remembering tokeepher steps shorter and less determined. She'd have to remember to keep herbearing more feminine, she thoughtas shepaused by the carriage andpeeredin through the window. Inside sat Meg, the old prostitute Bull had found to play her aunt and chaperon.</p><p>Valoree grimaced at the societal foolishness of forbidding womento travelalone, and threwthe door of thecarriage open.</p><p>Ah, well.She would makedo.With a quick heave, she clambered into the coach. This woman would serve her purpose. Itwasonly once she was inside that Valoree noticed the other woman's pallor. Left over from her drunken state the night before, no doubt, Valoree thought dryly.Shelooked soberenoughto play her part, though. In fact, today the womanlooked sosober that Valoree almost pitiedher.Her \"aunt\"would probably welcome a littlehair of the dog that had bitten her.</p><p>However, other than obviously suffering the ill effects of overindulgence - her facehadaslightly gray casttoit, andthe linesaround her eyes andtheway shewas squintingspoke of head pain - \"Aunt Meg\" looked fine, much better even than Valoree had hoped. Her new gown, black and demure, and her carefullyupswepthair gave her aregal air. In fact, if She hadn't knownbetter, Valoree might have swornthe woman wasatrue lady, rather than the prostituteshe knewher to be.</p><p>\"Ye're ready, \" Valoree said as she arranged herself in the coach.</p> <p>One eyebrow arched majestically, and the woman subjected Valoreeto the same inspection she herself hadjust been through.</p><p>\"You're not, \"came her response.</p><p>Valoree blinked, then felt anger wash through her.\"Whatthe helldo youmean, I'mnot? \" she snapped.</p><p>\"Yourhair.A ladywouldnever walk about with herhair all wild about her head likethat.\"</p><p>Valoree raiseda hand to herhead, a frown onher lips. \"I - \"</p><p>\"Sit, \" the womanordered, gesturing tothe carriage seat beside her, and apparently fully expecting to be obeyed.She turned and began to sift through the contents of a small bag on the seat beside her. \"Iexpected as much, whichis why I asked your man Henry to collect a couple of things - Aha!\" Pulling a brushfree of the bag, she turnedandsmiled triumphantly at Valoree, then frowned at her lackof response.She smacked the empty portion of the bench seat again.\"Well, come on!\"</p><p>Valoree hesitated, then glanced at Henry, who had followed herto the carriage and now stood studying herhairwith a frown.</p><p>\"She's right, I guess. Ladies usually have their hair uplike hers.\"</p> <p>Thoughannoyed by the fact, Valoree hadto admit she herself was completely ignorant of what ladies did or did notdo. She had riot left the ship more than a handful of times over the past thirteen years. When shewasyounger, theports theyhad usually put in to were notthe sort Jeremy and Henry felt she needed to visit. Andwhen she had become Back-from-the-DeadRed, she had remained primarily on the ship to avoid discovery of her identity. All her memories of society werefromher very early childhood. She hadno ideawhat ladies were sporting nowadays.</p><p>Cursing volubly, she switchedto the other seat with a flounce of her skirts. Sheignored \"Aunt Meg's\" reproving look as the woman setto workon her hair.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The coach jouncedandjostledmore than a smallshipanthe high seas. Harder, too. Valoree grimaced as it crashed over another bump and gingerly raised a hand toher head.</p><p>Her discomfort didnotgounnoticed. \"Are you ill? Youlook quitepale, \" theold woman across from her asked with feigned sympathy.</p><p>Valoree'seyes snapped to her\"aunt.\"\"If I am looking ill, it is because every part ofmyscalp ison fire.\" The womanhad swept her hair upin a towering coiffure andpiled itonher head. \"And by the way, I am not foolish enough to think that ladies go throughthatkind ofpainevery time they put theirhairup - soif you try another trick like that, I'll haveyou whipped. Andkeep yourmouth shut whilewe are in this meeting. The lastthing I need is for this Whister fellow to figure out you are an old prostitute.\"</p><p>Meg stiffened, then colored at the insult. Valoree felt a moment's regret, but it was brief. She hadtoo manyworries and toolittle time tobe overly concerned with anyone'shurt feelings.</p><p>Her entire crew, and now this woman, were dependent onher for both a home and a newway of life.Shewas feelingthe strain.</p><p>And it hadn'thelped that the woman had pulled her hair awfully as she'd tugged itinto shape.</p><p>\"Myapologies, mydear\"Aunt Meg said haughtily, sounding every inch a noble asthecoachfinallycame toa lurching halt.\"I shall endeavorto remain silent whileatthisappointment should it please you. However, Ihave lived the'good life'solong, onecan never be sure of not meetingaprevious ... patron. Let us hope this lawyer ofyours isnot one of them.\"</p><p>Valoree's eyes widened in horror at the possibility, and her \"aunt\" smiledback with quiet malice. Further conversation was cut off as One-Eye opened the door of the coach.</p><p>\"Damn.\" Valoree cursed underher breathasMeg exited, then movedquickly to follow the woman, intenton catching her and shovingher back into the coach. She was not willing to risk Whister's recognizing her. Surelyitwasdoubtfulthathe hadever solicitedherfavors, butone never knew. Unfortunately, in her sudden panicto catch the woman, Valoree used more speedthan care in disembarking, and she managed to trounce on, thentangle her foot in, the folds of her skirt. She ended by tumblingtothe ground outside the coach, her hair falling out of its do and tumbling around her shoulders.</p><p>One-Eye blinked his onegood eye, then gaped down at herin horror as she tried tostruggle to her feet. Henry was a touch more helpful. Leapingfrom his seatbeside the driver, he hurried toassist her.</p><p>\"Whatare ye doin', yesillysouse? \" he snapped, slappingthe other man inthe back of the head and knockingthe fine newhat he woreaskew. Hehelped Valoree back toher feet.\"What were ye gonna do? Leave her lyin' there till the dolphins swam alongside ye? \"</p><p>\"Well...\" One-Eye straightened hiscap and hurried to brush down her skirts in aneffort to remove the mudthatnowclung to them.\"How was I toknowshe was to be needin' help gettin'up? Sheain't never needed helpgettin'up afore.\"</p><p>\"She wasn't a lady before. Shewas the captain.\"</p><p>\"Well, and soshe's still the captain now.\"</p><p>\"Aye, but she'swearin' adress. That makes her alady. And ladiesis moredelicate and helplessthancaptains. Just look at how shetumbledout of the coach like a - Ah!\"</p><p>\"Thatis the blade of myknife you are feelin' at your arse, Henry, \" Valoreeannouncedcoolly, annoyed byhis words. \"It's a little reminder that dress or nodressI am still your captain. I am nothelpless.Got that? \"</p><p>\"Gotit, Cap'n.\"</p><p>\"Aye, sir. Ma'am. Melady, \" One-Eye, added.</p><p>Grunting insatisfaction, Valoreeplacedherknife back inthe bag she had brought alongfor just that purpose, and waited asthe men straightened oneither side of her. \"Now. You two shall wait here with the hack. My \"aunt\" and I shallgo in and see Mr.</p><p>Whister. Youwillnotaccost anypasserby nortalk at all. You will stand silent and solemn-faced at yourposts.

Me lady.\"</p><p>\"Very good, \"she muttered, thenstarted up the path to the front door where Meg stood waiting. She knew the men knew her threats were mostly idle - she'd never whipped eitherof themin all thetime they'dsailedtogether - but shealso knewthat such threats were the only way to convey the seriousness of the situation.</p><p>Aunt Meg apparently saw it differently. \"Youshould not draw your knife in public, dear. It is most unbecoming in a lady.</p><p>Should anyone see - \"</p><p>\"No one saw.\"</p><p>\"Idid.\"</p><p>\"You don't count.\"</p><p>\"No, I do not suppose Ido, \" thewoman muttered as Valoree reached totap at the door. Aftera moment she added, \"There is nothing to worry about.\"</p><p>Hand still raised, Valoree glanced at her sharply. \"I am not worried.\"</p><p>\"I see. Well, your men toldme that when you arecranky it is usually becauseyou are worried and refusing to show it.\"</p><p>\"My menarea bunch ofcarpies.\"</p><p>\"They care for youvery much.AndI think you careforthem, too.\"</p><p>The commentsilenced Valoree foramoment; then a peevish anger overtookher.She tried glaring the other womandown, but the creaturewas notto be intimidated.</p><p>\"They are like family to you, are they not? \"</p><p>Sighing, Valoree swallowed and glanced back at the door.</p><p>\"Theyare. The only familyI have.\"</p><p>\"And youfear youwillfailthem, \" Meg guessed, then rushed on when Valoreestarted toprotestoncemore. 'There isno reason tofear that. I've heard of yourdifficulties.

Gesturing for Valoree to follow, she turned to the servant to add, \"We have an appointment.\"</p><p>\"Of course, my lady.\" Bowing, the servantnoddedat Valoree as she entered, then closed the door. \"Master Whister iswith another client, buthe should be only amoment.

The expression quickly disappeared, . however, andhe gave them a sickly sweet smile. \"I shall bebackdirectly with thoserefreshments.\"</p><p>Valoree nodded solemnlyto the man, barelywaiting forhim to withdraw and pull the door closed before hurrying forward.</p><p>Resting her hand on the doorknob, she leaned her ear to the wood in an effort tolisten to the shouting comingfrom acrossthe hall. Unfortunately, she could hear nothing but Meg's hissing reprimand as the older womanflew acrossthe room to pull her away.</p><p>\"Please calm down, Lord Thurborne. \"'Tis not as bad as all that, \" Whistersoothed.</p><p>\"Notas bad as all that? \" Daniel glaredat the man seated across from him. \"Youtellme that to claim my inheritance from my grandmother - money the Thurborne estates need quite desperately, by the way - I have to... to...

Asshe raised a handto rub at the sore spot on her skull, she suddenly found herself surrounded by people. Meghad moved quickly to her side, her expression more chiding than concerned. The butler was fluttering helplessly beforeher, horrified guilt written allover his face for braining her, however unintentionally. She alsosaw that a second man, much younger, and obviously of thenobility, had crossed the hall to join them. Valoree suspected his was the shoutingvoiceShe had been trying to eavesdrop on. That being the case, shesupposed she should feelchagrinat beingcaught.</p><p>Instead, she felt annoyed. If therewasone thing Valoree hated, it was feeling foolish, and the obviousamusementin the man's eyes was making her feel just that.</p><p>\"I was just coming to inform you that refreshments would not be a moment, \" the butler said, drawing her gaze again. He was wringinghis hands miserably ashe eyed her. \"Inever meant to - Well, I did notexpect youto be - Can I get you anything? A cold compress, perhaps? \"</p> <p>\"Stop fussing, man, \" Valoree snapped. Herhead was beginning to pound, and mollycoddlingwould simply makeit worse.\"It's notthefirsttimeI've been knocked about a bit, you know.\"</p><p>The sudden silence thatfellgave her the first hint shemight have misspoken. With a gulp of dismay, she took in the threesome around her. Meg looked horrified, and the butler and the newcomer lookedcompletelynonplussed.</p><p>Sighing, sheclosed hereyes. Yes, thathad most likely beenthe wrong thing to say. Most ladies probably didn't get knocked about.Ever. And if they did, they certainly didn'tadmit it. She should have thoughtbefore speaking. That was one of thefirst thingsShe had learned to do as captain of a ship full ofpirates.</p><p>Thinking before speakingcould avert all sorts of catastrophes.</p><p>Why hadn'tshedone sonow? \"I must have got knockedharder than I thought, \"she muttered in disgust.</p> <p>\"Perhaps some brandy? \" the butler inquired sympathetically, her words seeming to have shocked him out of his stunned silence.</p><p>Valoree shook her head, wincingas pain shot through her skull again.\"Never touch the stuff. I'll takesome rum, though, if you have any.\"</p><p>\"Oh, dear, \" Meg saidwith a sort of horror, then managed to forcea titter of feignedamusement. \"Oh, my dear, you areever the witty one. Youmust not joke so, however, for not everyone knows what a prankster you are.\" Turning to the butler, who relaxed ather words, she added sweetly, \"A coldcompress will befine. Anda touch of brandy, please.\"</p><p>Nodding, the servant hurried to a sideboard to pourthe brandy, then started back toward Valoree with it, only to pause when \"Aunt\"Megmet him halfwayacross theroom. \"I shallfetch a cold compress, \" he said as he handed her the snifter, then disappearedthroughthedoor.</p><p>Valoree watchedhim go, but was distracted by the newcomer.</p><p>\"Whatever wereyou doing at the door? \"</p> <p>Valoree peered at the man with irritation. He was tall and handsomeand carried himself as only a member of the nobility could.And she would bet her shareof the booty from that French frigate hercrew had just taken thathe knew exactly whatshe had been doing. There was no mistaking the glint in his eyes for anything but malicious humor.She supposedhe wasworking off some of the temper his appointment had stirredin him, but she didn't like it.Were they on her ship - But they weren'ton her ship. They were in aparlor. She made aface at the thought and did the only thing she could.She lied.</p><p>\"I was about toleave the room, obviously.\" Turning away, she movedtoward a chair and satdown. \"I was aboutto go looking for the loo.\"</p><p>A sudden sputtering made Valoree glance abruptly over at Meg. The woman had paused a few steps away. She was clutching the brandy glass with white-knuckled fierceness and looking readyto swoon. Abject horror wasthe only explanation for her pale, pinched lookandthe wayhermouth wasflapping with nothing but insensible sounds emerging.</p><p>The newcomer, too, was reacting oddly, blinking at her rather blankly, unableto believehe had heardwhat he thought he had just heard.</p><p>Gathering from all this that ladies did not \"go to the loo, \"</p><p>Valoree sighed inwardly and offered a bland smile. \"Lou. Louis.</p><p>Our footman.I left my smelling saltsin the carriage and I was going to have him fetch them for me. My aunt faints quite easily, \" she added drolly. Then, putting a hard edge into her voice, she addressed Meg. \"Aunt? Is that brandy forme? \"</p><p>\"I - Yes, dear.\"The woman hurried forwardat once, pushing the glass into Valoree'shand and pattingher on the back. \"Come, mydear. You should rest silently and drink this ... after that knock.\"Her emphasiswas notmissed by Valoree.</p> <p>The butler hurried into the room just as Valoree lifted the snifter ofbrandy to her lips.</p><p>\"Here, my lady. This should help, \" the older man murmured, rushing to her side withaflowered bluebowl filledwithwater and a fresh cloth. Setting them on the table before her, he watched anxiouslyas Meg tookher glass, setit aside, and took up the cloth to dip it in the water.</p><p>\"Iam ever so sorry about this. All of this.Youshould noteven havehad towait. Yours was theonly appointment scheduled for today, but - \"</p><p>\"ButI arrived unexpectedlyand quite rudelyusurpedsome of your time, \" the younger man interrupted. \"Of course, once I realized that MasterWhisterhad anotherappointment, I politely took myself off hereto allow you your time before I finishwith him. He should be along directly.\"</p><p>Valoree accepted that bit of information with interest, then glanced towardMeg as the woman touched her arm.</p><p>\"Lean your head back, \" her faux aunt instructed quietly, then laidthecold cloth out flatover her forehead and face so that even hermouth was covered.</p><p>If Valoree had suspected thatcompresseswere not generally supposedto cover the mouthas well as everything else, a short burst of laughter fromthe newcomerassured her she wasright.</p><p>Draggingthecloth away, she satup toglare at Meg, thenglanced toward the newcomer. But before she could give him the dressing-downhe deserved, the butler murmured, \"Well, then, MasterWhister should bereadyto see younow. I shall just check tosee - \"</p><p>\"No need to check, Hinkle. I amready.\"</p><p>They allturnedto the door at that bluff announcement, and Valoree took in the lawyer with curiosity.He was tall, slender, and distinguished-looking. Too, he had a gentle, reassuring face that seemed tosuggest he was trustworthy. He tooka moment to survey his guests, then started forward, his smile of greeting turning to a look of concern.\"Is everything all right? You are not ill, are you, my lady? \"</p><p>\"Aye. Imean, nay, Iamfine, \"Valoree murmured, rising to her feet as the solicitor paused before her. Turning to Meg with suddenpanic, sheadded, \"And thisis my aunt.\" She fell silent then, decidingatthat point that shewould bemorethan happy to allow the womantotake over.The lawyerintimidated her. She didn't know why. The otherman and the butler hadn't, butthis man, gentle-looking though he was, did. She supposed it had something todowith thefact that she had togo through him to get what she wanted, Ainsley Castle. And she knew that cutlasses and flintlocks were not the way to do it this time. Shewasout of herdepth.</p><p>Meg stepped into take over. As Valoree watched, Megsmiled and chatted away, entirely charmingasthe lawyer ushered them out of the salon andinto hisoffice.Once there, the small talk between thetwo continued briefly beforethey finally got around tobusiness.</p><p>\"I received your letter regarding your brother Jeremy'sdeath. I am sorry for your loss, \" Whister beganwith suitable solemnity.\"I realizehe is the last of your closefamily.\"</p><p>\"It was years ago, \" Valoreemurmured, ignoringthe pang of loss she felt at the mention of hisname.</p><p>\"Yes.Yes, of course. Well, itwasluckyyou had sucha lovely and warm aunt whocould take over your upbringing and shelter you until now, though. Was it not? \" He smiled charmingly at Meg, who actually blushed. Rolling her eyes, Valoree muttered a quiet agreement tothat.</p><p>\"Well.\" Clearing his throat, hesmiled oncemore at Meg, then looked away before getting to the sticky part.\"Ineed proofof his death, of course. I presume you...\" The lawyerpaused as Valoree suddenlytugged a rolled-up scroll of paper from her sleeve, then removed the ring she had not taken offsincethe day Jeremy had givenit to her.The day he had died. She set bothon the desk before him.</p><p>Whister read the scroll, a doctor's letter, then examined the family signetring silently before setting it gentlyback in the hand Valoree held out. Hethen settled himself behind his deskonce more and began to shuffle through his papers. \"Well then, of course youknow thatJeremy never reallyclaimed Ainsley. He made an appointment to seeme andhave ownership transferred from the guardianship into his name, buthe never arrived for that appointment.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I know.\" Valoree ignored Meg's startled glance and cleared herthroat. \"Ainsley was - probably still is - ashambles.</p><p>LordSwintunreleased the servants whenhe took over and rented the estate out forseveral years. Until it fell into disrepair.\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" Whister acknowledged gently. \"Your brother did write to explainthat he would missour appointment.He didsay that the estate had been poorly usedby Lord Swintun. He claimed that Ainsley needed extensive work and monetary input to make it liveable and self-sustaining, but that there was not nearly enoughmoneyto make the repairs necessary. Hehad purchased, instead, asmall ship and contracted to privateer for the king to earn the funds.\"</p><p>Valoree nodded mutely.</p><p>\"What I never understood was, why he did nottakethe money hepurchasedtheship with and use it to begin the repairs on Ainsley? Surely hemighthaveborrowed upontheestate then.\"</p><p>Valoree felt herhands clench in herlap. She had made that same argument herself. And had Jeremy agreed, hewould still be alive. Butthingshad notturned out that way.\"My brother was a proud man. Hedid not want to borrow. In fact, Jeremybought theship with jewels that wereactually left tome, \" she explained quietly. \"He intended to make enough wealth toreturn both those jewels to me and restore Ainsley ... without involvinganyone outside thefamily.And hesucceeded in doing so!Had he not been robbed and killed ...\" Valoree fell silent as her throat constrictedwith emotion.Fora moment she struggledwith anger andgrief, then, notingthepityingexpressionon the lawyer's face, she straightened. \"But he was killed, \"she finishedgruffly.</p><p>Whister immediatelybegan to shuffle his papers again. \"Yes.</p><p>Well, in the end it wasfortunate that he hadn't claimedAinsley...</p><p>since he left no will. As it is, since he died without either producing an heir or claiminghis inheritance, we must revert to your father's will. According to that - \" He paused briefly, skimming a few linesof the paper he held. Nodding, he said, \"According tothis, that makes you the heiress. Which, of course, you already know. Else youwould not be here.\"</p><p>\"Aye, \"Valoree murmured, shifting uncomfortably. It did not feel right that she was there to collect an inheritance gained through her brother's death. She would rather her brother were alive. Still, thingshad notturned out that way, and she hadto be strong.</p><p>\"Well, then, on your twenty-fourth birthday ... Let ussee, that wouldbe ... Mygoodness, that was almost three months ago.\"</p><p>Valoree nodded solemnly. They would havecomesooner, but they'd run into rough weather ontheir firstattempt to head for England. It hadbeenas if the sea itselfwere trying to prevent her gaining her inheritance. They hadbeen lucky to pull throughthe storm, but not fortunate enough to escape with their ship undamaged. They'dhad to put in toport for a bit to make repairs; then there had been a bit of troublewith illness - several of the crewhad come down with a fever of unknownorigin. And as Valoree had refusedto leave the illmen behind, sincethey had fought for her for long and well, they had waited untilthe sailors' illnesshad run its course.</p><p>\"Well, then, letme seehere.\"Propping a monocle over one eye, Whister lifted several pages and squinted to read them quickly. \"Yes, yes, \"hemurmuredafter a moment, then setthe sheets down and smiledat hersweetly. \"Itis all very simple and straightforward.All you needtodo is haveyour husband come with you to sign these papers - \"</p><p>\"My husband? \" Valoreestaredathim blankly.</p><p>\"Aye. Accordingto the will, your husbandmustsign - \"</p><p>\"Husband? \" Valoree interrupted. \"It is not mine, but my husband's? \"</p><p>Eyebrows rising slightly at thedismayin her voice, the lawyer shifted unhappily. \"Well, technicallyit will go to your heir, but your husband willhavecharge ofit until your son is of age.\"</p><p>Seeing that the news did not appear to improve her grim expression onewhit, hebeganstraightening hispapers nervously.</p><p>\"It is very common. Mostmen are hesitant to leavesucha large estate in the hands of their daughters. Either they leaveitto their sons, or - \"</p><p>\"Fine. Ishall marry then, \" Valoree announcedcalmly, almost to herself. It was little enoughtrouble to accomplish that deed.</p><p>She could marryone of her men, for that matter.None of them would be foolish enough tothink that theycould take control of her inheritance, and ifthey did... Well, they simply wouldn't.</p><p>They would realize that therest of her crew would quickly make hera widow shouldtheytry it.</p><p>Mr. Whisterpeeredfrom her to her auntand then back. \"Am I tounderstandthat you are not married? \"</p><p>\"Notyet. No.\"</p><p>\"I see. Well...\" Frowning, hebeganto straighten the papers on his desk, then glancedat her uncertainly. \"Your husband has to beof noble birth, youknow.\"</p><p>NowValoree wasfrowning. \"Noble? \"</p><p>\"Aye.

I did not realize that youwerenotaware of the stipulation, \" heapologized miserably as he hurrieddown the hall behind them.</p><p>Nodding silently, Valoreesailed through the entry andoutthe door, leaving Meg todeal with the man.</p><p>Henryleaped from his perchandhurried to open the door of thehack asshe approached.Valoree ignored his frown, knowing thathe was worriedby her stiffdemeanorandcold expression.</p><p>Hecould wait for anexplanation.Asshe seated herselfinthe carriage, sheturned to see Meg hurriedly exitthe house. Valoree raisedher eyebrow inquestion, hopingthat somethinghadbeen said that altered the situation.</p><p>The woman shook her head inanswer and climbed into the carriage, pulling the door closedbehind her.</p> <p>Valoreerapped onthecoach, and, shrugging, Henry climbed back up onto his perch at theback of the coach so that Skully could get the horsesinmotion. They set off.</p><p>Thesilence in the carriagewas heavy. At last Meg spoke, and Valoree was surprised by the concern in the woman's voice.</p><p>\"Whatwill you do now? \"</p><p>Valoree wassilent for amoment, thenshrugged. \"Return tothe ship and set sail.\"She glanced over, regretful. Bull had promised this woman a place on the estateifshe helpedthem.Nowthe promise was in vain, despiteMeg's having held up her end of the bargain.</p><p>Sighing, Valoree spoke. \"Youmay sail with us if you like.\" It wasn't exactly a cottage onan estate, but it wasall Valoree had to offer. \"You could help Petey cook, \" she added, just to let the woman know that her positionwould be a respectable one.</p><p>\"Where do you planon sailing to? \"</p><p>Valoree frowned and considered briefly before answering, \"Back to the Caribbean most like.\"</p><p>The woman shook her head. \"Will younot even try? \"</p> <p>Valoree blinked in surprise. \"Try what? \"</p><p>\"To find a husband? \"</p><p>She did not even bother to answer, merely turned herfaceback tothewindow andstared at the passingstreet. Itseemed obvious that She had little if any chance of findinga husband, not withthe prerequisites her fatherhadleft her: find a man, intelligent and noblyborn, who would be willingto marry her. That wouldhave been hard enough, but she also had to be with child or have birthed one by her next birthday. No, it was all quite simply impossible. Ifthe \"noblyborn\" parthad not beenincluded, well, then, that would havebeen one thing. But where the devil was Valoree to find a noble whowould be willing to both marry her andleave herin chargeof her own estate? And wherewould she find oneshe was willing tolay down with to beget a child? Valoreewasn't the timid type. Being raisedon a shipfull of pirates had seen to that. But she wasn't anywhere near experienced whenit cameto sex either. She had never evenbeen kissed yet.That was something elsethat being raised on a ship full of pirates had seen to. Or morespecifically, that's what hiding hergender on a ship full of pirates had seen to.</p><p>Still andall, she had heard quite a bit of bragging fromthe men abouttheir exploits. She had evenstumbled across one or two of the men withprostitutesthey had sneaked aboard-shipoverthe years. Between those twothings, Valoree had agood grasp on whatit was all about. As far asshe could tell, it all appeared rather awkward and silly to her. All that mushy mashing of mouths, humping, and moaning. It didn't appearvery exciting to her. But if the men were to be believed, itfelta whole lot better thanitlooked. That beingthe case, Valoree wasn't against trying it out. She just hadn't yetmet a man who attractedher in that way. She was rather hoping that she would be luckyenough to find a manlikethat, though, for shesuspectedsex was one of those things that could be a chore if therewasn'tsome attraction involved.</p><p>Theidea had her so caught up, it took her a momentto realize the carriage had stopped. Glancingabout distractedly, she peered at the open door of the hack where Henry stood patiently waiting.</p><p>Sighing, sheshiftedalong theseat, thenleapt clearof thedoor, landing in apuddle with asatisfying slap of herboots.</p><p>Ignoring Henry's startled and even slightly disapproving look, she turned and strode up the dock, uncaring ofhowit looked for awomanina dressto bestriding about like a man. This was how she walked: purposeful, commanding, with someplace to go. This was her life.</p><p>Pausing at the end of the dock, she waited as Skully and One-Eye hurriedtocatch up to her.Shescowled. They looked ridiculous in thelivery. Pale pinksimplydid not doathing for Skully's peg legor One-Eye's patch.Their hair was toolong, their faces scruffy andsunburnt.Theydid not fit insuch finery. They looked better and were more comfortable in their worn and ragged pirate garb. Mayhapit was better that they wouldnot be forced into the roles ofgentlemen farmers.</p><p>\"I want you torally the men, Henry. Weleave as soonasthe last of them return.\"</p><p>\"Leave? \"her friendasked in shock. \"For where? \"</p><p>\"The Caribbean.I shallnot inherit.It looksas ifwe havea few more years of sailingleft before us.\"</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Valoree had changed outofher gown and backinto herusual dress ofbreeches andtop, yetthis time she nolonger bothered to bindher breasts. It was thefirst timeShe had wornher captain's clothes without doing so.She had beenbinding her breasts since she'd developed them.Younger brothers and cabin boysdid not have breasts, and that was howthe crew hadthought of her for thirteen years - until now.</p><p>Henry had announced to them that shewasa girlthe afternoon they had sailed intoLondon. It had seemeda good ideaatthe time. Now that things had gonedifferently, then they'dplanned, Valoreewished he hadkept that informationto himself. The men hadbeenshocked, of course, and one ortwo had nottaken it well that theircaptain had turned out to be a girl.Still, they were probably over it bynow.</p><p>Right, she thought sarcastically, then leanedback in her chair with a sigh and propped her feet upon thetable. Grabbingthe bottle of rumShe had brought tohercabin withher, she took a swig. She was working very hardatemptying it.</p><p>Valoree was morethan halfway to being sottedwhena knock came at the door.Sighing, she started tosit up, then changed her mind and slouched even further in her seat.Surely theyhad come only to tell her that they had voted someone else captain, anyway. They would hardly keepher nowthat everyone knew she wasa woman, nor could she supply the longed-for homein thecountry that had been promised yearsago when theyhad all signed onwithher brother.</p><p>\"Enter!\" she snapped, thenwatched calmlyas Henryducked inside. He was followed by One-Eye, Skully, Bull, Petey, Meg, and asmanyof therest of the crew as could fitinsidethe room.</p><p>Shecould hear the restclustered outsidethedoor.</p><p>\"What? \" Valoree asked wearily, then waited for the announcement to come.</p><p>Themenall turned to Henry. He grimaced at being stuckwith the job of speaker, but stepped forward, clearing his throat.</p><p>\"Well, now, ye see, Cap'n, Meghere told usall about what that there Whisterfellersaid.\"</p><p>\"Of course shedid.\"She had expected as much.</p><p>\"Aye. And thenOne-Eye here andI, we wentand rounded up allthemen andbroughtthem back.\"</p><p>\"As youwere ordered to do.\"</p><p>\"Aye.And thenwe ...er... Well, we informed them of what was said.\"</p><p>\"Iam notsurprised.\"</p><p>There was silence fora moment;thenOne-Eyenudgedhim.</p><p>Henry sighedand continued. \"Well, themen... we all discussed it some, ye see, and then we...er ... We had a vote.\"</p><p>\"Here it comes, \" Valoree murmured to herself. So much for five years of successful piracy.</p><p>\"And we vote yemarry.\"</p><p>Valoree blinked.\"What did you say? \"</p><p>\"He said we voted, youmarry, \" Peteyrepeated helpfullyfrom hisposition near the door.</p><p>Valoree frowned at the cook's words, then glanced over the restof the men. Every singleone of them wasnodding solemnly.</p><p>\"You voted thatI should marry? \" she murmured with disbelief, unsure whether tolaughorscream. It would almost be easierif they had voted her out of position ascaptain. Were they mad? Did theynot understand things? No, of course they didnot, she realized suddenly. They had no concept of what a monstrous undertaking marriage was. Especially in noblecircles. Hell, she was not even sure of the full details.</p><p>Shaking herhead, she droppedher booted feet to the floor and calmly stood. \"Gentlemen, while Iappreciate what is at stake, you do notseem tounderstand - \"</p><p>\"We understand, \" One-Eye assured her with a grin. \"We understandthatyou gotta marry to gain Ainsley, so we voted ye get married.\"</p><p>Valoree paused atOne-Eye's words, then frowned.\"Now, see here. As my crew youcanvoteon a lot of things - where wesail, whether to takeaSpanishship or not, whether to kill its crew even - but youcannot vote on whether I marry.\"</p><p>\"Well, now, that's no' exactly true.\"</p><p>Valoree frowned at that announcement, coming asit wasin a Scottish brogue. Jasper stepped forward unfolding several contracts he held. \"According toArticlesix of the contractwe all signed uponjoining up with you, and Iquote, 'Every seaman shall havea vote on such matters as affect the welfare, safety, health, and future of the crew.'\" Lowering thecontract, the Scot raised his headand smiled at her, an expression revealing anumber of missingteeth.\"This here affectsthewholecrew.\"</p><p>Everyman present was again noddingin solemn agreement.</p><p>Even Megwas.</p><p>WhenValoree merely stared at them, baffled, Henry explained.</p><p>\"To getAinsley, ye got to marry.Gettin' Ainsley or not affects all of us. It's why we all threw in together - first withJeremy, then with you.\"</p><p>\"Aye, \" One-Eye agreed, drawing her gaze. \"Jeremy said he wouldgive each of us acottage at Ainsley wherewe could settle down.\"</p><p>\"Where we couldget married, \" Petey addedalmostdreamily.</p><p>\"Have a wife.\"</p><p>\"And bairns, \" Jasper putin.</p><p>\"A garden, \" Henry added. Everyone turned to stare at him.</p><p>Straightening his shoulders, he scowled at them defensively.</p><p>\"Jeremypromised me a garden.\"</p><p>\"So's you can grow vegetables, \"Skully added hopefully, but Henry shookhis head.</p><p>\"Flowers.\"</p><p>\"Flowers? \" They gapedat him, but he shrugged, indifferent to their scorn.</p><p>\"I'm thinkin' on growingme some roses.I've got a green thumb, don't ye know. ThinkI'll try me hand atmakin' one o' them new roses.I'll call it the Grand Valoree.\"</p><p>Valoree shook herhead in disgust and sankback into her seat.</p><p>Staring at her motley crew, she shook her head again and shrugged. \"Fine, \" she said with feigned indifference. \"I shall marry.I suggestyou go out and find me ahusband. All youneed is a noblemancapable ofgettingmewith child. However, I warn you, hehas to be willing tolet me make allthe decisionsand run the roost. Otherwise, do you thinkhe'll let mesetyou all up on hisestate? Good luck to you. I shall just wait here foryou to accomplish the deed.\"</p><p>Grabbingher bottle of rum once more, shesankback into her seat.</p><p>The room was silent for a moment as Valoree studiously ignored her men;thentheyslowlybegan tofile out.</p><p>\"Marry, \" she muttered, raising the rum to her mouth and gulpingsome ofitdownbefore shaking her head. \"Me.\" She was awareof her shortcomings. More than aware. Theywere all tied up in her past andwho she was.</p><p>Herparents had bothdied by the timeValoreewas five - her motherbreakingherneck in a fall downthe stairs shortly after Valoreewas born, andher father during acholera outbreak when she was five.That had lefther and Jeremy. Jeremy had been six years older thanshe, atender elevenyears old when they had been left to fend for themselves.</p><p>Well, they hadn't been leftentirely tothemselves; there had been LordSwintun.Hehad been aneighborandtheir guardian.</p><p>He hadbeen a kindand tender man who had beengood to them both. Unfortunately, he had been less kind to their birthright.</p><p>He'd raped the land, destroyed thepastures, and generally done his best torunthe place into theground, milking every drop of profit out of it that he could - as had been his right to do as guardianof the inheritance.</p><p>Still andall, Valoreehadbeen sorry when he had diedin her tenth year.He truly had beenkind and caring toward her and her brother. He had hired the besttutorsfor them, seentoJeremy's training, and openly nurturedthemboth. Then he had died, and they hadbeen left inthe hands of his son, a fellow who'dhad a terrible tendencyto leer at Valoreeevenatthat tender age. It had been most uncomfortable for a while. Four years later, Jeremy had turned eighteen and taken Valoree home to Ainsley to reclaimtheir birthright.</p><p>And that had been worse. Neitherof them had been nearthe estate since their father's death, and what they found was shocking.The manor housewas uninhabitable, with nota stick of furnitureleft. Swintun's son claimed ithad all been stolen and, seeing as selling offthe goodsand household articles was not exactly accepted as a rightof the guardian, they had believed him. There hadbeen nothingto do about it by then anyway, as it was apparent thatthe furniture had been gone an awfully long time.

That took money, however, and that was somethingthey were sadly short of. In his mismanagement of the land, Swintun had made it almost unrentable.Farmers wouldnot rent landtheycould not work.</p><p>Valoree recalled that Jeremy had taken one stunned look at his inheritance, walked around the destroyed entry and great hall, then moved to the fireplace, removed asmall rock there, pulled out a bag, andturned away. He'd walkedstraightout, mounted hishorse, and riddenoff.</p><p>Knowing he was distressed, andtrying to help, Valoree had set her hand determinedly to cleaning up, hoping that she could make a difference. Unfortunately, after the wholedayandmost of the night cleaning, she hadbarely made adent in the ruin that wasnow their home.She had cried herself to sleep on a bed of rushes ina cornerof the great hall, the cleanest space she could find.</p> <p>Thatwas whereJeremy hadfoundher late that evening when he returned, and thatwas wherehe had told her of their change ofplans. The bag he had removed from the fireplace hadbeen their mother's jewels. They were to have gone to Valoree.</p><p>Instead, Jeremy had takenthem and boughtaship, and he had hired a quartermaster - Henry. He intended to enter the risky business of privateering. Hewould attack the king's enemies, take their goods, and splitthem with the Crown. Then, when he'd made enough, he would return and legally claim his inheritance.</p><p>Itseemed the only way.</p><p>Valoree had protested, of course.But when her brother had gone to greatpains to assure herof thesafety ofhis undertaking, she hadrebelled at Jeremy's next intention: to ask LordSwintun to continue her guardianship until he returned. She hated and feared theyoung nobleman, and anything would be better than a sentence of living under his care. If a seafaring life was safe enough for Jeremy, it wassafe enough for her. And that was how she'd become a pirate.</p><p>NowValoree knew allthere was to know about sailing, and she was quitea hand atbattle aswell. But that was where her talents lay - not in wifely duties. True, she'd been trained in Latin, English, and German whileunderthe older Swintun's care, and her brother had continued her reading and writing lessons in those languages while he was alive, but those weren't exactly womanly arts.</p> <p>Even her speech was lacking. Jeremy had made her speak properly while hewasalive, but she hadslippedsomewhat since hisdeath. Especially whenshe was angry.</p><p>She certainly had none of the useful crafts that should be known bywomen. She was not very goodwith a needle. She could sew, but herstitches were nowhere nearas straight asthey couldbe. Sheknew nexttonothing aboutrunning a household, and was as good as useless when it came totendingillness. Her mother had beenan expert withhealing herbs, Jeremy told her, buthad diedlongbefore beingable to teachValoree anyof what she needed toknow. And for such pastimesasdance andmusic, the years she might have been learning those she had spent sacking galleons in the Caribbean. In short, she was terribly lacking. No nobleman would want her - let alone one who understoodher needs.</p><p>Her depressing thoughts were brought to a halt by a light tapping at the door.Sighing, she setthe almost empty rum bottle on the desk andsat up straight. \"Aye.\"</p><p>Henry opened the doorand stepped silentlyinside.This time he was alone. Valoree did notknow ifthat was a bad sign ... or worse.</p><p>Pausing before the desk, the quartermaster eyed her for a moment, then shifted uncomfortably and cleared histhroat. \"The men have been talkin' the problem over.\"</p><p>Valoree archedan eyebrow at him. \"Which problem would that be? \"</p> <p>\"The problem o'findin' ye ahusband.\"</p><p>Valoree grimaced. Atleast it sounded as if hermenwere being realistic aboutit, and weren'tfooling themselves intopretending it would bean easy task. \"And? \" sheprompted.</p><p>\"Well, we're thinking thatthe docksare noplaceto meet up withsome of them there noblefellers. We're thinkin' we need to get youinto society.\"</p><p>Valoree nodded at his logic. \"How? \"</p><p>\"How? \" He frowned. \"Well, er. .. I guess we'd have to be gettin' yesomeo' themthere invitesto some of them sorries.\"</p><p>\"Soirees, \" Valoree corrected dryly, then repeated, \"How? \"</p><p>\"How? \"</p><p>\"Aye. How? You cannot stealor force those at swordpoint, you know.\"</p> <p>\"Aye, well....\" Hislips puckered briefly; then he backed toward the door. Her exceedingly quiet and calm manner seemed to be making him atouch nervous.Perhaps he'd learned over the last thirteen years that when she was calm, it usually preceded a storm. \"I'll be gettingback to you on that, \" he ended lamely, backingthroughthedoor.</p><p>\"I am sure you will, \" Valoree snapped, then returned her attention to herbottle.</p><p>\"We are here.\"</p><p>Valoree glanced about at theannouncement just as the coach came to ahalt. Shiftingcloser tothe window, she lookedoutat the town house they had stopped before, peeringat itthrough a jaded eye. They were about towaste a whole lot of time and coin pursuing the impossible.</p><p>Thiswasthe answerthe men had come up with for getting her \"some invites to them sorries.\" They had determined that she must rent a town house for the \"seasoning\" and \"have one o' them therecomin'-up things.\"Brilliant.Marvelous.They were all mad. Howdid theythink rentinga town house would get her married? Itwasnot as ifthe members of the ton were liketo be overwhelmed by her grace, charm, and beauty.</p><p>The door suddenly opened and Henry appeared, offering a hand to aid her out. Sighing, she caught up her skirtsin a bunch, grabbed his hand, and clambered irritably down from the coach.</p><p>Once onthe ground, she released her skirts, givingthema slight shake so they would fall back in place, and glanced at the carriage parked in front of their own. The door to that one opened and a tall, slender, fair-haired man alit somewhat cautiously even as Henry helped Meg down from their own carriage.</p><p>\"Lady Ainsley? \" he asked hopefullyas he approached.</p><p>Nodding, Valoree automatically offered him her hand toshake.</p><p>\"Lord Beecham, at your service, \" he assuredher, giving asmile before bending to gallantly kissher hand.</p><p>Eyes widening in dismay as he slobbered over her fingers, Valoree glared briefly at Henry as ifto say this was all hisfault.</p><p>Quickly, she drew her hand back to gesture toward Meg asthe womanmovedforward, eyeing themanwith intent interest. \"My aunt.\"</p><p>\"My lady.\"The man could do no less than bend tokiss her hand aswell now, and Meg appeared asstunned by the act as Valoreehad been. Afterward, he straightened and smiledfrom one woman to the other. \"The house is all in order. I had it cleanedas your uncle requested in hisnote. It has notbeen used for several months, soittook abit of doing.Ishallsendhimthe bill, of course.\"</p><p>\"Of course, \"Valoree agreed dryly with anotherpointedglance at Henry. He had written the letter, signing it as her uncle.</p><p>Womendid notperform such transactions.Either their man of affairs did, or a male relative. Henry had thought an uncle, husband to Aunt Meg, ofcourse, might be a good touch - so that it was not thought Valoree was withoutprotection. As for the bill, the town house was the men's idea, so let them pay forit.</p><p>\"Thehouse is pretty much yours foras long asyou need it, \"</p><p>Beecham continued, turning to lead themup to the frontdoor.</p><p>\"Justhaveyour unclewrite me a note shouldhe wish to stay longer than the six months he has already rented itfor.\"</p><p>Noddingmutely, Valoree stepped past himintothe houseas he opened the door for her. Inside, she stood glancing about the entry as Meg - Aunt Meg, she reminded herself - joined her.</p><p>\"As youcansee, it's justwhat your unclerequested. Large, top quality, and clean as a whistle.\"He ran his gloved handdownthe banister of the stairs that led to the second floor to prove his point, and Valoree nodded beforeturning to move into thefirst room on the left.</p><p>\"Ah, now, thisis the salon, as you can see.\" Herhost hurried to keep up with her, rushing into the room atherheels and nearly running over Aunt Meg in the process.</p><p>Valoree was just wondering if she should comment on his rudeness when the woman spoke up for herself. \"We can see whattheroomis, youngman, \" she reproved gently, surprising Valoree. Considering the talent for tartness Meg had displayed overthepast couple of days, Valoree had expected a harsher chiding - a nice cutting comment, or an outright verbal slap.</p><p>Instead, the olderwomanwas smiling at the fellowalmost fondly.</p><p>She'strying to endear us to himbecause he's a noble, Valoree thought bitterly. Sheconsidered the man to see if it was working.</p><p>Lord Beecham, realizing what hehad done, wasnowflushing a brightshadealmost as pink as the god-awfullivery Henry had chosen for Skully and One-Eye. He stutteredoutanapology. It was only then that Valoree took notice of his appearance. He wasn't bad-looking, or very old really, perhaps twenty-five or -six. But he was the studious sort, she would guess. After spendingthe better partofher life inthe company of strong, fit pirates, Valoree thoughtheappeared weak and too skinny. His discomfort now didn'thelp either. Once hisaplomb wasgone, it seemed quite impossible forhim to regainit. It was almost painful for her to watch as he began to stammer out anoffer to give them afurthertour of the house. Itwas Megwho let him off the hook.</p><p>\"That will notbe necessary, my lord.I think wecan find our way around now.\"</p><p>\"A-aye, of course.\" He glanced briefly atMeg, but turned to Valoreeto speak again. \"I... Your unclenever asked me to see to servants, so I - \"</p><p>\"That will not be necessary, \" Aunt Meg answered for her again. \"Wehavepeople coming later today.\"</p><p>\"G-good. I'll just - Oh! I nearly forgot. My mother, Lady Beecham, thought that if you were not too tired from your journey here, you might like toattend asmall soiree sheis having tonight.\" His voice trailed away when Valoree stared at him rather blankly; then he began backing outof the room.\"Well, nay, ofcourse not.You are probably rather tired. I - \"</p><p>Hiswords came toan abrupt halt, as didhisretreat, when he managed tobackhimselfright into Skully.</p><p>The pirate stood in the doorway of the salon, eyeing the surroundingswithsomedisdain.</p><p>Jerking aroundto see what hehad backedinto, Mr.Beecham paled, his jaw dropping slightly. Valoree supposed he'd never seen the likes of Skully before. Apart from the man's being dressed in pink, Valoree imagined that to anyone who didn't know him, he wouldlooklike deathitself. His peg leg didn't help.</p><p>Chuckling quietly, she waved the pirate out of the room, then took Lord Beecham's arm and ledhim to the frontdoor.\"It is kind of ye - you, \" shecorrected herselfquickly. \"It is kind of you, LordBeecham. And you must thank your mother for us.\"</p><p>\"And tell herValoree'll be there, \" Henry inserted from behind her.</p><p>Beecham's eyes widened in amazement at such bold behavior from a servant, and Valoree wheeled, glaring furiously at the olderman. But Henry merelyglared rightback, and a glanceat theother men showed the same determined looks on their faces.</p><p>Grinding her teeth together, she took a deep breath, thenturned back toBeecham, forcinga smile.\"Ofcourseyou musttell her that wewould be delightedto attend hersoiree.\"</p><p>\"You will? \" theman asked, craning his necktopeer over her shoulder at Skully, who was grunting in approval of her concession.</p><p>\"Aye, of course.\" Opening the door, she smiled at him cheerfully, then urged him through it. \"Thank youagain for all your trouble, my lord, in attending to allof this forus.\"</p><p>\"Oh, well, my lady, it ismypleasure, \" he began modestly.</p><p>\"Aye. Well, you do it well. Good day to you, \" she said cheerfully.With that, she closed thedoor on hissmiling face and turned toglare narrowly at her men.</p><p>\"See that! Gotus an invite already!\" Henry crowed, ignoring herobvious displeasure.</p><p>Snorting in disgust, Valoree movedaway from thedoor and led the way back into the salon, where Meg was staring out the windowinto the street. \"You got lucky, \" she snappedirritably, dropping intoa chair and casuallyhooking onelegover the arm of it. \"Lady Beecham is probably the only person in thiswhole townwho would make an impulsivegesture likethat, and you happened to rent the house from her son.\"</p><p>\"Nay.\"Skully shook his head.</p><p>\"Naywhat? \" Valoree asked with asigh.</p><p>\"I'd bet all my shares of the booty from that last Spanish galleon we tookthathis mother ain'tnever e'en heard o' ye, \"the tall man said, bringinga frownto her face.</p><p>\"She - \"</p><p>\"Not she. He.\" When Valoreemerely stared at him blankly, he shookhis head andexplained. \"The boy. Are ye blind, Val? He was sniffingaboutye like ye werea bitch in heat.\"</p><p>Meg snapped with outrage from thewindow. \"You will leave that kindof talk outinthestreet, if you please. Lady Valoree alreadyhas a tendency to slip up without your bandying such foulnessabout.\"</p><p>Skully flushed bright red at the set-down, but Valoree went from pink, to red, to white. She didn't know whethertodefend Skully, snipeat the woman, oragree withher.True, the \"bitchin heat\" remark had been a touch vulgar, even for Skully. She supposedthat was why he wasn't snappingback at her himself.</p><p>That or hewas just as shocked bythe starch in her words as Valoreewas. Thewordsseemed exactly what a\"lady\" wouldsay, and - goodGod - the woman had actuallysounded the part.</p><p>\"Were you ever onstage, Meg? \" she askedatlast.</p><p>Ignoring thequestion, the womanturned to regard her.\"Skully is right, though, forallthat hissentiment could userephrasing.</p><p>Lady Beecham surely did notextend the offer. She does nothave the heart to think ofit.\"</p><p>\"How would you know? \"</p><p>Shrugging, Meg turned back to the window. \"Everyone in London has heard of Lady Beecham and her mean-spirited, snobbish ways.\"</p><p>Valoree stared at her fora moment longer, then glanced toward the doorway of the salon as the front doorof the town house openedand closed.Bull and One-Eyewandered into the room a moment later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Mighty finedigs, \"One-Eyecommented, glancing about the room. \"We stayin'? \"</p><p>\"Aye, \" Henry announced, drawing himself up and facing Valoreeas if expecting an argument.\"We're stayin'.\"</p><p>When Valoree merely shrugged, he continued. \"We'll be needingsomemore things from the ship, though.

Just lookat her.\"</p><p>Silence followed as the men glanced guiltilyat Valoree. She sat pretty much sideways in the chair, legssplayed, onethrown over thechair'scushionedarm, andthe other upon the floor. Herskirt was hitched up to reveal the boots and breeches she wore beneath. The men groanedas one at the sight, knowingthatevery word Meg said was true.</p><p>\"Well, maybe if someone had told us that she was a girl.\"</p> <p>One-Eye glared at Henry as he spoke. \"Maybe then we would have donesomethings different.\"</p><p>\"What? \" Valoree asked dryly. \"Like mutiny? \"</p><p>\"Nay, \" he snapped, affronted. \"Likemaybe throwin' some of themthere grace lessons in along with the sword handling and fisticuffs.\"</p><p>\"Oh, aye, \" she said with a sneer, but was suddenly uncomfortable under theircensuring eyes as they tookin the way she was sitting. For the first time in her life she felt quite inadequate. She was the captain. She led some of the most ruthless, notorious pirates in the land, and they followed her orders. Yetshesuddenly felt like anignorant, uneducated child.</p><p>And shedidn't likeit.</p><p>Slamming both her booted feet flat on the floor, Valoree stood andglared around the room.\"Well, I'll beleavingall this decision making up to youto 'vote' on. Me, I'm going togo takea nap.\"</p><p>**** She didn't sleep; shesat in thewindow seatin thebedchamber she had chosenand stared out at the passingpeople. Valoree had never seenso many peoplein one spotin her life. London was just bustling with activity. It was also overcrowded, and noisy, and it stank. She missed theopen sea:the breeze in her hair and salty spray on her face. She missed thesoundof the men singing their shantiesinto the wind asthey worked. Shemissedher cabin with its constant rolling sensation, and the safety she felt there.</p><p>And more than any of those things, she missed the feeling of beingin charge, ofdeciding whatto do, and where togo, and what should happen next in her life.Itseemed that her life had somehowgotten out of control, and shedidn't much like that.</p> <p>Trying not to think ofsuch things, she watched through the window as the men left together inthe carriage. Some time later, she saw Henry return alone on foot, a young boy followingwith several packages. Shortlyafter that, thecarriage returned with Skully and One-Eye onthedriver'sseat, and Bullriding atop, seated ontowering stacks of goods. When the coachhad rolled to a stop in front of the town house, its door popped open and several moremembers of hercrew piled out. Shewatchedmutely as Bull began to hand down sacks of flour, salt, sugar, andother miscellaneous goods from his perch, accepting unhappily that her men expected alengthy endeavorand obviously intended to stick it out.</p><p>Once the lastof the culinary goods were removed, the men turnedto unpackingthe last two items, a pair of chests - asmall coffer, no doubtstuffed full of the coins they planned tospend on this foolishenterprise, and a larger chest. She recognized the latteras thecontainer she hadstuffed her gowns intowhenthey hadbeendelivered. Moments later sheheardthemen banging their way down the hall towardher room.</p><p>Sighing, shestoodand movedto the door, pulling it open and stepping asideforHenryto enter. He was followed byOne-Eye and Skully and the clotheschest. Settingthe chest on the floor, they straightened, grinningfromearto ear.</p><p>\"Yer gowns is here, \"Henry announced withdetermined cheer.</p><p>\"Ye'd bestget ready.\"</p><p>\"For what? \" sheasked, bringing frowns toeach man's face.</p><p>\"For the sortietonight.\"</p><p>\"Soiree, \"Valoree corrected, thenshook herhead. \"Haven't you noticedany of the women passing by the house? \"</p><p>There was a hesitation as the men exchanged glances; then Henry shookhis head. \"Whatof them? \"</p><p>\"Theyare allwearing heavy white gook ontheir faces, then some sort of red stuffon their cheeks and lips, and thick black stuff on their eyes.\"</p><p>\"She isright.\"They allturned to glance at Meg, who stoodin the door to the room surveying them all. \"The fashion has becometo wear thickmakeup onyour face, lips, and to even wearkohlon youreyes.\" Her gazewent to Valoree. \"I take it you have noneof that? \"</p><p>Valoree shook her head, though she was not overly disappointed at the fact.Maybe this would be away out.</p><p>\"Well...\" Henry frowned. \"We'll gether some of that onthe morrow. But she'll just haveto do without tonight. Every shop willbe closedby now.\"</p><p>\"You cannot really imagine that you can take her to the Beecham soiree without it? \"Meg exclaimed in dismay.</p><p>Henry frowned ather. \"Course we can. Who knowswhenthe next invite willcome iffen she don'tshowup tonight? \"</p><p>\"Well, ifyou insist on her goingtonight without it, I will not be involved.\" Turning onherheel, the woman marched out of the room.</p><p>\"What do you think? \"One-Eyeasked, andHenry scowled.</p><p>\"Wedon't have no makeup fortonight, but we don't have no invitesfor tomorrow.That's whatI think.\"</p><p>\"Hmmmm.\" One-Eye made aface. \"MaybePetey can come up with something. He's gotlots o' white stuff in thekitchens. Red stuff, too.\"</p><p>Henry brightened at once at the suggestion. \"Aye. Gotell him tosee what he can do.\"</p><p>Valoree sighed. It seemed therewas no escape.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>A buzzgoing around the ballroom drew Daniel'sattentionfrom John Beecham's liturgy on the importance of wise investments andrenting unused properties.</p><p>Beecham was like that. Money was his mainpriority in life, a stricture he'd had pounded into his head by his father, who, disappointed in love, had settled for a loveless marriage and instead had poured his energies into the art of increasing his wealth.Riches, the older Beechamhad often saidwhile he lived, wereneverknown tobetray aman.</p><p>Thephilosophywasrathervulgar as faras the membersof the ton were concerned. For them, money was to be spent, not earned, and if itwasearned, one should never be so crass as to discuss it. Beecham's obsession with itwas the reason he was considered beneath the majority of the ton. Andyet, the amount ofwealth his family had was the reason no one missed one of their balls.</p><p>Thoughtsof Beecham fled Daniel's mind as the murmuring began. Turning, he let his eyes follow the direction everyone seemedtobelookingin, to thedoorway of the ballroom. They immediately widened on the youngwomanstanding there. She was tall and slender, wearing a simple gown ofmidnight blue and anexpressionof dismayon her face asshe took in the gathering.</p><p>It took him a moment to recognize her as the woman from Whister's salon, and then allhe felt was disappointment of asort.</p><p>He had thought her attractive at the lawyer's office; she'd had a sun-kissed face and natural beauty. Now she sported the death's-mask white face that was so popular, with red cheeks drawn on. Her hair hadflowed down her backnaturallythen, but wasnow looped and tied and knotted atopherhead. Well, sort of. Actually, it looked to be unraveling somewhat and sliding down her face. That was the reason everyone was abuzz, he supposed. Most of the nobility cropped their hair and wore wigs, but this woman's brilliant red hair was obviously allher own - and ifhe wasnotmistaken, it had been arranged using nautical knots. He couldn't be sure of that, though, for it was already escapingitsconfines.</p><p>\"Lady Ainsely, \"Beecham murmured nearby, drawing Daniel's startledgaze.</p><p>\"Did you say Ainsley? \" Whister had never mentioned her name.</p><p>\"Yes.She and heraunt rented my cousin'stownhouseforthe season, \" Beecham explained.</p><p>\"Her aunt, hmm? \" Daniel glanced back toward the woman.</p><p>\"That isnot her aunt with her. Who is that fellow? \"</p><p>**** \"This is a small soiree? \"Henry whispered in disbelief.</p><p>Sighing, Valoree glancedat the mansympathetically. He was all dressedupin thepoofy - ashe described them - clothes of a nobleman. He was \"Uncle\"Henry tonight, thanks to \"Aunt\" Meg having cozied herself up to a bottle of rum while the men were busy solving all theproblems that attending this\"littleparty\" had presented. Rum, of all things! Andafter she'd made such astink about Valoreedrinking it.</p><p>Still, Valoree herself was much more uncomfortable than Henry, especially with her hair. Henry had tried to wakeMeg to dress it, but the woman had been well sauced and beyond waking, so the sailor hadseen to thetaskhimself, snapping and cussing the whole while. At lastValoreehadsuggested he fix it up in nautical knots - she didn't know the first thing about style or fashion, and reallycouldn'tcare less, anyway - andafter half anhour ofhis tugging at her hair and swearing, she had suggested he try somethinghe knew. At least if he tied her long tresses up in knots on herhead, they would stay. Soshe'd thought.</p><p>Her coiffurehad lookedgood when hehad finished the task, or at least allthe men had saidso. But theride in the carriage had been quite jostling, and all the bouncing and bobbingaroundin the airless hack hadloosenedthe knots. Shecouldfeel theheavy tresses sliding slowly to one side of her headand was positivethe whole messwould come tumbling downatany second.</p><p>\"Oh, just a moment.\" Henry reached outto brushsomething from her cheek with one finger. Valoree forgot her hair and scowled. Her face was even worse.</p><p>\"There's just this piece ...\"Henry frowned. \"Araspberry seed, I think.\"</p><p>Valoree grimaced. Petehad comeup withsome sortof white gooey substance to slather on her face as makeup, but had apparently not been able to come up with something for red cheeks andlips. One-Eye hadreturned from the kitchens with a bowfulof raspberries, announcingtheywould do the trick.... And theyhad, she supposed, though she could havedone withoutthe men smooshing themon her cheeksandsqueezingand rubbing them on her lips. Shecould also havedonewithout the hour of picking at herface toremove the seedsafterward. Apparently they hadn't gotten quite allof them.</p><p>Her eyes dropped to his hand as he pulled it away from her cheek. A seed surrounded by white and pinkgookstucktothe end of his pink-stained finger. Sheshook her headin disgust.\"I suppose you've messed up my face, now.\"</p><p>\"Nay, nay, \" he saidquickly, surely realizing that shemight use it as achance to escape. However, his frown as hepeered at her was less than reassuring.</p><p>Valoreeeyed himbriefly, then gestured to his hands. \"Try to keep those out of sight.Thosestainsare - What the devilare you frowning at? \"</p><p>His eyes shot to hersnervously. \"Oh, nothing.\"</p><p>He'd answered too quickly, she decided, scowling at him suspiciously. \"You'd best tell me. You know I don't like surprises.\"</p><p>\"It's nothing, \" her quartermaster repeated, then wrinkled his nose. \"It's only that yourface appears tobe cracking somewhatin the spots that it's drying.\"</p><p>\"What!\"</p><p>\"Don't!\" he cried, butit wastoolate; her handshad already, risen instinctively to her face. She pulled her fingers away covered with the muck Pete had made as substitute makeup.</p><p>\"Nowyou'vedoneit, \" he muttered, and reachedoutwith his finger again to pat andsmoothher face. \"Standstill.\"</p><p>Valoree tried todoashe asked, forcingherself toremain still, butshe couldn't withhold the question that was now on the tip of hertongue. \"How can my face be cracking when it's still wet? \"</p><p>\"It'sdryingaround the edges, \" he informed her, a frown of concentrationon his face ashe worked at hers. \"Andon your bosom.That's where it'scrack - \"He paused, cursing when she glanceddownto see that, indeed, themuck they had insisted on spreading on herneckand bosom, where it wasn't covered bythe dress, was now dryand beginningto crackand flake.</p><p>\"Nowlook what you made me do.You've a streakwheremy finger was.

Her gaze slid over him, taking in the white breeches and shirt under a lime green waistcoat, with lime green and yellow ribbons onthekneebreeches.</p><p>They hadstopped at the tailor's onthe waytothe Beechams' soiree. It had been adesperate bid to get theirhands onsome lord-type clothes for Henry when they had realized that Meg was not going to recover in time to attend the \"sour-ee.\" It had worked, muchto Valoree's disgust.Ofcourse theman hadhad a proper outfit injust therightsize. Well, almostthe rightsize. It had been made fora Lordsomebody-or-other and was dueto be delivered the next day, but would be delayed now thanks to Henry. He'd offered up a smallfortune to beableto purchase it for his own use.</p><p>Giving a mutter, Henrytugged at his breeches impatiently. That was theonly realproblem with theoutfit, Valoree supposed. The green waistcoat fit him in the shoulders, but it and the knee breecheswere too bigat the waist. Apparentlythe noble who'd commissioned ithad something of astomach, while Henry, who kept trimby pulling ropes and climbing rigging, did not. Now Henry was forced to constantly tug the pants up or else risk losing them. Avoice interrupted her musings.</p> <p>\"Lady Ainsley.\"</p><p>Leaning to the side slightly, Valoree peered past Henry's scowling face at the smallish man who was approaching from behind him.</p><p>\"Beecham, \"shesaid.Henrymadea face, took one last swipe at herface, then turned to greettheman.</p><p>\"Ah, Lord Beecham. A pleasure to meettheman who made the arrangements Irequested. Good ofye toinvite us to thishere littleswarming, \" Henrybegan cheerfully.</p><p>\"Soiree, \" Valoree corrected, thenforced a brightsmile to her face as she nodded at their host. \"Lord Beecham, my uncle Henry.\"</p> <p>\"Apleasure, my lo - Ah...\"The youngman paused, his eyes fixed onthepirate, anda frownbegan toslip ontohis face.</p><p>\"Is there something wrong? \" Valoree asked atouch nervously, onlyjust now worrying overhis recognizing Henry as oneof the servants that had accompanied her earlier that afternoon. She hadn't thought itaproblem, for She hadheard that mostnobles didn't trouble themselves to notice servants. It figured that Beecham wouldbe one of thefew who did.</p><p>\"I am sorryforstaring, mylord, \" theman said. \"It is just that you look very much like one of the servants Isaw with Lady Ainsley this afternoon.\"</p><p>\"Ah.\" Henry nodded solemnly, and Valoree waited for his explanation, knowing hewould come up with one. The sailor was a quick thinker. He didn'tdisappoint her.\"That'd be me brother.</p><p>Half brother, thatis. My father's bastard offspring.His mother wasoneof our maids onthe island. When he came of age, we tookhim onas a servant. Have to look after family, don't ye know.\" He slapped their host on theback as he said that, nearly sending the slender manto his knees.</p><p>Maintaininghis feet, Beecham managed a weaksmileatthe jovial man. Then he glanced to Valoree and asked with real regret, \"Yourauntcould notmake it tonight? \"</p> <p>\"'Fraidnot, \" Henry answeredbeforeValoree couldspeak, then tried for a conspiratorial look and said, \"You know howwomen are. Fussing overtheleast little problem. Well, she took to the bo - \"</p><p>\"Bed, \" Valoree interjected quicklybefore he could finish. \"She was not feeling welland took to herbed.\"</p><p>\"I see, \" Beecham said, and Valoreesuspectedhe did see - if not the whole picture, then thatsomething was wrongwiththe picture theywere trying to present. Sighinginwardly, she sent a quick glance at Henry, relieved when he caught the younger man'sarm and whirled him around to propel him toward the middle of theroom.</p><p>\"How about ye introduce us around so we can size up the offerings this evening.\"</p><p>\"Offerings? \" Beecham asked uncertainly.</p><p>\"Aye. The men. Got to marry this little lady off, don't ye know.\"</p><p>Glaring at theback ofhis head and followingthe men intothe crowd, Valoree imaginedshe had one of her blades withher and was sticking it intoher quartermaster's arse.</p><p>\"Have you seen Lady Ainsley? \"</p> <p>Daniel glanced up from the drink he had beencontemplating, his eyebrowsrising slightlyat Beecham's distressed face. \"Last I saw her, she was with youand thatolder gentleman.\"</p><p>\"Her uncle.\"Beecham sighed, turning toperuse the roomful of people unhappily, unawareof the wayDaniel stiffened.</p><p>\"Heruncle? \" he askedcarefully. \"On which side? \"</p><p>Beecham turnedback, his eyes blinking rapidly.\"Which side? You mean which side of the family is he from? \" The man frowned slightly. \"Idonot know. She merely introduced him as UncleHenry. I imagine he isfromthemother's side, however, since I do not believe that Lord Ainsley had a brother.\" He pausedto considerthat briefly, then shrugged with disinterest.</p><p>\"He does not visit London much, obviously, \" Daniel said.</p><p>Beecham shook his head.</p><p>\"He hasaplantation on oneof the islands in the Caribbean.</p><p>This is hisfirsttrip toLondon in years.\"</p><p>\"Whichisland? \"</p><p>Beecham frownedat the question. \"I... I am not sure. I do not think they mentioned which one, \" he admitted slowly, then waved the question away. \"I must find herand make sure she is allright.\"</p><p>\"Did something happen? \" Daniel asked before he could slip away, and the other man groaned.</p><p>\"Aye. Therewas anincident.\"</p><p>Daniel's eyebrowsrose at his pained inflection.\"An incident? \"</p><p>\"Yes.\" Beecham hesitated, then said, \"I had introducedthem to several people when Mother wavedus over - \"</p><p>Daniel hadto smother agrinat the way the man said the word mother, though he couldn't blame him. Were Lady Beecham Daniel's ownmother . ..Well, he was just grateful she wasn't. She was a rather unpleasant woman.</p><p>\"So Iwas forced to introduce LadyAinsley and her uncle to her friends; thenMothersentme off to fetch her a sweetmeat.</p><p>Apparently, while Iwas gone. ..Well.. .\"He whined piteously.</p><p>\"Lady Ainsley's facefell off.\"</p><p>Daniel blinked, bemused. \"Her facefell off? \"</p><p>Beecham nodded, seemingly broken. Then he suddenly straightened, an idea strikinghim.\"Mayhap I should check - \"</p><p>\"Beecham, \" Daniel interrupted, drawing the other man's distracted attention.</p><p>\"Hmmm? \"</p><p>\"How do you ... I mean, howis itpossible that her face fell off? \"</p><p>\"Oh! Well, it was her ... er ... the white stuff that all thewomen wear.\" Heshookhis head witha frown.\"Itwasdryingup on her skin and cracking.\" His frown deepened. \"I thought to give warning, but feared to embarrass her, soI didnotsay anything.</p><p>She knows now.\" He shook his head again. \"It was horrible, really. I must find out where she got that makeup and warn everyone to stayaway - \"</p><p>\"Beecham, \" Daniel interrupted patiently.</p><p>\"Oh, sorry. Well, it was drying up as the nightprogressed. It turned asort ofgrayish color asit dried and began tocrack. Little bitsof it were flaking off for most of the night as I tookher and her uncle around. Honestly, we left a trailof the stufffrom one end of the ballroom to theother. I believeshe musthavebeen aware of itand did not know what to do, for she grew quieter and quieter as the evening progressed. And, of course, she could surely feel it. It seemed to be pulling her face tight.\"</p><p>Seeing that Daniel was growing impatient again, Beecham hurried hisstory along.\"Anyway, apparently Mother asked her a question she could notjust nodat asshe had been doingmost of the night. Shespoke, her facecracked, and a greatchunk of it fell right off her chin. It bounced off her\" - he gestured vaguely towardhis chest - \"and it plopped into Mother's wine. Of course, Mother's wine splashedout allover hernew yellow gown.It will probablystain, and she is quite distressed, \" he ended somewhat lamely.</p><p>Danielbit his lip hard to keep back thelaugh that wanted to escape as hevisualized the \"incident.\" Takinga momentto clear histhroat, he asked, \"I takeit the lady then disappeared? \"</p><p>\"Fled with her uncle on her heels, \" Beecham agreed unhappily.</p><p>\"I do not know where they may have gone.\"</p><p>\"I would think theywent straight home, \" Daniel proposed, but Beecham quicklyshook hishead.</p><p>\"I went out front and checked. Their carriage is still here.\"</p><p>When Daniel raised his eyebrows, Beecham shrugged. \"Her servants arerather easyto spot. Pink livery.\" He frowned. \"I've never seenmen look quite sodisreputable in pink livery as hers do.Andthey are allsobig.\"Shaking his head, he bowed slightly toward Daniel. \"I really must find her. I feel somehow responsible. I never should have left her with Mother. Excuse me.\"</p><p>Daniel considered thatlast phraseasthe fellow hurriedoff. It was more telling than the rest of the tale. Beecham suspected his mother wassomehow at fault for the whole affair.</p><p>KnowingLady Beecham, she probably was. She wouldhave seen theproblem the girlwas having, but ratherthan taking her aside and helping herrepair her problem, as any good hostess would, She had probablysent her son off deliberatelyso that he could not field questionsandthe girlwould have to speak and suffer the humiliation ofacracking face. Lady Beecham was a rather cold, nasty piece of work. Her friends were not much better, andthe crowd of them together... Well, they wouldhave eaten Lady Ainsley alive, he thought. But would they? He reconsidered. The woman he had seeneavesdropping at Whister's had not appeared the sort easily chewed up and spat out by anyone, even society's nastiest matrons.No. Just witnessthe fact that She had not already jumpedinher carriageand fled.</p><p>He glanced around the room. Wherehad shegotten tothen? he wondered. His gaze alighted on Lady Beecham and her crowd of cronies.They wereall having a good laugh, he saw. His eyes narrowed asone of thewomen gestured toward thedoors tothe balcony, titteringas shedid. Daniel stiffened.</p><p>Surelythat was not whereLady Ainsley had run off to? If so, wouldn'tLady Beecham have told her son, rather thanhave him run about searching forher? Nay.Ofcourse not. Not if she didn't wantthefellow to have anythingto do with her.</p><p>Positivehe was right and drawn by his curiosity, Daniel strode towardthebalcony doors.</p><p>\"Oh, Captain, girl, I'msosorry, \"Henry apologized ashe found Valoreeon thebalcony. \"This herewasa terrible idea. Wenever shouldhave madeye come out when yewere without the proper stuff.\" Awkwardly patting her shaking shoulders, he sighed miserably. \"Please don't be crying, though. Yer breakin' me heart.\"</p><p>Valoree wheeled around at that. \"I ain't crying, ye silly old goat, \" shesnapped, herEnglish slipping somewhat in herhurry to correct him. She had not cried since Jeremy's death. Pirate captainsdidnot cry.</p><p>\"Oh ... Well, yershoulders wasshaking so hard I - \"</p><p>\"I was laughing, \" sheexplained. At his amazed expression, she shook her head. \"Itwas damned funny when my facefell off. Did you see Lady Beecham's face whenit plopped in her wine? I thoughtI'dsplit a gutright there.\" She curledherlip. \"She was hoping for something of the like to happen, I think, the nastyold bitty. ButIdon't thinkshewas quite prepared for ittoruin her precious gownlike that.\"</p><p>\"Nay, Idon't thinkshe was, \" Henry sighed. \"And she is a nasty old biddy.\"</p><p>\"Aye, she is, \" Valoree agreed, her amusement evaporating as she recalled the woman'sfalse smile andcold eyes. HadLady Beecham found aught amiss with Henry's account of life on their Caribbeanplantation? He had been tellingtales taller than the Valor's masts tonight, but then hehad always been that way on the ship, too, entertaining the menwithsometruly imaginative yarns when they relaxedin the evenings. Unfortunately, notever having moved in such elevated circles as these people moved in, he'd had to makeeverything upfrom scratch. And even Valoree, who had notlived the lifeof a noble since her eleventhyear, had seengreat, gaping errors in hislies.</p><p>Not that he had told many of them at first, but once young Beecham had departed and they had been left alone with his mother and her crowd, Henry had started talking almost feverishly inan effort todrawattention awayfrom Valoree and hercrackingface. Themore hehad babbled away about their huge plantation - the sugarcane, the servants, and the fine \"shorties\" they held there - well, the more malicious Lady Beecham'ssmile had gotten, and the more she hadeyed, Valoree like a hawk eyeing a field mouse. Then she had started interrupting Henry to askValoreequestions. Henry had tried to answer them, but finally the woman had said, \"I asked your niece, my lord.Surely she can answer for herself.\"</p><p>It wasthen that, withnothing else forit, Valoreehadopened hermouth tospeak and senta great avalanche of the white muck sailing off herface. The largestchunk hadbounced off herchest into the woman's gobletof red wine, which had then splashed bloodred onher yellow gown.</p><p>Takingone look at the woman's horrified face, Valoree had whirled awayto flee. But asshe'd justtoldHenry, it was only so that shewould not be seenwhen sheburst out laughing.</p><p>\"I suppose tonight probably ruined everything, \" Henry said.</p><p>\"We'll never getanother invite toone of these here sworings, and we'll never get you marriednow.I should havelistened to Meg instead of forcing ye to come tonight.\"</p><p>Valoree's ears perked up;she was hopeful that this might signal theend of this stupidityand that she might return toher old life, whereshe felt safer despite the inherent danger ofbeing a pirate.</p><p>Was Henryadmittingdefeat so soon? And not because of any fault of hers but because of the men's own miscalculations? Oh, this was too perfect. Better than she hadhoped for.</p><p>Keeping her reliefhidden, she noddedinagreement.\"Aye. I doubtwe garnered any friends here tonight. We are ruined, I believeis the term.\" Shegave a feigned sighof disappointment, thenheadedfor thedoor. \"Well, we'dbest clear out of here and head home to tell the men.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"You don't really want towalkbackthroughthere, do ye? \"</p><p>Henry asked with amazement, fallinginto step beside her.

Valoree waited a moment, thencaught herself pickingoff the chunks of dried glop thatstill clung to her face. Grimacing, she forced her hands away and walkedto the edgeof thebalcony impatiently.Itwas then that she spotted thefountain. As she eyed itfrom where she stood, a plan formed in her head.She hurried down the steps andintothe garden.</p><p>When he first stepped outside, Daniel thought he had been mistaken; the balconywas darkand empty, and there was nosign ofLadyAinsley. It was quiet andcool, though, anice change from the inside of the Beecham ballroom. Decidingto enjoythe tranquilityfor a moment, he moved to the railingand set hisdrink down. Hisrelaxation was broken a moment later as heglanced quicklyup at the sounds ofsplashing water.</p><p>Squinting, he peeredout over the shadowed gardens, his gaze stopping upon adark shapedirectlyin frontofwhat appeared to be a rather large fountain. The shapeseemed to be the source of alltheracket.After a hesitation, he moved to thesteps and down into thegarden, making hisway silently until he stood directly behind the noisy shadow.</p> <p>It tookhis eyesa momentto sort out what hewas seeing, and when he did, it was only because thedark shapesuddenly shifted and roseup slightly, a headandshouldersappearingabovethe mass ofdark blue skirtsthathad appeared blackin thedarkness.</p><p>The sound of spluttering water continued.</p><p>Why would any woman submerge her head in Beecham's garden fountain? Unless she had adesperateneed to cleansome defective foundationfromher face.</p><p>\"Lady Ainsley? \" he asked in disbelief.</p><p>Theshape whirled on itsknees and turnedto facehim. It was indeed the lady. She peered up at him in dismay, then lurched to her feet, pushing wet hair backoff her face and glancingabout ratherwildly - looking for an escaperoute, mostlikely.Shifting forward a bit, Daniel blocked any opportunity for escape, his eyestaking in everything about her.</p><p>For a moment theywere both silent; then Daniel cleared his throat.\"Iheardof yourincident andthought tocome out and check onyou.\"</p> <p>Her eyes widened.\"My incident? \"</p><p>\"The trouble youhad with ...\" He gestured vaguelytoward her now clean-scrubbedfaceand thought she winced slightly, but he couldn't be sureinthedarkness.</p><p>\"Oh, aye. Well... I seem tohave . .. been soldsome inadequate foundation, \" she said at last.</p><p>\"Ahhhh, \" Daniel murmured, though he wasn't sure what he meantevenas he did so.\"How distressingfor you.\"</p><p>\"Aye, \"she agreed. \"Most distressing.\"</p><p>They both fell silent again; then Daniel, judging that she wouldn'trun off on him, stepped backto give her someroom.\"I seeyou managed to remove it.\"</p><p>\"Hmmm.\" Shegrimacedslightly. \"I doubt LadyBeecham will appreciate my befouling her fountain.\"</p><p>\"Betterthat than her wine.\" Daniellaughed, then realized what hehad said. Quickly he triedto backpedal. \"I mean - \"</p> <p>\"Oh, don't worry about it, \"the girl muttered, pushing past him and moving a fewsteps fartherinto the garden. Her gaze shifted out over the shadows as if in search of somebody; then she glanced back at him with a frown. \"Was there something you wanted? \"</p><p>\"Wanted? \" His eyes widened. \"Nay, I just...\" He paused, having no good explanationfor his presence in the gardens. He shrugged, then searched for something to say. \"I trust your appointment with Whister - \"</p><p>\"Went about as well as yours, \" she finisheddryly, thenglanced around. \"Else I surely wouldn't be here.\"</p><p>\"Itake it youarenot enjoying yourself? \"</p><p>She turned her face toward himin the darkness. \"Is that a joke, my lord? \"</p><p>A bark of laughter slipped from Daniel's lips at her dry question.The girlcertainly didn't pullany punches. He liked that.</p><p>Clearing his throat, he tried a different topic. \"Ainsley is in northern England, is it not? \"</p><p>\"Aye, \"she agreed, turningto peer out over the bushes again.</p><p>\"Iunderstandyour parents died when you were quiteyoung? \"</p><p>\"Aye.\"</p><p>\"And your brother, Jeremy? \"</p><p>Her head turned sharply, and Danielcouldalmost feel her eyes boring into him in the darkness. He continued.</p><p>\"Whister mentionedthat he diedsome ... fiveyearsago, was it? \" He waited for her reaction. In truth, Whister hadn't said anything about this girl's brother; Daniel had known the fellow personally. Infact, Daniel had been looking forthe man forsome time now.</p><p>Though the man had been reputedly killed, someone was riding theoceanwavesand continuingto lootthe Spanishin his place.</p><p>And whoever that man - Back-from-the-Dead Red, he was called - might be, he owed the kingofEngland his percentageof five years' worthof. piracy.IfJeremy Ainsley had thought to escape hiscontract with the Crownby fakinghis death, he was mistaken.</p><p>If it was someone else inhis stead, the king wantedhimbrought in.</p><p>Because hewas theonly one otherthan the king who hadever met Captain Red, Daniel had been commissioned by the king to bring Jeremy Ainsleyto task forhis crimes.</p><p>Of course, that had all ended a yearago whenDaniel's father had died, leaving him Thurborneandallof itsproblems. It had beenratherhumiliating tohim to have to admit failure after four yearsof endeavoring, butDaniel hadhad littlechoice butto give up his hunt for JeremyAinsley or his impostor. He'dhad toreturn to take uphis responsibilities. But perhaps here wasa chance to rectify that. A little charm, a few compliments, and no doubt Lady Ainsley could be encouraged to give up the information Danielneeded toatleast discover if her brother still lived.</p><p>\"Damn!\"</p><p>His thoughts interrupted by the curse, Daniel glanced downat the light oval of Lady Ainsley's face, then followed her gaze toward the balcony. Lord Beecham was coming out of the ballroom.</p><p>Heglanced backtoValoreeAinsley, hoping to continue their discussion, butwhen he did, she was gone.He peeked around.</p><p>Thegirlhadducked behind a nearbytree.Itwas a poor hiding place, and herskirts were sticking out on either side of thetrunk.</p><p>Amusement filling him, Daniel took pity on the girl. She obviously did not wantto speak to Beecham. With a sigh, he started back toward the steps to waylay the man.</p><p>\"Psst... Pssst! Hey!\" A voicecame out of thedarkness.</p><p>Her headjerking around, Valoree squintedatthebushes and trees that Henry haddisappeared intoseveral moments earlier.</p><p>\"Henry? Isthat you? \" she said in ahiss, then glancednervously around the treeshe washiding behind. Thurborne had reached Beecham andthetwo men were now talking.</p><p>\"Well, who the hellelsewould it behidin' in the busheshissin' at ye? \"</p><p>Herquartermaster sounded cranky. Shesupposed she couldn't blame him. It had been an awful evening. Casting a nervous glance toward the men on the balcony, Valoree took a deep breath, then skitteredacross thesmall open space. She dove into the bushes, crashing into Henry'sbarrel-like chest. \"Oh, there you are.\"</p><p>\"Aye, here Iam, \" Henry answered dryly, steadying her.</p><p>\"Did you find anotherway out? \"</p><p>\"Aye.\" Turning, he beganto pushhis way through the bushes.</p><p>Then he stopped. \"Well, it's not anidealexit, \" he warned over his shoulder.\"But a stonewall surrounds the townhouse gardens, and one side of it facesonto a street. I thought I could boost ye over the wall, thengofetch the carriage and bring it around to pick ye up.\"</p><p>\"That'lldo, \" Valoree answered. Anything to escape.</p><p>The two set off.</p><p>\"Here we are, \" Henry announced a moment later, pausing under a tree and tipping his head back to consider the wall.</p><p>\"Whatdo youthink? \"</p><p>Valoree nodded asshe looked at it. It was only a couple of inches taller than she. Were she not in such a clumsy, heavy dress, she would have managed it onher own. \"All right.Give me aboost.\"</p><p>Henry locked hisfingersand stooped to hold them at knee level. Rucking herskirts up, Valoree placed herbootedfoot in his hands, then reached out.Grasping thetop of the stonewall, she launched herself upward as she pulled with her arms. Henry straightened and boosted her atthe same time, and that lifted her high enough that she landed onthe wallon her stomach. Quickly she swung one leg up to the side, catching atthe wallwith her foot and scramblinginto a sitting position.Onceperched there, she squinteddown at him.</p><p>\"I'll go back through the party, fetchthe carriage, andbring it around, \"he toldher.</p><p>\"Why not just come this way? You canwalk around to fetch it rather than go back through the party.\"</p><p>Henry shook his head. \"I'm too old to be scrambling over walls, \" he told her, turning away. \"I won'tbe a moment.\"</p><p>Valoree watched him disappear into the bushes again, then turnedto glance atwhat lay on the otherside of thewall. It was more an alley than astreet - dark, narrow, and not well traveled.</p><p>Unfortunately, though therewas no one to seeher, therewasalso nothing tosee. Shebegan toswing her legs on either sideof the wall in boredom. Glancing back theway Henry had disappeared, she tried to calculate how far he might have gotten. He had probably reachedthebalcony.</p><p>She had just decided that when, glancing idly down at the ground just inside the wall, she stiffened. Something metal was glinting in the moonlight. Tugging her skirts out of the way, Valoree felt alongthe top ofherbootfor theknife thatalways rested there, thencursed. It was gone, of course. Must havebeen bumped out of her boot top asshe had struggledto mountthe wall.</p><p>Straightening, shepeered down at it again.Short, sharp, and with ajeweled hilt, ithad been passed down through the family for generations. It was almost all she had left of the family that had once been hers.That and Ainsley Castle. But Ainsley wasn't yet hers, and wouldn'tbe if she couldn't findahusband and get with child.</p><p>She couldn't leavethedagger behind. Cursing under her breath, she swungher right leg back overthe wall and launched herself offof it. She landed harder thanshe expected and stumbled to the side, rolling inthe dirt and underbrush, then stopped herself and crawledto herhandsand knees.Reaching out for the knife, she picked it up, then sat back on her haunchesto inspect it. She needed to besure all the jewels were still present.</p><p>The knife seemedfine. Deciding not to riskitsfalling outof her boot again, shestood and reachedup to lay it ontop of thewall.</p><p>Then, grasping thetop of the wall with onehand, Valoree tugged herskirts up with the other. Revealing onebootedfoot, she dug it into the wall, then attemptedto pull herself upwithboth arms. Of course, the moment she let go of her skirts, her second foot tangled in them. With a jerk both her feet slid out from under her, sending her smacking into the wall.</p><p>This hadbeena loteasier with Henry's help.</p><p>Daniel hadmaneuvered Beecham around so thathis back was to the garden. He didn't want the other man to spot Valoree sticking out from hertree. Unfortunately, once hehad completed themaneuver, as he peered into the gardens himselfhe found he couldnolongersee her either.His gaze slid over the shadowed area ashe nodded absentlyatBeecham's conversation, but he could discern nothing.</p><p>Where the devil had she gone? he wondered; then he stilled, hiseyes narrowingas he spotted movement in thedarkness atthe periphery of the garden. Someone was sneaking toward the balcony, sticking carefully to the shadows. But it wasn't Lady Ainsley, he wassure.There were no bell-shaped skirts hampering the figure.</p><p>Quickly, Daniel turnedhis head slightly away so that whoever it was would not know they had been spotted. Instead, he watched from the cornerof his eye.Thefigure drew nearer, then hesitated. Suddenly, straightening abruptly, it started forward at a fastclip thatsent itsailing by intotheballroom almosttoo fast for Danielto recognize the man.</p><p>\"Who wasthat? \" Beecham asked, turningsuddenly. Hemust have caughta glimpse, however, for with some shock he said, \"That was Lady Ainsley's uncle.\" Excusing himself, Beecham wentoff after the manatonce.</p><p>Daniel watchedhimgo, then turned topeer backdown atthe gardens. Moving to the steps, he walked down them, then paused to glance aroundbefore setting off towhere he had first noticed the man, attheedge of the gardens. Finding almost at once a rough sortof sidepath that had been trounced into the trees and bushes on theedge of the garden, he did not hesitate, but began to follow it. After several steps, he heardamuffledcursefrom ahead and picked up hispace.</p><p>The path ended quite suddenly, andThurborne stepped out of the bushes to find himself confrontingthe backend ofaskirt - Lady Ainsley's - as the woman hungfromthewall andscrambled toclimb it.</p><p>\"Damn it!\"</p><p>Daniel blinked as the woman before him swore again, then briefly settled on the ground.She launched herself upwardonce more almost immediately, pulling with herarms and scrabblingat the wall with her feet.</p><p>\"Might I be of some service? \" he asked with amusement, chuckling when she released the wall abruptly, stumbled a step back, then tripped over her own skirt and plopped onto her behindin thedirt. Thecurseshe snapped thenwas nothing any lady he knew would have everuttered - and certainly notwith such believable vehemence.</p><p>Moving around in front of her, he reached out, offering assistance.Lady Ainsley hesitated briefly, then slappedher wrist into his hand, her own fingers closingaround hiswrist likea vise.</p><p>Before Daniel could recover from his surprise at both the masculine actionand the strength inher fingers, she was pulling, and he had to brace himselfto preventbeingtuggedover on top of her. Gathering himself quickly, he pulled even as she did, bringing herto her feet before him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Attemptingto avoidleaving via the ballroom, I takeit, \" he asked, watching with interestas shebusiedherselfin brushing off herhands onher once pristine skirts.</p><p>Sighing, the girl gave uptrying to remove the dirt on herhands, thenused them topush the dampmaneofhair off herface.

An inquisition? \"</p> <p>When he merely archedhiseyebrows atherandleanedback against the wall, she sighed impatiently and returned to her task.</p><p>Grasping the top of the wall she leaped and strained to pull herselfupward. He watched in fascination forseveral moments, waiting for her to beg his assistance as most women would, before herealized quite suddenly that shewould not doit.</p><p>\"Allyou needdo is ask, \" he said atlast.She turned, asmall struggleon her face.Asking obviouslywasn't easy for her, he realized withsome wonder.Amazing. In hisexperience, females werealwaysasking for help. They were thought weakerand used that to their advantage. Pray, my lord, the basketis soooo heavy, if you could but carry it. Oh, my Lord, prithee, I couldn't possibly walk from here to there on myown, if you would but loanme your strong arm to lean on.</p><p>Butnot this one.She would most likely continue to struggle untildoomsdayereasking, Daniel realized. He felt himself soften.</p><p>Straightening, he caughther armand drew her away from the wall, then stepped in frontof her. Placinghis back to the wall, he droppedto his haunches, andheldout hisinterlocked hands.\"Up we go.\"</p><p>She considered his profferedhands suspiciously for a moment, then sighed. Positioningherself in front of him, Lady Ainsley reached over himto grasp the wall, then glanceddownto find his hands with her eyes.</p><p>\"On three, \" he murmured, considering the booted foot she placed in hishands. What odd dress, he thought. \"One, two, three.\"</p><p>He pushed, butnottooeagerly. She pulled witha grunt, and she landed on her belly on the wall, her lower legs pressed against his face.Grinning, Thurborne slidout from between her andthe wall, then straightened and moved behind her, considering her voluminous skirts as she swung her right leg to the side and tried toheftit up onto the wallas well.</p> <p>\"Some more help perhaps? \" he teased, watching her skirts swingbackand forth asshe struggled.</p><p>Hergrunt of rage wasmost entertaining. Stepping forward, he slidhis hands under her skirtsand caught her by her boots.\"Up or to the side? \"</p><p>\"Up, \" shesnapped, and he slid his fingers lightlyup until he touched something other than leather, laughing at her abruptly cut-off yelp.</p><p>\"To the side, to the side, \" she roared, not sounding at all ladylike. Thurborne continued tochuckle as he graspedoneleg, lifting and swingingit totheside. A momentlater she had broken free from his hold and sat straddling thewall. Immediately, she pulled her other leg up beneath her as if not trusting him not to touch her again. Then she felt along the wall for something.</p><p>Whenshe didn't findit, she released another curse and turned to glare down athim. Even in thedarkness he could see that she was furious.</p><p>\"IfI had my blade with meI'd - \"</p><p>He nevergot to hearthe end of that threat, for at thatmoment thejangleof a carriage and the clip-clop of horses reached them both. Glancing over her shoulder, Lady Ainsley muttered somethingunder her breath.Then suddenly, she droppedoffthe wall, disappearing ontheotherside.</p><p>\"What took youso bloody long? \" he heard her snap on the other side of the wall.</p><p>\"Long? \" a man cried. \"Why, I nearly ranthrough that there house, then hustledSkullystraight onoverhere. I only left you buta moment ago.\"</p><p>Her response tothatwas cut off and muffled by the slam of a carriage door; then Daniel heard the conveyance jangle away down the street.</p><p>He stayed where he was long after the carriage had rolled away, his mindreplayingthe incident and certain things that had been said.I could climb this damn thing ifI just hadmy breeches on and notthesehorrid skirts.</p><p>Ah, but then youmight be mistaken for aman.</p><p>Nay, he thoughtuncertainly.It couldnot be ... But she had been wearing bootsandsomething else beneath her skirts. And she had said mybreeches. Still, what did all this mean?</p><p>\"Daniel!\"</p><p>Recognizinghis mother's voice, Daniel peered back towardthe bushes he had walked through to reach the wall. He started quicklybackthroughthem, stepping out into the garden to see his mother standing on the balcony, glaring impatiently out intothe darkness.</p><p>\"Oh, there youare, Daniel.\" She sighed as she spotted him.</p><p>\"Lord Beechamsaid he saw you out here.Whatever were you doing in those bushes? The party isinside.\"</p><p>\"Whichis perhaps why I am outside, \"Daniel muttered, jogging up the lastfew stepsto join her.</p><p>\"Oh, really, \" she muttered with exasperation, turning her cheek up for his dutiful kiss.Once that was outof theway, shestepped back toeyehim.\"Did you see Master Whister today? \"</p><p>\"You knowI did, \" he answered.</p><p>\"And? \"</p><p>\"And what? Do nottry to pretend you did not know the codicil to Gran's will. She told you everything. No doubt you have known about it for some time.\"</p><p>The womanhad the grace notto denyit. Instead, sheasked, \"I am arranging severalsmallsoireesinthenextlittle while. One for tomorrow night even. Is there anyone in particular you would like me to invite? \"</p><p>He knew what that meant; Daniel, now that you know you have tomarrytoinherit your dear grand-mama's money, I am arranging a party to parade available femalesby you. Is there anyone youprefer?</p><p>\"Nay.\"</p><p>His motherblinked. \"Well, then, I shall just do my best.\"</p><p>Translation, he thought dryly: Every available female in England shallbe invited.</p><p>\"Do not bother; I willbe unableto attend, \" he began. Suddenly he paused. \"On second thought, I do have someone I wish invited.\"</p><p>His mother's expression, which had begun toturn downwith displeasure, abruptlylightened.\"Yes, dear? \"</p><p>\"Lady Ainsley.\"</p><p>Her face fell with displeasure again. \"Not that woman! Oh, Daniel, youcannot beinterestedinher! She is the talk of the ball.</p><p>My God, herface felloff in Lady Beecham's wine. Andher uncle is an absolute horror. Completely barbaric, from what I have heard. He - \"</p><p>\"She hadan unfortunate experience with some bad makeup, Mother.It wasnot her fault, and she was humiliated byit.\" He somehow doubtedthat the ladyin question had reallyfelt much more thana touch of embarrassment - amazing, considering that thesituation would havecrushed most young women attending a soiree - but his mother need notknowthat. \"As to her uncle, she canhardlybe heldaccountableforhis behavior. If you wish me to attendyour party, you will invite Lady Ainsley. Otherwise I shall be quite unavailable. For the foreseeable future, I shall attend only balls that sheis attending.\"</p><p>His lady mother's mouth dropped open, her eyes wideas she gazed onhim. Then she fairly beamed at him. \"Oh, Daniel! Of course, Ishall invite the dear girl then.\"</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\"You were a success!\"</p><p>Valoree paused halfway downthestairsto peer at One-Eye warily. He closed the frontdoor, waved a small pieceof paperat her, then snatched up a small stack of four or five more and hurried toward her.</p><p>\"See! Invites, allof them. Soirees, balls, the lot, \" he announced with glee, waving the invitations under her nose. \"See, there weren't nothing to worry about. I knew ye'ddo just fine.\"</p><p>\"Do just fineat what? \" Henryasked, catchingthe tail end of One-Eye'scomment as he came down the stairs behind Valoree.</p><p>\"At beingalady, \" One-Eye explained, grinning widely as he flashed theinvitations atthe older man. \"Invites. Five of them.</p><p>Shemusthavedone usproud last night. She's been invited to more ballsand such.\"</p><p>\"Pity invitations, \" Valoree muttered, pushing the papers he heldout of her facewith disgust and continuingpasthim down the stairs.</p><p>Quick to speak up, Henry followedher with One-Eye on his heels. \"Oh, now, I don't think them nobles we met last night wouldsend invites totheir sworingsout of pity.\"</p><p>\"Soirees, \"Valoreecorrectedautomatically asshe crossedthe hall. \"But aye. Mayhapyou are right. Mayhap they invited me for the entertainment value!\"</p><p>\"Entertainment? \" One-Eye asked, moving to Henry's side as they followed her into the small morning room.</p><p>Valoree had refused to discuss the evening's debacle oncethey hadreturned home last night. She had simplystridden upstairs and straight to her room, rolling her eyes asshe'd heard Henry telling the others thatallhadgone \"well enough.\" So much for the man's leading her to believe that they would give the sorry taskup.</p><p>Now she ignored One-Eye's questions to glare at Meg. The older woman was already seated at the table, and she looked pretty brightand chipper for someonewhohad drunk herself into unconsciousnessthenight before.Her aunt merely smiled blandly back.</p><p>Peteyentered thenwith a rack of fresh loavesof bread, still steaming, and Valoree's attention turned to herrumblingstomach.</p><p>Noddingto the dark-haired, solemn man, she moved toward him as he set the bread on the table.</p><p>\"Oh, come now.It weren't that bad, \" Henry soothed. \"Yedid real finefor yer first night out.\"</p><p>\"Realfine? \" Forgetting food briefly, Valoree spunon himin fury. \"Real fine? A great chunk of my face fell off into the hostess's glass! You call that fine? \"</p><p>\"What? \" Meg gasped with horror.</p><p>\"Her makeup, \"Henryexplained quickly, thenglared at Petey.</p><p>\"It dried, cracked, andfelloff her face. She left a trail of face flakes from one endof Beecham's ballroom to the other.\"</p><p>.\"What are you looking at me for? \" Petey asked, eyes narrowing.\"Ihad nothing todo with it.\"</p><p>\"Nothing to dowithit? \" Henry sputtered. \"You madethe muck up!\"</p><p>\"I didn't make nothing up!\" Petey snapped back, drawing himself up proudly. \"Whatdo youtake me for? I don't know how tomake that mucknoblewomen put ontheir face. I cook.\"</p><p>Henry scowled. \"I sent One-Eye down to have you make something up for herto wear onher face.\"</p><p>\"And I set asidethe cake I wasmaking and wentdown tothe docks to see if I could find someplace to buy some proper makeup, \" the man snapped impatiently. \"I wasted two hours searching for some, and when I come back, what do I find? You're gone, my cake batteris gone, my raspberries are gone - \"</p><p>\"Anna!\" Valoree interrupted, turning to glare at both Henry and One-Eye. \"Itold you it tasted sweet when you gotsome on my lips.\"</p><p>\"Aye, that you did, \" Henry muttered. He turned to glare at One-Eye. Theman raised his hands helplessly.</p><p>\"How was I to know itwas cake batter? You said to go down andsee what Petey hadwhippedup to puton the captain'sface. I went down. Peteywasn'taround, andthere it was. Whitegooey stuff. Itlooked likeit could have been makeupto me.\"</p><p>\"Let meget this straight, \" Meginterrupted quietly from her place at the table. \"You took LadyValoree toa soiree with cake batter on herface? \"</p><p>\"Andraspberries smooshed into my cheeks and on my lips, \"</p><p>Valoreeaddedwithdisgust.</p><p>\"Raspberries? \"Meg stared at Henry with dismay. He shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>\"Well, it worked. Her facewas white - \"</p><p>\"Until it fell off, \" Valoree snapped.</p><p>Ignoringher, Henry continued.\"Andherlips and cheeks was redlike all the rest of them ladiesattheswarming.\"</p><p>\"All the rest of the ladies at the soiree didn't have people picking raspberryseedsofftheir cheeksallnight long, \" Valoree snapped.</p><p>\"Oh, dear.\" Megsank back into her seat, her face dropping weakly into one open hand.</p><p>Valoree wasgratified bythis displayof horror untilshe noticed the way the other woman's shoulders were shaking. She was laughing! \"It wasnot funny!\" she said in asnarl.</p><p>\"Nay, ofcourse not, \" Meg said at once, though the words came out with afew chortles.\"Itis notfunny atall, \" she agreed again, trying for solemnity andfailing desperatelyas a chuckle began to rumble from her belly upward. \"Oh d-dear.\" She gasped apologetically, fightingvaliantly to keep thelaughter in, butthe moment she lookedatValoree, it exploded out of hermouthon a hiccupof sound that quickly grew into a full-blown laugh. \"Oh m-my!

Megshook her head, amusement twinkling in her eyes briefly before she sobered again and ordered, \"You'dbest fetchsomeof that gold, Henry. We shall needit.\"She sailedthrough the door then, adding, \"Comealong, Valoree. The bread will still be there whenwe return.\"</p><p>\"Notbloodylikely with Bull and One-Eye around, \" Valoree muttered, snatching upthe biggest loaf, and a good-sized hunk of cheese, before following thewoman. Asshe passed afrowning Henry, she said sweetly, \"Ye'd best befetchingsomeof that there gold, Henry.Or have ye changed yer mind and decided wecan return tothesea, after all? \"</p><p>The last part was more a hope than anything else. Valoree would havedearlyloved togiveupthis humiliating venture and returnto their liveson thesea, butshekneweven as she voiced the words that none of the men was likelyto give up yet. She figured she hada great deal more humiliationleft to sufferbefore they wouldcallit quits. Andwhy not? They weren't the ones having to suffer.</p><p>\"Whichdo youlike best, Valoree? \"</p> <p>Sighing, Valoree peered at the small pots of red color and frowned. She did not havemuch patience at the best of times, and thislittle expeditionseemedto be evaporating what tiny bit she did have ratherquickly. They were supposed tohave comein searchof makeup.Andthey were... now. Finally. But they had left the town house several hours ago.</p><p>First, \"AuntMeg\" had insisted onastop atthe tailor's to see about those dresses Henry had gone to order. Despite her irritation, Valoree hadto admit that at least that had proved to be an intelligent move. The little land-rat had horrible taste, andthe dresses he had decided on for her had all been atrocious. They werefrilly, fluffy, busy littledressesthathad made Valoree curse a blue streak when she saw the designs.He apparently didn't realize she was not afrilly, fluffy sort of woman. The tailor was an idiot. She had told himsoas she hadrippedup the designs he had made, then spent a grimhourhanging over his shoulder and directed him in sketching more acceptable gowns, slapping himin thehead orbellowingin his earevery time he hadtriedto sneak in aruffle or frill.</p><p>They had all - Meg, Valoree, and the tailor - been relieved when thatwas over. But then Valoreehad climbed out of the carriage at the next stop to find they were at a perfumery.</p><p>Enteringthe smelly placehad given her an immediate headache, one that had stayedwith herthroughout the hour of sniffing and sampling Meg forced on her. The woman favored flowery odors, forever shoving them under Valoree's beleaguered nose until she'd finallyorderedHenry to buy one of them forMeg to get her toleave off.</p><p>The woman had fairly beamed at the gift, though Henry had been less than pleased. Still, they had both left her alone to choose her own fragrance then. She had made her choice relatively quickly, picking one that reminded her of tropical breezes andthe smell of the ship's holdafter they took a galleon rich inspices. Meg had looked doubtful ather choice, but Henry hadproclaimed it nectar and paid for it alittle more happilythan hehad Meg's.</p><p>Now here they were, finallyat themakeupshop. But thispart of the expedition wasgoing nofasterthantherest of the trip.</p> <p>They had spenthalf anhour just choosing a foundation, the white base thatwas spread over a woman's face, neck, and bosom to hide skin problemsor scars from thepox. And while Valoreedid nothaveeither of thoseproblems, due to her yearsof sea and sun she had a slighttan - despite the captain's hatshe alwayswore.</p><p>And tans simply were not the thing at court. Ladieswere tohave lily white skin androugedcheeksand lips.</p><p>A foundation madeof white leadandvinegarhadbeen what the shopkeeper obviously favored, but Valoree had refused to even consider it, no matter how many times he insisteditwasthe best. She hadheardthat the concoction made the skinshrivel and turngray. When he hadfinallygiven up on tryingto sell her that, heturnedto a longdescription of the other offerings he had; pastes made up of alum andtin ash, others featuring sulfur. She had chosen onewith an egg white-and-talc base and stood firm on itdespite his effortsto steer her back to the lead and vinegar.</p><p>Now they had moved on to thefucus, as he kept calling it - a most unattractivename for the variety of red face paints that were used on both the cheeks and lips. Once again he was insisting on describing their contents. There were madder-, cochineal-, and ocher-based compounds among them, but vermilion, made up of mercuric sulfide, was the one he kept drawing theirattention to.</p><p>Valoree groaned. There were still kohl and concoctions to brightentheeyes to get through yet. Also, Valoree seemed to recall Meg muttering something about a wig. She envisioned hoursofthis nonsense ahead, and, frankly, she had already had morethan enough. It was nearly the nooning hourandshe was dyingofthirst. She hadn't had anything to drink since the night before, and the fact thatshe had eatenthe whole loaf of bread as well as the chunk of cheese in the carriage, polishingoffa good portionofeach on the way from the town house, thenfinishing them betweenshops, didn't help.</p><p>\"Well? Do anyof themappeal to you? \"Meg asked.</p><p>Sighing, Valoree focused on the paintpots again, then shook herhead. \"I donot care.\"</p><p>\"Of course youdo, dear. You - \"</p> <p>\"Nay. I don't, \" Valoree assured the woman grimly. \"I am hungryand - \"</p><p>\"How canyou be hungry? \" Henry asked peevishly.\"You ate that whole loaf of bread yerself.\"</p><p>Valoree's mouth began to twitch at theresentmentintheold man's voice. She had been aware of his hungry-eyedglancesat her loaf and cheese, but had ignoredthem, still irritated that he'd reneged on his claim last night that they wouldgive up this fool's errand of trying tofinda husband.</p><p>Forcing heramusement aside, Valoree shrugged. \"Well, I am.</p><p>AndIam also thirsty. Ihave not had a droptodrink since last night.So thetwo of you can make the choices, \" she announced, turning toward thedoor. \"Iam in searchof... refreshment.\" She said the word dryly as she walked out of the shop, knowing Henry wouldgather her true meaning.She wanted a damn drink.</p><p>A realdrink. Rum, or whiskey, or - \"Ah, Lady Ainsley.What asurprise.\"</p><p>Valoree gasped and stepped to theside to avoid collidingwith Lord Thurborne as the man suddenly appearedbeforeher, but she did not slowher step. Shewas too damned thirsty to be bothered withthe irritating nobleman. Rather than leavingher to herown devices, the pestfell quickly into step beside her.</p><p>\"I see I caught you without your blade again, \" he saidlightly, reminding her ofher lastcomment the night before.She hadbeen frustratedto find the knife missing whenshe had finally gained the wall, but ithadonly been knocked off to landon theother side. She had snatched it up on her wayto the carriage.</p><p>\"Aye. More's the pity, \"she muttered now.</p><p>'Then I suppose I am safe, \" he teased.Then, before she could comment, he asked, \"Where is it we are headed exactly? \"</p><p>\"Iam headed fora tav - \" Catching herself, she cleared her throatand tried for a less irritated and moreladylike answer.\"I am searching foran establishment in which Imightpartake of refreshment.\"</p><p>\"Alone? \"</p><p>Valoree rolled her eyesatthequestion. She had been doing things alone since she was eleven. Disguised asa boy, mindyou, but alone nonetheless. Ladies, of course, would not take refreshment unescorted - especiallyin this lessthan idealpart of town.Damn! The rickety littleshop that Meg haddirected them to was in an area that had once been quite upmarket and expensive, butthat was years earlier. Now the buildings were crumbling and the shops were gradually moving out, a less pleasantelement moving in.</p><p>\"I am not alone, \" she told him grimly.\"My aunt anduncleare in the shopIjust left, and my men...servants... manservants...</p><p>are right there.\"She glanced toward theircarriage as she gestured to it, thenpaused, for while Skully still satupon thedriver's seat, One-Eye was nolonger onthefootman's stand.</p><p>A movement out of the cornerof her eye drew her attention to the manstanding a step or two behind Lord Thurborne.It was One-Eye, and he had a solemn expression on his face as he attemptedtolook the part of a footman. Impossible, of course, despite the pink livery he wore. The pink merely seemed to emphasize his long, shaggyblack hair, his eyepatch, andthe fact that he was armedto the teeth.Two flintlock pistols stuck out of his pants, his cutlasshung sharp andwicked at hisside, and a leatherstrap hehad fashioned yearsago hadbeen slungover his head and hung from one shoulder blade to his waist on the opposite side.It waspacked full of blades, all in varying sizes and shapes. He lookedlike what he was:a pirate who was deadly withknives. But that didn't alarmValoree nearly as muchasthe factthat he had come downoff of his perch on the carriage to follow her. As if she needed protecting like any other lady! Fear rippledthrough her atthe damage that wasbeingdone to her image as a strong and capable captain. None of the men would have considered her inneed of protecting prior to this nonsense. None of them but Henry had even known shewas a woman before they'd arrived in London! Until thenthey had all stillsupposedher tobe Jeremy's younger brother, about to claim hisestates andthetitle of lord.</p><p>\"My lady? \"</p><p>Valoree glanced at Thurbornebriefly, herbreath comingout on a small sigh. \"I am sorry, my lord. Wait here a moment, please, \"</p><p>she ordered. Then steppingpast him, she caught One-Eyebythe arm and jerked him aroundto lead him back to the carriage.</p><p>\"What do you think ye're doing? I don't need protecting, One-Eye, I may be wearin' a dress, but that don't mean I'm suddenly helpless. I - \"</p><p>\"Iknow that.\"</p><p>His sharpwordssilencedher as she paused bythe carriage, and she facedhim questioningly.</p><p>\"Well, \" he explained, \"Iseen a lot of ladiesout andabout since we got here, andnone of 'emseems to go anywhere without an older lady or aservantfollowingher about like a pup. So when ye came out o'the shop without Meg orHenry, I thought I'd best follow ye ... For appearance' sake.\"</p><p>\"I see.\" She sighed, relief and gratitude overwhelming her brieflyso that she had to turn her head awayin alarm tohidethe moisture that suddenly dampened her eyes.What the devil was going on here? she wondered with dismay. She hadn't cried since Jeremy's death, yet hereshewas getting all watery just because One-Eye didn't see her as helpless. Brilliant! If this wasaside effect of wearing a damn dress, she'd never put one on again once she finished this business.</p><p>Taking a deep, calming breath, Valoree blinked her eyes rapidly until mostof themoisture was dispersed, assuring herself that there was nothing to get upset about here. One-Eye was following her around for appearance' sake, not because he suddenlysawher as a weak woman.Her title as captain wasstill safe. She hesitated toexamine why that should relieve her so, except thather ship and crewwere all she really had in the world right now, and maybe all sheeverwould have, unless shefound a husband and had achild to claimher homeagain.</p><p>Clearingher throat, she turnedback to One-Eye. \"Well, now I haveLord Thurborne toescort me. You should remain here. But take offthose damnweapons.\"</p><p>\"Take'em off? \" he cried.</p><p>\"Aye. This is London, not the high seas. You just make yourselflook like a silly pinkpirate withthem. Take 'em off and stick themunder the driver's seat or something.\"</p><p>\"All of 'em? \"</p><p>Valoree wasabout to say \"aye, all of them, \" when she caught thepanic inhis eyes. The expression made her think for thefirst timethatshe mightnot be theonly one feeling like afish out of water, sufferingthe insecurity of new roles and such. No doubt going from a swaggeringswashbuckler to a pink-clad footman was a difficult transition to make. Sighing, she shook her head.</p><p>\"One pistolandtwo of the smallerblades you can keep, but stick 'em in the top of your breeches and close yourcoat over them.\" Shegesturedto the pinklivery jacket he had left undone, and pushed backthe sides to reveal thewhite top and weapons beneath. \"Justput the others somewhere out ofsight, butcloseat hand.\"</p><p>\"Aye, Captain, \" hesaid, apparently relieved.</p><p>\"Good .. . And tieyour hair back, \" she instructed.</p><p>One-Eye's handwent tohis long black locks in alarm. Valoree sighed. \"Only when you are out and about as a footman. Of course, youmay wearit as you liketherest of the time.\"</p><p>Sighing, he nodded reluctantly, and Valoree grimaced sympathetically, then glanced toward the man now stepping down from the carriage to join them. Her eyebrows rose. His namewas No-Nose, which came from the fact thathe had no nose, of course. Well, not really muchofa nose anyway.It had been shot off long ago whilehe wasa merchant seaman. The ship he had ridden withhadbeen under attack bySpanish piratesat thetime. Once he had healed, he had returned to his ship, butits captain had told him he wasn't needed anymore.

All they had caredabout was that he knew his businessand did it well. Yetshe wished he hadn'tbeen the one driving today. She hadn't really paidattention towho was driving, simply assuming it was Skully. Now she wished hewere Skully. She didn't care aboutthe man's nose so much, but she did care that he had long hair. It was a limp, greasy brown, and he too was armedtothe teeth - his rotten, half-missing teeth. His presence brought a scowl to herface. \"What thehell are you doing here?

I expect my orders tobe carried out. If they aren't...\"</p><p>She let thesentencefade away, a mean lookonher face. There was no need tofinish the threat. All her crewknewwhat would happen if they shoulddisobeyan order ... Something bad.</p><p>Chin lifting, Valoreewhirled away, actuallyenjoying the way her skirts flew out around her, imagining that it must look impressive as shestrodegrimly back to whereLord Thurborne patiently waited.</p><p>\"Come on, Ineed a drink, \" she said with a grunt, catching his arm anddragging himalong theroad awaysbefore tryingto pull him intoa tavern. She got him to the doorbeforehe balked.</p> <p>\"Just a moment.\"</p><p>Turning at his hesitation, she eyed him impatiently. \"What? \"</p><p>\"Well...\"Heglanced upat the sign over thedoor unhappily.</p><p>\"Thisis a rather rough establishment for a lady. I do notthink - \"</p><p>\"Can you not protect me? \" she asked withfeigned surprise. He stiffened.</p><p>\"Aye, ofcourse I can, but - \"</p><p>\"Good.\" Whirling away, she hurried inside, leaving him to follow ornot as hewished.</p><p>Thenoise from the tavern washed overher likethunder as she opened the door, but was a very brief thunder. Her entrance seemed tobe notedbyeveryone rather quickly, and an ominous silence abruptly fell.Ignoring theirmute stares, Valoreewove her way calmly throughthe sea of sailors, ne'er-do-wells, and doxies, tothebar. Pausing there, she waited patiently as the barkeep hesitated, then made hisway to her.</p> <p>He eyed her uncertainly. \"Is there something I can help ye with, m'lady? \" he askeddoubtfully.</p><p>\"Youcan poorme a whiskey, \"she answered calmly, sighing when the bartender'seyebrows rose. He glanced over her headat someone behind her.Undoubtedlythat someone was Thurborne.</p><p>Forcing what shehoped was asweet smile to her lips, sheturned and flashed itat the man, then murmured, \"Whiskey settlesmy stomach, andI am feelinga touch nauseous just now.\"</p><p>Both the noblemanand the bartender continuedto stare at her rather blankly, and Valoree's frayed patience was stretched a littlefurther. Eyes narrowing, she turned back to the barkeep.</p><p>\"Isaid, it settles my stomach. Ye wouldn't want me to bepukin' on yer lovely barnow, would ye? \"</p><p>That got a better response. A look of horror overtaking his face, theman snatched a mug from under the counter, slammed it on top, and produced a bottle from seemingly nowhere. He pouredout some golden liquid into it.</p><p>\"Thank you, \" she said with amusement, liftingthe glassto her lipsas Daniel gave his own order - ale, ofcourse. Probably for the best, she decided. They didn't serve stuff like she was drinking in theplaceshe likelywent. This whiskey was thekind Petey could soakhis pots in andnever have toscour to get them clean.Onecould even drink theused whiskey afterward, and it wouldn't taste any different. Yes, sir, this was the good stuff.</p><p>Swallowing therest of the liquid down, she slammed her mug onto the counter, a message to thekeeperthatshe wasready for more.The minute hehad refilled it, she moved to the nearest tablewithan open spot and settled herself on the end of the bench. Sheneededto drink and try to relax. Danielfollowed and settled acrossfrom her almost at once, glancingaround warily as the other patrons slowly began to speak again - about her, no doubt. They didn'tlike what they thought wasa ladyinvading their territory. Didn't like it at all. That becamerather obviousin ahurry.</p><p>\"Mayhap we should find another place to - \"</p><p>\"Nay, it'sfine here. Just ignore them, \" she advised, but the approach of oneof thesailorsmadeignoring impossible. He was abig gawkyScot. The man was asbigas Bull, with hair asred as Valoree'sandawicked grinthat almost distracted her fromthe factthat hewas missingone ear andhad a scar in its place that randown tohis chin.</p><p>\"Hello, lovey, \" washis opening line, and Valoree arched an eyebrowathim.</p><p>\"Is there something I canhelp you with? \" she asked, suddenly aware of the way Danielwas tensing across from her.</p><p>\"Actually, lovey, I was abouttoask ye theverysame thing.\"</p><p>He grinned suggestively.\"Mayhap alittle male companionship.\"</p><p>\"She already has an escort, \" Lord Thurborne said sharply, bristling all over.</p><p>\"Does she now? \" The bigScot glanced at him with amusement.</p><p>\"Well, it wasn'tescorting I was thinking ofoffering.\"</p><p>Muchto Valoree's surprise, Danielwas on his feet beforethe mancould finish turning backtoface her.Grabbing him bythe shoulder, Daniel wheeled the biglugback around, and coldly glaredathim.\"Isaidshe hasan es - \"</p><p>That was asfaras he got, of course. Thiswasn't the type of place where men \"discussed\" their differences. The Scot was on him at once, slammingafist into his jawmidword, sending him stumbling backward. Valoree sighed, thinking she would have to give up herrelaxing drink andinterveneon Daniel's behalf. It seemed she wouldfindno peacetoday.. . anywhere.</p><p>But before she could move, he hadregained himself and come back at theman, fists flying. Valoree was impressed. TheScot wasn't much taller than Thurborne, but he carried twice his bulk, and had armsasbig aroundasher thighsand fists like pots. But Daniel was thebetter fighter, apparently - and a dirty one, too, she realized with a grin amoment later as hesuddenly kickedthe other man.</p><p>The Scot howled anoteinsoprano, his hands suddenlyglued to his groin. He tumbled sideways to moan and writhe on the ground.</p><p>Straightening his cuffs, Daniel eyed the Scot for a moment, then turned a hard-eyed lookon Valoree. \"If you have finished your refreshment, mayhap we could get out of this establishment.\"</p><p>\"Well, now, \" she said withamusement.\"As ithappens, I am notquite finished. Besides, it appears you'vemade some friends.\"</p><p>\"Friends? \" He gaveher an angry look.</p><p>\"Aye. And itappearsthey'dlike ye to stayand play.\"</p><p>Understanding dawning in his eyes, Danielwhirledjust intime to see the fist that came flying athim. Hetried to avoid it, and while he didn't succeed entirely, he did manage to avoid the worst of the blows. It seemed the Scot had friends - three of them - and theywere moving in on him. Sighing, Daniel spread hisfeet slightly and prepared to do battle.</p><p>Gulping down the last of her whiskey, Valoree stood and moved around the fighters to reach the bar again. Settingthe mug down for the barkeep to refill, she kepther gaze fixed on Daniel and his new friends as the real fighting began. She wasn'treally worriedabout him, despite the odds.If he could handlethe Scot, he could handle those three ... four . .. five ... Now, six was getting a bit unfair, she decided irritably.</p><p>Grabbing herrefilledmug in one hand, shesnatched the now empty whiskey bottle from the barkeep with her other, and started backto the table. She paused along the way to smashthe bottle over thehead of thenearest of the six men. He felllike a stone, crumplingto the wooden floor behind her asshe continued on to the table.</p><p>Sipping herdrink, she watched the remainder of thefightwith interest.Daniel wasfaston his feet. He wasalso, she sawwith delight, using every dirty trick in the book. There werenofancy fisticuffs here. He was pulling hair, gouging eyes, kneeing, punching, andkickinggroins. She couldn't have been prouder had hebeenone of herown men.</p><p>A tap on her shouldermadeher glance around to find herself staring at Richard andScratchy. \"What the devil are the two of you doing here? \" she snapped irritably, then glared ather second mate. \"Richard, I leftyou in chargeof the ship. What - \"</p><p>\"Skully came back to relieve me. He saidHenryhad sent him togive me some time off, too.\"</p><p>\"Oh.\" Sighing, Valoree glanced back at the fight, trying to shrug off the guilt that was suddenly plaguing her for notthinking herself ofgivingtheman time off. \"Well, behave yourselves.\"</p><p>The two menmuttered acquiescencetothat, then were silent for a moment, watching the fight with her.</p><p>\"He's pretty good, \" Richard commented after a moment as Danieltossed one of the menover his shoulder andonto anearby table. \"Is he'him'? \"</p><p>\"Him who? \"Valoree asked distractedly.</p><p>\"The one what ye're gonna marry, \" Richard clarified, bringing herheadsnapping around.</p><p>She glared at himbriefly, then snapped, \"Nay.\"</p><p>\"Why not? \"</p><p>\"Why not? \" she repeated in amazement. Because he was definitely not thesort to allowher tobe incharge; she couldtell justby looking at him. But insteadshe said, \"Well, for onething, hehasn't asked.\"</p><p>\"Hmmm.\" Richard pursed his lips and eyed Thurborne consideringly. \"Goodfighter.\"</p><p>\"Not bad, \" Scratchy agreed, pluckingout asilverofwood that washalf sticking out of the rough wooden table and using it to pick histeeth as heconsidered thecontinuingfight. \"Knows how tohandle hisself.\"</p><p>\"Hmmm.\"They were allsilent for a moment; then Richard muttered, \"Don't suppose weshould help'im out abit? Justin case it turnsout he's thinking of asking? \"</p><p>\"He doesn't need help, \" Valoree snapped. \"He's doing fine.</p><p>Besides, you know I don't like you men fighting when you're on shore.\" She winced as oneof the men landed aratherbrutal blow that seemedto stun Thurborne fora moment, allowing several more blows before he could stop them. The Scot chose that moment torecover from his own injury. Climbingback to his feet, he released a furious roar and charged Daniel. The two men crashed onto a far table, grappling together. Now thattheScot was backin the battle, several more mensuddenlyfound their courage and decided to join the fight as well. Once the odds reached nineto one, Richard couldn'tkeepsilent any longer.</p><p>\"Hemay notneedhelp. Allthesame - \"</p><p>\"Oh, go ahead.\"Valoreesighed, hidingherreliefas Scratchy and Richard rushed forward, launchingthemselves into the fray.</p><p>Thurborne had done allright for himself, but he was growing tired and could use the help.</p><p>\"What do you thinkyou are doing? \"</p><p>Valoree glanced around with a start at that sharp tone, relaxing somewhat whenshe saw Meg and Henry standing behind her.</p><p>\"Oh, it's you. Done, are you? \"</p><p>\"We finishedseveral moments ago, \" Megtold her grimly. \"And have been searchingfor youeversince.\"</p><p>\"Well, all you hadto do was askOne-Eye. He must have seen me comeinhere.\"</p><p>\"One-Eye didnotsee you come in here, \" Meg informed her grimly.\"Heclaims you ordered him andthat poor gentlemanwith no nose to remove their weapons and tie up their hair, then disappeared. Hesaid that by the time they had finished these tasks and glanced around, you weregone.\"</p><p>\"Oh. Well.\" Valoree gave an unconcernedshrug atthe news.</p><p>\"Youfound me in the end, and that's all that matters, I suppose.\"</p><p>\"All thatmatters? \" Meg repeated withdismay. \"What matters isthat you are presently sitting ina ... a ... What are you doingin here? \"</p><p>Valoree blinked in surprise at the razor-sharp edge to the woman's voice. She shifted uncomfortably. \"I'mjust watching a fight, \" she answeredquietly, reaching for hermugto take asmall drink.Her hand was about toclose aroundthecup when Meg slapped it. Snatching the cup, the woman raised itto hernose and sniffed the contents.</p><p>\"Whiskey? \" She exclaimed in horror.</p><p>\"Aye.Do ye want some? \" Valoree glancedtowardthe bar to wavethebarkeep over, only to cry out inshock as pain shot throughher head. Meghad grabbedher ear andtwisted it.Even now, shewasusing it to force Valoreeto her feet. Followingthe pull to avoid further pain, Valoree found herselfdragged back out ontothestreet before she wasreleased. Eyesspittingfire, she whirled onthe old ex-prostitute, then reached automatically for her cutlass, only tofind it missing.Withlittle elseto use against her enemy at the moment but words, Valoree sucked in her breath, ready to bawl her out, only to find her mouth snapping shut in surprise asHenry grabbed her arm and whirled her around in the direction of thecarriage.</p><p>\"If you were my daughter instead of my captain, I'dtake you overmykneeand whupye, \" he snapped. \"Me? \"Valoree cried in amazement.\"But she - \"</p><p>\"She did exactly as an aunt would be expected to do to a brainlesswhelp who doesn't havethe sensetotend toher own reputation.\"</p><p>\"You were in a tavern.

'This has nothing to do with being a woman.This has to dowithbeing anoble. You are a member of nobility, girl. Orhave you gone so far that you've forgotten that? 'Cause your brother never did.

Not just hot, but burning. It also itched something fierce.The discomforthad startedshortlyafter Meg hadfinished putting that glop they hadbought today on her face.</p> <p>Valoree had beendoingher bestto ignore the fiery itch for what seemed likehours, butreally shewasbeginningto think it would drive her mad - if all the fawning women around her did not manage tofirst.</p><p>The Thurborne ball was certainly a different beast than the Beechamparty had been. Theirhostess, Lady Thurborne herself, hadgreeted them upon their arrival, been most gracious, then taken it uponherself to introduce themaround. There were no snickers behind fans or gloved hands, nor malicious messages being sent from cold eyes.Everybodyhad been most pleasant.</p><p>Valoree wouldhave liked to have believed that itwas because Megwas doing allthe talking and that theolderwoman, much to heramazement, carried herself, looked, andsounded exactlyas a lady should.</p><p>Truly, her performance was impressive. She carried each conversation withapparentease and grace, leaving Valoree and Henry to smileand nod politely. Butthat explanation just didn't wash. These people were up to something, Valoree decided grimly. There was noother explanationfor theway thewomen had suddenlycrowded around her, cooing and pleadingthat she attend this ballorthat dinner.They werefawning overher asif she were royalty, and it was making Valoree nervous.</p><p>Her gaze slid to Henry, andshe saw the same suspicion she felt reflected inhis eyes. He, too, had noticed the difference. No doubthe had also noticed that, while they were presently the center of anevergrowing circle ofpeople vying for her attention, there was not a single man among them.. .. Well, except for Thurbornehimself, but Valoree didn't really counthim. She had already ticked him off her list of possible husbands, so his presence was easily discounted.</p><p>Nodding politely in response toyetanother younggirl's plea thatsheattendsome functionor other, Valoree turned her face awayfromthegrowingcrowd. Annoyed, she dabbed at thesmall bead of sweat that was trickling down the side of her face.</p> <p>Despitethe crowds and theheat in the room ofso manybodies together, Valoree wasn't really hot enough to be sweating. At least not fromthe neckdown, but that stupid wig that Meg had insisted she wearwas irritating her scalp something fierce. Since she'd arrived, sweat had begun gathering at her hairline and trailing down her face. Valoree kept discreetly dabbing at it, trying to minimizethe damageto her makeup, but really, all she could think wasthat this was all terribly uncomfortable and a blasted waste oftime.</p><p>Why, she wondered, wasshe allowing herself to sufferthrough this when every single man but Thurborne was keeping himselfat a safe distance? Watching the frufarau curiously, but not approaching? Valoree could almost have believed she was wearing her shirt and breeches, and that the women all thought her a man, by the way they were gatheringaroundher. Except that She had never been this uncomfortable in herregular clothes.</p><p>\"Would you care to dance? \"</p><p>Valoree gavea start and glanced over to see Daniel Thurborne.</p><p>The man had a small bruise on his left cheek, but otherwise looked none the worse for wear. \"Nay. I do not dance, \" she answered irritably, then gaspedin surpriseas he suddenly took herarm andturnedher away toward the dancingcouples.</p><p>\"Comenow, you shall have to come up with a betterexcuse than that, \" he chidedgently as heled herunwillinglyforward.</p><p>\"Everyoneknowshow todance.\"</p><p>\"Aye, well, Idonot, \" Valoree insisted, giving a uselesstug on herarm.</p> <p>\"Then I shall be pleased to teach you, \" hemurmured sweetly, pausing to drawher around to face him and settling thehand he held onto his shoulder, even as he snatchedup her otherin his own and setout to dance.</p><p>Her handsmoved with him;her arms did too, but Valoree's feet stayed plantedfirmlywhere they had settled, her legs bracing automatically againsthispull as if she were astride the Valor's, deck during rough seas. Startled, Daniel halted abruptly and peered down at her feet, then up at her face.</p><p>\"You really do not know how, do you? \" he asked quietly.</p><p>Encouraged by somethingin his eyes, Valoree sighed and shook her head. His gaze drifted briefly; then he straightened his shouldersand nodded.\"Then I shall teach you. Now, you just - \"</p><p>\"I really do not think that would be a good idea, \" Valoree interrupted, turning awayto head right back towardwhere Henry and Meg still stood surrounded by women. She came to a dismayedpause, however, upon seeing that every single personin the grouptheyhad just left seemed to be watchingher. There was nothing like a littlepressure to make thingseasier.</p><p>\"Well, I think itwould be a verygood idea, \" Thurborne argued, taking advantageof her pause to draw her back around to face him. \"After all, it will be very difficultto find yourselfa husband if you donothave the proper skills, \" he argued.Ashe did, he replaced her hand at his shoulder andtook the other up in his own again.</p><p>\"What makes you thinkIam lookingfora husband? \" Valoree askedsharply.</p><p>\"Isthat not every woman'saim? \" he asked with amusement.</p><p>Then, seeing that she was not amused, and neither was sheabout tolet the question go, hesighedand admitted, \"All right, Whister told me the first time you andI metathis office.\"</p><p>\"Whister, \" shemuttered disgustedly. \"If he is notcareful, he willfindhimselfwithout histongue.\"</p><p>Daniel bithis lip in amusement atherdisgruntled words, then nodded, indicating thatshe should peerdown.\"Watch my feet; you are going tofollow me.\"</p><p>\"Follow youwhere? \" Valoree asked suspiciously.</p><p>\"In thedance. Youwill followmy steps. It is easy. The same steps are repeated over and over. Watch.\" He stepped back, waiting patiently for herto follow, thenstepped to the side. She followed and he stepped tothesideagain. \"Youshould not be too upset with Whister, \" he said afterhe had led her slowlythrough the routine twice. \"He onlytold me becauseI am in muchthe same situation.\"</p><p>Her eyes met his.\"What situation? \"</p><p>\"Imustmarry togain my inheritance as well, \" he admittedwith distaste. Valoreeshook herheadinpatent disbelief.</p><p>\"You already possess your title and estate. You inherited Thurborne estateand a dukedom from your father some years ago, \" she announced. Hiseyebrows rose, and Valoreecouldhave kicked herself.It was Megwhohad passed onthat littletidbit of news, and Valoree should never have let on that sheknew it.</p><p>\"Aye, \"he admitted now.\"Howbeit, I have not yetinheritedthe wealth necessary to keep it running.\"</p><p>Valoree blinked. \"You inherited the land and title, but no wealth? How is that possible? \" Howsimilar wasthis man'splight toher own, shefound herself thinking.</p><p>Daniel hesitated, then sighed.\"Ah, well, it isnot something any one of those women or their mamas who have been hanging about all night could not tellyou. My father inherited land and title onhis father's death, but hadto marryfor wealth.\"</p><p>\"Your mother? \"</p><p>\"Aye. Her familyhadagreat deal of wealthbutno estate or title. It was a perfect match. Mother had avery generous dowry when they married thathelpedtokeep things afloat, but bythe timemy father died, it had been exhausted.WhatI wasleftwith was a nice title, a lot ofland, and a mountain of debt.\"</p><p>\"Hmmm. Andthiswealth that you have notyetinherited? \"</p><p>\"My grandmother, my mother's mother, died this lastspring.\"</p><p>\"Iam sorry, \" shemurmured, hergaze sliding to the dancers movingaround them.</p><p>\"So am I, \" Daniel murmured. \"She was a grand lady. A wonderful sense of humor.\" He grimaced slightlyashe said that last bit, then smiled wrylyand said, \"She helped outwith some of the worst of thedebts while she wasalive.\"</p><p>Something in histone madeher glance back, andshe could see hisirritation at making thatadmission.Valoree knew instinctively that he had never asked for the old woman's help, and that accepting it hadprobablybeen the hardest thing in the world for him. She couldunderstand that. She hated to ask forhelp, too, andwould nearly kill herself tryingto do things onher own rather than give in, speakup, and admit she could useassistance.</p><p>\"She sounds ... nice, \" Valoree finishedlamely, wishing wistfully thatshe'dhad someonesimilarin her own life after Jeremy had died.</p><p>\"Nice? \" Daniel gave a short laugh. \"She was an oldharridan.</p><p>Foreverlecturing me that Iwasnot getting anyyounger, and that Ishouldreallymarry andstartthenextline. I tried toexplain that, what withtrying to repair thedamage done at Thurborne, I really didnot have timeto look for awife. She always said, 'You will not havetime until you make time.'\" He grimaced.\"I found out that day inWhister'soffice thatShe had arranged itso that I wouldmake time.\"</p><p>\"Marry and produce an heir, or noinheritance, \"Valoreesaid with a smile.She doubted he had taken sucha stipulation any better than she herself had. No wonder hehad been shouting and stompingaboutintheoffice.</p><p>\"Aye.\"He smiled wryly. \"And whenI asked Whister where she hadgotsuch a ridiculousidea, he saidthatshe may haveheard it from him. That he had another client, a female, whose father had left a similar codicil in his will. And, in fact, that this female client was no doubt, at that very moment, waitingto see him.</p><p>That she had an appointment with him, whereas I had just stormed to hisdoorstep the moment I arrived in town.\"</p><p>Valoree grimaced at the reminderof her own objective: tofind a husband. Not to inheritwealth, asDaniel hadto do - she had a greatdeal ofthat. Nay, she hadto find a husbandso that she mightbe able to claim land - land that was rightfully hers by birth.They weretwo opposites of thesame coin.\"So you are here in search of a wife.\"</p><p>\"Much to myeverlasting horror, itappears Ishallhave to take one, aye, \"he agreed. \"And mymother, of course, Godbless her soul, hasput out the news thatI am seeking one.\"</p><p>\"Well, that explains the women.\" Valoree chuckled. His expression changed to slight confusion.</p><p>\"What women? \"</p><p>\"What women? \" Valoree rolled her eyes. \"The women all fawning upon me with pretended interest inbeingmy friend. No doubt it is just camouflage. Since you'vebeennearme, soare they. It's anexcusefor themto flock around you in hopes of being the 'chosen one.' \"</p><p>Daniel gaveher a strange look, and suddenlyValoreebecame very self-conscious. \"So why areyouwasting your time dancing with me? \"</p><p>Daniel's expression changedto a smile.\"Soyou have noticed? \"</p><p>\"Noticedwhat? \"</p><p>\"Thatwe are dancing. Youare dancing. And quitewell, Imight add.\"</p><p>His words madeher realizethatshe was indeed doing just that, and had been for the length of theirdiscussion. He'ddistracted her with talk. She immediately stumbled, her feet suddenly forgetting where they weresupposed tobe going. Daniel drew her nearer to counterbalance her sudden awkwardness. \"How is my dancingwithyou a wasteof time? \"</p><p>\"Well, should you not be threshing out the chaff from the wheat among the eligible young women who are interested in marrying you? \" she asked, forgetting her feet to glance up at him again.</p><p>\"Ah.\"He nodded inunderstanding. \"I supposeI should. And which are you? Chaffor wheat? \"</p><p>\"Me? \"She was surprised by the question, but not so much that she couldnot answer. \"I amsugarcane, hard to cut.\"</p><p>\"But sweet, \"he teased. Herexpressionturnedgrim.</p><p>\"Nay. Notsweet. Nevermake the mistake ofthinking that, \"</p><p>she said solemnly. Then, while he was pondering that, sheadded thoughtfully, \"So all your motherhadto do was announce that you were looking for abride, and theeligible women flocked to you like piratesto a keg ofrum? \"</p><p>Daniel gave heranotherodd look, then nodded. \"Pretty much, aye.\"</p><p>\"How interesting, \" she murmured, then glanced up at him sharply. \"Butyou stillhaven'tanswered my question. Why waste time with me, when youshould be sorting the offerings? \"</p><p>Daniel was silent for a moment, forin reality he had no idea whyhe wasdoing what he was doing withher. He didn't know why he had told his mother he wouldnot attend her ball, or any other function for that matter, unless Valoreeand heruncle were invited, or why he had asked her to dance. Oh, certainly, he was curiousas to whathad happenedto Jeremyonthe king'sbehalf, and to get to the bottom of the rumors about Back-from-the-DeadRed, but as curious as he was, he had not even touched these topics tonight. He had been too intent on makingher comfortable, teaching her todance, seeing her smile.</p><p>He liked it when she smiled.

He raised his eyebrows questioningly.</p><p>\"You werenot thinking thatyouand I should - that we would ...\" Pausing, she shook her headand gavea halflaugh. \"Nay, of coursenot.

That we should marry? \" He moved her into the dance again.</p><p>\"Forget Ievensaidthat.\" Shelaughed with a shake of her head, as if the idea were quite ridiculous, he noted with mounting annoyance.\"I am a touchsuspicious onoccasion. Of course you werenot thinking thatwe could marry.\"</p><p>\"And - just to satisfy my curiosity, mind you - why is it that we couldnot marry? \"</p> <p>Lady Ainsley'seyebrowsroseslightly, as ifshe was surprised that he needeven ask. \"Why ... because ...Well...\" And then she burst out laughing.</p><p>Daniel felt his indignation grow. Not that he had beenthinking that theymight marry - hadhe? - but, well, now that he thought about it, it was not abad idea. Hehad to marry to gain the wealth his grandmother had left behind. She hadto marryto gain her landand title. They were both in thesame boat, so to speak. It could be abusiness arrangement. People did that all the time.</p><p>She, however, didn't seem to see thesense init. Shewho needed a husband or, as far as he knew, would be left with nothing, laughed at the idea of marrying him - even though most of the ton were throwing their daughtersandgranddaughtersat himin hopes of just such a match. \"Because what? \"</p><p>Valoree's laughterdied slowly away as she realized hehadn't joined her in it.In fact, helooked quite put out. \"Because we wouldnot suit, \" she said seriously.\"You are far too ...\" He raised an eyebrow at her hesitation, and she sighed. \"You are serious, aren't you? \"</p><p>His silence was her only answer.</p> <p>Valoree actually consideredthe matter, hergazetakingin his deep brown eyes and handsome features; hehad astrong nose, a square, stubbornjaw, a sensual lower and narrower upper lip.</p><p>Fitted together it all was an attractive package. Very attractive.</p><p>Her fingers slid from his shoulder to his upper arm and she measuredandsqueezed, testingthemuscle therebeforesliding quickly across his chest, poking to make sure that that magnificent expansewas allhis and not padding. Nay, it was all his. She pulled away, and her gazedropped downover his flat stomachtothe fine tight breeches he wore, without those silly frillyribbons, she notedwith relief, and she peeredat his strong, well-shapedthighs with interest.</p><p>Daniel was as stiff as a marblestatue underher inspection, his feet moving automatically in the dance as the rest ofhim awaited herpronouncement. When shefinally turnedher gazeback to his face, he eyed her warilyand waited.</p><p>\"My lord, you are a fine specimen of a man. Well built, obviously strong, and nodoubt you could supply thebabe Ineed to inherit my family estate. However\" - Valoree ignored his grimace - \"ourcharacters are simply too similar tomake such an option a success.\"</p><p>\"What? \" He stared at her withamazement, and she rolled her eyes.</p> <p>\"I am far more independent, strong-minded, and strong-willed than the average lady.I am not in the leastbit interested in a husband. I wouldnot even ever marrycould I getawaywith it.</p><p>But I havebeen forcedto do so by my father'swill. Theman I choose to husband me will notrule me.Infact, Ishall probably rule him. You would not likesuch a thing.\"</p><p>\"You are damn right, Iwould not like it, \" he snapped. \"What on earthmakes you think that any man is going to allow you to rule thehousehold? It simply isnot done.No man worth his salt - \"</p><p>\"Ido not wishto marry amanworth his salt. I wish to marry a man who will allowme tolead my life asI havedone since I was nineteen.\"</p><p>\"You would never respect amanlike that, \" Danielarguedwith afrown.</p><p>\"Ido not need torespect him, just tomarry him.\"</p><p>\"And have a babe withhim, \" Daniel pointedout.She grimaced this time.</p><p>\"Aye, well, that is a part of the bargain I could do without thinkingabout fora bit, if youdonot mind, \" she said unhappily, then glanced around. \"Oh, look. Megand Henry have managed to escape yourwould-bebrides. Takeme back tothem, please.\"</p> <p>It cameout as more an order than arequest, and shecouldtell Danielwas about to balk at it when he noticed the trickle of sweatslidingdown herface. That tookhim aback.\"Aye. Mayhap we should stop. You appearto be overwarm.\"</p><p>His words made her dab at the sweat selfconsciously. He releasedher hand and tookher armto lead her to where Meg and Henry were conversing.</p><p>\"You did pretty well out there, Ca - girl, \" Henry corrected himself, casting a quick glance in Daniel'sdirection.</p><p>\"Aye.But you should havestoppedsooner, \" Meg saidwith a frown.\"You are overwarm and...\" She paused midsentence as she reachedout with her hanky to dab atValoree's cheek, just as Valoreeturnedto give ameaningful glance to Daniel.</p><p>\"Idid try to stop. Several times, \" she announced peevishly.</p><p>\"But Lord Thurbornewas notwilling to let me.\"She waited a moment then, for some comment orapology fromthe man, but he remained silent, hisgaze locked on her face. Frowning, she glanced backtowardMegandHenry questioningly, only to see them both just as frozen and fixated on her. Shifting uncomfortably under theircombined stares and mountinghorror, Valoreeglancedfromone person totheother. \"What isit? \"</p><p>\"Your face, \"Henry said in dismay.</p><p>Frowning, she reached up to feelher cheekwhere Meg had meantto daband felt that her movement had turned the dab into abrush that had removed aportionof her makeup. The bare skin underneath felt oddly lumpy.</p><p>\"Do not touch it, \" Meg said quickly, pulling her hand away and peeringatthespot.\"Is your face itchy? \"</p><p>\"Itchy? \" Valoree muttered with disgust.\"It has been burning anditching allnight.It has been nearly driving me mad.\"</p><p>\"What? \" Megpeeredat herwith concern. \"Well, whydid you not saysomething? \" the woman asked in exasperation. Valoree glanced toward Henry, whose expression showed complete understanding mingled with regret. She hadn't said anything because a captain should notcomplain ofminor discomfort. A captainshould bearit as long as necessary, thentend to it when the opportunity arose.</p><p>\"Never mind why she said naught about it, \" Henry said resignedly. \"What dowe doaboutit? \"</p><p>\"Do? \" Meg peered at him blankly, then shook herhead. \"She is obviouslyreacting tothe makeup.We must leave and getit off heras quickly as possible.\"</p><p>Henry'sshoulders slumped atthat, and Valoree could readthe disappointment inhim. They had goneto all thistrouble. Again.</p><p>And it had been a flop. Again. She hadonlydanced, or talked even, with one man. Nonetheless, he nodded solemnly. \"We leavethen.\"</p><p>\"Nay. Not just yet, \" Valoree said suddenly. She turned to Daniel, hermind racing with aplanthatwasforming even as she spoke. \"Who is the biggestgossip of the ton? \"</p><p>Daniel peered at her in surprise and confusion, then said slowly, \"That would be Lady Denholme. Why? \"</p><p>\"Is she here tonight? \"Valoree asked hurriedly.</p><p>Daniel hesitated before nodding. \"I believe she is.\"</p><p>\"Where is she? \"</p><p>He peered at Valoree silently for a moment, then glanced around thehall, scouring thepeoplepresent until he spottedthe woman in question.\"She isover there, besidethe large womanin white and green.\"</p><p>Valoree followed hispointing finger, then glancedto her aunt.</p><p>\"Meg? \"</p><p>\"Aye? \" The older woman moved to herside atonce, frowning in concern at her niece's blistered red skin.</p><p>\"Go and strike up aconversation with this Lady Denholme.</p><p>Tell her aboutthe codicilin my father's will. Tell her how you must marry me off quicklyto claim it.Then tell herit shouldn't be a problem, however, since I am exceedingly wealthy. Make sure you mention that I am desperate and not likely to be picky.\" She paused suddenly to glance toward Daniel. \"Are thereanyother rather gossipy women here tonight? \"</p><p>Daniel gaveher a look ofmixed admiration and annoyance, then straightened to glance around the room again. \"Ah, well, Lady Smathers over there, and... er ... Lady Wenback by the tall, skinnygentleman.\"</p><p>Nodding, Valoree turned toMeg again. \"After you are finished with her, move on totheother twoand tell them the same things.</p><p>Then comejoin us. We shall be onthebalcony.\"</p><p>Nodding, Meg hurried off to do as she asked. As she did, Valoree began to fan her face with one hand, her gaze moving aroundtheroom.</p><p>\"Damn me.\" Henry's hissed words drew her gaze around questioningly, andhe muttered, \"A passeloftroubleheaded our way.\" Henodded towarda herdof hopeful mamas dragging their chicks theirway.</p><p>\"Damn.\"Valoree muttered as she spotted the group. This was the last group she wanted to see. Her gaze shot aroundto land on Daniel. \"They are after you. Go away and they will leave me alone.\"</p><p>\"Ihavea better idea, \" he answered. Taking her arm, he hurried her through thecrowd toward thebalcony doors, Henry hot on their heels.</p><p>\"See, this is what I mean about our not suiting, \" Valoree snappedirritably ashe rushed herout onto the balcony. \"You could not justgoawayas I asked; you had to take charge and drag me alongwithyou.\"</p><p>Daniel said nothing, simply led her down into the garden.</p><p>Finallyhe said, \"Well, your aunt did say that you shouldget that stuff off directly, or else ruin your complexion.\"</p><p>\"So? And so I shall. Assoon as Meg is finished with what I asked her todo, we shall returnhome and getthis goop offmy face.\"</p><p>\"Why wait? \" Daniel grinned anddrewhertoahalt, gesturing towarda fountain hehad brought her too. \"Itworked wellenough last night.\"</p><p>Valoreestared. This fountainwas smaller than the mammoth one theBeechams had owned, but muchmore attractive for all that. Its musical trickle was like some tempting siren's call, promisingrelief for her face.She couldwash off andsoothe her face in the cool water. Ease the itching and burning. Enjoy a momentof givingher facea good scratch, allunder the guise of cleaning it.</p><p>A moan slipping from herlips, she dropped to her knees beside thefountain and thrust her face into its cool, soothing water, her fingersscouring herskin with avengeance that made up forthe whole night of suffering. Lifting her face out of the water a moment later, shesighed in relief. She heard Henrysighas well.</p><p>\"I don't suppose ye'vegot an alley siding onyergarden here, do ye? \"sheheard him ask as she impatiently tugged off thewig Meg had insisted upon her wearing.Tossingitto the ground, she rubbedather scalpvigorously asDaniel answered.</p><p>\"Aye. Along the sidethere. ShallI help her over thestone wall whileyou fetch the carriage? \"Sheducked her whole head into the water, then, thrashing it exuberantly about rather like a dog shaking itself off.Shepulled her head back out just in time to hear Henry answer.</p><p>\"Aye. But give ita couple of minutes.I shallgo back inside and wait forMeg, thenleave with her, get into thecarriage, andhave it comearound.\"</p><p>\"Make sure she talks to all three women, Henry, \" Valoree called after him as he headed backtoward the balcony;then she collapsed back tositon her heels.She gavea sigh of purebliss.</p><p>\"Better? \"Daniel asked.</p><p>\"Aye, \" Valoree said. Though the itching and heat were still there, her face felt not nearly as bad as it had with all that makeup irritating it. When Daniel offered herhis hand to help her up, she hesitated, her gaze moving back toward the fountain.</p><p>Thenshedecided thatshe'dhad enough andplacedherwristin his hand, her own fingers closing aroundhis wrist so thatthey workedtogetherto gether back on herfeet. \"Where doesthe alley side your garden? \"</p><p>\"Thisway.\" Daniel gestured, thentookherarm towalkwith her, following the moonlit path to the trees.There, he slid his fingersdown tograsp hers sothat hecould lead the way onthe uneven ground, tugging her behind him.At thewall, he paused andturnedto faceher. \"Thisis becominga habit.\"</p><p>\"Whatis? \"she asked. \"My leaving soireesover walls, ormy littleincidentsatballs? \"</p><p>\"Both of those two, \"he admitted. \"ButI was thinking more along the line ofour meetingindark, secluded spots.\"</p><p>\"Oh, that.\"Tuggingher handfree ofhis, she stepped up tothe wall, checking its heightrelativeto her own. Of course it was a good foot higher than her head, she thought in annoyance. Who exactly werethesenoblestrying to keep outof their darngardens anyway? shewondered. \"Well, never fear, it shall not happen again. Iam never wearing thatfoolish muck onmyface again.\"</p><p>\"Good. You are far toolovely to bother with suchnonsense.\"</p><p>Valoree gave a doubtful snort. Lovely? Whatnonsense. She'd had an entire crew ofpirates convinced she wasaman forthe pastthirteenyears. That hardlyspoke of loveliness.\"Aye, well, if my plan works, I should havethis businessdone in no time. Then weshall headfor Ainsley and I shall notneedworry whatthe fashion is, orwhat people think.\"</p><p>\"Ah, your plan, \" Daniel murmured softly, suddenly standing directly behind her.He was uncomfortably close, she thought, feeling his heat through his clothes and her own. He wasn't touching her anywhere, yet she was incredibly aware of his presence.She actually shudderedwhen hisbreath brushed her ear as hewhispered, \"Do you really thinkthat simply spreading the word among the gossipmongers will work? You'll just announce that you are looking for a husband, and they shall come? \"</p><p>\"Why not? Itworked for you, \" shesaid, thenfrowned atthe husky quality of her voice. She had meant to sound slightly derisive. Insteadthe words had come out slightly breathy, asif she had just swuma longdistance.</p><p>\"Aye, but whatsort ofman willit bring running, do you think? \"</p><p>He breathed soclose toher ear that his lips actually brushed it.</p><p>She shivered uncontrollably, ripplesofsomething She hadnever experienced before shimmering through her body. Her mind unable to actually grasp whathehadsaid, she leaned back into him, herbreasts rising andfalling quickly now.</p><p>\"I - Ohhh.\" Shegasped in surpriseas his lips closed onthe rim of her ear. His handsclasped her waist gently, fanning out where they rested as he did some dark and mysterious things to her earlobes that hadher turning into pudding inhis hands. Moaning mindlessly, shelet her headdrop limply back against his chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wasn'tquite sure whathe was doing, and almostsuspected it was some witch's trick, her reactionwassoviolent;but she didn't seem to be able to find thepresence of mindtocare.Itfelt so damned good, shehardly noticed as his handsinched their way up over her ribs, to climb the mounds of her breasts.</p><p>A secondmoan slipped from her.She archedinto histouch, her breasts pushing against the cloth that bound them, her hands comingup to coverhis, cupping them closer against herflesh as she turned her head, her lipsunconsciously seeking his. When his mouth covered hers and histongue slid out totraceher lips, she opened instinctivelytohim, anda series of seizures seemed to ripplethroughher. Her ears were actually ringing as if inreaction totheshot ofa pistol nearby, and she jolted inhis arms, a hungry groan slipping fromhermouth intohis. She turned in his arms, mindlessly seekinga closerembrace.</p><p>Caught by her shoulders, Valoree let Daniel press her back against the wall, his kneeslidingbetween herlegs andpushing forward and upward.Hetuggedat the decolletage ofhergown, and shefelt thecool airon her nipples like a caress before his hands coveredthem.His lips left hers to travel down herthroatin search of the booty he hadjust uncovered. Gaspingand moaning, Valoreepressed her bare shoulders back into the rough stone, archingher breasts out as he pluckedat themwith his fingers and licked at the bare flesh hehad revealed.</p> <p>It was like some sort of madness. Daniel wasn't what she wanted or needed, and yet she wanted and needed him with a violence that would have terrified her had she seen it coming.</p><p>Clenching her fingers in his hair, she dragged his mouth away fromher breast, pulling it impatientlyback to herown with little care fortheslight pain shemight be causing.Daniel respondedin kind, catching her still-damp hairin his fingers and tugging her head backas far as itwouldgo. Thenhegave her the kiss she wanted, devouring hermouth with a passion that stole all her breath and left her panting and gasping and shuddering. He tugged herskirt impatientlyupward and foundher thigh, and she felt herselffurther inflamedby that touch. Then hewassuddenly gone. Valoreewasleftblinking in amazement, her chest heaving with hergasps asshe saw Daniel had backed awayto several feet in frontofher, hands clenched at hissides as he struggled for a return of control.</p><p>Valoree gapedathim in amazement for amoment; then the clip-clop of horses'hoovesand the jangleof a carriage came to herfromover the wall, and sherealized why he had stopped.</p><p>Henry and Meg must have finished and were coming in the carriage to fetch her. GoodLord, hadso much time passed? Shaking her headin an effort to try to clear it, she turned to face the wall. Leaning her forehead against it briefly, she was brought back to herself somewhat by the cool, rough stone pressing against her skin. Then she straightened, took a determined breath, and leapedupward, graspingat the topof the wall with her hands.</p><p>Danielwas behindherat once, his hands grasping her waist, then suddenly sliding upward again to her breasts. Valoree gave a startledcry, herfingers releasing theirholdon the wallso that she dropped to the ground infront of him again.For a moment, her body seemed to singwith a sort of joyasit felt hisnearness and touch again, and really, at that point, he probably could have thrown her on theground and taken her rightthere, carriage on the other side of the wall or no. But then that joy dissipated as she glanced down to see that he was fumbling to put her decolletage back in place, to cover the breasts hehad bared.</p> <p>Beforeshe could move his handsout of the way and take over the taskherself, itwas doneand his handshad movedback to her waist once more.But ratherthanlift her upthen, he turned herin hisarmsand torturedthem both with another searingkiss that left them gasping andbreathless.</p><p>\"Tillwe meet again, \"he murmured near her ear; then heturned her and liftedher upward until she could graspthe wall and help to pullherself to rest across the top ofit on her stomach. Her gazefound the carriage a little down the lane.</p><p>\"There sheis. Up alittle farther, \"sheheard Henry calljust as shefelt a coolbreeze driftover her naked legs and behind - a naked legs and behind that would have been clad in breeches had Megnot dragged them from her handsand given them tothe men to hide. Jerking around in surprise, she saw Daniel's head disappear beneath her skirt, thenfelthislips graze the inside of one thigh, then theother. A moment later, heducked back out from herskirts and smiled at her wickedly.</p><p>\"Till we meet again, \" he repeated silkily, clasping her bottom through herskirts. Then he levered her upwardonce more, and Valoree was distracted with the challengeofgaining the wall or findingherself tumbling off the other side of it. Once she was astride the stone, she glanced back down, but Daniel had disappeared, and she could hear the sound of his footsteps receding through the trees.</p><p>\"Well, areyou comin' down, or shall I comeup there and fetch ye? \" A hand on her ankle drew Valoree's head around.One-Eye gazed up at her inamusement.His hatwas pushed back on his head, hiscoatundone andpushed to either sideofhis waist, and he held a glaring lantern that stung hereyes with its light. She missed thesudden change of expression on his face as he caught aglimpse of her, but she didn't miss his concerned comment.</p><p>\"Lord love us. You did reactnasty tothatstuff, didn't ye? \" She could see him shake his head through her squintingeyes as he released a lowwhistle. \"Your face is all red and flushed. .. and even your lipsareswollen. Damn, ye're amess.\"</p> <p>\"Thank you, \" Valoree saidsarcastically, slinging her other leg over the wall, but careful of her skirts in the process. Then, holding thehem down withone hand, shedroppedoff thewall, landing on her feet in front ofhim.</p><p>\"Let's get the hell out of here.\"</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\"Lord Thurborne is avery handsomeman.\"</p><p>Valoree quit shiftingimpatiently under Meg'sministrations and openedher eyesto peer atthe womanpresentlyslathering green muck over her face. It smelledlike some sort of garden mixture.</p><p>Mushed cucumbers or something. Whatever it was, Meg had assured her it would help with the burningand itching, which was the only reason that Valoree had agreed to her slathering yet another concoction onher face. And actually, despite making her smell likea salad, the mixture washaving a soothing effecton her skin. Exactlythe opposite effect thatMeg's words were having on her mind.</p><p>Valoree needednohelp tosee Thurborne's attractiveness. She had noticed that upon first meeting the man, but she wasn't generally impressed with the prettiness of a man's face.</p><p>Unfortunately, she wasseeingmore andmore about Daniel that was impressingher. He was a no-nonsense sort, who did not enslave himself to thepresent trend towardfrilly, fluffyfashions; his waistcoats hadalmost a militarycut to them, and there were noridiculous ribbons onhisknee breeches.She liked that. She thought the rest of the menlooked likesilly poodles.</p> <p>He wasalsostrong, obviously a man who used hisbody for more than posing orprimping. She would notbe at all surprised to learn that hehad been chipping in physicallyto correct thingsat hisfamily estate, whichhe claimedwasin suchdisrepair.He had the shouldersof a workingman, not a dissolute landowner. He hada good senseof humor, and had madeher laughseveral times last night. Then, too, what other lord was likely to direct awoman tohis fountainto have her wash off, then help her climb over his own wallto avoidhaving to pass back through his guests? He was a sharp thinker, too, and commanding - -traits she possessed herself and could appreciate. And damned ifhe wasn't the finest kisser.</p><p>Of course, she remindedherself solemnly, mayhap every man kissed like that. But good Lord, her lips were still numb and tingling, not to mentionthe inner backs of her thighs where he hadpressed those finalkisses good-bye.</p><p>Aye, she'dlike tosee more of the man.She fanciedshe'deven paya king's ransom to bed him, but marriage? Now that was another thingentirely, and sheknew darned wellthat was the reasonMeg wasbringinghim up. It was what all of her crew wanted - for herto marryand getthem theirpromised homes.So, of course, knowing theman was inthe same position as herself, they would look to him as a prime candidate. Unfortunately, Valoree couldn't agree with them. She would not be ruled. And Thurborne was the ruling sort. Just look howhe had not gone away and left her_alonetonight! How hehadnotaccepted her refusal to dance.Nay, he liked things his own way. Like her. And aship just couldnot have two captains.</p><p>'Tell mesomething, \"Valoree murmured now as Megopened her mouth to comment again. Closing her mouth, the older woman raised her eyebrows questioningly, and Valoree asked, \"Who are you? \"</p><p>The woman stiffened, her eyes turning wary, and Valoree smiled. \"I noticed tonight while you were talking to Lady Thurbornethat you know quite a bit about Port Royale. You've been there.\"</p><p>\"Nay, I've just listened well, \" Meg answered quickly.\"Sailors willtalk whileintheir cups.\"</p><p>\"You have been there, \" Valoree insisted. \"You know more about it than I. And you are of noblelineage, for all that you lookedlike a down-and-out prostitutewhenBull found you. No prostitute could walkquiteasstifflyortalkquiteasprecisely as you do. Now I'll ask you again, who are you? \"</p><p>Meg glared at her silently for a moment, then shrugged indifferently. She turned awayto clean upthemess She had made on the smalltable with her garden medley. \"It does not matter. I was hired for ajoband amperformingit to the bestof myability.</p><p>That is all you need know.\"</p><p>\"IfearI disagreewith you.\"Valoree stood to block her path as thewoman triedto carry thebowl of remainingsalve towardthe door. Shestared down at the suddenly nervous womanandsaid grimly, \"If you are a lady and of the nobility, you may be recognized. Then ourlittletaleof your being my aunt could be ruined.I cannot risk that. Whoareyou? \"</p><p>Meg hesitated, then turned aroundto drop herloadback onthe table. Wipingherhands on the apron she had donned over her gown, she sighed. \"You are right, of course. Iwas born a lady.</p><p>But you need not fear my being recognized. I left London twenty-seven years ago, married, and livedin theCaribbean. On aplantation even, so that would fit rightinwiththestory wehave passed around.\"</p><p>\"And your family? \"</p><p>Her mouth tightened. \"My husbanddied lastfall. We had no children, as hecould notfather them. I have no family.\"</p><p>Valoree heard the painin Meg'svoice ather admissionand felt pity fora moment, butshe tamped it down. Too many people were affected by this. She could not afford for pity to get inthe way of herprotectingthe men who counted onher.\"No parents? No brothers or sisters left here inLondon? \" Her expression made Valoree's gaze narrow. \"Which is it? A brother? \"</p><p>\"Sister.\" Shesighedmiserably, herhead lowering further. \"But you need notfear her acknowledging me inany way. She ...I...</p><p>There wasa rift.\"</p><p>Valoree waited a moment, then sighed and moved backto her seat. Settling there, she gestured to the other chair as Meg glanced at hernervously. \"You hadbest tell meall.\"</p><p>Megsatwith resignation, thenshruggedunhappily. \"There is little to tell. I was young and thought I was in love. I did something foolish and found myself unmarried andwithchild.\"</p><p>Valoree archedan eyebrow atthat. \"Whydid your family not force amarriage? \"</p><p>Meg shrugged. \"My father probably would have, but I did not tell them. I did notwishthe baby's father to be forced to marry me. Hedid not believe it was his, anyway. He said ifI had given myself soeasily to him, how was he to know Iwas not sofree withothers? \" Sherelated her story as dispassionately as if telling the time of day, a sure sign to Valoree that it had been incredibly painfulfor her at the time.</p><p>\"Ifled toan empty cottage on the edge of anestate myparents owned, \" Meg continued. \"Itwas in the north. ThereI had the babe. It... it was born dead.\" Her voice trembled, her hands twisting viciously at her apron. Taking a deep breath, she straightened and finished. \"BecauseI'd fled, my reputation would beintatters amongtheton. Itwould be quitethescandal.I had to get away, so I caught a ship for the Caribbean, metmy husband on it, and wasmarried at sea the day beforewe landed in Port Royale. Ilived thereeversince andhad absolutely no contact with my family in that time.\"</p><p>Valoree peeredather silently, positive the woman was lying, or at least leaving somethingout, but unsure how to force itfrom her.Or if she even hada right to.Ifit did not affect her, or her men, she really had no need to know. But... \"Your parents? \"</p><p>\"Dead.\"Thewordwassaid without emotion. \"Theywere both dead within ten years ofmyleaving.\"</p><p>Valoree nodded slowly. \"So this scandal is the reason you believe yoursister, Lady Beecham, will not acknowledge you? \"</p><p>\"It is the reason I know she will not, \" Meg snapped, then suddenly froze. Her eyes snapped up to Valoree's, wide with shock. \"How did you - \"</p><p>\"She looks just like you, \" Valoree explained.\"She isthinner, meaner, and grayer mayhap, but I sawright away that she hasthe same features. I just needed something to make merealize it.\"</p><p>She paused. \"I take it thatis whyyoudraggedthe bottle to bed andmade damn sure you would not have toattend her soiree? \"</p><p>Turning pink, Megnodded.</p><p>\"Didyou reallydrink it all? Or did you justswish asip around in your mouthand splash some on yourself tomake yourselflook worse? \"</p><p>The woman'seyes widenedslightly. \"How did you guess that? \"</p><p>Valoree smiled. \"Ladies do not drink rum, Meg.

You have tobe carefulabout things like that. Thereare men justwaiting to prey onwomen travelingalone. I heard a story of a similarincidentthe day we arrived in London. A well-bred woman arrived on aship, hired a hack totake herand herservant toa relative's, and they never made it.Theauthoritiesfound both women the next morning - dead. Alltheir belongingshadbeen taken, eventheclothes offtheir back.\"</p><p>Meg paled, her eyes going round with horror. Toput her at ease, Valoree quickly asked, \"So you were left without your things.Howdidyour dress getruined and - \"</p><p>\"Oh, \" Meg interrupted irritably. \"I... Well, I just started to walk. I did notknow whatto do. I was flustered by the fix I found myself in anddid not pay enough attention towhere I was headed.By the timeI did, it was tofind that Ihad made my way back toward the docks.\" She grimaced and nodded at Valoree's shake of thehead.\"Aye, Iknow it wasfoolish of me. The area was horribly run-down. The smell alone...\" She paused and shuddered, then sighed\"Well, I realized my folly at once, and turnedto head backthe wayI had come, buthad barely done so when I was accosted.</p><p>\"Rightthere, in broad daylight, two youngruffians grabbed me andstarted todragme into an alley.I screamed, and they koshed me over the head. When I awoke, everything was gone: my jewelry, my cape, myreticule withthe last of my money. They hadleft me lying in a pileof filth. I stank and my gown was ripped and filthy. Iwas woozyand weak.I could not see any injuries, butI could feel alarge bumponthe backofmy head. I knew I needed help, and as frightened as I was to leave the relative safety of the abandonedalley where I hadbeen left, my head ached horribly and I feared if I allowed myself to lose consciousness, Iwould diethere. Itried to get to myfeet, butthe worldseemed to spinaround me, so I hadto half crawl, halfdrag myselfoutinto the street. Itwas night by then andthestreets weremuch less busy. Those people stillwalking about simply ignored my pleasfor help. I'msure theythoughtI was justwhat I lookedlike: afallen woman. Then a coupleof young nodcocks, as you would call them, came along. They were drunk and stumbling, and they assumed I was drunkas well. When Iraised a handtoward themto plead forhelp, they thought it was a drink I wanted. They hadsome fine sport emptying their bottle over me andlaughing at my pathetic state before moving on.</p> <p>\"The next person tocome alongwas Bull, \" she finished quietly.</p><p>\"Bythattime Iwasratherresignedto dying, but hestopped and seemed to look me over, thennodded to himself.</p><p>\"How would you like a handout of the gutter, old girl? ' he asked. When I nodded dumbly, he picked me up and started walking, carrying me in hisarms as he told me what he was about. 'We need ye fer a job, a respectable-type job - chaperoningour captain. If youdoit allrightand proper, there's food, clothes, aplace to stay, and a cottageof yer own at the end of it. Thinkyou could playa lady? ' \"</p><p>She laughed with real amusementnow andshook herhead.\"I am not evensure ifI meant to help youat that point. I simply wished to get away fromthe docks atthe time. I was still rather groggy, my head aching, while you and the dressmaker's wife bathed, dressed, and measured me. But in the morning, when I awokeon the ship, I thought it through. I had no money. No home. And fromwhatI could tell, no family. A cottage ofmy own onan estate faraway from court, with thebeautyand peace of the country, seemed afineplace for me to sitand reflect inmy old age.\"</p><p>\"Aye, Isuppose it is, \" Valoree said, moved. She sighed. Here was another burden for her conscience, another soul whose future it seemednow depended onher.</p><p>\"If I have answered all your questions, \" Meg said, standing suddenly, \"I thinkI shalljust - \"</p> <p>\"Go ahead.\"Valoree sat back inher chair with afrownas Meg left the room. She had toget married. She had to regain Ainsley and get Henryhis roses, Pete hisown big kitchen, and Meg a home in which to settle. They alldepended on her. Her mind raced, but she kept coming back tothegossips being her best hope. She simply could not bear another party - or any engagementthat mightresult in another debacle regarding her makeup.She hadno graces to attract ahusband. If astraight-out callsent through thegossipsdid not work ...well, she mightjust have toconsider Thurborne.</p><p>\"Good morning, Valoree. Your face is looking abit better.\"</p><p>Valoree gruntedin response to Meg's comment as she entered the morningroom. She knew by the expressions on her men's faces, and bywhat she had seen for herself upon awakening, that the woman was lying through herladylike teeth. No doubt she was just tryingto make Valoreefeel better, but Valoree didn't much care how she looked;she had noballs to attendtoday. She was just relieved thattheirritation had gone away.</p><p>\"Well, eat upquick there, Captain, girl, and we shall head out nice and earlyto the shops, \" Henry suggested with bluff good cheer.</p><p>Turningasuspicious glareon the man, Valoreedropped into the seat atthe head of the table.Peteimmediately carried in a largetrayof baked goodsthat made her stomachgrowl. \"Andjust what would youbethinking we might need to go totheshops for? \"</p><p>Her quartermaster hesitated, his gaze shooting to Bull and One-Eye, who sat on either side of her. When the two men nodded in encouragement, heclearedhis throatand continued, \"Well, yecan't bewearingthat slopye wore lastnightagain, so we'll have to go find you some other muckto - \"</p><p>\"The hell we will, \" Valoreesaid in a growl, rising to her feet.</p><p>\"There will be nothing more on my face. Two such incidents wereenough.\"</p> <p>\"Now Captain, girl, \" Henrytried.\"Iknow - \"</p><p>\"Ho!\" No-Nosehurried intothe room, excitement lighting his eyes.\"There's threefellers at the door, allof'em looking'to see the captain. Theygave me these.\"</p><p>\"Letme see those, Robert, \" Meg murmured, holding out her hand for the cards he held. Squirmingunderheruse of his real name, No-Nose handed the cards over and waited along with everyone else as she perused them.</p><p>\"Lord Chaddesley, Lord Alcock, and Lord Heck-ford, \" she murmuredthoughtfully, tappping the cards againstone hand.</p><p>\"What isit about? \" Henry asked, frowning as he moved to standbehind herand peer downover her shoulder.</p><p>\"I donot know.Lady Thurborne was talking about these three last night.Theyare all friends who gadabout together. Theyare alsosecond sons - they will notinherit and are in need of wives who are wealthy.\"</p><p>Relief flowingthrough her, Valoree chuckled. When everyone turned toher, she shrugged. \"I would say they arehere to offer themselves up for marriage, \" she proposed. \"Meg's littlechatwith the gossips lastnight must have worked.\"</p><p>Meglooked takenaback.\"Oh, my, ofcourse.\"Sheturned to No-Nose. \"You shall haveto tell them thatLady Valoree is not available today, and to trybacktomorrow. We - \"</p><p>\"What? \" every maninthe room, plus Valoree herself, cried out.</p><p>Megsighed unhappily, but her responseremained firm. \"Just look at herface! Shecannot catch a husbandlooking so. Besides\"</p><p>hermouth tightened - \"it is always best toplay hardto get.\"</p><p>Valoree made a face and shook herhead.\"Nonsense. They do not care what I looklike. This is business. No-Nose, show them tothesalonand tell them I shall bealong directly.\"</p><p>\"Valoree, \" Megprotested, but Valoree ignored her, her eyes narrowing onthehesitating No-Nose.</p><p>\"You heard my order.\"</p><p>Acquiescing, the man turned and hurried out of the room.</p><p>Valoreeturnedto peer at Meg, whose upset was obvious. \"This is business, Meg.I am notlooking for ahappy-ever-afterending.</p><p>You yourself should know how rare those are. I have seventy-five men and one woman under me, allin need of a home and safe harbor. I cannot afford dreams of a perfect husband or happy marriage.I mustbe satisfiedwith Ainsley, one brat, and a husband whobothers meas littleas possible.\" Turning herbackon the table, she left the room.</p><p>\"Son? \"</p><p>Daniel paused, the tune he had been whistlingdying abruptly as helookedabout. His gazefell on hismother, hanging halfway outof a carriage ontheroad besidehim, waving madly in case he should miss her. Smiling, hechangeddirection andmoved tothe carriage, taking her hand topress akiss to it.\"Good morning, Mother.\"</p><p>\"You seemvery happy this morning.\"</p><p>\"Iam.\"</p><p>When he didn't add any furtherinformation, her smile faded.</p><p>\"Wouldyou care for aride? \"</p><p>\"Nay. Thank you. I felt like walking and sent my driver on ahead.\" He gesturedup theroad where the Thurborne carriage waited.</p><p>\"Oh. Well, where are you going? Andwhatisthat parcel? A gift? \"</p><p>Daniel laughed outright at herblunt questions andshook his head. \"You never change, doyou, Mother? \"</p><p>\"Nay, of course not. Why should I? \" she asked with real surprise. Hesmiledwryly.</p><p>\"As it happens, I am headedto see Lady Ainsley.\"</p><p>\"Lady Ainsley? \" Her eyebrows rose, her eyes filling with speculation.\"And your package? \"</p><p>\"Oh.\" He glanced down at it, suddenly embarrassed, and shrugged. \"She had a reactionto hermakeup last night.I stopped in at the apothecary to see what theyhadtoofferas aid. They gave me this.\"</p><p>His mother barely glanced at the bundle, her next question alreadytumbling from her lips.'Theladylives around here? I had notrealized thattheAinsley'shad a townhouse in this area.\"</p><p>\"Actually, I believe they are renting it for the season from Lord Beecham. Itis just...\" He turned to gesture vaguely up the street, only topause and frown as hesaw acarriage stop before the town house in question. A gentleman stepped down - John Lambert, he recognized as the man conversed briefly with a servant in pink livery who rushedforward - then turned to give instructions to his driver before following theservant tothe door of the house. TheLambert carriage had barely pulledaway when another had pulled up in itsplace, disgorging Harry Gravenner.</p><p>The servant hurriedbackatonce, gesticulatinga bitexcitedly, then turned tobriefly glare at Daniel'scarriage.</p><p>\"Hmmmm, \" his lady mother supplied thoughtfully as she, too, watched Gravennersay somethingto hisdriver, then hurry up to the house. \"It looks asifLadyAinsley ishaving many visitors this morning.\"</p><p>\"Aye, \" Daniel saidshortly, scowling as the Gravenner carriage drove away only to be replaced by another. \"I have to .. .\" he began distractedly, but didn't finish the sentence. He turned away fromhis mother's carriage andhurriedtoward hisdestination, his whole mood ruined.</p><p>Daniel had woken up ina finestate thismorning. He had not bothered returning to theparty the night before, but had gone to his club for a drinkand some peace. Ofcourse, allhe had done was think about Valoree: her spirit; her wit; her funny littlesmile whereone side curved up andtheothersort of bent downward as ifshe not only smiledrarely, but was afraid to indulge often lest she find her reason for doing so suddenly gone; the way she suddenly slipped into less than stellar speech when she was annoyed; her determination, her passion....</p><p>He had tasted her on his lips for hours after she had disappearedover the wall, and still could when he closed his eyes and concentrated. He couldfeel her armswrappedaroundhim, her fingers in his hair, her body moldedto his, could hear her gasps and sighs and groans and moansas he had lickedher eager flesh.</p><p>Dear God, justthe memory aroused him, and he had tortured himself with it for hours ashe hadpondered things - likethe fact that he had to marry and produce an heir to gain his grandmother'sinheritance. That she hadto marryand getwith child to gain herfamily estate. Thathecould helpgive her that baby. Over andover again. In bed. Outofbed. Against a garden wall.On astaircase. On his desktop. In one of the chairsbefore the fire in his room.</p><p>He was thinking with his nether regions and not his head, he knew, but damn, itmade his nether regionshappy. And really, when it cameright down to it, why not contemplate such things? He enjoyed this woman, albeit inan oddsort of way. He found her awkwardness in the ton endearing, her intelligence enchanting, and her independence refreshing. Of course, he would have tocurb some of that independence, butthe pleasure he anticipated in other areas seemed to make that a small consideration.</p><p>He just had toconvince her of the smallness ofthat. Which, he had thought last night, should notbe thatdifficulta chore. After all, she did have to marry to regain her home, and he was a handsomefellow - intelligent, soon to be wealthy, withland of his own, a title, and all those other things that a smart and ambitious young woman soughtin a husband.Just look at allthe girlsandtheir eager motherswho chased him from ball to ball.</p><p>They thought he was prime marriage material. And, he had assured himself, it would be little enoughtrouble to convince her of that, too. His certainty was what had had him whistling cheerfully ashe had madehis way here.</p><p>But that hadbeen whenhe hadthoughttherewould be littleif anycompetitionfor the woman.Now, ashe hurried alongthe street, watching yet anothergentleman leapfrom his carriage and strideupto the door to rap gaily, he couldn'thelp thinking that perhaps it would not goassmoothlyashe had hoped. And why the hellhadn'the ridden here in his carriage? He would have been here longago had he not decided to walk off some of his excitement along the way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"ShallI move, my lord? \" Daniel's driver asked as he drew abreast of hiscarriage. \"Aservant keeps insistingthatIshouldn't park here, butI told himthat you said I should, so here I'd be waiting.\"</p><p>\"Stayput, \" Daniel ordered, turning to glare at thefellow now rushing towardhim from the townhouse.</p><p>\"Ye cain't be parkin' yer hack here. Have yer driver move it.</p> <p>We don't need the road blocked out front here, \" the harried-looking fellow announced, and Daniel raised a supercilious eyebrowatthefellow. The man's pink livery was uglybut easy to digest, but hiding hissurpriseas he took inthe man's damaged face took some doing.The butler had nonose! He wasalso missing severalteeth, had long hair, and wore a pistol sticking out of his breeches. Catching Daniel's glance at the weapon, the fellow scowled and fastened his waistcoat. \"Isaid - \"</p><p>\"I heard what you said, \" Danielinterruptedcoldly. \"I simply cannot believe your temerity in attempting to order me about.\"</p><p>The man rolled his eyes, not looking the least impressed. \"Now seehere, them's me orders.

However, my carriageshallwait right here for me, \"Danielannounced firmly, bringing ascowl to theservant's face. Theman lookedabout to argue the point, but another carriage pulled up just then, distracting him.</p><p>\"Oh, now, ye can't be parkin' yer hack here!\" he shouted, movingon to the new carriageina fury. Daniel glanced back curiously to see Beecham stepping out.Blinkingin surprise atthe surly servant, the nobleman directed something quickly to his driver, and the hack pulled away, leavinghim to hurry up the walk.</p> <p>\"Thurborne, \" he said in greeting, glancing over his shoulder toward the fellow with no nose. \"I really must talk to Lady Ainsley about her servants. They are quite - \"</p><p>\"Unusual? \"</p><p>Daniel suggested.</p><p>\"Impertinent? Loud? Disreputable-looking? \"</p><p>\"All of those, \" Beechamagreed as they paused on the steps to the town house andDaniel rapped on the door with his cane.</p><p>If the first servant had seemed somewhat disreputable, the servantwhoopened thedoorwas downright scary. He filledthe door like death, aswide asand even taller than, it was, having to stoop tostand in itsframe, completely blocking any passage. His skinwas a deep, rich mahogany, his head bald, and his teeth shone as he smiled a white smile that was anything but friendly.</p> <p>\"Yer cards.\"</p><p>Daniel blinked at the deep growl and handed hiscard over, silently eyeing theman's thickarms as he took bothit andthe card Beecham supplied. Barely glancing at them, the fellow steppedback forthe two nobles to enter, then tossed their cards on atray, where a smallmountain ofothers resided. He gestured towarda door on their left, behind which the sound of voices could be heard. It seemedopening the door andannouncing them was not part of his duties.</p><p>Amused, Daniel started for the door, only to pause andglance back when Beecham asked curiously, \"What did you want our cards for if you had no intention of presenting them to your mistress orannouncing us? \"</p><p>In the process of closingthe door, the giant paused to eye young Beechamnarrowly.\"So's I'll know where to deliveryeif yecausetrouble and I have to knock yeout.\"</p><p>Even Daniel blinked at that announcement, hismouth drawing into an astounded smile. \"And how will youknow which card belongs to whom? \" he asked smugly. \"You have quite a collection there, myman.\"</p><p>The fellow's expression didn't change at all; hemerely said, \"I'll know.\"</p><p>And really, Daniel suddenlysuspected the man would. Shaking his head, he turned backto the door and opened it. Having done so, he frozeinshock.The room was overflowing withmen. There were at least thirtyof them in thesmall salon - and every single oneof themwas trying to be heard overtheothers.</p><p>\"My God, \"Beechambreathed, moving to his side to surveythe room. Daniel glanced at himgrimly.</p> <p>\"Aye. It wouldseem herplan worked, \" hemurmured, not at all pleased by this turnof events.</p><p>\"What plan? \" Beechamaskedfaintly, his glazed eyes shifting from one suitor to another. Knowing the man's penchant for keepingaccounts, Daniel surmised he was counting them.</p><p>\"Herplan to spread thewordthatshe is wealthyand desperate for ahusband, \" Daniel explained patiently. \"She washoping that it would bring the suitors scurrying. It appears that her plan worked. Everygold-digger inLondon has shown up.\" Hemade a disgusted face, thennoticed Beecham's alarmed expression. \"Is that not why youarehere? \"</p><p>\"Nay!\" Beecham criedat once. \"At least - Well, the money isn't really important.I mean, money is always nice, but Lady Ainsley is ... She's . ..\" His voice trailed away helplessly, his expression slightly moony.</p><p>\"Aye. She is, \"Daniel agreed darkly. Stepping into theroom, he madehisway throughthe crowdof male bodies toward where they seemed most dense. That was wherehe wouldfind Valoree, no doubt.At the centerof the hive.</p><p>\"Your hairis like fire.\"</p><p>\"Your beautyis incomparable.\"</p><p>\"Your lipsarelike little rosebuds.\"</p><p>\"You are as sweetas honey.\"</p><p>\"Oh, your voice ismusic itself.\"</p><p>Valoree sighed inwardly and tapped her hand impatiently against her side as compliment after complimentwas bestowed by the men crowding around her. It was all a bunchofbunk, of course.Herface was red and blistered, her eyes bloodshot, and her hair was lying flatandunfancy uponherback because she had refused to wear her damn wig.She had left it inThurborne's garden, anyway. In short, she looked likehell.Andshe knew she looked like hell. Nor was she terribly impressed with all the flowery phrases with which suitors were showering her.</p><p>It seemed her plan had worked too well. Thesalon was filling up by the moment with hopeful would-behusbands.Itwas nice tohavea choice, but really, how was she to choose one fromthis mob?</p><p>A firm grasp onher armmade her glance aroundto see Daniel.</p><p>\"Good morning, \"he mouthed with a wink, then turned and started away, dragging her firmly behind him. Her crowd of gentleman callers immediately began to follow, their silly compliments undiminished as they trailedher to the door of the salon. Stepping into the hall, Danielpulled herout, then slammed the door in their faces.</p><p>\"Good day, \" he murmured, smiling pleasantly asheturned to face her, leaninghis weight determinedly againstthedoor and holding the knob firmly. He duga bedraggledand knottedwig from his pocketwith hisotherhand. \"Youleft this behind last night.\"</p><p>Valoree couldn't help it;she burst outlaughing as she tookthe wig, then shookher head and sighed. \"Good day to you, too.</p><p>Thank youfor getting meout of there.\"</p><p>\"Yes. Itseemsyour plan worked.\"</p><p>'Too well, \"she admitted sardonically asthe doorrattledwith the combined force of those who sought to openit.</p><p>\"Well, \" he continued cheerfully, \"I could rid you of this problemshould you butreconsider marrying me.\"</p><p>Valoree smiled slightlyathis words, but shook her head. \"I never reconsider adecision. That wouldmake me wishy-washy.</p><p>Oncea decision hasbeenreached, good or bad, it stands.\"</p><p>\"Thatsoundsincredibly foolish.\"</p><p>Valoree shrugged, vaguely annoyed but unswayed. She had spentmostof her lifeon a ship, and the last five years as its captain. She wasn'tgoing to allow one man's opinion to change herway ofdoing things.</p><p>\"Whatif there was some bit ofinformation that you did not know before you made your decision? \" he suggested. \"Surely, should you learn something new, and of import, you would reconsider - \"</p><p>\"That's not reconsidering; that isa new consideration entirely, \"</p><p>she toldhim calmly.</p><p>\"But that's the same thing!\"</p><p>\"What is twoplus two, my lord? \"</p><p>He blinked at the non sequitur. \"Four, but - \"</p><p>\"And what is two plus twotake awayone? \"</p><p>'That would bethree, but - \"</p><p>\"Exactly.Yousee.Two separate mathematical problems. With two different answers, despite both havinga similar portion.\"</p><p>He staredat her blankly fora moment; then admirationslowly began to shift over his face. \"Why, you clever little witch. I believe you couldtwistsomeintellectuals intoknots with your thoughts. Are you always sological? \"</p><p>Valoree blinked at the question. No one hadevercalled her logical before. A knock atthe front door savedher from having to comeup withan answer. Turning, she watched as Bull moved toward the door, positive it would be more damn suitors like thosetheyhad trappedinthesalon.</p><p>\"Oh, my!\" a female voice cried out in surprise, but Bull blocked Valoree's view of whoit was.\"Oh, hello, um ... Iamhere tosee Lady - \"</p><p>\"Mother!\"</p><p>Valoree blinked atDaniel'sirritatedvoice, thenleft him alone to guard the salon door - which no longer shook, the suitors apparently resigned to wait in peace. She moved curiously to Bull's side to seethat it was indeed Lady Thurborne.</p><p>\"Oh, Lady Ainsley, \" Daniel'smother exclaimedwith relief as Valoree moved into view. \"For a moment, I feared I had the wrong town house. Danieljustwaved downthe street. He did not pointout exactly which one it wasand - Oh, hello, Daniel, \" she said, easing cautiously pastBull and into the entry.</p><p>Her son did not look impressed, Valoree noted with amusement, taking in his expression. \"What are youdoing here, Mother? \"he asked.</p><p>\"Oh, well, I thoughtmayhap Icould help.\"</p><p>\"Help? \" Valoree asked withamazement. Surely hismother had notcome to plead his case asto whyshe should marry her son?</p><p>\"Yes, dear.\" Lady Thurborne whirled toward her, smiling brightly. \"Daniel mentioned that he had stopped at the apothecary's to collectsomesalve for your poor face because you had reacted to - Oh, my!\" sheinterrupted herself inhorror.</p><p>Bull had swungthe door wider for a nervous young maid to scamper insideand sunlightspilled over Valoree, illuminating her ravaged face.</p><p>\"Oh, you poor, dear thing, you!\"she cried, hurryingforward to catch Valoree's facegently in herhands, turning it this way and thatto examinethe blisteredskin. \"Oh, Daniel. You didnottell me it wasso bad!That nonsenseyou got from the apothecary will beuseless.\"</p><p>Then she turned to scowl ather son.\"Didyou know aboutthis last night? \" she asked sharply, and read the answer in his expression. \"Well, you shouldhave told me about this. She needs Grandmama'sremedy forcertain.\"Sighing, she turned back to stareat Valoree one more time, then released Valoree's face and shook her head.\"Itis agood thing I stoppedbyto see what was about. Now, whereis your kitchen? \"</p><p>\"Kitchen? \" Valoree repeated blankly. Her mind was still taken with the factthat Danielhad stopped atanapothecary's to pick up some salvefor her \"poor face.\" For some reason, that fact made her feel all warm and squishy inside. It wasafeeling she wasn't sure sheliked, but was farbetter thanthe irritation allthe false compliments her suitorshad been raining on herhad caused.</p><p>\"Yes, dear. Bessy will need to mix up Grandmama's remedy.\"</p><p>Shefrowned now. \"I wish I hadknown about this sooner.I would have brought the ingredients, but hopefully yourcookwillhave them on hand. Where is the kitchen? \"</p><p>\"Uh ... well...\" Valoree glanced uncertainly down the hall.</p><p>Petey hated anyone in his kitchen. At sea or on land, it wasthe one thingon whichhe tended tostand firm. Noone wasto mess about in hisgalley. Not even her.</p><p>'Thisway, isit? \" Lady Thurborneasked, movingdeterminedly inthe direction Valoreehad involuntarily glanced. \"Comealong, Bessy, \" shesaidto her maid. \"There is notimeto waste.\"</p><p>\"Damn, \" Valoree said underher breathas the woman sailed down the hall andthroughthekitchen door.</p><p>\"You might like to call your aunt in on this one, \" Daniel suggestedwith a repressedsmile, andValoreeglanced to where hestillstood with his back tothesalondoor.</p><p>\"My aunt? \"</p><p>\"Aye, \" he said with something that seemed oddly like sympathy. \"And your uncle, too. My mother will march right overyou if youdo not have plenty of support.\"</p><p>Valoree blinked in amazement at the claim, then shook her head. She was the captain ofa pirateship! The dayshe could not handle one little old lady... Her thoughtsdied as a clatter inthe kitchen was followedby some vigorous cursing. Frowning, she started up the hall, but paused halfway there when Lady Thurborne stuck herheadout. The woman gave a brilliant smile.</p><p>\"Ifound your cook, \" she sangout cheerfully, not even wincing ata secondround of oathsbehindher.\"He is the temperamental sort, I see. So is mine.All artistsare. Not to worrythough; we shall getalong famously.\"</p><p>Her headdisappeared back into thekitchen, there was a great racket, and then there was complete silence. Valoree hesitated, unsure at that point whether she really wished to know what was going on. Danielspokefrom behind her. \"Your aunt wasnotin there, was she? \"</p><p>Valoree glanced over to see him nod toward the door he guarded, but shookher head. \"Nay, she wentup to herroom.\"</p><p>\"Ah. Good, she will be well rested and in fighting form.</p><p>Perhaps youshould send someone upto gether.\"</p><p>Valoree paused, then sighed and nodded to Bull. The giant left his post by the door and started up the stairs at once. \"Find Henry, too, \"shecalled after him, then walked toward thesalon door Daniel was guarding. \"I suppose I had best tend to my suitorswhile Iam at it.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Is that what you call them? \" Daniel asked a bit peevishly, straightening away from the door. \"I would havethought greedy gold-diggers to bea better description.\"</p><p>\"Oh, sod off, Thurborne, \" she muttered. With that, she reached for the doorknob andtugged the dooropen.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p> <p>\"Marryme andyou can simply tell them all to just goaway.\"</p><p>Valoree grimaced at the wordsDaniel whispered inher ear and sighed. She supposed he had been encouragedby her pauseat openingthe door. It wasn't that she didn't know what to do. It was that shecouldn't believe how many men had responded to the gossip. There wereatleast thirtyof them, and of all ages, shapes, and sizes. If She hadrealizedhow easy getting them to her door would be, she neverwouldhave bothered withallthe nonsenseof dresses and makeupandsocials. She simply would have sent Henry and Meg tohavea chatwiththeappropriate parties, then sat backto await the arrival of every single malein London who wished to marry money. But now they were here, andshe had toweed through them and decide which was the weakest, and in the most desperatestraits. She would marry him.</p><p>IgnoringDaniel, she straightened her shoulders and addressed the waiting mob of men.\"Everysingle one of you is heretoday because you heard the rumors yesterday about my being wealthy and needing to marry to claim my childhood home, Ainsley Castle.\"</p><p>She hadbarely finished making that statement when the men rumbled to life with denials.Oh, no theyweren't there because she needed tomarry!They werethere tobaskin her beauty.To wallow in her wit. To enjoyher intellect.</p><p>Valoreerolledhereyes. \"You can stop your nonsense now, \"</p> <p>she interrupted. \"You canall seethatI suffered a reaction tothe foundation and fucus I wore to yesterday's ball. There is no beautyto bask in. AndIam not feeling particularly wittytoday either.Soif you aren'there with an interest in marryingme for my wealth, then you can leave now.\"</p><p>There was an uncomfortable silence as the men peered anywhere but at her. Valoree supposed thesudden shifting and nervous silence were because thelords of the tonwere not used to suchopen honestyin regards tomotive. She supposed they all wouldhavebeenmore comfortable to play a game where she pretended they all were ensnaredby her femininewiles, andthey pretended she found them the most interesting creatures alive.</p><p>Well, pirates did not goin much for lies! Their motives were wealthandthey madeno bonesaboutit. That was the society she'd learned to respect. She had neither the patience nor the intent to lie her way through several weeks of courting, smothered by smarmy compliments thatweren'tsincere.</p><p>Despite their discomfort, she noted, not a single man leftthe room. Valoreenodded her headsolemnly, then said, \"To inherit, my husband has to be a member of the nobility. If youare not such, you mayas wellleave now.\"</p><p>There was a murmurof voices and a general shiftingofbodies as first one man, then two others, made their way out of the crowd and moved past where she and Daniel stood by the door.</p><p>Well, she thought, three down and twenty-seven to go. \"Imust also have birthed a child, or be carrying onebymy twenty-fifth birthday - which is a little less than nine months away, \" she continued. There was dead silence in answer. Valoree frowned slightly.She hadhoped at least another oneor two men might be eliminated by that.They couldn't all be thrilled tobed her. Just as she would have opened her mouth to speak again, Daniel startled herby interrupting.</p> <p>\"LadyAinsley's uncle will, of course, have you all thoroughly investigatedto discoverwhetheryou are truly members of the nobility... Also, that you have not suffered any injury or illness that mightraise some doubt as to your ability to perform the necessarytask of providing an heir, \" he announced pleasantly. A sudden ripple of alarm wound through the group. Valoree watched inamazement as more than half her remaining suitors made a quick exodus.</p><p>\"All of them could not be unable to produce heirs, \" she murmuredto Daniel in disbelief. He shookhis head slightly.</p><p>\"Nay. Doubtless some of them werenot really nobility, but had hoped to be ableto convinceyou theywere long enough to trick you intomarriage. Then, too, someof themmay have skeletons in their closets that they do notwish uncovered byyour uncle's 'investigations.' \"</p><p>Valoree nodded. That madesense. Notthat she hada problem with skeletons inone'scloset. She had seventy-five of her own, every oneof themaliveand breathing and eagerto seeher bound in marriage. Resigned, she eyed the twelve menleft to choose from. Then, sensing a presencebehind her, she glancedover her shoulderto see Henry standing there, his eyebrows raisedasthe dozen men left.</p><p>\"Bullsaidyou were wantin' me, \" he explained, then gestured to the room at large. \"What happened to the restof 'em? \"</p><p>\"We weeded out the ones who weren't nobles, orable to father anheir, \" Valoreeanswered, perusing the suitors that were left.As she turned back, she thought she saw. an odd glint in her quartermaster's eye, but he was peering at Daniel.</p><p>\"What are ye going to do with the rest of 'em? \" Thurborne asked.</p><p>Valoree was silentfor a moment, then turned toglance athim, aslight grimace on her face. \"I suppose Ishall have to spend some time with each to seewhichone would suit best.\"</p> <p>\"Or you could saveyourself the trouble and marry me, \" Daniel put in.Valoree saw Henry regard the man again, andshe quickly moved to squash that notion.</p><p>\"I already know you would not suit. She turned to Henry.</p><p>\"Take them allto the dining room. Schedule visits witheach of them sothat I can see what theyare about, Henry. Ifwe work this right, we couldbe out ofthisstinking town by week's end.\"</p><p>Nodding, her right-hand man facedthe men. \"All right. We're moving into the diningroom now. I'll get ye names and schedule each ofye with an appointment to return, then ye can leave.</p><p>Follow me.\"</p><p>Valoree and Daniel stood asideas the crowd vacatedher salon, each man pausing to give her smarmy smile, andkiss her hand with varying degreesof a passion. Each assured her they could not wait fortheir visitation.Shaking her head as shewatchedthe last man troop out thedoor, Valoree released abreath with what she told herself was satisfaction.There was not a single real man among the bunch. This endeavorto find aneasily subdued mate shouldbe quickly successful.The feat She had thought impossible was suddenly beginning to look simple.</p><p>\"Aloneat last, \" Daniel murmured, pressing a kisstoherneck that madeher jump in surpriseand wheelon him.</p><p>\"That'll be enough o' that, it will, \" she snapped, quashingthe shivers the briefcaresshadsentthrough her. There wasatime for business anda time for fun afterall - andshe was still on business time.</p><p>\"Your language is slipping, \" he said with a wicked smile, insinuating his arms around her waist and pulling her stiff body against his own. \"I notice it tends to turn into something resembling the speech of a dock-side doxy when you get excited.\" His hands slid down her backtoclasp her bottom and urge her tighter against him so that their lower bodies were molded together. \"Oddly enough, I findthatexcites me.Can you tell how much? \"</p><p>\"You - \"</p><p>\"Daniel!\"</p><p>Releasing Valoree at once, Thurborneleapedguiltily awayat his mother's scandalized roar from the doorway, then caught himself. Scowling at her, hequickly affecteda slightly wry smile.</p><p>\"Done playing in the kitchen, Mother? \"</p><p>Beforeshe could respond, Meg appearedbehind her. \"Why, Lady Thurborne! What a pleasant surprise. Zachariah said we hadcompany, but did not mention who itwas.\"</p><p>Valoree was puzzling over the name Zachariah when she caught a glimpse of Bull moving across the hall, his face contorted with mingled embarrassment and displeasure.</p><p>Zachariah? She hadn't even knownthat that was his realname.</p><p>God'steeth! It was no wonder he preferred to be called Bull.</p><p>\"Do come in andsitdown.\" MegurgedDaniel's mother and her maid into theroom and toward the chairsandsettee. \"Valoree, dear, willyou ask one of the mentohave Peter bring ussome refreshments? Tea, and perhaps some biscuits or scones, \" she added pointedly.</p><p>Just in case I thoughtrumand a sideof beefwould do, Valoree supposed with vague amusement, turning to walk out into the hall. When shedid, shenoticed Bull was missingfrom his spot by the door. Shesupposed hewas down inthe dining salon with Henry, sizing up her suitors. No doubt all the men were. It affectedthem, after all. No doubt the bloody bastards thought they could vote on which one she married, too. Well, letthem.</p><p>Shedidn't care what they did at this point. In fact, she didn't reallymuchcarewhich shemarried.Although, had her lifebeen anormal one, and her needs notso specific, She had toadmit that Thurbornewouldhave been an interesting option. Hereminded her very much of her dearly departed brother, at least in his determination and strength.Aye, she liked Thurborne.</p><p>But she had beenin chargeof her crew for toolongto give up her power to another and play the submissive, dutiful wife. Not that she even could haveif she had wanted to.She had no skills inthatarea - didn't know the first thing aboutit, and didn't want to. Being a ladyandwife seemedincredibly boring next to her yearsof adventureon the high seas.</p><p>\"Ah, Lady Ainsley.\"</p><p>Drawn from her thoughts, Valoree looked blanklyat the fellow she had nearlywalked into, recognizinghim as oneof her suitors.</p><p>He wasa hardone toforget. The man's name was Alcock, which was fitting sincehe dressed likea peacock. He was also short with ascrawny little neck and shoulders, and a rather wide rump.</p><p>Amost unfortunate physique, she decided as he drew her hand into his and lifted it to press tiny butterfly kisses across her knuckles.</p><p>Withhis lipsstill pressedtoherhand, he peeredup atherin what she considered a rheumy manner. 'Truly you are as lovely as a freshsummer day. How itpainsme tosay adieu.\"</p><p>\"Aye.Me, too, \" Valoreelied, snatching her hand back. Then, using it to catch hiselbow, she propelledhim firmlytowardthe door.\"Nowwatch your step on the way out, \" she sang outwith feigned good cheer. Pulling thedoor open, she gave him a shove that sent him stumblingout intothestreet, and sheclosed the door behindhim with a snap.</p><p>\"Lovely asafresh summer day indeed, \" shemuttered with a scowl, fullyawareshe looked anything but lovely. Unless one likedrashes . ..</p><p>\"Henry!\" she yelled, starting up the hall, then paused whenthe door to the dining salon opened. Henry'sheadpopped out. \"Cross Alcock off the list.He'stoo damn prissy formy liking. Andhave Peteyfetch some refreshments;we have company.\"</p><p>Henry's gazeshotaroundthe entry questioningly and Valoree sighed.\"Lady Thurborne has joinedher soninthesalon.\"</p><p>Nodding, Henry turned backto the room, addressing someone.</p><p>A momentlater One-Eye slid out andmoved into thekitchen to pass her message on toPetey.</p><p>Leavingthem to it, Valoree returnedto the salon in time to hear Megsaying in apained voice, \"I fearher uncle was not very strict with her over the years. Hehad no ideawhat todo withthe poorgirl, and it hasbeenup to me to tryto instill alifetime's lessonsin manners inavery short period.She is coming along nicely, of course, but still occasionally forgets somelittlething.</p><p>Suchas that ladies never raise their voices, \" she added, turning to eye her\"niece\" with some annoyance.</p><p>\"She isdoing fine.\"</p><p>Valoree's answering glare at Meg faded abruptly, replacedwith amazement as Lady Thurborne championed her.\"She isa lovely girl, and with perfectly lovely manners. I must confess that I myself sometimesforget andcallout to, or for, my servants more loudly than is thought proper.\"</p><p>Meg smiled doubtfully atthat, butValoree choseto ignore her.</p><p>Lady Thurborne continued, \"Daniel mentionedtome thatLady Valoree had suffered a reaction toher makeup lastevening, so I thought I wouldcomeover and see if therewas notsomething I could do.\"</p><p>\"Oh, that was very kindofyou, \"Meg answered, tsk-tsking as she peeredatValoree's ravagedface. \"I fear we havejust not had much luck with cosmetics on the girl. Lastnightwas the second foundation we have tried sincearriving, and the secondtime we have had problems. I fear she just is not suited to such concoctions.\"</p><p>\"Well, it certainly does not seem to have affected her popularity any, \"LadyThurborne said brightly.</p><p>\"Yes, well, \" Daniel piped up, \"it appears Lady Valoree isin much the same boat as myself. She must marry to gain her inheritance. Someone let thatslip, and it has made the gossipmill.</p><p>Every secondson anddown-on-his-luck lord in London showed up here today.\"</p><p>\"Oh!\" Lady Thurborne's eyes widened slightly; then she confided, \"Well, I had heard something about that. About the will, I mean. Actually, I am surprised that you are notmarried already, dear.Surely there were some marriageable menon that island you grewup on? Whichisland was it? \"</p><p>Meg sidestepped the question for her. \"As to meeting marriageable men, IfearHenry, Valoree's uncle, was not very interested in society. It was not until we married that Henry understood the importance of society and a coming-out and marriage. Hence the reason Valoree iscoming out at such an advanced age.\"</p><p>Valoree's head whipped around at the \"advanced age\"</p><p>comment, a scowl darkening herexpression. She wasn't that old.</p><p>\"How old are you, dear? \" Lady Thurborne asked with curiosity. Valoree hesitated, then answered reluctantly.</p><p>\"Four and twenty.\"</p><p>\"Oh, dear!\"</p><p>Valoree grimaced at the woman's shock and dismay. She'd reactedas if She had said sixty.</p><p>\"Aye.\" Meg's expression wasdisconsolate, but Valoree swore she sawa spark of humor in her eyes. \"Such aproblem.Andthen there is the codicil to her father's will, which adds even more urgency to the issueof marriage.\"</p><p>\"Iheardaboutthat, too, \" Lady Thurborne confided. \"I was told that to inherit, she has to be married and have ababe - or at least bewithchild - by her next birthday.

Even Lady Thurborne's maid looked shocked that Valoreehad refused the man. Lady Thurborne shook her head.</p><p>\"Well, Daniel. 'Tis no wonder sherefused.Nogirl wishes to be proposed to so cavalierly. Theylikeromance, sweet words, and charming gifts. No doubt those gentlemen Bess and I saw parading down the hallaswecame out of thekitchen will offer thosethings if you will not. There must have been a dozen men - were there not, Bessy? \" She glanced toward her maid, her eyes suddenly widening as they landed on the bowl the girl stood patiently holding.\"Oh!

Glancing up athim, Valoree found herself staring withfascinationat his eyes. They sparkled withlife, and actually seemed to twinkle in hishandsome face.</p><p>\"Well, shall wedo it over here? \"</p><p>Forcing hergaze away from the woman's son, Valoree saw that Lady Thurborne had moved to achair by the fire and was now waiting for her expectantly.</p><p>\"Come, Valoree.Sit here and we shallhaveyou looking and feeling betterinno time.\"</p><p>Valoree's gaze slid from the bowl to theseat the woman was encouragingly patting.She really didnot want any more stuff on herface.</p><p>\"Mother's concoctions are really quite miraculous, \" Daniel announced, his eyes alight with laughter. \"She is infamous among the tonfor them.\"</p> <p>\"I have helped quite a few people over the years with one ailmentor another.\" Lady Thurbornesmiled modestly. \"Come, dear. Sithere.\"</p><p>\"Ido not think - \"Valoree began, only to be interrupted by Meg.</p><p>\"Oh!A brilliant idea, andso kind of you to think of it.\" The woman was suddenly at Valoree'sotherside, giving her apoke.</p><p>\"Hey, that hurt!\" Valoree exclaimed, glaringat her. Sheturned that glare towardDaniel as alaugh slippedfromhim.</p><p>\"I am sorry, dear. Why do you not sit over there as Lady Thurborne suggested? \" Meg urged, adding under her breath so onlyValoree could hear, \"OrshallIfetch Henry andthe men to vote on it? \"</p><p>Furiousbut unwilling to be further humiliated, Valoree moved reluctantly to the chair andtook a seat. The moment she did so, the three women closed inon her, blockingany possibility of escape as Lady Thurborne's maid dipped her fingers in the bowl of goo.</p><p>Craning her neck slightly, Valoree examinedthe contents. It was graywith reddish chunks in it.She opened her mouth to ask what it was, thensnapped her lips closed and leaned back as far as she couldin an effort to avoid the maid's hand - it had come out of theguck witha nasty glob of salveon thefingertips and moved toward her face. Unfortunately, seatedand surrounded as she was, there wasno escaping. It was coldand slimy as the maid began to smooth it around.</p><p>Valoreeimmediately wrinkledhernose atitssmell. \"What is it? \"</p> <p>\"An old family recipe, \" Lady Thurborne told her, watchingthe application closely. \"It is passedon only to family members.\"</p><p>\"What a shame, \" Valoree lied. Not that Lady Thurborne seemed tonotice.Daniel did, though, and she was gratified by a snort of amusement from him. She found herself thinking that she liked it whenhe laughed. Especiallywhen she'd made himdo so.</p><p>He had a nicelaugh, fulland deep and robust. His eyes sparkled, andhis teeth flashed.And hehad all histeeth - withnot a brown, gray, orblack one among them. Pretty impressive, she thought.</p><p>He wasa handsomeman. She had seenprettier men, perhaps, but there was just something about him that appealed to her.</p><p>\"You couldhaveit if the two of you married.\"</p><p>Valoree blinked at Lady Thurborne's sly words, her mouth dropping slightly. Then Meg added, \"Oh, would that notbe nice, \"</p><p>in a vaguelyamused tone. Valoree glared at the older woman, quite positiveMeg knew that She had no interest atall inmaking Daniel her husband.He was too ... Well, hejust wasn't right for whatshe had in mind! \"You should not grimace, dear. Youwill getwrinkles, \" Meg lectured sweetly. Valoree glared at her silently as her face was quicklycovered in chunkyslime.</p><p>\"Oh, my, Mother.What wondrous stuff this is. Ibelieve I see an improvement already, \" Daniel said as he peered over the woman's shoulder at Valoree's face. Her eyes immediately snapped to him, spitting fire, but he merely winked inresponse.</p><p>His mother turned andslapped him playfullyon the arm.</p><p>\"Oh, do behave, Daniel. You shouldnot even be here.Why do you not go visit with the men? \"</p><p>\"Because this is far more interesting, and even educational.\"</p><p>\"You know, \" Lady Thurborne murmured, drawing Valoree's gaze back to her expressionas she peeredthoughtfully at Meg, \"you look terribly familiar, my lady. Is it possible wehave metin the past? Perhaps ere your journey to the Caribbean? \"</p><p>\"Me? \" Meg stammered. \"Oh, nay. Nay. I have been in the Caribbean since I was quiteyoung. Quite young.\" Sheglanced around a bit desperately; then hergaze settled on thedoor. In a voice strident with sudden anxiety, she added, \"I had best go and seeto those refreshments. Our cook appearsto betaking histime with them.\"</p><p>\"Oh, nay!\" Valoree shot outofher chair, herfirst opportunity to escape presentingitself. \"I shall tend tothat. Youshould stay and visit. Who knows, mayhapyou and Lady Thurborne knew each other aschildren.\"</p><p>Meg looked quite upset inthe glimpse Valoree had of her face as she slid out of the room - distraught even, almost ina panic. It was enough to make Valoree feel a touch guilty.Almost. Not being used to the sensation, she shrugged her shoulders uncomfortablyasshestrode down thehall. It did not help. The guilt remained solidly across her shoulders like a cloak. This nobility business wasreally starting to irritateher. Nothing was fun anymore, not even a littlegood-natured spite! Cursing underher breath, shepushed through the doors into the kitchen.She hadbarely registered the empty room andthe open back door whensomething slammed into the back of her head. Lights exploded behindher eyes, nausea rolled up from her stomach, andthenthose lights faded to darkness.</p><p>Thehue andcry coming fromsomewherenear the backof the town house was the first indication Daniel had that anything was wrong.Aware that thewomen were following, hemoved swiftly out of thesalon toward the shoutsandcries of alarm downthe hall. There, a good half-dozenofValoree'ssuitors were clogging the entranceto the kitchens.</p><p>\"What is it? Let me through, \" heordered, makinga path where therehad been none even beforethe men began to shift out of the way. Reaching the front of the pack, he found himself staring down ataneven tighter circlethat consistedof Valoree's uncle andthemen who passedfor her servants. They were bent over an unconsciousValoree.Kneeling beside the girl, her uncle reached for her shoulderand turned herontoherback. A horrified gasp immediately wentaround the men.</p><p>\"MyGod! Look at what they done toher face, \"theservant with the eye patch criedas Valoree'suncle sat back in dismay.</p><p>\"That is salve, \" Daniel explained, pushingthrough the servants tokneel beside her.\"Did she faint? \"</p><p>\"The captain don't - \" An elbow in his side silenced the one-eyed fellow's scornful comment.</p><p>\"My niece is not prone to fainting fits, \" Meg said quickly, drawing Daniel'sattention from the servant.</p><p>\"Aye, and notonlythat, she just don'tdo it, \" thefellow missing hisnose muttered.</p><p>\"And she didn'tthis time, unlessshe hit her head on the way down.\" Henry announced thatashe pulled thehand thathe had cradledher head with away, revealing a stain ofblood.</p><p>\"Onsomething like this, maybe? \" the cook said sarcastically, bending to pick up abloodyrolling pin.</p><p>\"Seems more likely it would fall on herthan her falling on it, \"</p><p>One-Eye said grimly, turning to coldlyeye thesuitors. \"AndI'm wondering which ofyou helpedit fall.\"</p><p>\" 'Tweren't none of them, \" Henry snapped as Daniel pulled a hankie outto press toValoree's head. \"Couldn'thave been. They were in the dining salon with you, me, and Bull. Petey - you found her, didn't you? Where were you? \"</p><p>\"Out hagglingwiththefishmonger.\" He gestured to aspilled basket on the floor by the door. He hadobviously dropped itin hisrush toget tohis mistress's side;his purchases were spilled out ontothefloor.</p><p>Henry nodded, then glanced at Daniel and the women questioningly.</p><p>\"We were inthe salon.LordandLady Thurborne, her maid, andmyself, \" Meg said quietly.</p><p>\"Yedidn't hear or see anything? \"</p><p>\"I was the first one out the door, and did not see or hear anything exceptyour cook shouting, andyou men rushing into the kitchen, \" Daniel said impatiently, lifting Valoree into his arms. He stood.\"I am taking her into the salon to be attended to.</p><p>I suggest you have theservantssearch the house. It is doubtful you will find anything, but it cannothurt to be sure.\"</p><p>\"Aye-aye, \" Valoree'suncle agreed, risingas well. \"Bull, seethe men into thedining salon, I'llbe along directly.One-Eye, Skully, No-Nose, you start searching the house. Whoever it was is probablylong goneby now, but lookanyway. Petey, cleanthis mess up.\" Daniel heard the orders being issued as he carried Valoree out of the kitchensandback down thehalltowardthe salon. Meg, his mother, and her maidimmediatelyfollowed.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\"Captain? \"</p><p>Valoree murmuredgroggily, wincing as herhead protested her return to consciousness. Blinking her eyes open, she moaned, then quicklypressed themclosed again.</p><p>\"Ye'dbest call the others.\"</p><p>\"Aye.\"</p><p>There was a rustle as someone left her side, then a door opened. A high, piercingwhistlerent theair, and she recognized Skully's voiceshouting. \"Hoy! She'sawake!\"</p><p>Groaning, Valoreeraisedher hands miserably to press them to either side of her head. Shefelt as though someone were doing a dance on it.If she'd hadthe strength, she wouldhave risenfrom herbed and ripped the man's tonguefromhis mouth.</p><p>\"Captain? \" One-Eye's voice sliced through her head, and she let her handsdrop away in despair.</p><p>\"Aye. I'mawake, \" shesaid in disgust, just toshut the two men up. Then, forcing her eyesopen, she straggled to sit upas she saw that she was lying in bed. Reaching out, One-Eye quickly propped pillowsbehind herand grasped her under the arms to assisther in leaningagainst them. Hadshe beenin a better mood, Valoreemighthavethanked him. As it was, she didn't bother.</p><p>Instead, she granted as Henry and Meg rushed into the roomwith the other crewmen at their heels.</p><p>\"How're yefeeling? \"Henry asked anxiouslyashe reached her bedside.</p><p>\"Likehell, \" Valoree snapped, then scowledaround at thefaces surrounding her. \"What happened? \"</p><p>\"Yedon't remember? \"he asked.Valoree sighed.</p><p>\"Would I askif Idid? The last thing I remember is that Meg wanted togo checkon the tea.I said, nay, I'd doit.

At least, not here. Now, if this were Spain, or maybe evenFrance or Holland, and people knew who she was... Well, that was another story.Buthere in England? She did noteven knowanyone here, otherthan her own men and the few people she had metso far.</p><p>\"Thurborne suggestedwe postsomeone towatchthe back door as well asthe front for awhile, to keep an eyeout, just to make sure, \" One-Eye added. Valoree nodded again. Sensible and cautious.

Valoree blamed it onthe dresses She had been forced to wear. They never would have looked at her likethisafter akoshingbeforethey'd heard she was really a girl.When shewas Captain Valerian, they wouldhave gone about their workand left Henry to tend to her wounds.Now they allthoughther so fragile they had to see forthemselves that she wasall right, and even then they looked reluctant to look away orleave her.Hell, she mightdropdead while theyweren't looking! \"Oh, goon, get out of here, \"she saidin a snarl.\"Myhead is pounding something fierce.\"</p><p>\"Aye, come on, let her rest, \"Henryordered, straightening and urging the rest of themen awayfromthebed. \"She'll be fine.</p><p>She's suffered worse than this before.\"</p><p>\"Go ahead.

Beingthe only onewho had knownhertrue sex, he had always beenthe oneto tend her whenshe was ill or injured - and he had also always tended to fuss overher like a mother hen.</p><p>\"Do yeneed anything? \"he asked, settling himself on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\"Nay. Thanks, \"she added a bit gruffly, then waited, knowing him well enough tosuspect he had something to say. She didn't have long to wait.</p><p>\"Daniel seems a fine boy, \" he murmured, and Valoree glowered at him. Lord Thurborne wasa man, not a boy. Still, Henry calledanyoneunder his own nearly sixty yearsboy or girl.</p><p>\"Aye, \"she agreedatlast.</p><p>\"Heis smart, strong, and handsome. Virile, too.\"</p> <p>\"Aye, \"Valoree agreed, trying notto smile at thatlast comment.</p><p>What would Henry knowaboutthat?</p><p>\"You noticed, then? \"he asked hopefully.

I can tell ye likehim.And - \"</p> <p>\"Henry, I need a husband I can control, and Daniel does not strike me as verycontrollable.\"</p><p>Theold man scowled at that reasoning.\"A wife ain't supposed tocontrol - \"</p><p>\"A normal wife, mayhap, butI am not a normal woman! There isnothing normal about me, \" shesaid.</p><p>He hesitated atthat, then peered down athis handas he began plucking atthe linen sheets. \"Iknow you haven't had theusual childhood, girl, but now is your chance for a normal life.</p><p>Wouldn't you liketo set down your burdenand lean on - \"</p><p>\"I leaned on Jeremy once, \" she interrupted quietly. \"I have learnedmylesson.\"</p><p>\"Jeremy didn'tmean to let you down.He didn't mean todie.

The men could have voted in another captainand I could have found myselfsuddenly alone and destitute. I probably would have endedup dead, or a prostitute.Iwill not everbe weak like that again. I want to run my own life. Nosurprises, no - \"</p><p>\"Passion? \" Henry suggested sadly. \"I understand what ye're saying, girl. Butdo you? \"</p><p>She felt surprise at that, then asked warily, \"What do you mean? \"</p><p>\"What I hear ye sayingis that ye're afraid.\" She started to protest, but he waved her to silence. \"Ye're afraid to be hurt again.To love and lose. Tocare andsuffer. To do those things, ye gotta give up control. I've said it before: ye've no fear of dying, but ye're terrifiedto live.\" Seeing herclosedexpression, he sighed and got tohis feet.\"Ye must betired. I'llleave ye to rest.</p><p>Yer first visit with oneof themsuitors is midmorning tomorrow.\"</p><p>\".. .and she had a molecut to look like a carriage and horses thatsheinsistedonwearingrightabove her lip. It was themost disgustingthing, and yet she thought herself soclever for it.\"</p><p>Valoree forced a smileas Lord Gravennertittered at his own ancodote. He was thesecond of her scheduled visits of the day.</p><p>Unfortunately, hewas just as boring as LordShether, her first.</p><p>Shether had talked of nothing buthimself: how clever he was, how fashionable, how everyone adored him. Gravenner talked about everyone else: how stupid they were, how ugly, how terribly unfashionable anddull.Really!She didn'tknow which was worse. She did know, however, that both men were idiots and off her list of prospective husbands. Lack of personality aside, she didn't think that either man could be quietlongenough toaccomplish thetask of getting her withchild.If she wereeven capable of allowingthem near her.</p><p>Bothmen had decided ona \"nice walk in the park\"as their courtship activity, and Valoreehad briefly wondered if they were separatedtwins. Still, she'd foundthe proposal finefor thefirst appointment, so she, Shether, Meg, and Henry had set out on a walkwith good cheer. Half anhour intotheirpromenade around the park, they had run intoDaniel, who had \"just happened\" to be outfor a stroll himself.</p><p>Honestly, Valoree had beenrelieved to see the man. By that point, she had too long listened to a nonstop diatribe from Shether about his favorite topic - Shether. At first she had thought that the man was simply trying to let herknow as much about himself as he could to help her make her decision, but by the time they hadrun into Daniel, she had begun tothinkthatthe man was simply a bore. Lord Thurborne's amused and rather snide littlecomments when he joinedthemhadonly proved her right.</p><p>\"Shether iswell known as anexperton himself, \"had been one of Daniel's quips. It had madeher eyeswiden, her hand covering her mouth to hold back a laugh, and that laugh had nearly escaped whenShether hadagreed enthusiastically.</p><p>\"Aye, \" he'd said. \"He was an expert onhimself. Why he could tellher...\" And off he had gone, not even seeming to realize that the commenthadbeen a poke at his egotisticalpersonality. By the time they hadsaid good-byeto Daniel to return to the town house, Valoree's mouthwas sore from biting itin forbearance, andthemuscles in hercheeks ached from the effortnot tolaugh.</p><p>She had instructed Henryto crosstheman off the list themoment he had bidden them adieu and ridden off. Alas, they had entered the town house tofind Gravennerwaiting in the salon, eager to announce that he, too, had decided on a pleasant little walk.</p><p>Sighing, Valoree, Meg, and Henry had trotted out again, following the exact samepaththeyhad just trodden, this time running into Daniel right away. Stunned to find them there again, or sohe proclaimed, he had fallen into their groupand murmured, \"Lord Gravenner is the one to ask should you wish to know anything at all about the ton. Heis quite in the know.A very sharp fellow.\"</p><p>Valoree had raised an eyebrow at the twinkleinhis eyes as he'd said that, then turnedherattention to Gravenner. He, too, hadagreed with Lord Thurborne's assessment. \"Oh, my, yes. I know everyoneand everything. Forinstance ...\" Andoffhe had gone, into an attack on seemingly every member of society.</p><p>\"Lady Braccon isa cow, she ...\";\"Lord Snowtanis a dullard, he ...\";and so on and so forth. Valoree, aside from beginning to suffer aching feet, was heartily sick of the man with his cruel quipsand snide remarks. If it weren't for Daniel's gentle little jibes at the man - jibesGravenner, just likeShether, did not seem tograsp - -she wouldhave told Gravenner toshove off andhave headed home long ago. Instead, she was seeing thehumor inthe situation, sharing silent laughter with Daniel, and actually enjoying herself in an odd way.</p><p>\"Well, herewe are.\"</p><p>Meg's voice, heavy with relief, madeValoree glance aroundin surpriseto see that they had returned to the townhouse.</p><p>\"Aye. I can hardly believe it. The hour passed like mere moments in your company.\" Lord Gravenner turned to take Valoree's hand.\"It has been a true pleasure, my lady. I can hardly wait to enjoy yourcompany again.\"</p><p>Bending, he pressed akiss to her hand, then nodded to the groupatlarge and turnedto get into hiswaiting carriage. Valoree turned awayas it pulled off, her gazemoving to Henry.</p><p>\"Cross himoff the list? \"theolder man asked solemnly.</p><p>\"Aye. Who isnext? \"</p><p>\"Ye've a free hour between now and the next one, \" Henry informed her, pulling a piece of paper out of his pocket and contemplating it briefly before scratching out an entry, presumably Gravenner. \"I thought I'd best put rest periods in once in awhile - incaseone of the appointments ran overtime.\"</p><p>\"Hmmm.\" Valoree nodded, impressed with his forethought, thenstartedfor thedoor. \"Well, I do not know about the rest of you, butI could use adrink.\"</p><p>\"I intendto putmy feet up, \" Megmuttered, following her into the town house. \"I certainly hope the rest of the suitors have something alittlemore entertaining inmind thanwalkingabout jabbering about themselves ... orsniping about everyone else.\"</p><p>\"So doI, \" Valoree muttereddryly, stripping her gloves off her hands as she crossed the entry tothesalon.</p><p>\"What youneed is to giveyour feet a good soak, Meg, \" Henry commented, following Danielinand closing the front door.</p><p>\"Oh, thatdoes soundlovely.\" Theolder woman sighed, then shook her head. \"Mayhaplater. We should - \"</p><p>\"There's no better time than now, wife\" Henry arguedfirmly.</p><p>Pausing by the sideboard, Valoree glanced overin timeto see the man catchMeg by the arm, drag her around a startled Daniel, then pull her out of the salon.</p><p>\"Henry, what areyou doing? \" Meg gasped, struggling tofree her arm. \"I cannotsoakthemnow. Valoree cannot be left alone with agentleman caller. It isnot proper.\"</p><p>\"It ain't improperif noone knows aboutit. 'Sides, shecan take - \"</p><p>The door closedbehind the older couplewitha firm snap.</p><p>ValoreeandDanielwerebothsilentfor a moment, staringat the closed door; then their gazes met.</p><p>\"Well, \" he began with a smile, \"I would guess that means that I have your uncle's, approval.\"</p><p>\"Aye, \"Valoree admitted, then frowned and glanced back to the sideboard. She busied herself preparinga drink, then asked politely, \"Did youwant refreshment, mylord? \"</p><p>\"Please.\" The soundof hisvoice right behind her made her start slightly in surprise. Forcing herself to ignore him, she finished pouringtwodrinks, drawing itoutas long asshe could before picking up both and turning reluctantly to face him.</p><p>\"Here you are.\" She held one glass out.</p><p>\"Thank you.\" His voice was deeper than usual, softer as he closed his hand overhersonthe glass. \"Now perhaps you could tell me something? \"</p><p>Valoree glanced up tomeet his gaze, amazedto find herself suddenly nervous. \"I... Whatwould thatbe? \"</p><p>\"What itis I have todo to convinceyou to reconsider.\"</p><p>She didn't play dumb. She knew he was referring to her considering him as a potential husband, and her lips tightened slightly inself-defense.He was a temptingpackage. Especially when he stood thisclose, his bodyandlips a hairbreadth away, his hand gentlywarming hers around thecool drink. She took a deepbreathto tryto clearthe effecthe hadonher senses, but it just made thingsworse as she inhaled the scent of him.</p><p>\"Itold you, I donot reconsider, \" shebeganalmost desperately, buthe interrupted, finishing for her.</p><p>\"Unless there is a part of the equation thatwas left out. And there is, you know.\"</p><p>Valoree paused in surprise, her head cocking to the side.</p><p>\"What? \"</p><p>Taking both glasses, he reached his arms around her to set thembothon thesideboard.Then he caught her shoulders and drew her toward him, whispering, 'This.\" And then his lips covered hers, warm, soft, and seductive.</p><p>As before, Valoree was lost at once. Opening her mouth beneath his evenbefore he issued the invitation, shesoughtthe heat and excitement she hadexperienced in his mother's garden.</p><p>She had beenyearning for a repeat performance since thatnight, andwas honest enough to admit it, at least to herself, as she wrapped her arms aroundhis neck, archingso that her breasts pressed tightlyagainst him through their clothes.</p><p>Muttering a sound of surprised delight into her mouth, Daniel thrust his tongue inside, his hands slipping down her sides to grasp her waist. He inched forward, pressing her back until a sword blade couldn't have fitbetween herand the sideboard, or herand himself. When hismouth left hers to traildownher neck, shetipped her head slightly to the side, releasing amurmur of pleasure.Thenshe shuddered and broughther head back around topress akiss to, suck, then nip at his neck in return, enjoyingthe slightroughness ofhis skin against herlips andtongue.</p><p>\"Vixen.\" Daniel chuckled breathlessly, raisinghis head to kiss her lips again as hegrasped her by the waist andlifted her tosit on the sideboard.But then his kisses became moreteasingthan satisfying. Healternated between brushing hislipslightly over hers, then nippingather. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Agrowl offrustration slippingfrom herthroat, Valoree caught her handsin his hair to holdhisheadstill.

Her head snapped up in surprise, her eyes searching his face as hesuddenly removed his hands from under herskirtand stepped back. He crossed hisarmsand glaredat her.</p><p>He wasangry, sherealized with surprise.\"What? \"</p><p>\"Do I understand you to say that you have not changed your mind about marrying me? \"</p><p>\"Nay, ofcourse not, \" shesaid, surprised that he wouldthink so.</p><p>Taking in his grim expression, she realized hewas quite upset.</p><p>Sighing, she slidoff the sideboard and moved forward, placing her hands gently onhiscrossed arms. \"Do not takeit so. I like you and am attractedto you, but nothinghas changed. We simply wouldnot suit.\"</p><p>Uncrossing his arms to avoid her touch, he propped his hands on his hips and saidin disbelief, \"You meanyou areletting me touch you and makelove toyou like this when you have not decidedto marryme? \"</p><p>\"Well, sure.And why not? \"</p> <p>\"Whynot? \" He gasped in horror.\"Mayhapthings are different in the Caribbean; but herein England, ladies do not behave so with just anyone. Theysave themselves for their husbands.\"</p><p>\"Really? \"Valoree asked. She heardhisdoubting emphasis on the word Caribbean, but ignored itas She had the wayhe seemed to emphasize uncle when he spoke of Henry.She was gathering thathe didn'tbelieve their coverstory, yet for some reason she was more interested in this new bit of informationat the moment.</p><p>It seemed more relevant, since her body was throbbing and aching withdesire for him. Too, she found what he said hard to believe. Men didn't seem to wait to have sex until they were married. Themembers of her crew certainly didn't.Every single oneof themhad been with almost every willingwoman there was inthe warmer ports, and no doubt those on leavewere having a goodgo at those here in London at this verymoment.</p><p>In fact, Valoree was the only one on board the Valor who hadn't been with amember of the opposite sex. She had noteven beenkissed untilDaniel. But, living a lie as she had, it wasonly because the opportunityto do so had never come up. Valoree had no interest inwomen, and shecouldhardlyhave brought men on boardto satisfy any baser needsshe might have had. Besides, she really hadn't had any until now. An oddity, that, she thought.</p><p>None of the men, not One-Eye with his charming smile and ways, oreven Bull, whowas pure muscle and handsome ashell, had made her feel thewayshefeltwith Thurborne. She supposed it had somethingto do with growing up withthem; shethought of those men as family. But whatever the case, nowshe no longer needed to hide the fact that she was a woman, and she was attracted to the man before her - whynot have him?</p><p>\"Yes, really, \" Daniel said in exasperation and Valoree was drawn back to theirconversation.</p><p>\"Hmmm.\" She peered at himdoubtfully. \"So you'rea virgin, too? \"</p><p>\"Too? \" Daniel seemed tosag with relief, apparently pleased by the unintentional admission.Then whatshe had askedsank in, and he frowned. \"Nay, I... Only women mustrefrain until after they are married.\"</p><p>\"Aha!\"shecrowed a bit derisively. \"Ladies arethe only ones who must restrain themselves! Not men! Now, is that not interesting? \" she asked. \"Whoexactly would it be who made up that rule, do ye think? Men, mayhap? \"</p><p>\"Aye, but - \"</p><p>\"Now, why do you suppose that is? \"</p><p>\"So they would know that any heirs born of the union are theirs, \" he answered.</p><p>\"Oh, of course, \"she said with a sneer. \"That must be it. It wouldnot be another way tocontrol women.Nay, of course not.\"</p><p>\"Well.\" Hesmiledslightly. \"No doubt they enjoy the fact that it alsomakes women behavea certain way. But thefact is, a man - even myself - does not wish to leave his family estate and name to someone else's by-blow.\"</p><p>Valoree's eyebrows rose slightly;then she nodded herhead.\"I suppose I can understand how that might be an issue in the normal course of things, \" she admitted, then shrugged. \"But nothing about mysituation is normal. I amthe one with the land andtitle. I also must produce anheir. And as it is a businessdeal, whomever I marry willhave norights in the matter of what I do with my body. So . ..\"</p><p>Stepping closer, she pushed his undoneshirt off his shoulders, licking a path from his right nipple upto his neck asshe did. Then shepressed her breasts against his chest, kissed himjustbelow the ear, and murmured, \"Help me makea baby.\"</p><p>Daniel was tempted. Oh, dear Lord, was he tempted. He had never been quite so much soinhis life, infact. His body was screaming at himto just doit. Just grab her, dragher down tothe carpet, push her skirtsupto her belly, crawl between her sweet legs, and thrust himself into her untilhe cried out and spilled his seed.</p><p>Unfortunately, he wasn't sofargone that his brain didn'tstill work, and it was pointing outthe reasons whyheshouldn't. For instance, it certainly wouldnot help him out of his predicament of needing to marry. And if he did have to marry someone, Valoree was his choice. But that aside, if he did goahead and takewhat she wasoffering, and shemarried one ofthoseother oafs on her list of suitors, he would be imagining that man enjoying herbody, and knowing what itfelt like to do so. That would be sheer torture. Then again, she might be willing to continueto allow him access to her body aftershe marriedone of those other oafs - but he would still know that when she went homeat night, another man was enjoying crawling between her sweetthighs. On top of that, what if his seed took? If hedid take her as he wanted to, and she did produce a child as she must to inherit, he would always wonder if the child was his, and would have tolive with the factthat some other bastard was raising him.</p><p>\"Thurborne!\"</p><p>Glancing down with a start as she squeezed his hard manhood through his pants, Daniel stared at her with fascination. She wanted him. That desirewas written all over herface. Hercheeks were flushed, her eyesheld a mixtureof desire and impatience, and her naked nipples stoodproud and erect. Aye, shewanted him. Badly.Hmmm. Mayhap this wasa weapon he could usein hiswar forher hand in marriage.</p><p>Sniffing, hecrossed his arms andliftedhis chinso that he could glaredown hisnose at her self-righteously. \"Nay.\"</p><p>She blinked once, then drew her head back in amazement.</p><p>\"Nay? \"</p><p>\"Yes. Nay. Iam nothelpingyou have a childthat willbear someone else'sname, \" he announced primly. But then he added, \"However, if youwouldcare to reconsider and agreeto marry me...well, then, ofcourse I wouldbe obliged to - \"</p><p>\"All right.\"</p><p>Daniel paused and stared at her in amazement. He hadn't expectedit tobe this easy.\"All right? \"</p><p>\"Aye. All right, \" she repeated, thenreached up to tugher gown off hershoulders.It droppedto thefloor, leaving herstandingin apoolof silk in just a pair of tightblack breeches.</p><p>Very nice tightblackbreeches, he decided, taking a stepback toward herbeforecatching himself andstopping. Thiswas too easy. Hegazed at her face suspiciously for a moment, then asked, \"Youareagreeing tomarry me? \"</p><p>Her mouth twitched with irritation at hismakingher clarify, and he watched a struggle take place on her face; then she snapped, \"I am agreeingto reconsider.\"</p><p>\"Not good enough.\" Whirling away, hecontinuedhiswalk to thesideboard, pouredhimself a nice stiff drink, anddowned itin onegulp.</p><p>\"Thurborne!\" she snapped again, stomping a foot in impotent rage.</p><p>Daniel turned toglance ather, then wheeled abruptlyback to thesideboard. Damn, she was a sexy littlebundle when she was furious!\"Call me Daniel, \" hecalled over his shoulder. \"We know each other wellenoughfor that, I should think.\"</p><p>Instead she called him a string of words that he had never heard put together before. Actually, he decided, tossing back another drink, he had never heard a lady sayevenone of the words she had just uttered, letalone all of them togetherinsuch a creative manner.</p><p>She was still muttering some inventive, though not very pleasant, things that she wouldlike to do tohima, moment later when the rustle of clothing made himglance back tosee that she was donningher gown. Even thataction wassexy, he thought glumly, turning backforanother gulp of brandy beforereaching up tostraighten his own clothes.He had barelyfinisheddoing so when therewas a tap at thesalon doorand it was pulledopen by Henry. The man peeredhopefully inside.</p><p>His expression drooped immediately upon seeing the two of them standing so far apart; then his gaze narrowedon Valoree.</p><p>Daniel glanced toward her to see that while her hair was a touch disheveled, her dress was back in place. She also looked as sour as a lemon, however, and was glaring daggers in his direction.Ignoring her, Daniel smiled pleasantly at Henry. \"Come tojoin us? \"</p><p>\"Nay.\"he glowered at them. \"Thenextsuitor's here.\"</p><p>\"Hmmph.\" Valoree started forthe dooreven asHenry pulled it open and stepped aside. Daniel couldn'tatfirstsee the manin question.He did, however, seeValoree's responseto him. She stumbled to a halt, her eyes widening slightly, then flashed a brilliantsmile and moved forward again, holdingout herhand. A figure immediately stepped through the door totake theproffered appendage, liftingit for a kiss.</p><p>Daniel stewed. Henry had let him know shortly after the incident that had leftValoreelyingunconscious onthefloorin thekitchen that hishope was for Daniel and Valoreeto come to anunderstanding. Ithad happenedafter Valoreehad been carried toher room and whilethewomenwere undressing and tending to her. The two men had waited in the salon, and Henry had confessedas much, then informedhim of her first suitors and their intendedactivities. He hadalso said thatthere wouldbe an hour between the firsttwo and the third fellow that Daniel could take advantage of, but hehad notmentionedwhothe next fellow was. Now Daniel nearly groaned aloud as he recognized the golden-haired man with thewinningsmile.Hawghton. Of allthe bloody luck! \"My lord.\" Valoree moved a step closer to the man as he releasedher andstraightened, andDaniel felt his hands clenchat hissides.</p><p>\"Lady Ainsley, \" Hawghton purredin his perfect voice, flashing her his perfect smile. \"I must say thatyour beauty is a pleasant surprise. Ifeartherash youwere sporting yesterday did notshow you off toadvantage.\"</p><p>Daniel grimaced at that.She was lookinglovely today. Her face was free of makeup, and completely recovered thanks to his mother's miracle salve.Probably one of theonlytimes thatone of herdamn salves hadactually worked, too, he thought bitterly.</p><p>That figured.</p><p>\"Thank you, my lord. Itis sokindof youto say so, \" she purred, then tossed a glare in Daniel's direction, asif to underlinethe fact that he hadnot.</p><p>\"Oh, Thurborne, \" Hawghton greeted, as if just noticing his presence. \"I did not see you at first, old man.\" Then a concerned expression crossed his face. \"I am sorry, did I getthetimewrong?

Then he seemed to come to some decision and turned on his most charming smile. \"Well, then. I thought mayhap we couldattendthe theater this afternoon.

You werejustleaving, were younot? \"</p><p>Nodding, Daniel set thedrink he hadbeen holding down, then movedsilently toward her.Shedidn't waitfor him, butstepped out into the hall, leaving him to follow. By the time he had reached the hall, she was at the front doorand pullingit open.</p><p>Pulling the door tothesalonclosedwith a snap, Daniel crossed to Valoree determinedly, caught her about the waist, and drew her against hischest.She tried to bring her armsup, but he had pinned them nicely to her side. Then she opened her mouth, probably to bestow upon him a few more of her colorful endearments, buthe covered hermouthwith hisown, taking full advantage of the moment.</p> <p>Valoree didn't crumble right away - she did have some backboneto her - but when he pushed the door closedwith his foot, caught her hands, and held them behindher back with one of hissothatthe other could roam freely over her breasts, sheat least stilled and stopped struggling.It took several minutes of thorough kissingandfondlingbefore sheactually began to kiss him back, butonlya moment or so more afterthat before she was as liquid fire inhisarms and moaning intohismouth.That was when he stopped.</p><p>Taken bysurprise, she sagged against the wall and watched blanklyas he straightened his cravat and cuffs.</p><p>\"I justthought I would leave yousomething to remember me by, \" he saidwith a wink, then opened the door and slipped out quickly.A growl of rageslid from her throatandshe grabbed a vasefromthe table beside her. Daniel pulled thedoor closed and chuckledas he heard the smashof glass behind it.</p><p>The battle lines, it seemed, had been drawn.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>\"Icannot believe youdidthat!\" Meg snapped, climbing intothe carriage and seatingherself across from Valoree so that she could glare at her throughthe darkness. \"What on earth is thematter with you? Are you deliberately trying to ruin any possibility of finding a husband andclaimingyour inheritance? Becauseif you are, you are doing a fine job ofit!\"</p><p>\"There is nothing the matter with me, \" Valoree snapped impatiently. \"Scrantom was feelingme up with his stinky old foot underthetable!\"</p><p>\"What? \"Megblinked in amazement, seeming at a loss for a moment; thenshe sighed impatiently.\"Well, that may be, but an old man playing a littlefootsie - \"</p><p>\"Footsie? \" Valoree snorted her disgust.\"He had hisfoot under my skirt, halfwayup my thighs, andwas still movingupward until I put a stop to it.\"</p><p>Meg bither lip. \"Oh.\"</p><p>\"Aye, oh, \"Valoree said in a snarl, turningher head to glare out the window of the stationary carriage. Itwas stationary because they werewaitingfor Henryand him tocome out.</p> <p>Him was how Valoree thought of Daniel Thurborne now. Just him. The man wasa cankeronher butt. A wart on her nose. A pus-ridden carbuncle on her arse.</p><p>In short, he was making her life absolute hell. He was everywhere she went.Therewasn'ta moment's peace fromhim.</p><p>Every walk, every dinner, every anything one of her suitors choseto do during theirappointed times with her . . . he was there.Which might not have been so bad hadhe simplybeen present. More often than not his wit and charm turned what would have been hellacious hours spent in the company of boring, whining, or just plain weakmen into bearable chores.</p><p>Unfortunately he did morethan that. Heteased, and chatted, and made her laugh, waiting thewhole time like a vulture. And the moment the opportunity presented itself, he pounced, taking her inhis arms and makingherdizzy with passion, working her into a frenzy ofwant, then stopping and walking away, leaving hera bundledball of knotted nerves. Andit was hell.</p><p>He didn't even have to kiss ortouch her anymore.Themoment she saw him, Valoree's body began tohum withwant. Should he brush against her innocently in passing, a jolt of desire shot throughher likelightning.Andforget fighting it. At first she had tried toavoidany situationhe might take advantageof, but now she sought them out. Now she looked for them. He had worked his frustrating magic on her behind trees, in hallways, under stairways, andeven, once, in a closet.Butalleach episodedid was make her more miserable. And she was reaching the breakingpoint. Even losing control of herlife didn'tseem like such a horrible price to pay to gain release from this terrible frustration. And that scared the devil out of her.</p><p>Back-from-the-Dead Red, scourge of the Caribbean, the pirate feared by theSpanish, French, andDutch alike, waslaid low by the need for a man betweenher legs.</p><p>Notjust any man. Him. Only he would do. Oh, she had tried kissing her various suitors, and even a bit more on the less repulsive ones.But itwas liketryingto substitute wine for rum.</p><p>Winewas sweet but not very strong; rumwas spicy and had a kick.Valoree wanted the damn kick! But shedidn'twant tohave tomarry the kicker. Whata pain.</p> <p>A titter from Megdrew her head around, and Valoreepeeredat the older woman in question. \"Whatis sodamn funny? \"</p><p>\"Oh, dear. Iwas just thinking ofLord Scrantom's face when you slammedyour knife into thetable beside hishand.I think he relievedhimself on thespot.\"Shecovered her mouthtokeep a laugh in, then shook her head. \"Then whenyou pulled it out - \"</p><p>Shebegan to laugh helplessly, and Valoree smiled slightly as she recalled the moment. It had been rather funny, now that she thought ofit. She had tugged the knifeout of the tableinthe sudden silence, nonchalantly turning it over, to hold it half an inch in front of Scrantom's quivering nose sothat hecould seethe decimated insect on its end. \"A fly, \" she had said, as if that explainedeverything, \"Peskylittle things. Theyliketocrawl up under a lady's skirts and tickle her legs.\" Then she had shot her gaze to himcoldly and added meaningfully, \"I hate things that crawl upmyskirts and tickle my legs.\"</p><p>The man had gone intoa dead swoon. Valoree had wipedthe flyoff on hissleeveand stood to leave the room, saying, \"Cross him offthe list, Henry. He wouldn't survivelong enough to get me with child.\" Then she had come out here to wait in the carriageforthemtojoin her, which Meg had done almost right away. Daniel and Henry, the only other guests at Scrantom's dinner, hadn'tyetcome out.</p><p>\"Where is Henry? \"she asked impatiently.</p><p>Megleanedforward to peerthrough the window at the town house.\"I am not sure. I thought Henry was right behindme, but - Oh, heretheycome.\"</p><p>Valoree leaned forwardto seethe men chatting asthey walked toward the carriage. They parted at the end of the walk, Thurborne moving toward hiscarriage, and Henry hurrying over towhere Meg and Valoreewaited.</p><p>\"Come on, \" hesaidcheerfully, pullingthedoor open. \"Iinvited Thurborne back for something to eat, since Scrantom's shenanigans cheated us out of half our dinner. He's offered us a liftinhis carriage.\"</p><p>Valoree blinked in surprise that Henry had known what the man was about, then frownedas what he saidsank in. \"What's wrong with our carriage? \"</p><p>\"Nothing, if ye don't mind riding in a sea of silk, \" Henry muttered in disgust. \"It's too damnsmall forthe three of us, let alone all four.\"</p><p>\"Well, he can just follow inhiscarriage, \" she argued, but not with verymuch force behind it. A momentlater, as Henry pursed his lips and looked downhis nose at her, she heavedasigh and started out of the carriage. Satisfiedby her agreement, Henry turned totellNo-Nosethechange ofplans.</p><p>She supposed she wasn'treally fooling anyonebysucha weak protest, at least notHenry. Heknew her too well tobe fooled by it, but she felt better that She had at least made the effort. Valoree attempted notto look too eageras she walkedfrom one carriage to theother.She even muttered something unpleasantunder her breath whenDaniel winked at her as he helped her inside. A heartbeat later, they were all seated, and Valoree was cursing herself for herweakness as the carriage theynowrode in moved outto followtherented hack home.</p><p>The Thurbornecarriage was larger than the one themen had rented for their stay inLondon, but Daniel didn't seem to be aware of that. Hewas sittingsqueezed up againsther, his hip and outer thigh pressedagainsthers, and hisarm rubbing herswith the movement of thecoach as hechatted with Henry. It was all what She had hopedfor, ofcourse, but it was sheer hell anyway.</p><p>Amazing, thethings that youcould learn about yourselfwhen put intonewsituations. For instance, until she had come to London and metThurborne, Valoree hadn'thad a clue that she had such masochistic tendencies.</p><p>Shewas berating herself forafool whenthere was a sudden shout of warning, the shriek of horses, and a loud crash. The carriage lurchedviolently, throwing Valoree against Daniel, but a glance outthe window showed a wagon tipping on its sideeven as itwas pulledpast by two panicked horses.</p><p>\"Are youallright? \" Daniel asked, helping her to sit up again once the carriage had stopped.</p><p>\"Aye, \"Valoree assured him, then peered out the window as Daniel turned to check on Henry and Meg. Her gaze moved towardtheroad at the back of Thurborne's carriage, the direction the wagon had gone. She saw the vehicle had stopped some distance back, lying on its side in the road. The driver was whipping the horses, tryingto get them to moveanyway, todrag the wagonaway. When they wouldn't budge, hegaveup, and ran off down the road. Muttering under her breath, Valoree then turned to glance to the expanse of road at the front of Thurborne's carriage.What she sawthere made her blood run cold and hadher scrabbling to get outside.</p><p>\"What isit? \" Daniel asked, noticing her panic, but Valoree didn't stop to tell him. Stumbling from the carriage, she ran towardthewreckage of thehackher menhad rented.</p><p>\"One-Eye!\" sheyelled, hurrying toward thefirst man she saw.</p><p>Flung tothesideof the lane, he satup slowly, shaking his head as shedroppedtoherkneesbeside him. \"Areyou all right? What happened? \"</p><p>\"Don't know, \" he answered dazedly, shakinghis head again.\"I guess we crashed. There wasa bang;then I gotthrown fromthe back of the hack.\"</p><p>\"Isanythingbroken? \"she asked worriedly as Daniel reached them.</p><p>\"Don't think so.\" He moved one limb, then another with caution. \"Nay, I'mfine. Whatabouttheothers? \"</p><p>\"Youstayhere and rest a minute; I'll go see.\" She patted his back, then stood and moved toward the front of the spilled carriage, aware that Daniel was following her. She heard him curse ashelooked over what remainedof therented hack, but didn't look herself. She had seen the wreckage when she had peered out the window of his coach. The hack had tipped, smashing intothestone wall along the frontof a townhouse. The top had beentorn off, itssides hadcavedin, and the bottom was twisted. She doubtedanyone would havesurvived had theybeen inside.</p><p>She found Bulland No-Nose off to the side at the frontof the carriage. Bullseemed fine as he knelt by the other man, but No-Nose was not. His legwas broken, the bone poking clean through the skin.</p><p>\"Sorry, Captain, \" No-Nose apologized. \"Thatwagon came out ofnowhere. Headed straight forus. I tried to move out of the way, but...\"He shook his head.</p><p>\"Shutup, No-Nose, \" Valoreemuttered, kneelingbyhis injured legandbeginning to rip at the hemof her petticoat. \"Help me here, Bull. We have to straighten this out. Are you hurtanywhere else? \"</p><p>\"Nay, I - Aaaahhhh, \"he screamed, then beganto curse a blue streak as Valoree and Bull set to work onhim.</p><p>Valoree pressed her lips together and didwhat hadto be done, or at least as much as she knew. Scratchy wouldhave to have a look at itwhenthey got him back to the ship. Hewas the doc.</p><p>Butshe knewNo-Nosewould be lucky to keep the leg.</p><p>\"Damn, \" Henry swore upon spotting No-Nose's injury as he andOne-Eyereached them. \"Howthehell did this happen? \"</p><p>\"A wagon came aroundthe corner, pointed straight at us, \" Bull rumbled.\"No-Nosetriedto getus outof the way, but theother fella wascomin'on too fast. We couldn't avoid getting hit, and we both jumped off just before ithit.\"</p><p>Henry blew out abreath, then asked, \"Hegonnabe all right? \"</p><p>\"He'll live, \" Valoree answered shortly, unwilling to make promisesabout keeping hisleg. Hergazemoved to Bull. \"Ican finishuphere.You and One-Eyegotip thatwagonback onits wheels andsee if it willmove. If it still works, bring it back here.</p><p>You'll need it to take No-Nose back to the ship.\"</p><p>\"I'llgive 'em a hand, \" Henry said, chasing afterthem as the two men hurried away.</p><p>Daniel shifted, drawing her gaze to him. She had quite forgotten he was there.</p><p>\"No-Nose? \" he said softly, raising one eyebrow. \"Ship? \"</p><p>Lipstightening, Valoree turned back to trying to stanch the flowof blood from No-Nose's leg.</p><p>\"Here.\" Meg was suddenly beside her, ripping a length of materialfrom her own petticoats and offeringitto Valoree, even as she attempted to reassure the man. \"You will be all right, Robert.\"</p><p>Eveninpain as he was, the man managed to grimaceat the use of his proper name.</p><p>When she had done the best she could for him, Valoree glanced around. Daniel hadmoved off tohelpthe men. They had the wagonbackon its wheels, but insteadof bringingitback, had pausedto chat with a stranger. The four men she knew were standing in a semicircle, apparently listening to the other, who was gesticulatingwildly.</p><p>Clicking her tongue impatiently, shestood and roared, \"Quit yerlollygagging, yeshiftless bastards!I've a woundedman here!\"</p><p>Jaw dropping to hischest, Daniel wheeled around to peer at her inamazement. One-Eye and Bull, however, rushed to the wagon and leaped onto the driver's bench, immediately turning it to ride back toward her. Henry stayed, though, apparently trying to soothethestranger. Theman was getting moreexcited by the moment.</p><p>\"Sorry, Captain, \" One-Eye apologized, holding the horses steady as Bull leapeddown tolift No-Nose into theback of the wagon. \"That fella back there is the ownerof the wagon.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Oh, he is, is he? \" shesaid in a snarl, turningtostart toward whereHenry was still talkingwiththeman.</p><p>She was given pause when One-Eye calledout, \"Aye, but he weren'tdriving it.Somefella stole it from him onthe next block.</p><p>Hechased after him on foot andcame on the accident after it happened.\"</p> <p>Valoree hesitated, her gaze moving to where One-Eye was strugglingto control the horses.The man was a sailor.He didn't know the first thingaboutdriving. As far asshe knew, Skully and No-Nose werethe onlymembers of her crew who had any skill with the beasts. Sighing, she turnedback toward the three men still talking down the street. \"Henry! Bring thatman overhere!\"</p><p>Henry glancedtowardher, hesitated, then started to leadthe man back. He wasabout Henry's height and nearly as muscular, his face covered with soot. He hadbeendelivering coal tothe town houseswhenhis wagon had been stolen, she guessed. The bottom andsides of hisconveyance were stained black fromthe dust of the coal.</p><p>\"This is your wagon? \" Valoreeasked assoon as he was close enough tohearwithout herhaving to shout.</p><p>\"Aye. The dirtyblighter stole it. I - \"</p><p>\"One of mymen isinjured, \" Valoree interruptedshortly as he stoppedbeforeher. \"I need toget him to the docks.Can you take him? \"</p> <p>The man hesitated, displeasure shifting over his features. \"Why can't ye just take himinyour damn carriage? He not goodenough todirty the seats? \"</p><p>Valoree stiffened, her eyes narrowing to cold slits that were usually a warning to her men that they were treading adangerous path. \"His leg isbroken.He needs to be kept flat. The carriage is too small for that. He must be returned to the docks in your wagon. What I am asking you, is whether youwish to do the driving and be recompensed for it, or whetheryouwishto stand here andwatchit betaken. Now, which isit? \"</p><p>The man's gazeslid from herto Bull, to Henry andDaniel, then lastlyto One-Eye seated on the driver's bench. \"Ah, hell, \" he muttered, starting forthebench.</p><p>TurningtoBull, Valoree murmured, \"Both you andOne-Eye gowithhim.Seehe's paid when hegetsyou there.\"</p><p>Nodding, Bull turned and hefted himself intothe back of the wagon.The driver climbed up to join One-Eye, who had shifted to make room for him. The vehicle was off almost at once.</p><p>Valoree waiteduntil ithad turned the corner before turning to move back to Thurborne's carriage.</p> <p>The four of them were silent on the way back to the town house. Valoree was fretting over No-Nose. She almost asked Daniel to take them tothe docksseveral times, but then changed hermind.It would just meanmore questions. She already had enough on her plate whatwithhaving to explain aboutthe ship to him, and she knew she would have to. The nobleman kept looking ather. Of course, he was always looking at her, but he was looking at herdifferentlynow. Now, he kept castingcurious glancesher way.</p><p>Sighing, she leaned her head against thewall of the carriage, relievedwhen theystoppedat theirdestination a moment later.</p><p>They trooped silently inside and went directly to the salon.</p><p>Valoree moved to stand by the fireplace asHenry quickly fixed everyone a drink. He handed these out, then glanced at Daniel questioningly. \"Are yestillhungry? \"</p><p>Thurborne smiled wryly, but shook hishead, as did Valoree when he glanced her way.Henry'sgaze then moved to Meg, who sighed and set her glass on the table, then stood. \"Actually, Henry, I think I ammore tired than hungry.Ithas beenamost eventful night. If youwillallexcuse me, I amgoing to retire.\"</p><p>Sheleft the room to their murmurs of good-night; then Henry downed his drink and headed forthedoor aswell.</p><p>\"I'm goingto talk tothemen. Goodnight, Thurborne.\" The door pulled quietly closedbehind him before Valoree or Daniel could say farewell.</p><p>Nowthequestionswould begin, Valoree thought.She lifted her glassto drink fromit, but Danieldidn't ask questions. Instead he was suddenlybehindher, his hands on hershoulders, histhumbs rubbing the bare flesh ofher collarbones. He pressed a kiss tothe back of her neck. Swallowing the rum in her mouth, Valoree stood perfectly still, amazed to seethat the handholding herglass was beginning to tremble.</p> <p>The shaking became much moreviolentwhen his hands slid down her arms, then beneath to reach around and cup her breasts. Twisting her head, Valoree sought his lips with hers, sighinginto hismouth when he accepted theinvitation.He kissed herpassionately, one handdropping down over herstomach, then lower, until it rested between her legs.There, he pressed gently.</p><p>Shegroaned, barely aware of the splash of cold liquid on her skin asthe glass she held tipped dangerously. Then he withdrew his hands, andhis lips, and gave her aquick peck on the nose.</p><p>Eyes blinkingopen, she stared in amazement at his retreating back, then whirledtoward the fireplace, throwingher glass inthe fire with a vulgar curse. Leaning herforeheadwearily againstthe mantel, she heard the front door of the town house open and closequietly.She wasstill standingthere several moments later when the door tothesalonopenedagain.</p><p>\"Captain? \"</p><p>Sighing, Valoree straightened, took adeep breath, thenturned topeeratHenry.\"Aye, what isit? \"</p><p>He stared at her uncertainly for a minute, concern flashing across his face. \"Are yeall right? \"</p><p>\"Iam fine.Why shouldn't I be? \"she snapped. \"Is that all? \"</p><p>\"Nay, Iwantedto talk toyou about the carriage accident.\"</p><p>Sighing, Valoree moved to one of thechairs andsank into it wearily, then gestured for him to sit in the other. \"Have you heard from the ship? Is No-Nose going tobe all right? \"</p><p>\"Aye. One-Eye and Bull returned with Skully just a minute ago. Scratchy islooking after No-Nose. Saysitwasa cleanbreak andhe might even keep his leg.\"</p><p>Valoree relaxed slightly at thatnews. \"Good.\"</p><p>\"Skully's going toarrange foranother hack first thing inthe morning. We paid for the other.\"</p><p>\"Alsogood.\" Theywere both silent for a moment; then Valoree frowned.</p><p>\"What is it? \" Henry asked, waiting.</p><p>Valoreemet his gaze, her thoughts shifting for a moment.\"I want youto have a coupleof the men go out tomorrow and talk tothat wagonowner again.\"</p><p>\"Why? Whatis itye want toknow? Do you not think it was an accident, pure and simple? Thefellow stole thewagon and in his excitement toget away, went toofast and lost control.\"</p><p>\"Maybe, \" Valoree murmured, then shrugged. \"Just have them find outeverything theownercan tellthemabout the fellow he saw stealit.\"</p><p>Henry nodded slowly; thenthey both fellsilent for a moment.</p><p>At lasthe asked, \"Have yemade upyour mindyet? \"</p><p>She peeredathim in surprise. \"About what?</p><p>\"About which oneto marry, \" he answered. \"Scrantom wasthe last of'em on your list. Ye'vevisited with all of them now.\"</p><p>Valoree looked away toward the fireplace. \"Nay. But I've narrowedthelist.\"</p><p>\"Aye, ye've done that, all right. Ye'veonly gotHawghton and Beecham left on it.\"</p><p>\"Aye, \"Valoree agreed.</p><p>Whenshe didn't say anythingelse, Henry said, \"Should I send a letter around to those two, inviting them by for ye to have another gander? \"</p><p>Sighing, Valoree lether head fall backonthe chair and closed hereyes. \"Aye, aye. Go ahead.\"</p><p>\"I'll write 'em upbefore Igo tobed so one of the mencan run them around first thinginthemorning. Good night.\"</p><p>She didn't hear him get up, but shedid hear thedooropen and close. Sighing, she turned her head toward the fireplace and staredintoitfor a moment, picturingHawghton and Beechamin hermind.</p><p>Hawghton wasa handsomeman, mayhapeven more handsome than Daniel. He was also a charmer like Daniel. But, unlike Thurborne, who Henry toldherhadspentmostof his time out tendingto his estates since inheriting, Hawghton neglected his affairsand lived inLondon, wherehecould enjoythe high life.</p><p>Gambling appearedto be his downfall. He, unlikemost of the others, was not a second son. He wasa firstborn sonwho had inherited a greatdeal of wealth with histitlewhen his father had died three years earlier.Hehad also gambled mostofit awayin the short time since.</p><p>Or thrown it away on some mistress or another. Henry had seento looking into eachman. Hawghton liked gambling, women, and drinking. Betweenthe three vices, he couldn't seemtohold on to a coin.Still, thatdidn't bother hermuch. Once the child was bornandhe wasno longernecessary, shecould sethim upin town on a nice allowance that he could gamble away as he pleased.</p><p>What bothered her was that during their appointment, when they had gone to the theater - the only appointment she had managed without Daniel being there - She had glimpseda flash of fury in the man. It was as they were leaving Drury Lane.</p><p>Someonehadjostledhim and he had turnedin a rage, his face suddenly beet red and looking as if he meant to strike the unfortunate passerby with hiscane. Valoree had shifted then, drawing his gaze, and Hawghton hadforced himselfto relax and immediately release one of his charming laughs. All as if the incidenthad never happened. But the momenthadstuckin her mind. The man had a temper, and asecond appointmentwasonly to assure herself of that. Shewould not marry a man whomight raise his cane to her. She'd have to kill the bastard then, and she hadenoughtroubles without that.</p><p>That leftBeecham. Hewas aperfectlynice man, unlike Daniel, who wasan evil, irritating bastard. He was smart, unlike Daniel, who didn't know enough to take a woman when she offered herself. Hewasalso good withmoney. In fact, from what Henry could findout, hehad absolutely no need for her money, so she was not quitesure of his motives for offering tomarry her. That was bothersome. He had taken her to a coffeehouse for his appointment, andValoree had enjoyed herself.Daniel hadshown up, of course, but hehad not done anything at all to emphasize anyfaults Beecham might have. She supposed he didn't really have any. He didn't rattle on about himself endlessly, or talk snidely about others. In fact, he wasa very quiet man. He didn't sniffle orwhine asHavershamhad ... or hadthatbeen Griswold?</p><p>He did not waste hismoney on gamblinglike Hawghton, and he certainly had not tried to slip his foot under her skirts like Scrantom. He was just a nice man who would make a fine husband.</p><p>But therewould never beany passion there. She was positive of that. Beecham had not tried to kiss ortouch her in any way during his appointment, but she knew despite that, his kisses would be justas mildand unassuming as hewas. Unlike Daniel's kisses, which curled her toes andsinged herinsides.</p><p>Sighing, sheleaned her head back onthechair, closing her eyes again, her mind drifting. Sheheardthemenmoving about, talking quietlyas theymade their way tobed, butshewas suddenly too tired tobother getting upto goto bedherself. She knew she was falling asleep right therein thechair, but couldn't seem to rouse herself enough care.</p><p>Shewasn't sure what itwas that woke her. Perhaps itwas a sound that disturbedher dreamless rest, or perhaps it was her neck, which wasstiff and sore from nodding off in the chair.</p><p>Whatever it was, she woke abruptly, hereyes darting aroundthe dark room.Thefirehad goneout while she slept, but the smoky scent of itwas still in the air.</p><p>Grimacing at the pain in her neck, she rubbed atitirritably and forced herself to get up. Bed was where she belonged. She stumbledtoward the line of light beneath the salon door, thinking she would have to cuss out the men in the morning for such foolishness. They were obviously getting lazy on land if they were not even bothering to putthecandles out before retiring.</p><p>The last thing they needed was a fire.</p><p>The waveof warm, thick smoke that rolled over her as she opened the door was enough to wash such thoughts from her mind.Thelight had not been from candles at all, but from across the hall. The library door was open, and showed thefire licking its way up the drapescovering the window inside.</p><p>Bellowingat the topof her lungsforher men, Valoree hurried into the room, taking in the situation at a glance. The drapes were ablaze, and the firewas spreading from there. Runningforward, she snatchedat thecurtains, ignoringthe pain that shotthrough her fingers as she did, and ripping the drapes from thewindow.</p><p>She letgoas soon as they fell, thengrabbed up her skirts and proceeded to try stomping on the flames.Someone grabbed her from behind and moved her outof the way.</p><p>\"Get outof here! Your skirts'll catchfire. Go wakethe others!\"</p><p>Henry shouted, pushingher toward the door.</p><p>Valoree hesitated, then left himto it andchargedupthe stairs, roaring at the top of her lungs as she went.One-Eye met her as she reached the upperlanding.</p><p>\"What's goingon? \" he asked, still half-asleep but waking up quickly.</p><p>\"Fire, \" Valoree snapped, pausing to push Meg's door open without knocking.\"Get up!\" she yelled, hurryingin to shakethe old woman awake. \"Move it, Meg. We'vegota firebelow.\"</p><p>\"What? \" the woman muttered, sitting up groggily, then immediately began coughing.

Hurrying the older woman along, Valoreeran her down the stairs and pulled the frontdoor open.</p><p>She wasaboutto shove Megthroughwhen Henryshouted, \"It's out!\"</p><p>Pausing, she whirled to stare through the smoke-filled entry toward the men comingout of the library. \"What? \" she askedin amazement.</p><p>\"It hadn't got far, \"he explained, waving his hand in frontof his face and movingto join her where sheand Megnowstood inthe open door. \"I managedto get thedrapes put out, and your shout woke Petey.

I putthe candle out after Ifinished writing them invites to Beecham andHawghton.\"</p><p>\"You're sure? \" Valoree asked sharply, then took in the affronted lookthat immediately covered his face. Of course he was sure. Despite her thoughts onseeing thelight under thesalon door, she knew noneof themenwould make a mistakelike that.</p><p>Thirteen years hadtrained them well. You had to be extra careful about things like that onboard ship. You couldn't runout adoor, or climbout a windowto escape a fire on a boat. Your only options were burning to death or jumping ship, then either drowning or being shark bait.</p> <p>\"Aye, I'msure, \" he said testily. \"Besides, it looked likethe fire started withthe drapes atthe windowbehindthe desk chair, and thereain'teven a tablethere, let alone a candle that mighthave sparkedit.\"</p><p>\"It's a curse, that's what started it, \" Skully muttered.</p><p>\"Someone'sput a curseof bad luck onusfor sure, 'cause that's all we'vehad sincewe came toLondon.\"</p><p>\"There's no curse, \" Valoreesaid impatiently as themen began toshift. Therecould never bea moresuperstitious lot of men thanpirates. And the last thing sheneededright now wasforthe men to start harping on badluck, curses, and such. \"As faras bad luck goes, aye, we'vehadsome, but we've had goodluck, too.</p><p>We haven't lost a singlemanin five years of pirating.Whatother crewcanclaim that? \" shesnapped, then sighed and went on. \"As for these 'accidents? ' callingthem a curseis foolishness.\"</p> <p>\"Aye, she's right, \" Henry agreed. \"We can'tjust claimit's bad luck; therehavebeentoo manyinstances forthat.\"</p><p>\"And too many for them to be coincidence, even.\" she continued. \"But they still could be. The first incidence we thought a robbery attempt, and it may havebeen.Ifso, we were lucky. They got away with naught and wesuffered little but a knockon my head.\"</p><p>\"What about the carriageaccident? \" One-Eye asked. \"No-Nose brokehis leg.\"</p><p>\"Aye, and ifyouaskme that was luck, too. Had Henry, Meg, and I been in the carriage instead of riding behind in Lord Thurborne's hack, we wouldbe dead now.No doubting it. I say one broken leg is better than threedead any day.\" She allowed that to sink in, then continued. \"Asfor thefire, we were lucky again. It was caughtearly, it'sout, andno one was hurt.\"</p><p>She sighed again, a frown twisting her mouth.Therehadbeen too much bad luck. Evenshecould seethat, but she didn't want the men to get jumpy. \"We have been lucky. But I wantto make sure thereis nothing to worry about. TomorrowIwant a couple of you men to go talkto the owner of the wagonagain, andfind out what you can. Then ask around near where the accident occurred, see if anyone saw where the fellow whowas driving ranto.\"</p><p>\"You thinkit wasn't an accident? \" Henry said. Valoree paused.</p> <p>\"Idon't know. I'djustfeel better finding out what we can.\" She glanced overthemen, then sighed. \"Iwill seeLord Beecham and Hawghton again tomorrow and decide whichof them to marry; then we can getout of here. Thenit will be over. Now it's late.</p><p>Whydon't you men head offto bed? \"</p><p>Meg wasthefirstto turn away toleave, butthemen did follow.</p><p>Valoreestood staringaround the library once they were gone, frowning at the fact that, somehow, a curtainwith nothingnearby to hold a candle had been aflame. If she were the superstitious sort, she mightbelieve it was a curse, or some such thing as Skully had suggested. But Valoree wasn't superstitious. She was slightly cynical. And to her the answerseemed quiteclear that someone had setit.</p><p>But who?</p><p>Sighing, she left the libraryas well, butshedidn't seekout her bed. Insteadshe crossed the hall to thesalon, only tofind Henry there, seated on the settee, dealingcards out onthe low table before it.</p><p>\"Hazard or hearts? \" heasked as shemovedto the sideboard to pour them botha drink.</p><p>\"Hearts, \"Valoree murmured, carryingglasses over to joinhim.</p> <p>He knew her too well. She should have realized he would know she would not simplyretire and risk another fire, or any such accident, befalling them while they slept. He had figured she would sit up all night to stand guard against any further \"accidents\" while everyone slept, and meant to keep her company.</p><p>Picking up the hand he had dealt himself, Henry announced, \"Skully andBullare going to spot us in a couple of hours;then One-Eye andPetey will take over forthem.\"</p><p>Valoree just gruntedand picked up her cards.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Valoree closed the door behind Hawghton with a snap and turned toeyeHenry.\"When doesBeechamget here? \"</p><p>\"Heshould be alongshortly. Ischeduled themone afterthe other. Hawghton lefta little early.\"</p><p>\"Aye, well, you can crosshimoffthe list.Beecham it is, \" she announced, walking back intothesalon.</p><p>A fewminutes later, Valoree wassittingstaring into the fire when Henry entered. Forcing herself tosit upand doingher best notto look as depressedas shefelt, she raised an eyebrow in question.\"Aye? What is it, Henry? \"</p><p>\"Well.\" The man hesitated, then straightened his shoulders and decided to get to the point without anyshilly-shallying. 'The men and I were talking, and we've decided ye shouldn't marry Beecham.\"Seeing hereyes narrow, fiercely, he quickly wenton.</p><p>\"He's too weak for ye, Captain. Ye'dwalk rightoverhim;then ye'dloathe him for lettin' ye. Ye need someone stronger, like Thurborne there.\"</p><p>\"I - \" she beganharshly, but he interrupted before she could blast him.</p><p>\"So One-Eye's gone back to the boat to let the men know what's about, and havethemtake avote on who we want ye to marry. I'm thinking they'll all vote for Thurborne, too, once One-Eye tells'em they should. We surely wouldn't have donethis had we not known ye really like the man anyway. We've all caught ye shilly-shallyingwith himat one point or other during the last twoweeks.Weknow yelike the fella.\"</p><p>Valoree flushed at his announcement, herface heating up like toast overthefire as she realizedthat she and Thurborne had been spotted in their passionate clinches.</p><p>\"I - \" she began furiously, but paused abruptly, her mind ticking over what he was saying. They were going to vote she shouldmarry Thurborne.She'd get a lifetime with the man. It meant a lifetime battle for her independence, and a lifetime strugglenot to be secondary tohim, but also a lifetime of passion, of finally gaining satisfaction from the man, of his finally scratching the unbearabledamn itchhe had workedso hardat buildingwithinher. And it wasnot even as if she wasgiving in.</p><p>They were basically forcing herto do it.</p><p>Or were they? If she gave inon this, mayhap they weren't forcing her at all, and weeksfromnow ...well, perhaps months...</p><p>Okay, it would probably be years. Yearsfromnow, whenher itch wasscratched and she came out of her desire-fogged state, she would awake to find she had given up her independence for somethingthat wouldnot last. She hadto considerthat. But she wasn'tgiven thechance asBull opened the doorand rumbled, \"Beecham.\"</p><p>Valoree frowned at the news that the man was there, then glanced at Henry. \"If you have finished arranging my life? \"</p><p>Nodding, Henry turned and moved toward the door. Bull stepped outof the wayfor Beecham to enter. Her\"uncle\" paused togreet himon the wayout, then murmured something about instructing Petey toprepare atea tray. With that he left them alone. Unlike he did whenever Daniel was present, this time Henry left the door open.</p><p>\"Thurborne'snot here? \" Beecham asked insurprise. He came tojoin her by the fire.</p><p>Valoree made a face at the question. Apparently it had not gone without notice that Daniel always seemed to be hanging about. She hoped that he wasn't also aware of their \"shilly-shallying, \" as Henry had put it. Beechamwas too nice a man forher to wishhis feelings or hispride hurt.</p><p>Sheblinkedas that thoughtran through her mindand stuck.</p><p>Beecham was toonice a man forher todeliberatelyhurt.Damn..</p><p>. She was going soft! She would have blamed it on being in London, but she knew that wasn't the only reason behind it. It was Meg's influence, her disapproving looks, her gentle remonstrances.</p><p>It was alsothe dresses she wasforced to go about in herein London.Meg had forcedthe men to returnall her breeches and boots to theboat after she'd discoveredherniecein them. That hadleft her withlittle choicebut togo about withthe air running upunderherskirts, and those silly, uselessslippers as heronly footcovering. Itwas hardnot to feelfeminine in that gear. And it was also Daniel, with his kissesand caresses, making herfeel like awoman forthe first time inher life. Butbeing a woman did not feel sobad when hisarmswere around her, and the heat was burning her up from the inside out.</p><p>Aye, she was going soft, she admitted with regret.</p><p>\"... that is why I have always admired Thurborne. I know I would never have had thecourage to deal with and hunt down privateersand pirates.\"</p><p>\"What? \" Valoree cried in amazement as Beecham's words registered.Obviously She hadmissed a greatdeal ofsomething that theman had been saying, and someveryimportant things, too. Seeing hisstartled expression, she forced herself to speak more calmly. \"I mean, Ifearyou spokesofast I did notgather all that.\" It was true.If he had spoken slower, she might havetuned back in at anearlier point.\"Huntdown pirates and privateers? \"</p><p>\"Aye. Thatis what he was doing in the Caribbean all those years.Atfirst he was justthe king'sman, assessing thecargo of variousprivateers in theareaand taking the king's fortypercent. But then when thatCaptainReddied - Are you quiteallright? You appear pale. Are you not feeling well? \"</p><p>\"Nay, I am fine.\" Valoreeforced a smileto her lips. \"I amjust suffering an achinghead. Please go on.\"- \"Anyway, there was a famous privateer called Captain Red.</p><p>Living in the Caribbean, you probably heard of him. It was rumored that hewasactually a lord, trying to remake thefortune hehad lost, butonlytheking andThurborne would know for sure. At anyrate, the poor fellow was captured by the Spanish, butit was just after he had turned inhis cargo for assessing. They say thatthe Spanishwere sofurious at being cheatedout of the treasure they had expected, they tortured him and his entire crew todeath.\"</p><p>Not his wholecrew, Valoree thoughtgrimly.Onlythose who hadbeenaboardatthetime. A skeleton crew, just enough men to get Jeremy where he was to meettheassessor. Sheand the others had been in port, collecting thesupplies they would needforthe next trip out. AndtheSpanishhad gotten the gold.</p><p>\"Butthen rumors began to circulate, \"Beecham went on, \"that Captain Red and his crew hadcomeback fromthe deadto seek vengeance and wreak havoc on the Spanishfor what hadbeen doneto them. Ship aftership aftership claimed that the dead captain and his crew appeared out ofnowhere, out of the very mist, materializingsuddenlyon the deck of their ships. There was never anyship, just the crew.\"</p><p>Valoree's mouth twitched at that with nervous humor. Their attackon that first ship had worked so well, they had used it repeatedly: leaving the new Valor anchored in a safe cove, rowing out in a smallpiragua or two, then drillingholesinthe smallboats and climbing aboard their targeted ship to take it over. With each craft they had taken, the story of Back-from-the-Dead-Red hadgrown until the very sight of them on deck was enough to send the crew of whatever ship they boardedeither totheir knees to plead for their lives or scurrying to droptheir own skiffs into the waterto get away. That had left them with, notonly whatever treasureeach carried, but the ship itself to sell. That was how they had made the moneythey had needed to replace so quickly.</p><p>Of course, they had taken an occasional ship in the usual manner, chasing them down in theValor, boarding, fighting, and winning, butalwaysatdusk or dark whentheycould continuethe charade of Back-from-the-Dead Red. Sailors were a damned superstitious lot, and that charade had given them theedge more timesthannot.</p><p>\"Theking wasirate about this, of course, \" Beecham related.</p><p>\"Privateeringis one thing, but pirating quiteanother.\"</p><p>\"Yes, \" Valoreeassented. Good Lord, yes. If the kingdidn't get his share, the whole letterofmarquewas null andvoid - evenif the pirates in question attacked only the king's enemies, and never bothered their own countrymen or ships ofcountries that were allies. Unfortunately, when Jeremy had died, thename of the assessor and next meeting place arranged with the man had beenlost aswell. Thus, Valoree and the men had been unable to keep everything as aboveboard as they wouldhaveliked. Still, they had saved the king's portion, always counting it out painstakinglyto be surethat his share was there. They had stored it in a ware-house herein London when they arrived, and waited for the king to contact them.She'd assumed he would as soon as he knew that Lady Ainsley was in London. He had known CaptainRed washer brother, of course.But he had notyet called onthem, and frankly, Valoree had been so wrapped upinthis husband business, the matter had quiteslipped her mind.</p><p>\"So, since Thurborne was one of the few people besides himself who had met this Captain Red, the king sent him out to seek thetruth of the matter - whetherthere really was a ghost pirate running amok out there, or if Captain Red hadsurvived after all andwas takingadvantageof the talesof his death to keep the entireportion of the treasures he took.\"</p><p>Valoree blinked insurprise. She hadnever consideredanyone mightthinkthat, but, she supposed it madesense. Unfortunately, she had more importantthings toconsider. Forinstance, whatthis allmeant to her andthemen. If Thurborne hadbeen the assessor, then heknew that Jeremywas Captain Red. And if heknew that, he knew she was his sister. So why had he notcometo her and requested information? Why not ask herthe truthof the matter? Had he beenhanging about allthis time in thehopeof learning some further information for the king? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Quite suddenlyshe remembered the night before and what had happened after the carriage accident. She had unthinkingly mentionedthe ship. Daniel had heard her and echoedthe word.</p><p>Valoreehad fully expected himto question her on the matter once they returned to the town house, buthe had not. He had merely kissedand caressed her, thenleft.But he had not returned this morningaswas hisusual habit.Where was he? Out looking for her ship? Andnow that shewas thinking along those lines, she recalled all thetimes hehad emphasized certain words like uncle or your islandor theCaribbean with some hiddenmeaning. She had paid little attention, and hadwasted little concern over such mattersatthetime, but she wasnow beginning to attacha terrible significance tothem.</p><p>Mayhap they should not have waited for the king to send someone around. Mayhap he would not. Mayhap he would merely have them all arrested and hanged.</p> <p>Cursing, sheleaped to her feet and started forthedoor.</p><p>\"Is theresomethingamiss, my lady? \"</p><p>Valoree paused, thenglancedbackblankly at Beecham. She hadquite forgottenall about hispresence. Recovering herself, she managed a smile.\"Nay, mylord. It just suddenly occurred to me to wonder where that tea is that myuncle saidhe wouldhave sent. I willnot bea moment, \" she assured him, then slid out into the hallto find herself facing Henry, Pete, One-Eye, Bull, Skully, and Meg. Theyall stood there, huddled in conversation, but fell silentand turned to face her asshe closed the door.</p><p>\"What? \" she began, scowling. Henry held up his hand to silence her.</p><p>\"One-Eye andSkully justgot back from theship, and the crew has voted. Ye marryThurborne.\"</p> <p>\"You menare incredible, \" she said withdisgust. \"You cannot vote on a thinglike that. Ishall marry whom Iplease.\"</p><p>\"Nay, according to the contracts - \"</p><p>\"According to thecontracts, any decision that affects you men andyour life aboardship isup to the vote, \" she said shortly. \"So, aye, mayhap youcouldforce me to marry, butonce I marry and reclaim Ainsley, yourlives aboard ship end. Then you become land rats. And that means all your contracts are null and void. So I will marry whom I please, and Iammarrying Beecham.In fact, I amgoing to gotellhim so right now.\"</p><p>Turning on her heel, she threw the door open and marched right back in, closingthedoor behind her witha slam. She was so angry, she was halfwayacrossthe roombefore she realized that she hadnot told them about Thurborne, and that they wouldstill have to take care of that situation right away. Sighing, she whirled reluctantly back, then changed her mind. She couldtell them allabout that later. First she would arrange things with Beecham.</p><p>Smiling, she returned to her chair and had just seated herself when the door opened and Meg rushed in. \"Oh. Hello, Lord Beecham, \" she said brightly, ignoring Valoree's glare as she moved to join them. \"How are you today? \"</p><p>\"My lady.\"Beecham stoodat once, bending to kiss the older woman's hand when it wasoffered.Valoree sat frozen, throwing glares at the woman thatwere studiouslyignored.</p> <p>She had no doubt that this wassupposed to preventherfrom announcingBeechamas her choicefor a husband. Meghad made herself scare every other time that John Beecham had been present. Valoree was not sure if it had been becauseshe feared being recognized as his scandalous aunt, or if the sight of himjust broughtback the pain of the rift with her sister. Still, whatever it was, Meg had always chosen to absent herself when he was about, leavingHenry totend to thematter ofchaperoning - ajob he had done miserably, allowing her countless moments of fraternizing with aman who was most likelytrying togetthem all hanged.</p><p>\"How handsome youlook this afternoon, my lord, \"Meg was saying, seating herselfbeside Beecham on the settee and beaming at him widely. \"You must tell me whoyour tailoris so that Henry can payhim a visit. The clothesmaker we have been using is barely adequate.\"</p><p>\"Oh, well, I would be pleased to share his name, \" the man assured her quietly. \"He is quite the best one in town, inmy opinion, Top-quality workata fairprice.\"</p><p>\"Oh, marvelous. It isso hardto find thatnowadays, is it not? So manyovercharge and - \"</p><p>\"Aunt Meg, \" Valoree interrupted inawarning tone, and Meg turned toher innocently.</p><p>\"Yes, dear? \"</p><p>\"I was about to speak of something important with Lord Beecham.\"</p><p>\"Were you, dear? \"she murmured, then brightenedasthe door tothesalonopenedand Petey entered, carrying atray. Henry was hard on his heels. \"Oh, look.Here is the tea!\"</p> <p>Sighing, Valoree sat backin her seat impatiently and crossed her arms. They could delayallthey liked, but she would marry Beecham. Shewatched with grim displeasure as the two men walked to her side. Pausing there, Peteyheld the tray silently as Henry lifted a cup of teaand offered itto her.</p><p>Giving him a you-are-pushing-your-luck-mightily stare, she reached impatiently for the cup. But her pesky crew did not moveonthen; they stood waiting. Valoree arched her eyebrows irritably. \"What? \"</p><p>\"Ye have totry it, \"Henry announced, adding when Valoree began to frown, \"Petey'safraid he may have madeit toostrong.\"</p><p>Rollingher eyes, Valoreelifted the cup toher mouthand took a curious sip, nearlyspitting it out insurprise. There was heated spiced rum in the cup.</p><p>\"Something wrong? \" Henry asked innocently, giving her a wink when she glanced up at him. Valoree shook her head, her shouldersrelaxing.</p><p>\" 'Tis perfect, \" she said quietly, knowing that thiswas Henry's way of saying he was sorry. Fromthe timethat she hadboarded the Valor at the age of eleven, any timeshewas feeling sick or just plain unhappy, Henry had always brought her some heated, spicedrum. Of course, Jeremy had not known that. At least, she didn'tthink hehad known. But just the taste of the warm drink on her tongue made her soften toward him affectionately.Asunlikely as itseemed, this crustyold pirate had been the equivalent of nanny, friend, and tutortoValoreefrom the moment she had become Valerian. And he still was her friend, confidant, andeven tutorin someways. Especially when she wasreacting in anger rather than usingher head; then he always settled her down and helped her to see what she was doing.</p><p>\"Drink up. Tea's good for what ailsye, and there's plenty of it, \"</p><p>Henry said cheerfully as he moved around her chairtowardthe settee, Peteyfollowing.</p><p>Smiling slightly, Valoree took another drink, enjoying the spicedflavor andthe warm, fuzzy feelingit gaveheras it went down.</p><p>\"Thank you, Henry, \" Megmurmured, accepting her own cup as Henry took it from the tray and carefully handed it to her. Lifting it to her lips, shetook asip andsmiled as she swallowed it. \"Oh, my. It is good, isit not? \" she asked, smilingat Valoree, who grinned back, nodding asshe took another swallow.</p><p>Valoree knew darned well that Meg's cupwould not haverum in it.Despite the way she had tried to fool them all at first that she wasa drunk, she didn't drink much at all. Hercup wouldhold tea and nothing else. Of that she was sure, andthe thought of the trickthat she and Henrywereputting over onthem struck her suddenly as quite funny, making herchuckle aloud.</p><p>Henry and Peteypaused on the way to Beecham to turn to glance ather with amusement. Meg liftedone querying eyebrow.</p><p>\"Somethingfunny, dear? \"</p><p>Valoree shook her head. \"Jusss thinking, \" she murmured, frowning when she heard the slurof her own voice.</p><p>\"Oh, well, drink up, \" Meg murmured. Valoree nodded, dutifully swallowinganother gulp, thenleaning back in herseat with asigh as she watched Henry continue toward Beecham. She was suddenly quite tired. She supposedit wasthe lackof sleep last night, when she andHenry had sat up playing cards and guarding against another \"accident.\" She hadn't really lost much sleep, though, just a coupleof hours; then One-Eyeand Bull had taken over for them.Or hadit been Petey and Skully? Mayhap it had been Skully andOne-Eye, orPetey and Bully - Oops, Bull. She chuckled again, and Henry paused in the process of lifting Beecham'steacup offthetray.</p><p>\"All done? Shall I fetch youmore? \" heasked pleasantly.</p><p>\"Oh, aye.\" Swallowing the last ofherdrink, she heldthe cup out, laughing again asit teetered andswayed beforeher.</p><p>An exclamation drewhergazetoBeecham to see the teacup Henry had been holding tumbling out of his hand and down towardthenobleman. It seemed to Valoree tofall in slow motion.</p><p>Shesaw it turn upside down asit went, the liquidspilling down to hit the man on the shoulder, splashing down the front of his waistcoat even as the cup finallycaught up, bouncing off his shoulder andsmashing to the groundina thousand pieces.</p><p>Fallingback into her seat, Valoreebeganto laugh uproariously as she letthe cup she held drop to thefloor.It wasall too funny - especially their expressions. Beecham was jumping up with alarm, hiseyes wide as thoseof a fish. Meg was looking horribly apologetic and leaping and jumpingaround like a frogas , she wrung her hands.Henrywas doing his besttomop upthe mess up with Petey's help astheyurgedBeecham toward the salon door. Oh, it was hysterical! \"Really, this is awful, Iam sosorry.Please forgiveus, \" Meg murmuredworriedand repeatedly even as Henry closed the door behind thedepartingman, then leaned weakly against the wall beside it. She sighed miserably. \"I wish there had been another way.\"</p><p>\"Well, there wasn't, so it's no goodfretting over it, \" Henry assured her quietly, then reached out to pat her shoulder awkwardly as Petey hurried back into the salon to check on Valoree. \"Does heknow ye're hismother? \"</p><p>Meg frozeatthat, her eyes going wide. \"I - He isnot - \"</p><p>\"He'syerson, \" Henry said firmly and dryly. \"And there's no doubting it. Your sister maylookquite a bit like you, but she hasn'tgotthose lovely blue-as-the-skyeyes with the goldflecks. I doubtanyonedoes.\"</p><p>\"Tom could tell Lady Beechamwasmy sister, too? \" she asked in alarm. \"DearLord, whatifeveryone - \"</p><p>\"Everyone hasn't figured it out, \" Henry reassured her quickly.</p><p>\"Valoree hasa good eye.She recognized yewere sisters, then talked to yeabout it. Afterward she told me. I don't thinkeven she has figured out that Beecham's yer son, though. The only eyesshe's been lookinginto lately is Thurborne's.\"</p><p>\"Aye.\"Meg sighed. \"I do not understand why she is so set against marrying him. He isperfect for her. My John ...\" she paused, flushingslightly, then continued, \"Well, John isa nice youngman, but he isno match for her.\"</p><p>\"Not yet, \" Henry agreed quietly. \"Buthe'll become stronger.</p><p>He is still quite young. He needs a little seasoning, is all - seasoning he never wouldhavegothad he married Valoree. She'd havestepped on him andkept him there under her footuntil his spirit died.\"</p><p>\"She'sasleep.\"</p><p>They both turned to glanceat Petey ashecameout intothe hallto make that announcement.</p><p>\"Good. The potion worked, \" Henry murmured wearily.</p><p>\"Aye, \" Petey agreed quietly. \"But she ain't gonna likeit much when she wakes up andfigures outwhat we did.\"</p><p>\"It's for her own good, \" Henry said defensively. \"We're trying to save her from making amistakeshe'd regrettherest of her life.\" Turning, he peered downthe hallway toward thekitchens.</p><p>\"One-Eye! Skully! Bull!\"</p><p>The three men came out of the kitchens on the double, a questionin their eyes. But only One-Eyeaskedwhatthey were allwondering. \"Is it done? Did itwork? \"</p><p>\"Aye.Bull, go fetch her outto the carriage. Skully, help Meg bundle upsomeof those fine dresses for us to take with us.\"</p><p>\"What do you want us to do? \" One-Eye asked, moving up beside Petey as the other two men and Meg moved off to do whathe had asked of them.</p><p>\"We needto move thechests out and make sure everything is locked up tight. Who knows how long it will take ere we convince those two they are meant for each other? \" Henry paused, clicking his tongue inirritation. \"And I'd best send a message to Beecham, tellhimwe're off to thecountry for a bit.</p><p>This town house is paid up for another five months and hemight wonder if we just disappear.\"</p><p>\"What about Thurborne? \" Pete asked as Bull carried an unconscious Valoreeout of the salon.</p><p>\"We'llcollect him afterwe get the captain backtothe ship, \"</p><p>Henry announced, reaching to openthedoor for Bull, only to freezewhen a knocksounded onthe other side. Bullimmediately changed direction, turningaway from the door and continuing across the entry arid on into the library with Valoree. Henry grabbed Petey'sarm and pulled him outof sight on the otherside of the door, then gesturedfor One-Eye to openit.</p><p>Daniel rapped hiscane on the door, then set it onthe ground andturnedto peer idlyup the road as he waited for it to be answered. Hewas running a bit late. He hadhoped tohave all his questions answered and to have gotten here by noon, but the answers he had received to his questions had not been satisfactory. He had wasted the whole morning and a good portion of the afternoon finding out nothing. So much for his hopes of being able to sort out the mess that seemed to be swirlingaround Valoree.And it seemed to him to be a rather huge one.</p><p>First, there was the matter of Back-from-the-Dead Red. The king had finally heard that Lady Ainsleywasin London insearch of a husband. He was demanding answers now regarding her brother'sdemise, or lack thereof. Daniel had rather hoped the manwouldn't findout for a bit longer. At least until Daniel had gotten her to trusthim and give up her stubborn resistance to marrying him. He knew if he didn'tget her to agree before she found outabout his past, she probably wouldn't trust himenough afterward.</p><p>Daniel grimaced at himself and the spot he was in. He had never before beeninterested enough in any womantodo more than offerher a quick roll in the linens - or possibly two. Yet here was a woman who wanted that roll andnothing else, and he was theonewho wanted more. Hell, hewanted it all.She was unlike any woman he had ever met. She was strong, intelligent, decisive. Herespected her. He also wantedher with an ache that was beyond anythinghe had before experienced. The last two weekshadbeen hell. He hadthought that was sodamn clever when he had decidedthat hewould use her desire for him to crumble herdefenses and convince her to marry him. If he had realizedtheagonyof torture hewould becausing himself... Well, hell, he stillwould have gone aheadwith theplan. He waseven beginning to think it mightbeworking. Or perhapshe wasjust foolinghimself, he thought wryly, and sighed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thiswoman was a magnet for trouble, though. Firstthere was the king and his desire to solve this Back-from-the-Dead Red business; then there werethe rashof accidents aroundher. They had decided at the timethat she was knockedoutthat she had probably walked in on andsurprised someoneout to rob her. And heprobably wouldhave been satisfiedwith that if it werenot for the carriageaccident.That had bothered himagreat deal. And the description her men had given of how it had occurred was positively worrisome. From what was said, it hadalmost sounded as though the crash was deliberate. Daniel had been doubtful enoughof itsbeing an accident, and he had decidedto look into it.</p><p>But Valoree's \"servants\"had beaten him to it, alreadytalking to everyone he had thought to ask - from the various household help of each place on the streetwhere the accidenthad taken place, to the owner of the wagon itself. They had all mentioned that a fellow with a patch over his eye, andamateof his who was as bigasa mountain anddark as death, had been by to ask the same questions. Daniel had at once recognized the descriptions as fitting two of Valoree's rather disreputable manservants. He hadalso learned from the owner of the wagon that thefellow withthe patch onhis eyehad mentioneda fireat the town house latelast night.</p><p>It hadall only left Danielmore convincedthan everthat there was something goingon, but he hadn't a clue exactly what or why - just that Valoree was asmuch amagnetto trouble asshe was a magnetto him. And that he had best resolve all this soon, before someone gotkilled - or he diedfrom unsatisfied desire. Hejust had to convince her to marry him; thenhe could lay hiscards on the table, tell her all, and together they could work out everything.So today he was determined toget herto agree to marryhim - even ifhe had to blackmail her with his knowledge that shewas Back-from-the-Dead-Red to doit.</p> <p>The opening of the door drew Daniel fromhis thoughts, and he turnedto find theservant Valoree calledOne-Eye peering outat him.The man's one good eye widenedincredulously at the sight of him; thenhe slammed the door in his face. Astonished, Daniel could hear excited chatter from the other side of the door.</p><p>Unfortunately, the wood muffled it enough that he couldn'ttell whatwas being said.</p><p>Shaking his head in disbelief, he rapped firmly on the door again. It opened almostat once thistime, and Daniel arched one eyebrowwithincredulity. \"Lord Thurborne to see - \"</p><p>\"I'm not daft; Iknow who ye are, \" themanmuttered in disgust.</p><p>\"I'll seeifshe's in.\"</p> <p>The door slammedinhis faceagain.</p><p>Shaking his head in bewilderment, Daniel sighed and prepared to wait. It seemedthey were playing a new game. Hard to get, perhaps? Or let-the-randy-bastard-wait-on-the-doorstep-until-I' m-ready-to-grant-him-an-audience?</p><p>The door opened again, all the way this time, and One-Eye gestured for him to enter, then peered outat the street as he did.</p><p>\"Isthat yercarriage? \"</p><p>Daniel glanced out and nodded. \"Aye.\"</p><p>\"Hmmm.\" He didn'tlookpleased at the news. Frowning, he pushed the door closed, thenmotionedtoward the door tothe salon. \"Well, go onin. She'll bealong directly.\"</p> <p>Shaking his head, Daniel turned and walked intothe salon. He considered making himselfa drink, then decided to wait until Valoree arrived. He had barely come to rest in a chair, when her Uncle Henry entered, followed by aman herecognized asthe cook.</p><p>\"Good day, Lord Thurborne. How are you? \" Henry asked cheerfully.He didn't waitfor an answer, butannounced, \"Valoree willbe along in amoment, but she asked me to see toyer comfort andoffer you arefreshment, so Pete mixedup a couple ofspecial warmed spiced rums forus.\"</p><p>\"Wannedspiced rum? \" Daniel asked curiously, acceptingthe cupHenry lifted offthetrayand handed to him.</p><p>\"Aye. They'rereal tasty andwarm the stomach, helpinga body torelax.\" He tooka cupoff thetray himself, nodded at theother man, who immediately turned toleave, then seated himself across from Daniel. Hesmiledathim overhis own cupas he lifted it for asip. \"Try it. Ye've never hadanything like it.\"</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Valoree felt like hell. Her mouthwas as dry asJasper's smile, and her headfelt like it was splittingin half. Shewas pretty sure of that. Graspingitin both hands, she held on toittightly, just to makesure her brainsdidn't fall out. Then she slowly, carefully opened hereyes - only to blinkthem closed again rather quickly.</p><p>She'd died and gone to hell for her sins. That was the only explanationfor theburning blur of light that attacked her eyes upon opening them.</p><p>Groaning, she tried to lie still for a moment, thenrealized that it wasn't her moving; it was the bed. Dear Lord! Someone or somethingwasmoving the bed about while shelayon it. Forcing hereyes open, again, she raisedherself up on her elbows and squinted about in the hope of discovering whoit was, only tofind there was no onethere. Itdidn'ttakeher poor woolly mind more than aminute or two afterthat before she realized thatthe bed she layin wasn't thehuge four-poster fromthe townhouse, but thewee hardcot of a ship. Her ship. She was on the Valor, and that was what was moving.</p> <p>Howthedevil had shegotten here? she wondered, dropping weaklyback onto herbunk. The lastthingsheremembered was ... Hmmm. What wasthe last - Oh, aye! Beecham!She hadbeen about toarrange things with Beecham. That was it.But then Meg hadcome in, and then Henry andPetey had brought the tea. Only it hadn'tbeen tea. At least hershadn't been.Henry had fixed her some of his special hot spiced rum and - Hereyes blinkingopen again abruptly, sheroseup inthe bed like the resurrected dead, roaring at the top of her lungs.</p><p>\"Henry!\"</p><p>\"Soyou decided tokidnapthe twoof us and forceusto wed? \"</p><p>Danielasked in disbelief.</p><p>Henry shifted.He stood afew feet fromthe bed, where Daniel now sat rubbing his sore head. \"Aye. Well, she's too damned stubborn to marry ye elsewise, and you two belong together.</p><p>Ye're perfectfor each other.Just being around ye hassoftened her up some already. And ye need a woman who will be a challenge, else ye'd lose interest right quick.\"</p><p>Daniel raisedhis head to stare at him. \"You know so much about me in sucha short time? \"</p><p>Henry shrugged.\"Yelearn to take the measureof folk right quick in ourline of work.\"</p><p>\"Speaking of which, whatexactlyis your lineof work? \" Daniel asked silkily. Henry pursed his lips, considering the matter briefly, then shook his head.</p><p>\"Ithink I'll just let you and the captain sortthat oneout.\"</p><p>Daniel grunted, then pressed his hands to either side of his head. \"What the hell was in that damndrinkyou gave me? \"</p><p>\"Head'sbothering ye, huh? \" Henryasked solicitously.</p><p>Daniel impaled him with his eyes, then suddenly frowned as a thoughtoccurred tohim. \"How did you getme out of the town house withoutmydriver causing an uproar? \"</p><p>\"Ina chest.\"</p><p>\"A chest? \" Daniel cried.</p><p>\"Aye.\" Henrygrimaced athisupset. \"We put ye in Valoree's dress chest and carted ye out.\"</p><p>\"And Valoree? \" he askeddryly.</p><p>\"We wrapped herina tapestry.\"</p><p>\"Great, I...\" Daniel began, thenpaused as a sudden bellow, not unlikethesound awounded bear might make, reached themfrom the nextcabin. \"Correct me ifI am wrong, \"hemurmuredwith sudden amusement, \"but I do believethat was your name she was singingout in her softvoice.\"</p><p>Henry's mouth tightened, his eyes narrowingon Daniel atthe comment; then he signed and turned toward the door.</p><p>\"Just amoment.\" Danielstood, grabbing at the nearest itemat handto steady himself. Itturnedout to be achair.He waited until the other man had turned back questioningly, then said, \"Whatever yougave me hasleft me with a weak stomach.If I do not get out on deck and breathesome freshair soon, youwill be sending someone in here to scrapethe contents of my stomach off the floor.\"</p><p>\"Go ahead, \" Henry told him. \"Ye're not a prisoner.Ye're a guest.\" Then he left, closingthedoor behind him.</p><p>Daniel stared at the door inamazement for a moment, then shook his head. \"A guest.Of course. Ido not know why I thought otherwise.\" Shrugging, he started cautiously across the floor.</p><p>Henry wasn'tquick enough. Valoree was off the bedand on her third shoutfor the man by the timeher cabin dooropened and he stuckhis head warily inside. Spying her standing, graspingthe edge of herdesk for balance as she tried toshake off the last of the effects of the drug he had given her, the man forced an innocentsmile. \"Aye, Captain? \"</p><p>\"Don't you 'Aye, Captain' me, you - \" she began, taking a threatening step toward him; then she paused to grasp the desk againas the room swayeddangerously about her. \"What have you done? \" she snapped. Then, beforehecould answer: \"Never mind that.I cansee whatyou've done. Well, it won't work.How farout of portarewe? \"</p><p>Henry didn't question howsheknewthey had left the London docks.She hadlived on a boatlongenough totell thedifference between the relativecalmof a harborand the roll of the sea.</p><p>\"About aday out, \" he admitted. Her mouthtightened.</p><p>\"Well, you get your arse upthereand tell them toturn the ship around. We're going back!\"</p><p>\"Ah, now, captain-girl, \" hestartedin awheedling tone. It died as her gaze narrowedon him.</p><p>\"Stow it, Henry. I'm so mad at you I could - \" She almost seemed tochoke on her anger, then waved him awayin disgust.</p><p>\"Getout! I'll give the orders myself.Butknow this, Henry: you men haven't stopped anything. I will return and I will marry Beecham. Allyou've managed to dois delay it.\"</p><p>Henry hesitated, then twisted and backed out of the cabin, closingthedoor quietly behind him.</p><p>Muttering underher breath several things she wouldlike to do to the man, Valoree made her way cautiously to the chestbythe bed and kneltbeside it. Throwingit open, sherifled through it brieflyuntil shefound her knee breeches, whiteshirt, boots, belt, and short waistcoat, then began to undress where she sat, transforming from Lady Ainsley into Captain Valerian in amatter of moments. Then she crawledback to her feet and stumbled for the door, pausingonly to grabup her cutlass, knife, and pistol on the way. She needed some fresh air, or she'd surely puke up whatever it was Henry had put in her drink - if there was anythingleft in her stomach to heave out, whichwas doubtful.</p><p>She felt betterthe moment she stepped outonto the deck. The roiling in her stomach diedan abrupt deathas she turned her face up to the sun and drew fresh sea air into her lungs.She had missed thislike astarving manmisses food.Fresh cleanbreezes, not the foul-smelling, polluted air in London. And the constant overwhelming racket thatwas the city: the rattle of wagons, the clip-clop of horses, the shouts of vendors selling their wares.</p><p>None of that assaulted herears.Here there was only theclang of the rigging, thesound of the waves hitting the hull, thewhisper of the breeze, and the flap of thesails. Dear Lord, how she had missedthis.Maybe she wouldn't punishthe men too harshly for this action, after all.Maybe she could forgive them this. She already feltrejuvenated after only a fewmoments. And it was only atwo-day delay of her plans.</p><p>Aye, she decided, a peaceful smile curving her lips as she peered around at the crew, who all watched her with wary attention.She would... hang themall by their damn toes fromthe rigging! \"What the hellis he doing here!\"she roared, her gaze having found and frozen on Daniel.</p><p>In thesilence that followed hercry, Danielmerelysmiledat hercrookedly.\"Back-from-the-Dead Red, I presume? \"</p><p>Valoree's eyes widened onthe man calmlycrossingthedeck toward her, dressed in only a shirt and breeches, his haira bit mussed, and a charming smile on hisface. He wasas handsome andappealing as She had ever seen him. Her heart turned overin herchest.</p><p>\"Bull, \"she said calmly.</p><p>\"Aye.\"The tall man was at her side at once.</p><p>\"TakeLord Thurborneup to the crow's nest andhanghim.\"</p><p>Danielgaped at her inthe brief silence that followed, hardly noticing how pale she had suddenlygone, or that herhands were clenched into tight fists, knowing only that she had just sentenced him to death.</p><p>\"Yecan't behanging him!\" Henry cried in dismay.</p><p>\"Aye!\" One-Eye backed the quartermaster up. \"We brought him here to marry ye!\"</p><p>She silenced the men with a gesture, then turned, her expression as smooth and emotionless as stone. \"I am stillthe captain of this ship, unless you menwant to vote me out of the positionright now. And, as captain, it is myjob tosee to your safety - even if you idiots are too damn stupid to tend to it yourself!\"</p><p>\"Now just a danged minute!

And do it quick.Andmake sure hisneck breaks when you throwhim over;I don't want him to suffer. Noneof this is his fault.\"</p><p>Noddingunhappily, the man grabbed for Daniel.</p><p>\"Now just a damn minute, \" Daniel snapped, dodging. \"I was theking's assessor, thatis true, butIam notto bringyouin, just question you.\"</p><p>He stopped talking and concentrated on struggling with Bull as the largerman tried to grab him. In the end, others had to step forward to help. Ittook eight men to entirely subdue him. They ended up having totie his hands behindhis back and his feet together so that Bull couldsling him over his shoulder and cart him toward the main mast.One-Eyeand Jackson followed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Never mind none.

But you'll have fulfilled therequirements of yourfather's will. Then we canstill claim theland.\" Henry watched her jaw tighten, her expression tellinghimthat she was atleastconsidering theidea.</p><p>He had torestrainhimself fromtelling her to think a bit quicker as he glanced warily up at the crow's nest. Bull was lifting Thurborne into the air in preparation to toss him over. If she thought too long, it would be too late, but he already knew pesteringher wouldn't work. She did whatshe wanted, inher own time, too.She always had.</p><p>\"Halt, \" she called suddenly tothe men above. Henry tried not tosag with relief as she began to pace beforehim. It was obvious she hadn't made up her mind, but he wouldn't pester her. It wouldn't helpif he did.All he coulddo was wait until she had thought it out.</p><p>When she suddenlystopped to whirl and face him, Henry felt himself stiffening to attention anxiously. \"Very well, Henry. I'll marry the bastard to saveyour hide and his. But if he doesn't showsigns of coming aroundright quick, you willbe making me awidow.You personally.\"</p><p>He nodded solemnly, hiding hisrelief asshe continued. \"And I won't beeither forgetting or forgiving this action, you sneakyold tar.\"</p><p>\"What did she say? \" Bull asked, glancing down at the deck wherethecaptainappeared to bechewing Henryout.</p><p>\"Sounded like 'Halt' to me, \" One-Eye muttered, peering hopefullydown.</p><p>\"Nay, it was'Toss.'\"Jackson joined them at the railing.</p><p>\"Toss? \"</p><p>\"Aye, asin'Toss 'im.' Tosshim over.\"</p><p>\"She wouldn't say 'Toss, ' \" One-Eye snapped impatiently.</p><p>\"She'dsay, 'Get on with it, ' or 'Throw him over, ' or maybeeven 'Toss him over, ' but she wouldn't just say 'Toss.' \"</p><p>\"Well, I think she said 'Toss, ' \" Jackson said a bit peevishly.</p><p>\"I'm pretty sureit was'Halt, '\" One-Eye argued.

'Tweren't yerfault ye're here.\"</p><p>Danielmerely stared at him numbly. He wasrather numb all over, actually. He couldn't seem to feel athing: not hislegs, not hisarms, not even anger.He was just numb.</p><p>Other than removingthe noosefrom around his neck, theydid not bother to untie himfurther. Bull simplyslunghim over his shoulder, then swung out onto therope ladder, carting him down just as he had carted him up. Despite the awkward position, Daniel was rathergrateful.Hedid not knowthat he couldhave managed the climb down - whatwith not beingable to feel his legs and all.</p><p>Valoree watchedgrimly untilthemen werehalfwayback down the ladder, then glared at Henry and turnedto stalk back into her cabin.Themen hadcertainlygottenher intoa fix this time. She hadtruly thought shewould have to see the man dead. She hadn't wantedto, and hadfelta shreddingsensation in her chestasthe man was led up the ladder to thecrow'snest.That shredding had intensified a hundred-fold as she had seen them placethe noose aroundhis neck, but She had trulyseen no alternative. Herbrother had leftthese men inher care. The knowledge Daniel now held, thanks to their foolish interference, had made him a terrible threat tothem all.It washer job tosee he neverbetrayedthem.</p><p>Just asit was his job tobetray them.</p><p>But if she married him, something She had been resisting doing fromthe start, the men became hisresponsibility by English law.</p><p>He wouldhardly turnhimself in. Not that she waspleasedto be giving up control this way, but faced with that or seeing an innocentman, king's spyor no, dead, well...</p><p>Sighing, she dropped intoherchair wearily.Mayhap she had been dreaming anyway to imagine that she could marry and retain her independence, even if she hadmarriedsomeone like Beecham. Legally he wouldhave beenlord over herand all she owned anyway, and the menmightvery well have accepted that.</p><p>Pirates they might be, buttheywere oddly traditional for all that. Hence the reason she had pretended tobe a male forthe past thirteen years. In truth, she mightbe gratefulforthe change as well. While therewas acertainamount of satisfaction ordering these men about, some of the responsibilityweighed heavily. Her decision today, for instance. Therewas nopleasure in ordering the death of a man. None whatsoever. She had done it twice before, butthose times themen hadbeen scurvy dogs deserving of their fate.Too, She had left the men tothe chore andretreated to her cabin. It was not that she lacked thecouragetowatch it, but simply that she had no desire to. She did not caretowatch garbagebeing tossedover the side of the shipeach dayeither.</p><p>As forDaniel, he hadbeen a different propositionentirely. His death, were she forced tosee to it, wasnot of his own making, or evenremotelyhis fault. The blamelaysolely on the shoulders of her men. That puther in aquandary.Shewouldhave to punish themfor that. Theyhad gone on their owninitiative and done somethingthey had known she wouldnot wish, and their actions had resulted in what could still mean the death ofa blameless man. That was why she had not been able to leave the deck during his execution. He didnot deserve todie, and she felt she hadto acknowledge thatby witnessingit.</p><p>But mayhap now he wouldnot have to die. Not if he wouldstill marry her. The tap at thedoor when it camedid not surprise her.</p><p>Nor was she surprisedwhen Henry entered. She had expected as much, desired himto followher, even. That was why she had glared at him hard beforecoming toher cabin. He had, as usual, understood.</p><p>Now he closed thedoorofher cabinandfaced her solemnly, waiting for her to speak.</p><p>\"Hemay still have toswing, \" she announced abruptly.</p><p>Henry grimaced. \"It's all my fault.\"</p><p>\"Aye, it is, \" sheagreed heavily.</p><p>The quarter mastersighed. \"How many lashes? \"</p><p>Valoree glanced awaywith a frown.Henryalreadyknew that he would be receiving punishment, or mayhaphe wasassuring her with hiswords that he understood she had to inflict it to maintaincontrol of theship.

They had approached her above deck a moment beforeand said theyneededto speakwith her. Nodding, she had led them down tothe captain's cabin. She had expected it would beaboutDaniel. She had given themantwo weeks tocalm down fromhis anger over almost being hanged, but he hadn'tsoftened onewhitas far as she could tell.It waslooking as though she was about tohaveto make ahard decision, but She had kept putting it off and putting it off.The men, it hadseemedto her whenthey had saidthey wished to speak, had decided they had all waited long enough.But then they had begun to speak, and she hadbeen so shocked by what they saidthatshe wasn't sure shecouldhave possibly heard them right.</p><p>Henry cleared his throat, thenrepeated himself. \"I saidthe men have allvotedand decided ye shouldwear a dress from nowon.\"</p><p>Valoree stared at him blankly. \"They want me to wear a dress?

Then ...\" He sighed.</p><p>Valoree turned her face away.\"Is thatall? \"</p><p>Henry and One-Eye exchanged a glance; then Henry straightened hisshoulders andannounced, \"We voted yelet Meg teach ye some ladylikethings.\"</p><p>Her jaw tightened. \"Whatsort ofladylike things? \"</p><p>\"Walking and talking andhowto laugh in that high, tinkly way that ladies do.\"</p><p>\"Isee.\" She was chilled through.</p><p>\"We also voted, and ye can't cussor drink nomore.\"</p><p>Her head snapped aroundatthat. \"Are you done? \"</p><p>The two menglancedateach other, then nodded.</p><p>\"Good, \" she said grimly.\"Now get out.\"</p><p>They hesitated, but thenmoved to the door.One-Eye paused there and nudged the older man.

Mayhap even resolve yourproblem with him.\"</p><p>Sighing, Valoree returned to herdesk chairand sank into it, gesturing forMeg totakethe seat across from her. \"Theletter of marque wasmade out to Jeremy.

But that was beforethe men kidnapped Thurborne - his man, and a noble. I fear that mightmake him alittle less pleased togrant us his favor.\"</p><p>\"Oh, dear, I see, \"Meg whispered, frowning. \"This all rests on Thurborne, then.\"</p><p>\"Who isquite angry at me for ordering him hanged.\"</p> <p>\"Aye, well.\" Shemade a face, then straightened her shoulders.</p><p>'ThenIthink you shoulddoasthe menhave decided: don your loveliest dressand try to charm the stockingsoff ofhim.\"</p><p>\"Do I have a choice? \" Valoree asked. Meg's expression softened again.</p><p>\"Oh, Valoree. You fight so hard notto be the things you are.\"</p><p>Valoree stiffened at the soft words. \"What I am is thecaptain of a pirate ship, \"she said quietly.</p><p>\"Nay. Thatis just a role you tookwhen forced.What you are is alady, born of nobilityand soonto return to yourhome.\"</p><p>\"I am a pirate captain, \" Valoree insisted.\"Andhave been for five years.\"</p><p>\"Areyou a man then, too? \" Meg queried, arching aneyebrow.</p><p>\"Nay, ofcourse not.\"</p><p>\"Nay, \" Meg agreed with a nod. \"You have lived as and pretended tobe amanfor thirteenyears, but that does not make youone. Youwereborn a female member of nobility, and will die one. Playing at pirates isjust something you did, not who you are. It is high time you realize that and stop playing. Pirate captains retire, die, or are votedout.Being noble lastsa lifetime.</p><p>This ship may sink, but Ainsley will not, and so longas you marry andprovidean heir, itwill always be there foryou.\" She paused, breathing heavily in herexcitement, thensighed.\"I suggest you stop deliberately doing everything in your power to look and soundand actlike a seadog, andstart using the ladylike words, manners, and abilities I know youhave.\"</p><p>At Valoree's startled expression, she nodded solemnly. \"Oh, aye. I figured out quitequickly thatyou werestomping about and muttering your curses, using slang and poor manners just to try to put off your suitors. I recognized you just as you recognized me for a true lady. What Ididnot understand at first waswhy. Now I think Ido.\"</p><p>\"Oh? \" Valoree said warily. Meg nodded.</p><p>\"You were hoping to avoid marriage. Having a family and children is risky.You might love yourbabies. Youmighteven come to love Thurborne, which is why you refused to even consider him. Lovingsomeone means risking heartache should youlose them, and you have had quite enough of that in your younglife, have you not? \"</p><p>Valoree made a face and shookherhead. \"Nonsense. As you said that day outside Whister's office, my crew aremy family. I care forthem. I amnot afraid tolove.\"</p><p>\"I was wrong, \" Meg saidsimply. \"Becauseif you lovedthem, you would havemarried Thurborne the moment he offered, and notchanced havingto return to pirating, wheretheyareall at risk of beinginjured or dying.\" Standing, shemovedto the door, then paused to glance back andsay, \"They careforyou. So much so that they will take away your captaincy if theythinkitwill make you do what they ultimately believe will make you happy. And they believe Thurborne will do that. So do I.\" Then shestepped outand pulled the doorclosed behind her.</p><p>Valoree releaseda breath andsank backintoher seat, a frown tugging at herlips. Meg was right, at least about her manners. She didknowhowto speakproperly, how towalk properly, and how to dine and behave in company. She may have been forced into theroleof cabin boy whilethey had worked to remaketheirlost fortune, butJeremyhad seento it that she knew howto behave.</p><p>There were no great dining halls on the Valor for all of them to eat together, sothemen ate in shifts. But Jeremy and she had had their meals in his cabin, where he had madesure she retained her proper eating habits, and had insisted they hold polite conversations. He had also insisted onherusing proper English allthetime, even around the crew - something the other men had teased and harassedher for at first.</p><p>Aye, She had been behavingbadly mostly on purpose, but she hadtold herself it wasfor the benefit of both herself and the men.</p><p>Theywould have grown boredin no timeliving the quietlifein the country, she'd assured herself.Thenthey would pine for their lives of privateering, but it would be toolate. In truth, . Valoree hadresented the men's voting to retire. She had been actually relieved when Whister had said she had to be married and produce anheir. Then she had thoughtthat they would give up this foolishness andreturnto the sea.But they had voted she should marry. So aye, mayhap she hadplannedto behave badly in the hopes offrightening off suitors, butshe hadn'treally had to. Not much, anyway. Fate had stepped in, tossing those calamities with the facewhitener and fucus at her, and things had seemed tobe going her way without her aid until Thurborne had stepped in to puta fly in her pie. Shecouldn't turn him down without risking the men'sgettingirate andrefusing tofollow her.</p><p>Itwasn't as if hewere anold troll or something. Soher plans had changed again, andshe had decided she must find areplacement wereshe to refusehim. Beecham hadseemed theone least likely tocauseher problems.</p><p>Butthe rest ofwhatMegsaid, thatbit about being afraid to love lest she get hurt, and her notreally caring for the men or she would wish them out of the risky business of pirating - well, surely thatwas not true? Shewas no coward.Besides, shedid care forthecrew.</p><p>Valoree grimaced as she realized she could not even thinkthe word love in regard to her own feelings. And she silently acknowledged that she had been selfish. The men wished to retire. She shouldwish to seethem safely out of thebusiness.</p><p>And shedid, but.. . wherewould thatleave her?</p><p>Her gaze moved to the signet ringon her hand. Jeremy had pressed it into herpalm as he had died, and She had worn itever since.It had been toolarge, of course, but string wrapped around the baseof her fingerhad made it stay on.It hadalways meant a great deal to her, even more thanthe land itrepresented. It was all she reallyhad left of her family - thatring andthe men who had survived when Jeremy had died. That was what she had always thought.She'd refused to includeAinsley, the home that hadwitnessedthe death ofboth parents - itcaused her too much pain.And that was when Valoreerealized thatMeg wasright.</p><p>She had closed off her heart whenJeremy had died, afraid to loveand lose. She had refused to marry Daniel, not because he wastoo strong or would notlether lead, but becauseshe liked, admired, respected, and maybeeven loved him alittle already.</p><p>And because sheknew that she could love him wholeheartedlyif given the chance.But that wouldmean risking the painoflossif anything happened to him, and that possibility frightened her more than losingher ownlife in battle ever had.</p><p>She had beenbehaving like an idiotand a coward, and it was high timeshe cutthatout.Standing, she moved to the chest that held the gowns she had ordered inLondon and began to sort throughthem. She would wear gowns. She would not swear. She wouldnot drink. Shewould be the best lady sheknew how to be, andshe would charm the stockingsoff ofDaniel. This time, when he asked, she would marry him in atrice. Then they couldstart making that baby she neededto reclaim Ainsley.</p><p>Thurborne was not in the mood to be charmed. Valoree came to that conclusion after wasting two straightweeksonthe effort.</p><p>She didn't charm anything off him, let alone his stockings. She couldn't, since he wouldnot even talk toher. Valoree worked hard at the effort, trying everything she couldthink of. She tried sweetsmiles. Shetried polite conversations. She triedteasing him for being so grumpy. In desperation, she even lowered her neckline until it was beyond decent, but all she gotfrom him on each attempt was a cool-eyed look and a grunt. He wasn't charmed at all. And Valoree, who hadbeen incrediblypatient, in herown opinion, had finally had enough. It was time to take action. With that intent, she had calledHenryto her cabin.Now she facedhimacrossher desk and saidthe onlythingshe could think ofto save the situation:\"Get him drunk.\"</p><p>\"What? \" Henry gaped at her.</p><p>\"You heard me. Get him drunk.\"</p><p>Henry hesitated.\"But - \"</p><p>\"Henry, we do not have time for any more playing about.</p><p>There are barely seven months for metoget with child. Imust get moving on the matter, and to preserve Thurborne, hemust marryme. So gethimdrunk. Weshallhold the ceremony and I shall consummatethemarriage.\"</p><p>\"You'll be needing a little help from him with that task, Captain, girl, \" Henry mentioned a little tentatively. \"And who willmarry the two of you? \"</p><p>\"You will have to goashore and bring back a minister.\"</p><p>\"Go ashore where? \" the quartermaster asked. \"We have not reached landyet.\"</p><p>\"We will reach Port Royale by nightfall, \" Valoree told him calmly.</p><p>\"We made good time, \" he murmured withsurprise, but knew hersense of thesethings. She shrugged.</p><p>\"Aye. Oneor twostorms and only a couple days of lee wind. A good strong wind the restof thetime more than made up for it.\"</p><p>Shesighed. \"Gethim started on the drink, Henry. I want him well sotted when we reach Port Royale and you fetch the minister back.\"</p><p>Less than twenty-four hours later, Valoree watchedthe men row back towardthe ship witha frown.Theyhad been preparing a \"love nest, \" asthey insisted on callingit, on anice secluded stretch of shore for her and Daniel. Calling it a battle arena probably would have been closer to the truth, she thought derisively as she watched the small boatreachthe Valor andthe two men begin to clamber up the rope ladder. She suspected Danielwas not goingto bepleased thismorning when he learned that theywere married. Why should he be? Nothing else she had planned had gone her way.</p><p>Oh, aye, Henry had done as she had requested and gotten Daniel thoroughly drunk theday before. He had challenged him to a drinking game, then cheatedhis piratehead off. By thetime they hadreachedPort Roy-ale, Daniel hadn'teven been able to standon his own, let alone see straight, and forget about any ability he might have had tothink.</p><p>Themenhad hadto prop himup for theceremony, which had made the minister, at first, refuse to perform it. It had taken a lot of talking, gold, andeven threats to get theholy man Henry had found and fetched to cooperate. Especially as Daniel had obviouslyhardly known where hewas. Still, he had kept raving on about how she was \"my Valoree\" and her passion was \"soooo hot.\" Apparently the drink had made him forget all about his irritationover her tryingto hang him, and this helped reassurethe priest.</p><p>Unfortunately the moment the ceremony was over, and the minister had walked away, Daniel had collapsed tothe deck in an unconscious, sodden heap.One-Eye and Skully hadimmediately carried himdownto hercabin and laid him out on hersmall cot.</p><p>There, Valoree had attempted to consummate their marriage, onlyto learn - firsthand - what Henryhad meantbyher needing Daniel'scooperation to accomplishit.The manhadlainflat on hisback, snoringaway as She had undressed him, then continued tolie there. Allof himhad just lain there.</p><p>Consummation had been impossible. She had spent the night dozing inher chair, then got up this morning to give orders. She supposed this latest plan had come to her ina dream, for she didn't recall thinking it out. But whatever the case, she had ordered themento setsail around the island until theyreached a secluded cove she recalled, then instructed Henry to sit with Daniel and wait for him to wake up. She had toldthe man that themoment he did, hewas topoursome of that sleeping potion - the onetheyhad used to get her and Daniel aboard this ship - down his throat.But not too much.She wanted him outonly long enough toset her plan in motion.</p><p>Leavinghim to it, she had gone off to converse with Petey about whatshe wanted himto prepare for this plan, then had had One-Eye, Bull, and No-Nose help hertakeseveralthings ashore.</p><p>Thelast trip to the cove hadbeen to take the food she had had Petey prepare, andthe unconscious Daniel. After arranging him as she had ordered, themen hadpiled back into the dinghy and shovedoff, hurrying backtothe ship. They were not toreturn until dusk the next night - unless it rained or there was a problem. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now she just had to wait for Daniel to wake up. Which shouldn't really be long. Henry had assured her he hadn't given him much of the potion, and he had already shown signs of stirringwhen Bullhad carried himashore.</p><p>A voluble curse from the trees behind her a moment later proved her thought correct.It was time to begin. Resigned tothe battle ahead, Valoree turned and started up the sand to the trees.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p> <p>Daniel tookanotherlook at hisbound hands and cursed again.</p><p>What thehell had happened? The last thing he remembered was waking up with a terrible hangover from the drinking game he hadobviously lost, and Henry nursing some foul-tasting liquid down his throat.Then he'dwoke-up here?</p><p>Where washere, exactly? he wondered a bit hazily. Hisfirst thoughtwas that he hadbeen stakedout in the sand and left to drown. But he wasn'ton sand really, and there wasno sign of water. Thoughhe was staked out. Twogood-sized posts hadbeen driven into the sand oneithersideof, and up alittle from, his head, just off the carpet of silkysoftclothhelay on. His hands had beenboundto them. Similarposts at the other end held his feet spread-eagled. \"Wouldyou like adrink? \"</p><p>Daniel glanced down sharply to the woman now standing between his boundfeetas she eyedhimwarily. He glared at her for a moment, then asked between ' clenched teeth, \"What exactly are you up to now? Hanging me was notgood enough, so youhave decided to stake me out in the sun and let medie a long, slow death from thirst? \"</p><p>He realized how stupid that sounded the moment the words finishedleaving hismouth, considering thatshe had just asked him if he wished a drink, buthe could do little to take themback now.</p> <p>\"I believe youhave to be left out in the sun for that, \" Valoree asserted calmly. Shemoved to pick upa bottlethathad been laid out on a barrel a short distance away. There was also bread, cheese, and what smelled like somesort of roasted chicken there aswell, he noted with interest. Hewatched her pour a glass of wine half-full, pick up aspoon, andmove toward him. \"As you can see, Imade suretheyput you in the shade.\"</p><p>Daniel glanced around briefly tosee thathe was staked out undera groupof nice shady trees.He turnedtoward heragain as she knelt on the silkymaterialbeside him. \"Oh, \"he said.\"So how do you plan to kill me? \"</p><p>Pausing, she met hisgaze brieflyand frowned. \"I did nothave you brought heretobekilled, \" she snapped, and he gave her a morose smile.</p><p>\"Well, doforgive me forslighting you by thinking so.It was notthat long ago that you wereordering me hanged from the crow's nest.\"</p><p>Valoree released asigh, thenshrugged. \"Iwasnot happyabout it.But you are the king's spy, andI did vow to protect my men as captain.I had little choice but to see to thatto the best ofmy abilities.\"</p><p>Danielfelt himselfsoftensomewhat, then frowned. It was as simple as thatto her. She had aresponsibility as captain to see to the safety of her crew. He supposed he could understandthat. He had been in similar situations and had to make comparable decisions. He had even understood that when Henry had explained it to him, when Meg had explained it to him, and One-Eye, Skully, No-Nose.. .Hell, the whole crew had had a go at him about itoverthe past month, each of themending their littlechat with: \"We'll just keep this littletalk betwixtus two, hmmm? Noneed forthe captain to know'boutit.She'dthink I was fussing in herbusiness.\"</p> <p>Aye, Daniel understood her decision, and he wasn't really angryabout it either, though hecouldn't havesaid the same right afterward.Once histemper hadcooled a bit, he had realized that hewas half to blame for the fiascohimself. If hehad been honest fromthe outset andsimply cleared up the mess over herbrother and Back-from-the-Dead Red from the beginning, none of it might have happened. But he'dbe damned if that meant he was going tolet her get awaywith marryinghimto save his life. Not thathe didn'twanttomarry her, butwho the hell needed that?</p><p>He did notneed her throwing it inhis face every timethey had a disagreement over the next fiftyor sixty years: I only married youto save your life. Ishould have let you swing! Nay. If they married it would be because she had finally admitted her desire to do so, notunder the excuseof saving his hide.The thing of it was, hewas pretty damn sure she did want to marry him.Orat leastthatshe wantedto sleepwith him.But he wanted to hear her say it. If she would just say it, he would becomethemostagreeable, mostcooperative of men.</p><p>A sigh of impatiencefromher drew hishead around as she asked, \"Do you want some ofthisor not? \"</p><p>Daniel eyed theliquid suspiciously. He was thirsty, but... \"Is it poison? \"he asked, his gaze narrowing at the spoonful of wine she hadpoured out of theglassand wasmoving toward his lips.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she lifted the spoon to her mouth and swallowed its goldencontents.</p><p>\"There. See? No poison. Now doyou want some? \"</p><p>Faceexpressionless, he nodded, and she quickly poured out another spoonful and tipped it into hismouthwhen he opened it.</p><p>Then she fed him another spoonful, and another. It was a perfectly ridiculous way to drink, and most unsatisfactory.He felt likea child, and histhirst required a fullglass or two poured down his throat to quench it, not these little trickles of thestuff.</p> <p>\"If Iamnot hereto be killed, why am I tied down? \"he asked after severalspoonfuls, when his frustration got the better of him.</p><p>Valoree hesitated, then admitted, \"Because Henrywasworried about howyou would take the news Ihaveto impart. He was unwilling to leave us herewithout a guard unless you were tied down.\"</p><p>His eyes narrowed at once at that. \"What news? And why could younot impart iton the ship? \"</p><p>\"Oh, I couldhave, \"she assuredhim quickly, then added, \"but I wanted privacy for the other part.\"</p><p>\"The other part? \"</p><p>\"Aye.\"</p><p>\"What other part? \"</p><p>\"The part thatcomes after the news, \" she said evasively.</p><p>Danielshifted impatiently, tuggingat his bonds infrustration.</p><p>\"Well, whatbloodynews? \"</p><p>She hesitated uncertainly, then asked, \"Would you not like some more winefirst? \" When his only response wastoglareat her angrily, she shifted unhappily and asked, \"Do you not remember anything about last night? \"</p><p>Daniel blinked at the question. He was rather fuzzy on that subject. Itwas alla sort of pink haze. Pink and fuzzy. \"What happened? \"</p><p>\"We got married.\"</p><p>He immediatelybeganto struggleas ifshe had stuck her blade in hisarse, hishandsand feetpulling furiously at theropes that boundhim, cursesrolling off his tongue in fury. He snarled as Valoree eased warily away from him to watch from a safe distance. After a few moments of fruitless struggle, Daniel stoppedand glared at her. Panting, he raged, \"The hell wewere!\"</p><p>Valoree moved silently toa sackbeside the barrel, withdrew a piece of paper, and returned to holdit before his face. It was a maritalcontract, andhis signature was right there on it beside hers, albeit a littlesloppy.</p><p>\"Henry fetchedaminister from Port Royale, and Jasper took careofobtaining the special license. You said 'I do' and signed.</p><p>We are married.\"</p><p>Danielstared at the paper forthelongest time, thenglanced towardher smugly. \"I will have it annulled.\"</p><p>Sighing, she looked away from him briefly, then back hopefully. \"Would you like more wine? \"</p><p>\"Oh, no.\" He shook his head firmly. \"I'll not touch another drop of anything but water untilI've had this marriageannulled.\"</p><p>Sighing, she walkedback to replace the piece ofpaperinits sack, muttering, \"I guessyou leave me nochoice, then.\"</p><p>\"What? Youare givingup? \"he asked withdisbelief andnot a little disappointment. Had he beenwrong? Did hemean so little toher? Where was his lady pirate? Where was her fight?</p><p>Finishedputting the license away, shestraightened andturned to calmlymoveback toward him.\"Nay. I am notgiving up. I am simplymoving on toaccomplishing the taskmyself.\"</p><p>\"What task? \"he askedsuspiciously. Hergaze dropped atonce tothearea south of hiswaistand north ofhis knees.</p><p>\"A little rapingand pillaging.\"</p><p>Daniel's jawdroppedin amazement;then anincredulous grin stoleacrosshis face. \"And howdo you plantoaccomplish that without my cooperation? \"</p><p>Her gaze still on his nether regions, she arched an eyebrow, her relief showingas she commented, \"It appears I may havesome cooperationwith that task. Just enough to see the deed done, no doubt.\"' Daniel didn't have to glance down to understand her meaning. The very thought of the raping and pillaging she had mentioned had made his one-eyed soldier decide to stand at attention - and it certainly was doing that. It was standing so straight and eager, she could probably fly her JollyRogerfrom the damn thing.Since there was no sense in arguingthe point, he decided to simplylie there and see how things developed. Until she picked up a knife from the barrel andmoved towardhim.</p><p>\"What are you planning todo with that? \" he asked warily.</p><p>\"Well, \" she mused calmly, \"itseemsto meI cannot undress you all tiedup asyou are.\"</p><p>Hiseyebrowsroseasshemoved down by his feet, then knelt between them. \"So youaregoing to let mego? \"</p><p>\"Notquite, \" shesaidcheerfully, then slid the knife between his leg and knee breechesand beganto slice upward.She wasmost efficient; were he a fish, he would considerhimselffilleted, he thought grimly as hisknee breeches droppedaway from oneleg.</p><p>Straightening, she performed the action again on hisother legjust as quickly.Then she shiftedfurtherupward to sit between his spread thighs, making twomore slices, each one neatlycutting the cloth from where her lastslicing motion had left off, up to andthroughthewaistof his breeches.Leavingthecloth lying over him, she then tossed the knife aside and straightened to standconsideringly between his feet.</p><p>Danielswallowed andwaited.He supposed he had expected her to lifther skirts and drop tomount him in justas quick and efficient amanner as she had sliced his clothes away.She didn't.</p><p>Instead, she reachedout suddenly and began to undo herbodice, watching his face as she did. Once done, she pulled thegarment off first oneshoulder, then theother and let it drop between his legs. Heroverskirtfollowed, then the kirtle, and then her partlet.</p><p>Daniel licked his lipsas her corset and petticoats slipped away next. She was left in achemise so thinthat through it, he could see the triangular shadow between her legs and the round darkness thatwere the areolae of herbreasts.</p><p>Her gaze slid back tohis manhood now, a slow smile spreading on her lips. Danieldidn't have to lookdown toseewhatcaused thatsmile.Hehad been unable todo anything but grit his teeth and bearit as hehad grown stifferwith each removed item, his erectiongrowingand lifting the loose cloth of his breeches away from hisflesh.</p><p>Winking at him, she bent slowlyandgrasped the hem of her chemise, drawingit slowly upward. Itwas only then that Daniel realizedshe had forsworn hose and garters, and was barefoot.</p><p>Probably a smart thing to do to negotiate the sand here, he thought distractedlyas sheslowlystraightened, uncovering her calves, herknees, herthighs.</p><p>Daniel swallowedaudiblyas she revealed thenestof curlsat the apex of her thighs. Itwas as bright as redasthe hair on her head. His gaze paused there briefly, losing several of her movements, but he caught up as she lifted the gown past her breasts, and his eyes widened.They wereswollen and full, with nipples that at the moment were tightly erect and a cinnamon-brown.</p><p>Daniel had to bite hislipto keep from groaning aloudat that.</p><p>Her little striptease had excited her as much as it had him, it seemed. She was definitely no shrinking violet. Tossing the chemise tojointhe smallpile of clothes to theside of where he lay, Valoree steppedover histhigh to kneelbesidehis chest. She bentover him then, her hair falling forwardlike acurtain to hide her face from view as she beganto undo the fastenings of his shirt.</p><p>\"Untie me.\" Daniel's voice was harsh from the strain of watching, silent and unmoving, but she ignored him, undoingthe lastof the buttons. She pushed thecloth of his whiteshirt open witha sigh, her hands running over hischest as she did, her hair ticklingacross his belly, which tightened atonce in response. She slid one hand down over his stomachto sweep the remainsof his breeches out of the way, her hand brushing across his hot flesh as she did, making him close his eyesin exquisite pleasure. Damn! She had barely touched himand his bodywasalready threatening toexplode.It was the anticipation.He knew bloody well that she would not untie him. That she would mount him with that damned sexy smile of hers, and ride him untilhe - His eyes popped open asshetrailed kisses down his chest and across his stomach. \"What are you doing? \"He gasped in horrified wonder as she pressed the little kisses to his hip, then shifted between his legs.</p><p>\"Sometimes, \" she murmured against the flesh of his thigh, \"when the men go ashore, if they arefeelinggenerous, theyhave been known to send back a prostitute or two for the men left behind, \" she told him, her hand closingaround his manhood and squeezing curiously. \"They are not supposed to and risk a whippingfor doing so, but a half a dozen times orso overthe years, Ihave come across themen engagedin various actswith these women. Twice the women were on their knees - \"</p><p>\"Oh, God!\" Daniel gasped as she rose up slightly, her breath brushing against the excruciatingly sensitive tipof his manhood as she spoke.</p><p>Pausing, she grinned at him slightlyandannounced, \"Youare getting bigger still. I did notthink you could.\"</p><p>\"Ohhh, God!\" Danielgroanedas her mouth closed over his tip and she suckled at him likea babe at its mother'sbreast. It was rather obvious that shedidn't have a clue what shewas doing.</p><p>She was experimenting with him like a child with a toy. She sucked, then she licked, then shenipped, anditdidn'tmatter that She hadno idea what she was doing, for the very fact that she was doing it - andthe view he had of hereyes and face as he looked down his bodyather - was driving him insane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Untie me, \" he rasped desperately, then added, \"I think I am coming lose anyway.Just - \" Daniel fell into relieved silence as thatgot a reaction out of her. Shifting, she reachedup to check the handnearest her, and Daniel licked his lips as one breast jiggledgently just a bare fewunreachable inches to the sideof his face.Then she leaned overhim to check the other wrist, and that breastwas suddenly an inch above hisface. Liftinghis head, he licked hungrilyatthefleshon the underside of herbreast; then he nippedat itspeak before closing his mouthoverthe nipple and drawing it intohis mouth.</p><p>Valoree had gonestill atthe first touch, but had not removed herself. Now she groaned as he laved her hungrily, her body tremblingas shestretched over him.</p><p>\"Untieme, \" hemurmured against her skin. \"Come. Untie me.\"</p> <p>Groaning, shestraightened away from him, shaking her head.</p><p>\"Nay. Youarejusttrying to seduce me into setting youfree.\"</p><p>\"Nay, I...\"Daniel paused as she stood, then stepped over him so that she had one foot oneither side of hiships.Fora moment, he had aview like no other; then she lowered herself carefully, frowning as his splayed legs forcedhers out at anawkward angle as she tried to positionherself above him.</p><p>\"You cannotdo it with my legs like that. Untie me andI will - \" Her sudden grasping of hisshaft with one hand totry to position him made him stop and bite his lip again as arrowsof sensation shot through him.</p><p>\"You cannot, \" hemanaged again in a strangled voice, groaning in relief when she suddenly releasedhim and stood.</p> <p>Retrieving her knife, she movedsilently to his feetandfreed first one, then the other. Daniel pulled his legs closed as she tossed the knife aside again, thenreturnedto herearlierposition, kneeling astride him. Grasping him in her hand, she shifted slightly, peering down as she lowered herself, shifting him as she sought her entranceusing his flesh as the probe. Daniel groaned at the combination of her firm hold on the base and the warm, wet flesh closingaround and brushingover the tip of him as she played find-the-entrance.Just when she hadfound it, hemuttered hername.She paused to peer up at him questioningly.</p><p>\"Aye, my lord? \"</p><p>Daniel nearlylaughedat the polite title, thenshook his head.</p><p>\"Myhands.\"</p><p>\"I will notuntieyou, mylord, \" she asserted, but he shook his head.</p><p>\"No. My hands. They feel odd.\"</p> <p>Her gaze slid upto his hands and she gasped inalarm. She releasedtheholdshe had on his manhood andleaned overhim to quickly loosenfirst one bond then the other. It wasnotenough thathe couldescape hiscaptivity, but enough to let someblood backintohis hands. Daniel, whohad deliberatelypulled tight on his bindingsto cause such anecessity, immediately licked at any flesh in hispathlike a starving dog lickingthe juice from his lord'splate. His tongueroved over her breasts, between them, andattheundersides. Anything thatjiggled into his pathreceived a like treatmentas she worked. A moan ofdisappointment slid fromhis lips as sheeased away fromhim, only to besilenced by her mouth as she kissed him, licking hislips as he had hers so manytimes, then slipping inside with her tongue to explore him aggressively before receding to allow him toexplore in return.</p><p>He kissed herdesperately, groaning again when she endedthe kiss, then sighingas her lips brushed over his chin, his chest, then found and fastened curiously on one nipple. She licked and nipped experimentally as she slid her handbackdownto find and squeeze hisstaff as iftesting itforusability. Thensheslid down again, settling herself over him, and began to probe herselfwith the tip once more, wiggling as his flesh rubbed over hers.</p><p>Apparentlyenjoying the sensation, shedidit again, and Daniel moaned at theexquisite torture. She paused then, peeringat him curiously. \"Doesthat hurt? \"</p><p>\"Oh, God, no.\" Hegroaned. \"Itfeels good.\"</p><p>\"Really? \" Valoree leaned forward slightly, bracing her free hand on his chest as she again brushed him against herself, rubbing his hardnessacross her soft, damp warmth.She admitted abit breathlessly, \"I like it too.\"</p><p>Tugging at hisbindings, Daniel closedhis eyes asshe continued to manipulate him, pressing him harder against herself with each caress, and moving farther forward and farther back eachtime until he felt histip nudge against her opening. She paused then, suddenly, and he opened his eyes to see that she was quite flushed, her lipspartly open, her eyes sleepy with desire. He knew he wasin much thesame state, and opened his mouth to again beg herto untie him, butjust as he wouldhave, sheeased herself slowly backward, wriggling and shifting as she went, easing him into her narrow passage. When the tip met the membrane that proved her innocence, she paused, her gaze meeting his, and Daniel immediately gave up his restraint. He raisedhis knees slightly behind her and thrust upward, plunging through with onequick push.</p><p>They were both still then, and Daniel frowned at her expression.</p><p>\"Are you all right? \" heasked in concern.She nodded, but not veryconvincingly, so he askedcuriously, \"Did it hurt much? \"</p> <p>She made another face and sighed.\"Just enough to dampenthe pleasure.\"</p><p>\"Untieme andI will - \"</p><p>\"Nay.\"She shookher head abruptly. \"Next time, mayhap. I willsee this well andtruly consummated before Irelease you.\"</p><p>\"Once the maiden'sveil is broken it is consummated.\"</p><p>Valoreeshook her head. \"I willhaveyour seed. Justincase you try to claim I was not avirgin and nothinghappened.\"</p><p>Danielopened his mouth to argueagain, butthensnapped it shut as she braceda hand behind her on his knee and began to riseoff of him. It allowed him toslidepartway out of herbefore she loweredherself ontohim fully again. Shewatchedhis face as she moved, her expressioncurious, and Daniel felt self-conscious at first, until what shewas doingmade him closehiseyes. She was driving him crazy. It was slow torture. She raised and lowered herself with alanguid deliberation that was teaching him the meaning of frustration. All he wanted todo was ripthe damn postsout of the ground, clasp her buttocks, and take control of the speed. He wanted it faster, harder, more, andshe was driving him insanewiththisleisurely ride.</p><p>\"Untieme!\" he yelled in frustration, and she stopped, tilting her head slightly and frowning.</p><p>\"Am I doingit wrong? \"</p><p>Seeing the worry on herface, Danielshookhis head. \"Nay.I...</p><p>I would touch you. Untieme andlet me touch you.\"</p><p>\"Where? \" she askedwithinterest.</p><p>\"Your breasts.\" Hetugged athisbindings. \"I would closemy hands over yourbreasts and ...\" He paused when she glanced down and cupped her own breasts, peering atthem. Still holding them, she peeredathim curiously.</p><p>\"Why do menlike breasts so much? Surelyyou get no pleasure from touching them. Yet nearly every timeI havecome across my men with the prostitutes they sneaked aboard ship, they always seemed to have their handson their breasts - nomatter what else they were doing. And even you always touch and fondle my breasts first thing afterkissing me.Why is that? \"</p><p>\"Why? \"He staredat her blankly fora moment, then shook his head.\"Because they are beautiful, and they are soft, andthey feel good.Do you not like it whenI touch yourbreasts? \"</p><p>\"Aye, Ilike itwhen youtouchthem, \" shemurmured honestly.</p><p>\"Well, so do I.\"He shook his head wryly.\"It is a good thing women carry the breasts, forifmen hadthem, they would be fondlingthem all the time.\"</p><p>She laughedhuskily at thatand Daniel smiled; then hishumor faded. She was still cupping herbreasts, butthat was all.</p><p>\"Closeyoureyes, \"hesaid suddenly, andwhen she peeredat him questioningly, he nodded encouragingly. \"Go on, close them.\" He waited until she had, then continued, \"Now touch yourself. Hold yourbreasts. Caress them likeI would and pretend it is me.\"</p><p>Shehesitated foramoment, thenclosed her own hands over her breasts, clasping them briefly before catching the nipples betweenher thumband fingers. Asshepinchedand rolled them tentatively, a sighslippedfrom her lips.Daniel watchedher and felt himself swell furtherwithin her. Asif suddenlyremembering what she had been doing before the interruption, shebegan to ride him again, raisingandloweringherself in thatexcruciating leisurely rhythm as she continued to caressherself. Her hands slid awayfromher breasts to smooth overher belly, thenmovedback her breasts, upover hercollarbone andshoulders, then returned.</p><p>Her lips parted slightly again, her cheeks beganto flush, and her head fellbackward.Daniel gritted histeeth, his hands clenching with buildingexcitement, but his mind screaming at the slow, sedate pace.</p><p>Which was perhaps why he was so surprised when his excitement suddenly overtook him. It came on him without warning. Hefelt his toescurl towardthe bottoms of his feet and his body tense; then he jerked at his bindings and cried out, exploding inside her with unexpected force.</p><p>Eyes closed, heartstill pounding inhischest, he felt her lean forward on him to kisshis cheek; then she briefly rested atop him. He had nearlydozedoff moments later when finally she slid off.He felt first one ofhis hands, thenthe other, go slack as she released him, then heard her move away through the sand.</p><p>Opening his eyescuriously, he turnedhis head to watch herwalk naked down to the ocean. She waded for a moment until the water reached her knees, then dove in, and Daniel rubbed his wrists absently as he watched her frolic. She did not swim long before turning to shoreagain.</p><p>He watched her rise out of the waves, too far away to see clearly, but was able to imagine the beads of liquid rolling over herrosy flesh. He closed hiseyes as she made her way back toward him. Hearingtherustle of material, hepeeked oneeye opento see her drying herself with a piece oflinen, then closed it againwhen shetossed thescrap of clothasideand turned toward him. There wasa pause before he sensed her kneeling besidehim.</p><p>It took a concentrated effort for himnot to flinch in surprise when hercold, damp hair brushed his arm, butthen she cuddled up against him. Burrowing her head into thecrook of his arm and chest, she laidone hand gently on his stomach, and relaxed.</p><p>Somethingwas pullingat Valoree's wrist. Frowning sleepily, she tugged against it, her irritation replaced withconfusion when she couldn't seem to free her hand. Turning her head, she blinked her eyes open and staredblankly at therope binding herwrist to a post. Then herhead snapped around to findDaniel kneeling on her other side. She instinctively started to lifther free handfrom the sand where it lay by her hip, but he caught it easily and smiled.</p><p>\"Good morning, \" he murmured with a sweet smile. The expression turned wry as he began to bind that wrist to the opposite pole, ignoringherattempt to retrieve her hand.\"Well, notmorning exactly. Midday, I wouldguess.\"</p><p>Finishingwith her wrist, he straightenedand moveddown to her feet. Valoree began to scrabble sideways toavoid him, but there was only sofar she could go with her wrists tied down.</p><p>Danielgrabbed herankle after only a shortchaseand dragged her back into place tosecure her tothe post.Shecursedherself for having left the ropes in place.</p><p>\"What areyoudoing? \" Valoreeasked furiously, lashing outat him with her free foot.</p><p>Catchingit easily, Daniel shifted to kneel on it to keep herfrom kicking him as hefinishedbinding the first foot.Then heturned hisattention totying that one aswell.</p><p>\"There weare, \" he murmured ashe straightened from his task, his eyes wideningwith a sudden thought.\"You must be hungry.</p><p>Would youlike something to eat? \"</p><p>Valoree let out a breath, her body relaxingwearily. \"What do you want? Is this my punishmentfor tryingto hang you? \"</p><p>Daniel smiled gently. \"Iamnot angry atyou for trying tohang me.\"</p><p>\"Oh, aye. Why doI find that hard to believe? \" Sheglanced pointedly towardone bound wrist.</p><p>\"I am not, \" heassured her quietly. \"You did not gothrough withit, and you werein a tough spot at the time, thinking that I meantto turn youinto the king.\"</p><p>Valoree eyed him warily. \"Thinking that youmeant to turn me in? Did younot intend to? \"</p><p>Daniel shookhis head. \"Nay. I did mean to sortthat business out eventually, but I never intended to see you hanged. Why wouldI askyou to marry me if I planned to dothat? \"</p><p>Valoree made a face. She hadn't thought of that, but did now and suggested, \"Well, it would see that you inherited your grandmother'smoney, withouttheirritation of awifeto getin your way.\"</p><p>His looked surprised.\"Now why did I not think ofthat? \"When hermouth turned down in anger and she began to tug at her bindings, hechuckled softly. \"Theonly problem is, I need an heir as well as a wife.I cannot getan heirfroma dead wife.\"</p><p>Hestepped over oneoutstretched leg and kneltbeside her on the silkycloth, languidlysurveying her, then lightlyrunning his fingers over herflatstomach. Valoree instinctively tightened her abdominal muscles, then raisedher head up slightly to peer at him suspiciously. \"Whydidyou tieme down? \"</p><p>\"Because I intend to torture you, \" he announced cheerfully, spreading out beside her and bending his arm at theelbow so that hecould resthis head upon oneopen hand.</p><p>\"Why? \" she gasped in amazement.</p><p>He smiled and ignored her.\"Why did you marryme? \"</p><p>Her expressionwentsolemn, her eyes again wary. \"So that I wouldnot have to hang you.\"</p><p>\"Hmmm. I thought you might say that, \" he said pityingly, tracing hisfingers lightly over her hip.</p><p>Valoree immediatelybegan towriggle beneath thefeatherlight touch. \"Cutthat out!\"</p><p>Daniel raisedhis eyebrows. \"Do younot like me to touch you? \"</p><p>\"Notlike that. It tickles, \" she snapped.</p><p>\"Does it? \" He shifted his hand lower so that his fingers whispered lightly up the inside of herthigh.\"Does thattickle? \"</p><p>Valoree gritted her teeth. Shewould notask him to stop again.</p><p>It seemedthis was partof his torture. Though only he andthe goodLord knew whathe intended to torture her for.</p><p>\"Tell methat you want me, \" he whisperedby her ear suddenly, andValoree turned to gape at him in amazement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldnot believethat hewould threaten to torture her, then expect her to saysomething like that. What thedevil was wrong with the man? Well, the answertothat wasobvious. He was mad. IfShe had knowna bitsooner, she mighthave let him swing.</p><p>Herthoughts were distracted when he suddenly liftedhimself up and leaned close to herbreast. She thought at first that he meant to lick orsuckle herthere as hehad done inthe past, but insteadhepaused, his mouth mereinches from the nipple. His breath rippled againstit as his eyes turned toward her face. \"Shall I lick you? Kiss you? Shall Isuckle your breast? \"</p><p>Her nipple already reacting as if hehad done so, tantalized by the fanning of his breath, Valoree pressed her mouth firmly closed and turned herhead. Hearinga rustleas Daniel moved away, she releasedher breathin a sigh. One of relief, of course, she toldherselffirmly, onlyto stiffen as he returned. She refused to look at him, staringgrimly towardthe waterand wonderingif hewould leave her tied up untilthemen cameback, andjust how exactly heintended to torture her, and to what purpose. Then a splash ofcool wetnesson her chest made her gasp andglance around sharply to see him smilingas he tipped a glass ofwine onto first one breast, then the other. The golden liquid immediately randown them, asmall puddle forming between and slightly below her breasts.</p><p>\"What are you doing now? \" she askedsharply, and hesmiledat heragain.</p><p>\"Torturingyou, \"was his husky reply. Then he benttolickat the shallow poolofwine beforefollowing the trail to thebreast nearest him. He cleaned the liquid from her with long, slow strokes of histongue.</p><p>\"T-thisis your torture? \" she askedshakily, watching his tongue slide out to grazethetip of one painfully erect nipple.</p><p>\"Aye, \"he breathed againsther damp skin, sending shudders through her. \"Howdo youlike itso far? \"</p><p>Valoreesagged back onto thecloth-covered sand with asigh that turnedintoa nervous giggle.She sensed ratherthan saw his eyesseeking hersout, andmet his gazesilently as he frowned.</p><p>\"You did not think I meant torture torture, didyou? \" he asked, the beginnings of a scowl tugging at hismouth. Valoree hesitated.</p><p>Had she? Had she really thoughthe had meant torture? she asked herself. She suspected the answer was no. Valoree knew herselfwellenough to realizethat she would have done quite a bit more cussingand struggling, ratherthan lying there tensely to see what was to come about, if she had truly believedhe meant toharm her. Still, she didn'tknow whathe wasup to.</p><p>\"Nay, \"she whispered at last, andhe relaxed.</p><p>\"Good.\" He turned hisattentionto herother breast now, laving it as hehad thefirst.Valoree swallowed, her fingers closing into fistsas shesilently watched.She wasa touch uncomfortable lying there, helpless, as he kissed and licked her.She wanted totouch him, too - wanted to run her hands through his hair, over his chest, down his back. Which, of course, he had claimed he wishedto do, too, when he hadbeentied up.</p><p>Hishand replaced hismouth at her breast, and hislips moved upward, kissingatrail to her mouth beforecoveringit with his own. He kissed her discomfort away, his hand squeezing and massaging herbreastas hedid, his fingerplucking and rolling her nipple.</p><p>Valoree moaned into his kiss, herbody arching off the silky material between herself and the sand, her fingernails digging into the flesh of her palms. Then she was gasping for air as he releasedher mouth, his attentions movingto explore other vistas.</p><p>His lips grazedher cheeks, her chin, her ear, her neck, untilthey returned to herbreasts. Butthis timehe gavethemonly cursory attention before his tongue led himdownher stomach, pausing to dipinto her belly button, before he continued on to her hip, licking the hollowthere.</p><p>Valoree was writhing - shifting, arching, and moaning mindlessly beneath his attentions. Daniel shifted to kneel betweenher legs, and she openedeyesshe hadn'teven realized she hadsqueezed closed to see him quicklyuntying her feet. She thought he would enter her then, andshe wanted himto. Dear God, that was what she wanted most in the world at that moment, to feel his flesh fillhers. But he didn't. Instead, hegrasped one ankle and liftedit in his hands until hecould press a kiss to her instep.</p><p>Valoree jolted as if hehad bitten her, her bodyrespondingwith amazing sensitivity to thetouch.It seemed he could do anything to her, touch heranywhere, and itwouldbeerotic. She pressed herselfback into the sand, twisting her head and moaning aloud as hislipsmoved up the inside of her leg, pausing to nibble behind her knee. He shifted to lie between her legs sothat his mouth could meander upher thigh.</p><p>She continued to thrash beneath his touch, uttering a continuous, mindless moan until she felt his breath between her legs. Then she went as stiff as wood, her nerve endings screaming, her eyes shooting open to stare blindly at the trees overhead. She cried out and arched upward off the ground, sending thebirdswingingfrom the trees aboveas he pleasured herina way she had heretoforeonlyeverheardher men talkof a womandoingto them. He did things withhis mouth thatbrought tears to her eyes and sobs bursting from her lips. She raced towardsomethingwondrous. Then he stopped.</p><p>The trees slowly came back into focusbeforeher swimming eyes, and Valoreefound herself lying panting on a scrap ofsilkin the sand, herbody clamoring in protest. Raisingher head slightly, she peered blanklydownthe length of her body and saw that he was watching her, waiting.</p><p>\"Tell meyou want me.\"</p><p>Valoree felt thosewordsbreathed against the trembling flesh of herwomanhoodall the way up to the roots ofher hair.Her entire body wasscreaming with the desire he would have her speak aloud.Couldhe not see that?</p><p>\"Say it, \" he instructed. \"Say, 'I married you because I want you. Not to save you from hanging.'\"</p> <p>Suddenly recognizing the vulnerability in him, Valoree felt some part of her heart crumble with the understanding.\"Imarried you because I wanted to, and I want you.Iwant you inside me.</p><p>Right now.\"</p><p>A slow smile twisting his lips, he glanced downto the damp flesh he had been devouring and blew on it softly, sending tremorsthrough her body.Then he leaned downfor a lick, and another, his teeth grazing her swollen skin andmaking her close her eyes andsob in need. With that, his touch changed slightly, and shepeeredback at him to see that he was caressing herwith hisfingers, continuingto urge her passion back to the blaze it had been. He shifted to his kneesand movedfurther up between her legs. There, ceasing his manipulations, he slipped his hands beneath her bottom. Lifting her slightly, he nudged her legs farther apart to makeroom forhim between them, then guided himself slowly into her.</p><p>A moan erupting from deep in her throat, Valoree tugged mindlessly on her bindings, yearning to holdhim. She wanted to wrap herarms aroundhimand draw him close, a need thatonly increased as he withdrew himself from her with agonizing slowness, watching her expression the whole time.</p><p>\"More.\" She groaned inagony, and Daniel smiled aslow, sexy smile.</p><p>\"More? \"</p><p>Shenoddeddesperately, bucking upward in an effort tourge him on, but he caught her thighs, restraining her, then grasped her ankles and bent her knees to maintain complete control. He slowly slid himself back into her.</p><p>\"Greedy, \" hechidedwith a grin when she struggled withhim, trying to force himto her will, but his control wasslipping, and he apparentlydecided togive her what theyboth wanted. Releasing her ankles, he dropped forward, his hands landing on eitherside of herbody, his mouth dropping to nip at one breastashe drove himself completely inside.</p><p>Gasping encouragement, Valoree wrapped her legs around his hipsand met histhrusts eagerly. Some few moments later, he tookthem both towhere thatwondroussomethingwaited and showed her just whatit was againand againuntil hejoined herin it.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\"What are you doing? \"</p><p>Working at the lacesof her gown, Valoreeturned back tosmile down atDanielwarmly. Hewas nude and still sleepy-eyed, his hair disheveledas he leaned up on onearm topeer ather. Good Lord, the man wassexy.\"Iam getting dressed, my lord.\"</p><p>\"Nay, \" he protested on a yawn, leaningforwardto grab at her skirt. \"Come back to bed.\"</p><p>\"Bed? \" Valoreelaughed, dancingaway to avoid being caught.</p><p>Smiling wryly, he glanced down at the now crinkled and sand-dusted cloth She hadlaidoutfor Bull to place him onthe daybefore.</p><p>It had beenwellusedand itshowed. The man was insatiable.</p><p>He had not let hersleep more thana few minutes sincehisfirst awakening after their arrival. Not that she wascomplaining. She hadenjoyed herself immensely.</p><p>Shrugging away the questionof a bed, Daniel peered backat her, thehungrylook shewas beginningto recognize takingthe placeof his sleepy expression.His voice, whenhe spoke, was huskyand seductive.\"Come back here. I am not donewith you yet.\"</p><p>Valoree felt aflutter in herlower belly athis words, and would have loved to shed the gown she had just donned and slipback intohis arms, butshe shook her head regretfully instead. \"Nay.</p><p>The men w - \" Her gaze slidingtoward the beach, shestopped as she saw the Valor sailing slowlyaround the point and into view.</p><p>Right on time, of course. She hadsaiddusk, and here they were.</p><p>\"Very well. And here Ithought that youwished to get with child.\"</p><p>Valoree glanced around at that to seethat hewas now rooting through the remainsof the supplies she hadhad brought over.</p><p>\"Whatdo youmean? \"</p><p>Shrugging, hesmiled at her innocently. \"Just what I said.We willneverproducean heirthisway.Especially when we only have - what is it now? - little better than seven months to produce one? \"</p><p>\"Well, surely we can manage thetask in thattime.\" She raised aneyebrow at his pursedlips. \"What? \"</p><p>\"Iwas just thinking that it took myparents three years erethey begat me, and according to my mother they were quite dutifulin their nightly attempts. How many years werethere between you andJeremy? \"</p><p>Valoree'seyes narrowed.\"Eight, almostnine - but there were two stillborn babes between us.\"</p><p>\"Hmmmmm.\" Giving up his search, hestraightenedand caught his handsbehindhis back, thenbegan topace naked before her, hishead tilted upward, eyes to the sky as he began to figure aloud. \"Now, let us see. Threeyears on my side, and... Well, let us just saythree between each child withyour parents, too. Now, thereare three hundred sixty-five days in a year.In three years thatwould be one thousandand ninety-fiveattempts they made tocreate a child before onewas produced. Of course, that isonly if your parents were as dutiful as mine in attempting it every night. Do you think they were? \" Pausing beforeher, he ignored hergaping expression and raised his eyebrowsinpoliteinquiry.</p><p>\"Are you saying you think it will take a thousand and ninety-five couplings for us to produce the heir we need to inherit? \" she asked with amazement.</p><p>\"Itwould seemso.\" He smiled innocently, thentilted hishead tocalculateagain.\"And we have just over seven months. But, of course, youshould be a couple months along else no one will know. Therefore, let ussay we have five months to accomplish the deed. Thatmeanswe have... Well, roughlywe haveto make the attempt atleastnine timesa day to inherit.\"He lowered his gaze to her again. \"How many times have we attempted it today? \"</p><p>\"Husband? \"</p><p>\"Aye? \"</p><p>\"Shut up and kissme, \" Valoree muttered, slipping her hands up to catchhis face anddrawit down to herown. She hadn'tfallen for his line. She wasn'tthat naive, buthe wasjustso darncute.</p><p>Their passion was quick to reignite.Hismouth shifted, and he sucked athers as his tonguethrustoutaggressively.He backed heragainst the treethat hadshaded them these last twodays, quickly beginning to undo the laces she had just done up.</p><p>Finishing with them, he pushed her gown off her shoulders, shifting her chemiseoutof theway atthe same time. Covering her breasts withhis hands, he slidone naked thigh between hers and raised it slightly to rub herthrough her gown. When hebent suddenly, hisface dropping toward her breasts, shethought he wasgoingtosuckle her, andhernipples puckered even harder, but he straightened again almost at once, his hands brushing up along her legs under her skirt.</p><p>Squirming against the tree, Valoree gasped, her eyes opening andlandingright onthesmalldinghy that was being lowered over the side of the Valor. She had forgotten all about them.</p><p>\"Damn, \" she said under her breath, stiffening at once, her hands going down to catch his astheyslid between her legs.</p><p>\"Whatis it? \"Daniel glanced over his shoulder andhesitated briefly, then turned back and kissedher again, slidinga finger into her moist heatto caress the nubthat hid there.</p><p>\"Nay.\" Valoree groaned, pulling her lips away and gasping as hebegan todrive her wild with acombination of kissesalong her chin, ear, and neck, and thefriction he was causing between her legs.\"The men.\"</p><p>\"Ignore them. They will go away, \" Daniel assured her.</p><p>Catchingone of her hands withhis free one, he drew it down to press itagainst his swollen flesh. Valoreereleased a breathless laugh thatendedon a moan ashe thrust one finger inside her.</p><p>\"Daniel, \" she cried pleadingly, caressing his arousal and pushing at hisshoulders at the sametime.</p><p>\"It will take them a minute to get here. We have time.\"</p><p>Reaching down to catch one ofher legsbeneath the knee, he hooked it around his hip, then clasped her bottom and lifted her slightly. Releasing his manhood, she reached up to clasp his shoulders as he drovehimself into her, her teeth biting theflesh of his shoulder, her fingernails digging into his back as he began a rhythmthat was fast andexciting, poundinginto her like waves on a beach until they both shattered with the pressure.</p><p>Valoree wentslackagainst him fora moment, then opened her eyes to see that the dinghy wasonly halfway betweenthe Valor and the beach. Grinning impishly, she straightened slightly, waiting untilhe lifted his head from her shoulder andmet her gaze beforeannouncing, \"Theyare onlyhalfway here. Wehave time todo it again, mylord.\"</p><p>Dropping his head to her shoulder, Daniel released a half groan, half laugh as she whispered silkily into his ear, \"Bymy counting, we have to do so at leastfour more times today.To reach the number you estimated.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt him begin to grow hardwithin her again, and chuckled breathlessly as she wriggled againsthim, her muscles tightening aroundhim encouragingly.</p><p>\"Aye, \" he murmured suddenly.\"Four more times. Let us seeif we cannotmake it three.\"</p><p>Valoree laughed happily, her heart soaring as she leaned forward tokiss him. Shefeltat that moment as if she had found heaven, and thatmayhap marriagewould not be so bad after all.</p> <p>Marriage washell.</p><p>It wastwo months since those incredible two days and one night in the isolated cove in the Caribbean.They were only a warm memory now. Marriedlife wasn't anythinglike thattime had been. In fact, marriage was very much as she had feared it would be, with Danieltaking overher life as if she were a child.</p><p>Oh, it hadnot startedout thatway.It had been a gradualturn.</p><p>They hadreturned tothe ship with One-Eye and Skully, then sailed back to PortRoyale to load upon goods andsuch, then had endedupstayingthere two weeks. Valoree had decidedthe men should havesome shoreleaveere they set out on another protractedocean voyage.Meg had spent that time visitingold friends on the island, so Valoree and Danielhad spent the two weeks almostexclusivelyin each other's arms. Oh, they had left the shipseveral times, to play on the beach, to gofor picnics. But always they had ended up in each other's arms. It had been almost asblissful as the two days in the cove, except that now there were occasional interruptions by Henryor one of theother men.Valoree had begun to noticethedifferencethen.</p><p>The first time Henry hadcometo her witha question, he had hesitated, hisgaze going from herto Danieland back again, asif he wasn'tsure who to ask. In the end, he had addressedit tothe roomat large. Valoree had frownedat that, but answered, giving orders as always.But the trendhad continued. So long as Daniel was present, the men all seemedat a loss as to whom toaddress.</p> <p>The matterhad bothered hersomuchthatwhenthey had finally set sail for London, she had been careful to go on deck to give her orders only when Daniel was sleeping. Therestof thetime had beenspent naked inhercabin, working hard at makingthe heir requiredby her father's and hisgrandmother's wills. Very hard. Extremelyhard.</p><p>Between Daniel's determination to learn every inch of her body, andherneed to check on her men, their location, and to give out orders whilehe slept, Valoree had hardly gotten any sleep atallthat first week of the journey. Ah, butit hadbeen worth it - until she had comedown with asummer cold, probably from herlack ofsleep andbeing worn out.</p><p>Daniel had coddled her then, bundling her in blankets and fetchingher hotspicedrum. Valoree hadslept nearly aroundthe clock for over a week. Bythe timeShe had recovered and made herway ondeckagain, it was to find that he had taken her place.</p><p>Oh, themen still calledher captain, but it was to him they now turned with questions, andwhen she gave anorder it was only to seethemen glance towardDaniel before carrying it out.</p><p>Valoree'sfirst instincthad been togo intoarage and demand the respect due heras captain.But then she had thought better of it. The men were traditional, andshe knew they wouldbelieve it was a man's place to rule.It wasone thing for her to becaptain when they had thought her aman - andeven mayhap oncethey hadknown she wasa woman, so long as she was seeking the husband they neededto retire. But now that she was married and hada husband, by law he was her ruler, and therefore theirs.</p><p>Thus, she had bitten her, tongue and returned to the cabin, determined to wait it out. Daniel was an intelligent man. Heeven hadnatural leadership qualities. But he had not spent the last thirteenyears aboard ship with these men. Hewould slip up, and shewould be there to show him - and the men - that being a lord did notmake hima captain.</p> <p>Valoreehadspentthe rest of the journey backtoEnglandin the cabin, claiming she wasstillfeeling undertheweather and desired the rest. In truth, she had been pacing the floor and waiting - something she hadneverdone well.</p><p>Sighing, sheshiftedin her chair andtried to concentrate onthe chapbook she had sat downtoread. Chapbooks were what she hadfilled hertimewithsince arriving at the Thurborne estate two weeks ago - tales of banditry, terror on the high seas, and adventure. One-Eye had sneaked them to her. There were romancesin the stack, too, but sheavoided them. Valoree had hadenoughromance to last a lifetime, anditwasn't all that it was chalked uptobe. She had found that it lost some of its appeal quickly whenthe rest of one's life was empty. Actually, she was beginning to resent Danieland the effect hehad had on her life.</p><p>Time had seemed to fly bywhen her life had had purpose; now it dragged likean anchor along the bottom of life's ocean. It didn't stop her from enjoying his touch andcaresses, but somehowthey hadlostsomeof theirluster.</p><p>A sudden great clatter and crashing from below made its way up tothe sunroom where Valoree sat, and she sighed.Petey and the Thurbornes' cook, Eleni were going at it again, no doubt.</p><p>Those two werehavinga battle overwho ranthe kitchen.Eleni hadbeenheadcook here for several years andwasdetermined to keep it that way. Petey hadalways been \"the captain's\" cook and was determinedto keep thatposition.The two hadbeen throwing pots around and having shoutingmatches sincetheValor had laid anchor two weeks ago.</p><p>Instead ofgoing to London, they had sailed the Valor tothe Thurborne estate, anchoring off the point that the castle itself stoodon and reachingshore by dinghy. That had been Daniel's decision. He claimed he had things to tend here, but she suspectedhe was keepingher awayfrom societysoshewouldn't embarrass him. He had since insisted on hiring instructors to teach her \"what she needed to know to get by.\"She supposed she couldn't blame him. After all, she had beenrather a flop during her coming-out. Added to that was the factthat she just wasn't like otherwomen.She supposedhe would rather keep her here, outof the wayof the ton. Mayhap he was even beginning to regret marrying her.</p><p>Daniel had wantedthe men all to wait on the Valor, butthey had had oneof theirvotesanddecidedthat the same men who had accompanied them in London wouldcometo the Thurborne estate with them. So, Henry, Meg, One-Eye, Skully, Bull, and Pete were allhangingabout the castle somewhere. Meg usually spent her time helping Henry inThurborne's gardens, wherethe old tar spent his time driving Daniel's gardener crazy with questions and opinions. Skully, One-Eye, and Bull divided their time betweenridinginto the village to try to romance thelocal girls and hanging out around thestables. The three men appeared tohavedeveloped a passion for good horseflesh.</p><p>It all left Valoree alone, feelinglike a fish outofwater inthis fancycastle with self-effacing servants, andwith a husband who was foreverbusy runninghisestate. Valoree had spent most of the lasttwo weeks cuddled upwith chapbooks in the chair she now sat in. She had notevenreally looked around much. She had discoveredthis room and stayed put.It wastheroomwiththe least numberof breakables in it. There had not been a lot of fancy little delicate thingsin Valoree's life. At least not since living ontheValor.</p> <p>Fancy breakables had no place on a ship that dipped and rolled on the high seas, and the Beecham town house had been furnished, but with just the essentials such as furnishings and cooking pots. There had been no easily destructible things there.</p><p>HereatThurborne, Valoree was almost afraidto walk around, lest she knock over and smash one of the fancy and delicate itemsher husband seemed to have everywhere.</p><p>Sighing, sheset the book down on her lap and peered around the small, sunny roomunhappily. Shecould seeher future quite clearly ifsomething did nothappen soon. The days stretched out before her, an unending paradeof hours spent sitting here, staring off intospace, miserable, asshe waited for mealtime, when her husband would reappear from whatever mysterious chores to which hewas tending.Good Lord, how did otherwomen stand it? Her life hadbeen fullof tasks up to now. Therehadalways been some chore or other to accomplish aboard ship: sails to mend, ropestocheck, maps and charts to read, orders togive.</p><p>Even as achild hertime had beenfull of lessons and chores. But Valoreehad no idea what women did once they were married and beyond theschoolroom. Was there anything todo atallbesides stare around?</p><p>The only good thing about it was that, if she wasbored, her men, stuck on the boat with its crampedliving quarters and lack of entertainmentandwomen, mustbenear climbing the rigging by now.She was positivethattrouble would break outsoon, and then they wouldsee whowas the real captain.</p><p>\"My dear girl!\"</p><p>Valoree's head snapped around, her eyes widening in amazement as they fell on Lady Thurborne barreling into the room, arms outstretched, a wide, welcomingsmileon her face.</p><p>Guiltily shoving thechapbook she had been reading down under the cushion she sat on, Valoree stood, and felt her body stiffen as she wasengulfed in a cloud of rose-scented taffeta.</p><p>\"Oh, my dear girl!I wanted to tell you how happy I am to welcome you asmy daughter-in-law, \" the woman trilled in her ear gaily, then pulled back to smile. \"I wasbeginning to think that Daniel would never marry. I feared even the requirements of Mother's will would not move him toit. Butyou managedit, you clevergirl! Comesitwithme; wemustchat.\"</p><p>Valoree allowed herself to be drawn over to the settee, her expression bemused.\"Whendid you arrive? How didyou know we were here? \"</p><p>\"I arrivedjust now, dear.\" Lady Thurborne dropped ontothe settee, dragging Valoree down with her so that they sat half turned andfacing each other. \"That nice young man with the unfortunatemissingnose arrived with Daniel's letter, telling me you had married and werehere.\"</p><p>\"No-Nose, \" Valoree murmuredto herself. Three months had seenhis leg heal quite well, though hestilllimped.</p><p>\"And the momentI readthat, I had theservants start packing, the carriage drawnaround, andI headed here.\"</p><p>\"Oh, \" Valoreemurmured, then glanced towardthe door with a frown asanother round of clattering, crashing, and curses in both Greekand English reachedthem.</p><p>\"What on earth is that? \" Lady Thurborne asked, rising anxiously.</p><p>Valoree sighedand waved her concern away. \"Itisjust Petey andElenigoing at it again\"</p><p>\"Eleni? \" Lady Thurborne sat down with a frown. \"Daniel's cook? \"</p><p>\"Aye. She andPetey, my cook, are struggling for who isin charge. They have severalbattles a day.\"</p><p>\"Isee, \" Lady Thurbornemurmured with a frown, then tilted her head slightly to the side andpeeredat her consideringly.\"You do notlookhappy, \" she announced.</p><p>Valoreesatalittlestraighter. \"Oh, I - \"she began, butLady Thurborne waved herto silence.</p><p>\"What do you do with your time? \"</p><p>Valoreehesitated slightly, then gazed around the room rather blankly.</p><p>\"Being a lady is much different from being the captain of privateers, Iimagine, \" she said now, and Valoree nearly fell off the settee in shock. Smiling at her expression, Lady Thurborne explained.\"Meg told me everything.\"</p><p>\"Meg did? \" Valoreeasked in amazement. \"When? \"</p><p>\"The day the men druggedyou bothand tookyou backto your shipto sail out. She did not wish me to worry about Daniel's suddenly going missing.\"</p><p>\"Did Henry know? \"</p><p>\"Yes. Apparently he was not pleased with the idea, but she convinced himit would be right - that Imightbe able tokeep Daniel's driver quiet about his going missing from your town house. And shewas correct. I did handle the man.\"</p><p>Valoree peeredather with confusion. \"Why? \"</p><p>\"Whydid Ihelpthe plot along inthat manner? Well, because, mydear, I wanted to seeDaniel married, settled, and starting on mygrandbabies.Andit did seemto methat hewanted to marry you, only you were reluctant to agree.\"</p><p>\"Youdo not mind that he married apirate? \" she askedwith disbelief.LadyThurborne grinned.</p><p>\"Actually, Ithinkitis allratherexciting and romantic. Though I thinkyouare being rather hard on yourself, my dear. Youare notreallya pirate.You are aprivateer.

You - \"</p><p>\"That's less than youdeserve, ye weasellybastard!\" Valoree roared, starting down the stairs toward him.</p><p>\"What the hell is going on here? \" Daniel shouted, drawingthe attentionofbothhiswife and her dance instructor as he strode outof the library, his mother hard on his heels. \"Valoree, get down here! What did you do? \"</p><p>\"Oh, my lord.\" MasterHendersongasped, grabbing at hispant leg. \"She broke my ankle, my lord. Look. How canI teach with a brokenankle?

IgnoringDaniel, he paused before Valoree, pantingheavily.</p><p>\"What is it? \" Valoree asked sharply as Henry followed, Meg on hisheels.</p><p>\"Trouble, \" Jasper said in a gasp, out ofbreath from hisrun.</p><p>\"Theship.\"</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Trouble did not begin to describe what they found when Valoree, Daniel, Henry, and Jasperrowed thedinghyback out to the ship and climbed aboard. Jasper had said that Richard had sent himafter her becausetwo of the men, Jacksonand Chep, were fighting. But during the time it had taken for Jasper to row ashore and fetch them back, the two-man fight hadturned into a free-for-all.EvenRichard was nowbusy bangingheads.</p><p>This, of course, was exactly the sort ofthing for which Valoree had been waiting. But beforeshe couldact, Daniel had snatched Jasper's flintlockpistol out of the waist of the man's breeches and firedit into theair. Theblast it made brought the fighting to an abrupt halt, and the men turned slowly one after another to warily eye her husband.</p><p>Valoree hadjust begun berating herselfforbeingtoo slow and letting Daniel take control, when he turnedtowardherandsaid quiteloudly - loudly enoughfor everyman present to hear - \"I believe these men and their behavior are your responsibility, wife.\"</p><p>Valoree's eyes widened at that, her jaw dropping slightly in amazement, for the behavior goingon today was all hisfault.</p><p>Then he winked, a gentlesmile tugging at his mouth ashe added, just as loudly, \"You are their captain.\"</p><p>He stepped to the side then, leavingher tostare at hercrew for a brief momentbefore gathering herself together. \"Who started the fight? \" she askedatlast.</p><p>Chepstepped forwardalmost at once. \"Me. I threwthefirst punch.\"</p><p>\"Nay, it wasme.\" Jackson elbowedhim aside to take his place.</p><p>One man afteranother then began to stepforward, claiming theyhad instigated the whole affair.Valoree nearly smiled atthe loyalty hercrew had to each other.They hadsimply been pent up on the ship too long. They needed to let off some steam, andthe fight had given them thechance. None of them wanted Jackson or Chep flogged for giving them that chance.</p><p>\"Enough!\" she shouted, working at keeping her face stern. \"It is obvious you do nothave enoughto keep you occupied. Since you all haveso much energy, I'm thinking we shouldcareenthe ship.\"A groan wentup all around, but Valoreeignored it and glanced aroundfor her secondmate. \"Richard.\"</p><p>\"Aye? \"The man moved to her side at once.</p><p>\"Make sure everything'sstrapped down, beach her, heave her over, and careen her.I want every man here working onthis.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Aye, Captain.\"</p><p>Nodding, Valoree glowered at the rest of the men. \"We won't be here much longer.

Valoree nodded, then turned and walked silentlyback to the rope ladder they hadusedto mountthe ship, aware that Henry, Daniel, and Jasper were following.</p> <p>\"What is careening? \" Daniel asked quietly later. They had returned to thecastle, assured Megand Lady Thurborne that all was well; then Daniel had asked Valoree to join him in the library. Nowhestood on one side of his desk, with her onthe other, as heawaited he answer.</p><p>\"Careening is when you run a boat ashore, heelher overon her side, and scrape the barnacles and seaweed off her bottom.</p><p>Sometimes scraping doesnot suffice and they have tobe burned off.Once the men havefinished withthat, they will caulkany of the leaks theycan, replace rotten planks when caulking will not do, andseal it.\"</p><p>\"It sounds alarge undertaking.\"</p><p>\"It is. But it is necessary if you want to move fast - and pirates have tomove fast.\"</p> <p>Daniel shookhis head. \"Youarenot a pirateanymore, Valoree.</p><p>You are Lady Thurborne.\"</p><p>\"Aye, \" she agreed calmly. \"But I had to have them do something, elsethey'dkilleach other outthere.\"</p><p>Hemust havenoticed the way shewas glaringat him, for he frowned.\"What?

Ididnot thinkabout that.\" Sighing, helookedup ather.\"You, of course, had thought of that, but did notbotherto mention itto me. Am I right? \"</p><p>She gavea briefnod.</p><p>\"Why did you not saysomething? \"</p><p>\"You did not ask.\"</p><p>\"Valoree.\" His mouth twisted inirritation. \"You could have told me anyway.\"</p><p>\"Aye, Icould have, \" she agreed grimly.\"Just as you couldhave askedbeforetaking over my ship.\"</p><p>Daniel leaned backin his seat to eyeher silently. After a few moments, he capitulated.Moving forwardto resthis armsonthe desk, hesaid, \"Assoon as this careeningbusiness isdone, we will sail downto London so that themen mayhave some leave.As you say, we can wait just aswell there as - \"</p> <p>When he suddenly paused, Valoree tilted her head, wondering at histhoughts. \"What isit? \"</p><p>\"How did youknow that I hadsent arequest to thekingfor an audience? \"</p><p>She snorted. \"Yourmother told me that you had sentNo-Nose to her with a message informingherof our marriage and taking up residence here.\"</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \"So? \"</p><p>\"So you would hardly tell her, and neglect the king, \" she pointed out. \"Really, Daniel, I do not know why you married me when you think me such anidiot.\"</p><p>His eyes widened in surprise. \"I do notthink you an idiot.\"</p><p>\"Oh, aye, \" she agreed sarcastically.\"Andthat wouldbe why you hiredthose bloody instructors, and thoughtto takeovermy crew? \"</p><p>\"Nay, I...\"He paused then, obviously thinking. \"I am sorry, Valoree, \" he saidat last. \"It would seem Ihave not been going about this verywell.I thought - \"</p><p>\"You thoughtto turn me intoone of those brainless twits that flit about the ballroomsin London, \" she interruptedfuriously, all thepainshe had not really realized she had been feelingcoming out.\"Well, you canstick that plan in your cannon and shoot it, my lord, becauseI have nointerest. And you can try to take over my menif youlike, butyou will have abattleon yourhands.</p><p>That crew is the only family Ihave.\"</p><p>\"You have menow.\"</p><p>\"Oh, aye, \" Valoree agreed.\"If I learntoplay the harpsichord and dance. Well, I don'thaveto do that forthem, and I don't wantto do that foryou.\" Turning onher heel, she startedforthe door.</p><p>Daniel was after her at once, hurrying around hisdesk and reaching the door in time to prevent her opening it; he placed a hand against it over hershoulder.Pausing, she stoodstubbornly facing thedoorand refusingto look at him.Danielsighed, then raised his otherhand tothe door, movinghis body closer until he was pressing against the lengthof her.</p><p>\"Ido not give adamnif youcan play the harpsichord, \" hesaid quietly, leaning hischeekagainst the backof her head. \"I do not careif you can dance, either, though itwouldbenice to dance with you.\"</p><p>\"Then why - \"</p><p>\"I am a fool; that is why, \" he murmured by her ear, then lowered his hands to clasp her shoulders before sliding them downaround her waistto draw her stiffbody backagainsthim.</p><p>\"My motherwasright.

She turned her head, trying to look at him, her lips opening tospeak then, but he silenced herwith a kiss. Ravishing her mouth as he slid a hand downbetween her legs, he pressed herbackagainst him.</p><p>\"Daniel, I - \" shebegan as soon as he broke the kiss, but he covered her mouth with one handand began tugging herskirts up with the other.</p><p>\"Shut up, Valoree and let me talk foronce, hmmm? \"he chided gently. She stiffened, but relaxedagain and nodded. He released her mouth to use bothhands to drawher skirts up between them as he continued. \"Your independence and even your crew mean that youdo not really need me.\"</p><p>\"Nay, \" sheprotested at once, trying to turn toface him again, but Daniel stopped her by grasping her legs. Hehad bent slightly behind her to find the bottom of her skirts, and now clasped her just above the knees, keeping her facing the door. When she stoppedtrying to turn, he started to straighten, drawinghis hands up as hedid. But while he could keepher facingthe door, hejust couldn'tkeep her quiet. As shewriggledunder the glide of his fingers over her skin, she whispered, \"I need you. I need a husband andbabe to inheritAinsley, just as you need a wife and babe toinherityour grandmother's bequest.\"</p><p>\"I need you for more thanthat, Valoree, \"hesaid against her neck.</p><p>\"M-more? \"shemurmured distractedly as he caught her atthe hips and drew herlower body away from the door slightly, even as he pressedher upper bodyagainst it.</p><p>\"Aye.Ifind myself having strong feelings for you.\"Reaching between them, hebeganto work at thefastening of his breeches.</p><p>\"Ithink - Nay\" - he sighed, pausing to leanhis head against hers - \"I know Ilove you.\"</p><p>\"You - \" Valoreebeganin amazement, thengasped and bit her lip as he suddenlyslidintoher from behind.Herhandsclenched into fists against thedoor on eitherside of herforehead, and she moaned as heslightly withdrew.</p><p>\"I love you, \" he repeated in a voice that almost sounded pained.He pushed into heragain.\"I love your body. I love your laugh. I loveyour passion. I love yourintelligence.\"He thrust inside of her and withdrew as he spoke each sentence, then added simply, \"I love ... you.\"</p><p>\"I - \" He stopped moving withinher as she startedto speak, waiting, and Valoree hesitated, then tried again.\"I...I - care for you, too, \"shegot out at last, rolling her eyes at her ownwords evenas Daniel suddenly leanedweaklyagainst her. He uttered a shaky laugh.</p><p>\"Just what every man in love wants to hear.\" There was amusement in his voice, butpain, too.Valoree triedonce again to pull away and facehim, but once again he stopped her.\"Nay.\"</p><p>Hepressed a kiss to the back ofher neck, then reached up to begincaressing theflesh of her breasts andbelly again.\"Ican wait. You need notlie to me, \" he murmured, resuming againthe rhythmhe'd begun. \"Butweshall make a vow. I will try not to take over, or treat youlike anidiot or child, and you will nottell me that you love me until youmean it. Deal? \"</p><p>Valoree knew a good deal when she heard one and noddedat once, then turned to peer at himinsurprise when hesuddenly withdrew from her.Grabbing her hand, Daniel pulled her to his desk, cleared one end of it with a sweepof his free arm, then pulledher intohis arms for a quick, hard kiss.Amoment later he turned heraround, bending herover the desk, tugging her skirts up, andthrusting himself into her.</p><p>It felt to Valoree almostasif he werestakinga claim, gaining control the only way hecould, sincehe had promisedto try not to take over. Atfirst shelay still against thedesk. But ashebent forwarduntil his chest was against her back, one hand snaked aroundto slide between her legs, and he began tocaress hereven as he nipped at hershoulder through her gown. His mouththen moved up to herear. Within moments hehad her panting and thrusting back into him, giving asgood as shegot until they both found satisfaction.</p><p>**** Valoree caught herself humming under her breath as the carriage rolled along, and she paused abruptly, shaking herhead with a laugh. She had beendoing thatalot lately - humming a cheery tuneas she wentabouther life.She felt happy. Things weregoing well.</p><p>It had been a littleover threeweeks since Daniel had confessed he loved her. Now thatit wasoutin the open, hisattitude and behavior toward her hadchanged. She hadnever really noticed, but until that day, he had only actually shown anything approaching affectionfor her whentrying to get under her skirts.</p><p>The rest of the time hehad worn aslightlycynicalsmile, as if he found her, and everything else, terribly amusing. It had made him seem slightly distant, aloof. Not that she had recognized it atthe time, but now she did. Now she saw thedifference. Everytime he looked at her now, there was love in his eyes. When he smiled, it wasasoftersmile, full ofemotion. Heno longerhid from her.</p><p>He also nolonger triedto takecharge. She had been in obvious control of the men since thatday, something the Valor's crew seemed toaccept without aproblem.She supposed it helped that Daniel had handed her backthat power with his loudcomments on the ship about their beingher responsibility, but whateverthe case, she gave them their orders and they listened without question.</p><p>Valoree had alsofoundsomething withwhich to fill her time.</p><p>Much to Daniel's everlasting horror, it was bees. Honeybees.</p><p>Valoreehad discovered them duringa visit with Daniel to see Lord and LadyMobley on the neighboringestate. The invitation had arrived a few days before Daniel's confession, butit wasn't until after that day that Daniel decided to accept it. Valoree suspected it was his attempt to prove that he wasn't ashamed of her.She, on the other hand, had agreed to prove thatshe could act like alady. They'dhad a wonderful time.</p><p>Well, all right - notwonderful. Valoree hadbeenbored totears until Lady Mobley had taken her outto see her bees. She had been smitten with them from the first. She wasn't sure why.</p><p>Perhaps it was theconstantrisk of being stung. Or the quiet that hadto be kept around them to avoid instigating an attack. Or maybeit wasjust that she found, astimepassed, that she was developing a terrible craving for the sweet nectar they made.</p><p>Whatever the case, She hadpromptlydecidedthat bee keeping was how she would fill her time since she was retiring from privateering. Anyway, She had startedstudying up on the little honey makers right away. Daniel had taken it all in stride, positive she would grow boredwith her project. But she hadn't.</p><p>Not over the twoweeks that passed beforeNo-Nose arrivedback with the king's response, not during the couple ofdays that had followed as they hadprepared tohead to London, and not over the several days since theirarrival back in that noisy, crowded, stinky town.</p><p>They hadarrivedmidmorning, given the mentheirorders, left Richard in charge of assigning themenleave, then hadsent Meg and Henry back to the town house they had rented from Beecham, to keep up appearances. Her aunt and uncle could hardly just disappear, and certainlywould notmovein with them at the Thurborne town house - not in any normal course of events. So until Daniel could clear everythingupand they could return toThurborneCastle, those two wereto continueto stayat the Beecham rental. Which meant that Skully, One-eyed Joe, Pete, and Bull were allthere, too - backin their pinklivery and continuing the masquerade.</p><p>Daniel and she had continuedonto his town house. There he had givenheratour, introduced her to the staff, had luncheon with her, and sat inhorror as she announced her intention to make some purchases whilethey were intown. It wasn't that she wished to spend money that horrified him.Itwas what she had told himshe intended tobuy:all the equipmentshe would need to start ahoney-making operationof her own.</p><p>She smiled to herself now as she thought of it. From his reaction that day, and thetwosince, she wasbeginning to think that Daniel hadmore than a usualdislike of bees. He really was notreacting well to the ideaof her having thousands of them. Not that she had let it stop her.Valoreehadbeen leaving the town house every afternoon since their arrival, and returning just before supper every night with more stacks ofthings she would need to runan apiary. She could hardly wait to get home and get started onit. Justthethought of all that sweet honey - The carriage came to a halt, drawing Valoree from her thoughts. Leaning forward, she peered out the window to see that they had arrived back at the town house, and she smiled in anticipation as the footman opened thedoor for her to get out.</p><p>Shecould hardly wait untilher husband saw her latest purchases. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He would turn green, she knew, and, oddly enough, she looked forward toit. Shewas findingDaniel'sdistress quite amusing for some reason.</p><p>That was probably a shameful thing to admit; no doubt enjoying torturingone'shusbandreally wasn'tagoodthing. But forsome reason, themore upset he got atthe ideaof all those beesbuzzing around, the more she enjoyed the idea. It was rather likethesatisfaction she had experienced as ayoung girl when she had eaten pickled cucumbers dripping with raspberry preserves, all to make Jeremy - who had always suffered terribly from seasickness - run for the side of the ship. This wasprobably a flaw in her personality, this enjoyment of torturing those she loved.</p><p>Valoree paused halfway up the walk to the house, her eyes growingwide asshe realized what she'd said. Those she loved? Those she loved? Sheloved him. She loved Daniel. Didn't she? She had just thoughtthat. She had. Right? Wouldshe give her life for him? She'd rather not, but probably would. Could she see growing oldwith him. Happily? Oh, dear Lord, shecould! She couldsee herselftorturing and makinglove to him by turn until hewas arandy hundred-year-old with noteeth.She lovedDaniel.</p> <p>The door tothe town house openedand Bawden, Thurborne's butler, peered out, reminding herthatshe had stopped halfway to the house. Flashing a beaming smile at the older gentleman, Valoreerushed forward, nearlyflying intothehouse.</p><p>\"Good afternoon, my lady. I trust youhad a good day? \"</p><p>\"Yes, thank you.\" Valoree laughed, tugging hergloves off. \"Is my lord husband back from his club yet? \"</p><p>\"Aye, mylady, \"the man said in hisdignifiedvoiceashe took her gloves. \"He asked that I inform you thathehas goneabove stairs tochange; then he shalljoin youfor supper.\"</p><p>\"He is already finished with his dress and is ready to join his beautiful wife at their supper, \" Daniel corrected, coming down the stairs and smiling at Valoree.\"You maytellCook shecan start serving now, Bawden.\"</p> <p>\"Very good, mylord.\" The servant headed off in his dignified walk as Daniel stepped offthe last step. Valoree launched herself at him at once, throwing her arms around hisneckand kissing him passionately as heclosed hisarmsabouther.</p><p>\"Mmmmm, \" Danielmurmured, rocking her gently from side to side as the kiss ended. \"I missedyou, too.\"</p><p>Valoree chuckled softly, thensobered. \"I have something totell you.\"</p><p>\"Oh? \" He cockedan eyebrow withinterest. \"Andwhat would that be? \"</p><p>\"I - \"</p><p>The frontdooropened, interruptingher, and theybothturned tosee the footman come in carrying several packages. Daniel groaned at once.</p> <p>\"More? \"</p><p>Grinning, Valoree nodded, then took his hand and led him down the hall tothedining salon. Tugging him inside, she whirled to leanagainst hischest and reached up to caress his face softly.</p><p>\"Now, as I was saying. I - \"</p><p>Theyboth turned as the door tothe kitchen opened and Cook entered carrying a largeplatterbearing stuffed fish.</p><p>\"Mmmmrn. That looks delicious, \" Daniel flattered theflushed woman, whosmiledher pleasureat the compliment.His gaze slid back toValoree apologetically and he urgedher towardthe table, then held her chair out forher. \"Sitdown, darling. We - \"</p><p>\"My lord? \"</p><p>\"Aye? \" Daniel turned from pushing Valoree'schair infor her, lookingquestioningly at Bawden as the manhesitatedinthedoor.</p><p>\"A gentleman to see you, my lord, \" the man explained the intrusion. \"I told himyou were at dinner, but he said it was important. Iput him inthe salon. Shall I tell him he will have to wait? \"</p> <p>\"Nay.Ishallsee to it, Bawden.\"Daniel gave Valoree another apologeticsmile, then bent to press a kiss to her forehead. \"I won't be a moment, \" heassured her, then slidfromtheroom.</p><p>The clank of the platter being setdown drew Valoree's gaze backto thetable, andshefoundherself gazing down at awhole fish, stuffed. Eyes, scales, fins, everything had been left wholly intact. Valoree felther stomach roll in protest and abruptlystood.</p><p>\"M'lord, I thought youshould know - \"</p><p>Valoree stiffened as she recognized Henry's voicebefore it was silenced. Frowning, she hurriedout intothe hall. Thesalon door was closed, muffling the conversation coming from inside.</p><p>Rushing toit, she reached for the doorknob, then hesitated, and pressed her ear to the door instead.</p><p>\"What? How did it happen? \" she heard Daniel ask in amazement.</p><p>\"The fellow was hiding inValoree's room, \"Henry responded.</p><p>\"Skully went in to collect the rest of Valoree's things as ye ordered him to, and surprised the fellow.\"</p><p>\"What fellow? \" Valoreemutteredto herself.</p><p>\"Is theresomethingI can get you, my lady? \"</p><p>Straightening abruptly, Valoree turned wide-eyed to face Bawden. \"Oh, I - \"Thinkingof no excuse, she simply shook her head. \"Nay, thank you.\"</p><p>Themanhesitated, thennodded and turnedonhis heel. As he tookhimselfoff, she turned back to the door to listen again.</p><p>\"Is he all right? \" Daniel was askingwithconcern.</p><p>\"He broke an arm in the tumble down the stairs.\" Henry sounded upset.</p><p>\"Great, \"Valoreesighed.\"Another broken limb.\" London was turning out to befar moredangerous to her crew than theseas.</p><p>Shecould almostbelieve that they were cursed. Then she realized that Henry had asked to speak to Daniel, andshe frowned. He should have asked to speak to her. He hadn't.He wasbringing the news to Daniel. And Daniel wasn't calling her inon this. So much fortheman'snot taking over.</p><p>\"And the other fellow? \" Danielasked inside the salon.</p><p>\"Dead. Broke his neck on the way down the stairs.\"</p><p>They went down the stairs together, Valoree guessed, frustrated that she hadto do anyguessing atall.Skully musthave surprisedhim, a struggle ensued, thefellow gotaway andmade a dash downthestairs, and Skully'd gone afterhim.</p><p>\"Do you recognize him? \"</p><p>\"Nay, \" Henry's answer reached her through the door. \"Never seen himbefore, thoughBull sayshe looks like the chap what was driving the carriage that crashed intoours.\"</p><p>Valoree cursed under herbreath at the same moment asDaniel.</p><p>\"Thenthat wasnotan accident.\"Her husbandsighed almost tooquietlyfor her tohear.</p><p>\"It wouldseem not.\"</p><p>\"Thenthe fire probably was not either.\" Daniel cursed again.</p><p>There was amoment of silence; thenhe asked, \"Is thereanyone in Londonwho mightbear a grudge against Valoree or amember of her family? \"</p><p>Valoree rolled her eyes at that.Justlike aman. The fellow was in herroom, so he had to be after her. Hedidn't even consider that unless he had beenin the house before, he wouldn't know whose roomwas whose. That he would have to search around.</p><p>Or that maybe hehadn'tmeant to go into that room at all but had beenin the hall, andhad ducked into her oldroom to hide when Skully had comeup the stairs.</p><p>\"Nay. She was just a child when sheleft England aboardthe Valor. This here husband-hunting trip was her first tripeven to London, \"Henry said.</p><p>\"The rumors said that the Spanish killedher brother.\"</p><p>\"Aye. Some Spanish bastard did him in.\" Henry's bitterness was clear.</p><p>\"How? And why? \"</p><p>\"Didn't shetellye? \"</p><p>\"She has not talked of itatall.\"</p><p>Silence, then: \"It was after he went to meet with you forthe assessing. Heleft, heading back to collect us, but the Spanish had found out that Jeremy'd be meetin' with ye. One ofour crew was feeding them information invarious ports, Ireckon.They layin wait, thinkinghe would leave you, collect therest of his treasure, then head back to join us. But he headed right back for us. He wanted allthemen present tocollect the treasure.</p><p>\"The Spanish layinwait, then stopped and boarded them, none too pleased that the Valor had so little on her. The captain offered them all quick deaths if they gaveup the treasure. Jeremy saidno, but he changedhis mind once they startedto torturethe crew. He toldthem then, but the bastardwas enjoying himself.</p><p>He had funwiththemen, doinghorrible thingsto them.\"</p><p>Valoree shuddered where she stood, recalling the sight that had awaitedthem whentheyhad finallyfound thespot where Jeremy lay. She and the rest of the crew had collected all that they needed forthetrip back toEngland, then relaxedat a tavern, checking infrequentlydown at thedocks for theirship's return.</p><p>They hadn'tat first worriedat how longit was taking. But when nightfellandValoree's brotherstillhad not returned, they had begun tofret.</p><p>The next morning, whileit was still dark, they had hired a piragua and set out to look for the Valor andits crew. Andthey had foundthem in acove not unlikethe one whereValoree and Danielhad consummatedtheir marriage. They had spotted the mastfirst.The Spanish had sunk the Valor in thatharbor, but it was notdeep enough tocover the ship. The mainmasthad stood outof the water, its Jolly Roger waving sadly inthe breeze. They hadrowed the dugout canoe toshore, silent and grim as they had passed body after body floating through the water. Yes, the Spaniardhaddonehorrible thingsto those men. Not one body had been unmutilated. But none of the bodies they had passed hadbeenJeremy's.</p><p>Valoree had leaped from the dugoutcanoeas soon as they had reached water shallowenoughinwhichto walk, nearlylosing her pants as they were dragged at by the waves. She had been wearing a set of Jeremy's clothes, as she had just had another growthspurt and had outgrown all her own. HoldingJeremy's breeches up impatiently, she had waded ashore and begun checking the bodies strewn about like so many dropped chess pieces. Checkingface after face ofmenshe had known and lived with for eight years, she haddesperatelysearched for her brother.</p><p>It had been a nightmare. She had been able to read, quite clearly, the horror ineach man's glassy eyesand open mouth. A little piece of herheart had broken away withevery friend that she found. Andthenshe had come upon Jeremy.</p><p>Valoree had been amazed to find him still alive, and then horrifiedathis state. They had staked him out inthe sand, naked.</p><p>His body was cut from one end to the other, none of thewounds morethan an inch apart. Then theyhad poured honey over him andleft himfor the insects and animals. Sheguessed that the way they had decided to kill him wasthe reason he still lived when they arrived. Itmusthavetaken hours to cut him like that.</p><p>Shestill had nightmares where she held him in herarms. He gasped, \"Spanish ... bastard ... Ohhhh.\" Sobbing, she hadclutched him close as he cried out, tellinghim to hush, torest, tosave his strength. But he had known he was dying. He'd gasped out, \"Question-mark shaped scar... neck.Told themwhere treasure ...</p><p>Lostall. So sorry. Val - \"</p><p>\"Then he pressedthefamily ring into Valoree's hand and died, \"</p><p>Henry's sadwordsdrew herback to theconversation in theroom beyondthedoor, and Valoree closed her eyes, shuddering.</p><p>\"My God, \"Daniel's horrified words reached her.</p><p>\"Aye. She hasn't beenthe same since. Closed herself up and didn't care 'bout nobodyor nothing except finding and killingthe bastard who did that.\"</p><p>\"She never found him? \"</p><p>\"Nay. We never did.\"</p><p>\"How did youconvince her to give up the hunt? \"Daniel asked.</p><p>Henry gave a drylaugh.\"Didn't convince her. Voted onit.\" She heard hissighthroughthedoor.\"We had regained the money neededto set Ainsley to rights lastsummer. But she didn't want tostop and we ...\" There wassilence, then:\"But, finally we had a vote. Themenwere ready to retire. It seemed tousthatwe were just givingthe bastards more of our time.We were giving up a portion of our livesfor them.Still, the captainwas obsessed.We talkedaboutit, and the men - well, they still thought her amanat that time, aladreally - but theydecided itwas for the captain's own good. So we voted, andoncewe voted, she had no choice.\"</p><p>\"No choice, \" she heardDanielmurmur. \"You took the power awayfromher.\"</p><p>\"Itwasfor her own good, \" Henry insisted grimly. \"She had no business being out at sea any longer. She was there out of necessity at first, andthat was one thing. Butintheend, it was no longer necessity.\"</p><p>Theywere bothsilent for a moment; thenDaniel said, \"So you know ofno one who would wish her dead? \"</p><p>\"Nay. But the men are spooked, and Meg...Well, she was nigh on hysterical. Took one look at the dead fella and went right white. She'swantingto getout of here. Wants us to tell Valoree that she'swithchild, have herannounce it, claim Ainsley, and head there rightnow. Andthemen are right behindher.\"</p><p>Valoree gave a start. She hadn't realized that anyone had guessed her secret, though she supposedsheshould have known that Henrywould figure it out. He hadalwayshelped her withthe fluxwhen it came onher:gettingrags for her touse, serving her hotrumto ease her cramps. Of course he would havenoticed she hadmissed the last two. Well, three now.</p><p>She had kept the secret to herself, though. She wasn't even sure why, exceptthat she had wanted to wait first and besure she didn't lose the child.</p><p>\"I just can't figure why anyone would wish to harm the captain, \" Henry said. \"Maybe Meg's right and it doesn't matter as long as we get her out of town. She's taking thisreally hard. She was fussing overSkully something fierce.\"</p><p>There was silence for a minute; thenDaniel spoke, his voice drawing nearer the door. \"Iwanttohave alookatthisfellow.</p><p>Maybe Iknowhim and - \" His voice died ashe openedthe door tofind Valoree on the otherside. She had managedto straighten, butnot to move away before he opened the door.</p><p>\"What - \" hebegan, but Valoree interrupted him.</p><p>\"Iwas just coming totellyou that your dinner is growing cold, \"</p><p>she said quickly, then glanced past him, her eyes wideningin feigned surprise. \"Henry! Is something thematter? Whatare you doing here? \"</p><p>The two menglancedateach other; then her husband said, \"He just camearound to let us knowthat they have settled in atthe town house.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Oh? \" she asked archly, her gaze fixedon theolder man.

I will not begone long, but I wantto check on something, \" heannounced, stepping outinto the halland forcing her backa step. Henry slid past, too, as soon as Daniel had cleared the doorway, sidling nervously toward the front door. Valoree frowned at him, then tried to speak, but Daniel continued right on as he shifted sideways and began to back towardthedoor as well. \"Why do younot goback and finish your meal? Youneed to keep up your strength. I will explain everything later. Muchlater.\"</p><p>\"But - \" The door closed in herfaceand Valoree slammed her hand against it impatiently.\"Somuch for discussingthings and not taking over, \" she said in a snarl, her mouth twisting with displeasure. She was damnedtired ofbeing led around by the nose.</p> <p>Pulling the door open, she looked out in time to see the carriage pullaway. A suddenthroat clearing behind hermade her pauseand glance back at Daniel's butler. \"Aye? \"</p><p>Bawden hesitated, then; \"Is my lady goingsomewhere? \"</p><p>\"Aye.\"</p><p>He hesitated at the hard word, then, apparently deciding he would be inmore trouble from Daniel should he not ask, he straightened his shoulders. \"Shall I ordera carriage? \"</p><p>\"I can walk. It is not far, \" Valoree said dismissively. With that she walkedout, pulling the doorclosed behind her.</p> <p>She washalfway up the walk tothe gate that fronted Daniel's town house whensheheard thedooropen behindher. \"But, my lady, where shall I tell my lord you have gone shouldhe return? \"</p><p>\"You will not have to tellhimanything, \" Valoree tossedback grimly over her shoulder. \"I am walking to my uncle's town house, which iswhere he is.\"</p><p>\"Oh.\" There was uncertainty in hisvoice; then she thought she heard him sigh unhappily asshe stepped through the gate and pulledit closed.</p><p>Valoree was so angry, shewasnearly halfway to theBeecham town housebefore shestartedto feel the early evening chill. The night wasdamp andfoggy. But then, from what she had seen since being in London, it usually was, she thought grimly.</p><p>Rubbingherarms, she berated herself for not thinking her plan through first andgrabbing a cloakof some sort. Ah, well, it wasn't much ofa walk from one townhouse to the other. Two short blocks. Still, her gazeslid alertlyaroundthe shadowedstreet as she went, trying to pierce the drifting mist and watch out for possible problems. Luckily she didn't see anything to be concerned about.</p><p>She was a mere two houses from her destination when something made her stop. Freezing, she saw a cloaked figure slide outthroughthefront door. Instinctively, Valoree moved closer to the stonefence beside her, trying to be less noticeable as she watchedthe figure scurry to the gate. She recognized Meg right away. Her size and the fact that a light-colored gown kept peeking out from under the cloak made her identity an easy guess. When the other woman reached the walkand turned away from Valoree to hurry up the street, sheimmediatelyfollowed, her thoughts churning. The woman was obviously up to something she shouldn't.Butwhatshe was doingwas anyone's guess.</p> <p>Already chilled Valoree hoped as she setout after her that Meg wasn't planning togo far.No such luck.The womanwalked for what seemed like forever, rushing downthis road, then hurrying up another. She shouldhavetaken the damn carriage, Valoree thought irritably.It wasn't safe for awoman to bewanderingthe streetsalone. Well, a woman whocouldn'tprotectherself at any rate.Ofcourse, if Meg had taken the carriage, she wouldn'thave been sneaking - Skully wouldhave had to go withher, too.Also, Valoreeherself couldn't have followed on foot.</p><p>It was a reliefwhen theolderwoman finally paused infront of atown house. She didn't approach it at first; she simplystood out front, staringupat it, uncertainty inevery line of herbody. She even turned back the way she had come - toward Valoree, who had to quickly duck behind a tree to avoid beingspotted - but she took only two steps before pausing again. Doing so, she straightened resolutely, turned back, hesitated, then started up thewalk to thehouse. Valoree watched fromher position behind the tree as the other woman knocked. A moment later, light spilled outover Meg'scloaked figure as a servant opened the door. As he stepped asidefor her to enter and the door closed, the night wasleft dark andsilent once more.</p><p>Frowning, Valoreepeered up at the dwelling, wondering whose it was and what business Meg could possibly have there, then back the way they had come. It suddenly occurred toher that she probably couldn't find herway back. She had been more focused onMegthan onthe route the woman had taken. Although she doubted even if she hadpaidattentionto the paththatshe would be able torecall it.The woman had taken moretwists and turns toget here than Valoreecould count on both hands.</p><p>Sighing, she turned backtothe house. She had abad feeling about allof this.The veryfact that Meg hadgoneaboutthisall so sneakily was enoughtomake Valoree edgy. First, afellow was caught in their house, wherehe broke his neck andSkully his arm ina tumbledown the stairs, then Megslippedout to come here.</p><p>Valoree seemed to recall Henry saying something about the woman being terribly agitated and wantingthem to leave London for the country. Of course, Daniel would not have agreed to that.</p><p>He wasstillwaitingfor his audience with the king.</p><p>Drumming her fingers against the tree she stood behind, Valoree considered thehouse. She could wait here for theother woman tocome out andfollow herback to Beecham's rental, never being the wiseras to the reasonbehindthis journey, or she could justsneak up to thehouse and have a look inside. Perhaps she might even figure outwho Megwas meeting.</p><p>Actionwas more attractive toValoree than standing about, so she slid out from behind the tree and walked quickly to the townhouse gate. Slipping through it, she eased it closed, then made her wayup thepath, doing her best to stick to theshadows as she went.</p> <p>She didn'tnotice the mantrailing her until it was too late.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\"You want I should get ridof the body? \" Bull asked, drawing Daniel's gaze away from the face of the dead man with amazement.</p><p>\"Get rid of it? No. We have tocall in the authorities.\" Seeing the uncertainty on the men's faces, Daniel grimaced and straightened. \"It was anaccident. Afall downthe stairs. No one isatfault here, and he was an intruder.But the authorities should benotified.\"He glanced around, his gaze landing on One-Eye.</p><p>\"I'm onmyway, \" the other man announced, then turned to open the door, onlyto pauseand glance back. \"Which authority, exactly, would it be Iam going to fetch? \"</p><p>Daniel glanced towardthe man, hismouth opening toanswer, then snappedit shut as hesaw John Beecham standing at the doorstep, gaping in at the body on the floor.</p><p>**** \"Damn.\" Valoree reached up tomassage her achinghead. Itdid seem she hada tendency to wake upsore-headedlately. At least this time she had seen the man who hit her. She had heardthe snap ofafallen branch behindheras she approached the town house, turned, and caught aquick glimpse of his face beforethe handle of hisflintlock pistolhad struck her in the temple.</p><p>\"You are awake.\"</p><p>Valoree glanced up with surprise at the woman who hurried to kneel at her side in the dim, dungeonlike room. \"Meg.\"</p><p>\"Aye.\" The other woman sighed, thenaskedat the sametime that Valoree did, \"What are youdoing here? \"</p><p>Valoree made aface. \"I saw you sneak outof the town house and I followed to seewhere youweregoing. Someoneknocked meout as I wascreeping up to the window to peek inside, \" she admitted, then arched an eyebrow. \"And you? \"</p><p>\"I came to see my sister, \" the woman admitted grimly.</p><p>Valoree's eyebrows rose.</p><p>\"Lady Beecham? \"</p><p>\"Aye. I was shown to the salon, went to peer out thewindow, and someone must have entered behind me. I was hit from behind, too.\"</p><p>\"Hasthis something to dowiththeman who broke hisneck falling down thestairs? \" At Valoree's question, the olderwoman noddedsolemnly. \"You recognized him? \"</p><p>\"He used towork for my father. I would imaginehe waswith my sister now.\"</p><p>\"Sotheattacks ...? \"</p><p>\"Were all aimed at me, I amafraid, \" Meg admitted sadly.</p><p>\"Hmmm.\" Valoree wassilentfor a moment, then beetled her brows. \"Would you care to fillin thebits you left out when last we spoke about your past? \"</p><p>Meg hesitated, then blurted, \"Johnis my son.\"</p><p>\"John? \" Valoreefrowned atthe name andstarted toshake her head, then paused, her eyes widening. \"John Beecham? Lord Beecham was the lover who got you with child, then did not believe it washis? \" When she nodded, Valoree sighed wearily and shifted to get up off the cold, damp floor on which she had been sitting. Theywere in some sort of storage room.It felt like a wine cellar, but therewas no wine, just crates and boxes. A single candle was the only light. Kind of them to leave even that, Valoree supposed asshe eased ontoa nearby crate. Rubbingthe back of herneck inan effort torelieve someof her discomfort, she raisedher head to peer at Meg. \"Go on.\"</p><p>Sighing, Meg settled herself on a crate near the door, tears beginning to shinein her eyes asshe staredunhappily downat her hands. \"Meg isshort for Margaret. My full name is Margaret JeanKettleworth.\"</p><p>\"Nice to meet you, Lady Kettleworth, \" Valoree said dryly.</p><p>\"But can weskip to the pertinent parts? I suspect we haven't much time.\" WhenMeg nodded, butlookedat a loss as to where to start, Valoree prompted her. \"How could you be John's mother? Lady Beecham - \"</p><p>\"Stolehim, \" Meg interrupted bitterly.\"She stole himand lied to me.\"Closingher eyes, shelowered herhead wearily. \"AsI told you, I loved John's father.\" A smile tilted her lips gently in reminiscence. \"He wassuch a handsome man. Tall, debonair - \"</p><p>\"You had an affair.\" Valoree interrupted, speeding the story along.</p><p>\"Aye.\" The wordwas asigh.\"His mother heldalargeroutat Beecham Castle before he was married. Lots of people were invited. It was a marvelous affair. Hunting during the days.</p><p>Dancing at night. Thelast night therewas amasked ball. I did not recognize him at first, but he did me.Hesaid it wasmy perfume that gave meaway.\" Her smile returned.\"Hesaid - \"</p><p>\"Meg, \" Valoree interrupted impatiently. The other woman nodded.</p><p>\"Aye, I am sorry. Toward midnight, we slipped out to the baileyfor somefresh air, butit was full of people, most of them quite drunk. One of thembumped into me and spilledsomething on my skirt. Itwasred wine, and mygownwas white.John was furious. Iwas afraid he would challengethehapless man to a duel, he was so angry. I dragged him away, pulling him intothe stable, begginghim to show me hishorse inthe hopesof calming him down.\"</p><p>\"And you made love in the hay, \" Valoree rushed the story along again. \"Thenwhat happened? Did henot ask you to marry him? \"</p><p>\"Hedidnot get the chance, \" Megsaid with asigh. \"Afterward, heled me back to the manor, saying we had to gosee my parents, that there was somethinghewishedtoask them.Butmysister came across us as we entered. Aghastat the stainon mygown, she rushed me off to help me tend toit. It Was beyondrepair. I hadto change. I told Blanche what had happened, and that I thought the question he meant to ask was for my hand in marriage. Shetook my gown andsuggested she go tell him to come fetchme in twenty minutes, thenleftme tochange. I did, then fell asleep waiting.He never came.\" Her bewilderment as she said those last words wasobvious.</p><p>Valoree frowned slightly.\"What happenedthenextday? \"</p><p>\"Hegave me the cut direct, \" she admitted. \"I stayed awayfrom the balls andpartiesafter that.It hurt too much to seehim. But three months later, I realizedI was with child.\"</p><p>\"Did you tell him? \"</p><p>Sheshook her head. \"I did not know what to do. I turned to Blanche\" - she grimaced at the name - \"but she was quite affronted.She said he would have totake responsibility. I resisted atfirst, but Blanche was brutal about the matter. I hadmademy bed, and now must face the consequences, she said. He was supposed to be at the Crichtons' ball that night. Blanche determined to go and drop the information in his lap. It would be hisproblem afterthat, she claimed. Istayed home, too humiliated andafraid to go. When shereturned, it was totell me that he had laughedatmysituationand said it probably wasn't even his. That if I had lifted my skirts for him so quickly and easily, how was he toknow I did not doit for others? It couldbe the stable lad's child for all he knew.\"</p><p>\"Men!\" Valoree snapped in disgust, and Meg nodded unhappily.</p><p>\"Ididnot knowwhat todo. IthinkI would have hurled myself out the window if my sister had not been there. Instead, she convinced me to go stay ina cottageonthe edge of Kettleworth land.

The older one had barely escaped a scandal herself, rumor had it.</p><p>Right after the wedding, she had gone to live inthe country.</p><p>Eight months after that she returned with the heir.

You still love him? \"</p><p>\"Aye. Foolish, perhaps, but I always felt there was some explanation for whathad happened, somethingIwas notseeing.</p><p>He hadcourtedme. We had been so happy together.

So gloriously happy. I wanted that for myself. AndI didn't care how Igot it. Ididn't even really plan what I did that night. It simply popped into my head, wholly conceived, as if the devil himself had whispered it to me.

I was afraidyou would talk to him and my plot wouldunravel, but when he gave you the cut direct the next morning, youseemed togive up on him. I had beenfeelingguilty about my impulsive actions, but that convinced me that what I had done was right.I told myself that you did not deservehimif you were not willing to put up even a bit of afight forhim.\"</p><p>\"How was I tofight? \" Meg interrupted sharply atthe criticism.</p><p>\"He wouldnot even look at me, letalone speak tome.\"</p><p>\"How would you know? You never tried to talk to him!\"</p><p>Blanche snapped back with resentment. \"I would have cornered him, forced him to tell me why he was treating me so shabbily after ournight together.\"</p><p>Meg sank back ontoher crate looking uncertain as Blanche continued. \"Instead, you avoided him - not goingto any of the same parties, leaving if he showed up at anyyou attended.\"</p><p>\"It hurtto see him. Iwas so ashamed.\"</p><p>\"Well, perhaps if you had used some courage instead of slinking awaylike a naughty puppy, thingswould have turned out differently. After the first couple of weeks, he stopped trying to avoid you. He was actually stalking you from ball to ball. I suspect he would have accepted any lieyou chose totellhim, simply to keep you near him; he loved youthat much. But you ran.\"</p><p>Meg bither lips, tears rushing from her eyesinrivulets.</p><p>\"Then you realizedyou were with child. Iwas afraid you would goto him outof desperation and tell him. I knew he would marry youthen. Even if he believed the child was not his, he would have married you.So I said I would go tell him.ButI didn't. I didn't sayanything to him. Ireturned home that night, lied toyou, andconvinced you totake yourself off to thecountry to havethe child in seclusion. Once youwere gone, I told him and everyone else that you had runoff to elope with a stablelad. Andthey believed it. Then Iwaited for my opportunity. AsI had expected, hebegan todrinkheavily. Onenight he got quite drunkand I was there, insisting on seeing him home. Of course, once there, I wouldn't leaveuntil I was surehe wasall right.</p><p>\"Ihad thoughtthathe wouldturn tomefor comfort.He would make loveto me, and I would have him.\" She gave a harshlaugh.</p><p>\"But Inearly had to rape him. It was nothingas you described. It was quick, rough, and sloppy, and he keptcalling your name. He passed out on top of me.Iwaitedtill near dawntobesure that his servantwouldseeme leave - inapanic, ofcourse - so that hecould report it to hismaster lest hewassodrunk he would not recall that he hadtakenmy innocence.ThenI waited.I expected him to dothechivalrous thing andpropose to me.Thenext time I saw him, however, he wasuncomfortable and as apologetic as could be, but he didnot propose. I was furious, butplayed sweet andwaited.</p><p>\"I had hopedthat our onetime would get me with child, as it hadwithyou, but once again Iwas disappointed. So againI lied. I told him I was with child from our night. At last, he did the honorable thing. Wewere married a week later.On our wedding night, he walkedme tomy door, kissed mein a fatherlyfashion on the forehead, then walked off to his own room, not tobother me again. Foolishly, at the time I was relieved, for I hadbeen agonizing over how I would explain that my body had not changed.Thenext morning atbreakfastI began mygreat plan to fool the ton. I wouldremove myselfto the country duringthe remainder of my pregnancy, have thechild there, and notreturn for ninemonthsatleast so thatno one shouldsuspect thatwe had married dueto my pregnancy. He said that was fine, even saw me off. Then Icame to see you.</p><p>\"He never asked me where I was going or how he could contactme, and I told myself that was grand, because then I would not needlie or fear his finding me withyou. I was a fool, deluding myself. The fact was, he didn't care about anything anymore, really. Except making money for the futuregenerations of Beechams.\"</p><p>Sighing, LadyBeecham peered athersister. \"Of course, you realizenow that your child did not die. I had him taken to a nearby inn with aservantuntil I could persuade youto leaveon a boat. I remained at the cottage until eight months had passed since my arrival; then returnedtriumphantly with your child. I was positive that presenting John with an heir would seal our relationship.That he would be gratefuland learn to care for me.</p><p>What Ihad not expected was his complete indifference.</p><p>\"He barely evenlooked atthe baby, nor myself, really, when we returned.

My life with himwas as cold and barrenas a fallow field in winter.\"</p><p>\"Poor you.\"</p><p>Meg gave a start at Valoree's words and glanced at her in surprise, asdidLadyBeecham. Valoree tookin their identical expressions withdisgust.\"Surely you are not falling for this sad tale and feeling sorry forher? \"she saidin asnarl. \"She ruined your life.

It isnot.\" Meg said quietly.Valoree gaped at her. \"She is right: I did not fightfor him, and I should have.InsteadI ran away like a coward.

I made my owndecisions, made a mess of my ownlife.\"</p><p>\"But if she had not - \"</p><p>\"Yes, she lied.She toldseveral whopping lies.

And not having that confidence, I should never have made loveto him.\"</p><p>\"Fine, \" Valoree snapped impatiently. \"You made your own decisions and are willing to forgive her for messing the relationship up between the twoof you.. But she's beentrying to kill you since you came to London! Areyou goingto takethe blame for thatas well? \"</p><p>\"Ihavenot been trying tokillher.\"</p><p>BothMegand Valoree looked over doubtfully at that, but it was Valoree who spoke. \"Let me guess.Youweren't really trying to killher; you were simplybaiting traps. If shefellinto one of them, it was her own fault for not beingmore careful? \"</p><p>A flicker of impatiencecrossed Blanche's faceat that.\"Idid notbait traps, either.It wasJohn.\"</p><p>\"John? \" Meg gasped in dismay. \"My own son wishes me dead? \"</p><p>\"Iam afraid so.\"</p><p>\"Does he not realize that she is his mother? \" Valoree demanded.</p><p>\"Iexplained everything tohim the day I spotted you inthe dressmaker's.

That hadonlyleft the meetingwiththeking.</p><p>Much to Valoree's pleasure, Daniel had taken her alongwith him for the royal audience.Too, it had gone much more smoothly thanshe had hoped. Daniel had explained the matterofJeremy's death and Valoree's continuation inhis stead. She herself had explained the reasons she had not yet delivered the king his portion.</p><p>The king had been very understanding. Valoree suspected it was due to themeticulous accounting theyhad presented tohim, and the scrupulous care that they had taken in ensuring his portion was set aside. And the fact that it was easily - and immediately - deliverable surely helped their case as well.</p><p>\"You, slept well, I hope? \" Little butterfly kisses along her throat drewValoree from her thoughts.She laughed huskily.</p><p>\"Like a babe rocked tosleep in its mother's arms.\"Turningin hisembrace, sheleaned her stomachinto him andpulled hishead down fora sweet kiss.</p><p>\"Mmmmm, \" he murmured; then his gaze slid past her.

She could see that everysingle man on deck was watchingthemwith big, silly, self-satisfied grinson their faces.

Forif they hadnot voted that she marry, then kidnapped the husband of theirchoice, she wouldn'tnowbe married to the man standing before her. So... letthem gloat abit, she decided, then watched as Daniel placed hishandsonher belly.He hadn'tbeen pleasedat the idea of this trip.He had refused to come until the spring, claiming that therewas little the men could do in the way of building theircottages, repairing Ainsley, and planting their crops untilthenanyway.</p><p>Valoree suspected he had also hopedthat thebaby wouldshow itselfearly and that any worry wouldbe outof theway. The men had therefore been stuck traveling between the ship and ThurborneCastle, taking their turns at eachplace, and suffering horrible boredom through the winter. Come the first sign of spring, Valoreehad announced determinedly that theyhad to get the men to Ainsley.Daniel had agreed, though not happily, and they had prepared the boat to journey around England to the other side. It was the longway there, for certain, but the men had wanteditthatway. Notthreeof them knew how toride ahorse, and travelingwagons had madethem all flinch atthe thought, so here they were, heading for Ainsleyand the lives they hadalways wanted.</p><p>Daniel had claimed that the pirates would get tired of the pastoral lifein notime.

At his astonished look, she chuckled. \"Think on it. That way, shouldanything happen to leave herwithout us, she will have the besthelp agirl couldask for.\"</p><p>Daniel shookhis head and pulled her into his embrace.\"That willneverhappen.\"</p><p>\"It happened to me, \" shemurmured solemnly intohis chest.</p><p>His arms tightened around her as if to protect her from the memoryof her loss.</p><p>\"Captain!\" Theybroke apartatonceatRichard's shout, both of them turning toward where the otherman hung over the crow's nest waving downat them.Both of them calledout at the same time, \"What is it? \"</p><p>\"A ship! Westward ho!\"</p><p>Both of them moved to the rail, squinting in the direction Richard waspointing. Indeed, there was a ship, and it was sailing towardthem at a fast clip.

Outrun them or surrender. What else - \"</p><p>\"We fight, \" Valoree announced. The men immediately cheered at the announcement.Daniel wasa little less pleased.</p><p>\"Fight?

And I know you are the more experienced at this, \" Daniel said unhappily. \"But your experience is with attacking, not defending. I really think we should just surrenderand hope forthebest. Our chances - \"</p><p>\"Are quitegood, actually, \" Valoree interrupted with a grin, her eyessparkling as she peeredaround the deck, quickly making plans in her head. \"They think we are simplya merchant ship.</p> <p>Weare riding low.They'llexpect usto have acoupledozen men at most. We have seventy-seven.\"</p><p>\"Seventy-six, \" he corrected, glaring meaningfully at her stomach. \"Andtwelve females.\"</p><p>\"Seventy-six men, andthirteen women, \" she laughed, rubbing her stomachmeaningfully.

Iknow we are weighed down right now, but I want you togetevery last bit ofspeed out of the Valor that youcanmanage.\"</p><p>\"Aye-aye, Captain.\"</p><p>\"Why? I thought wewere going toseem tosurrender? \" Daniel asked worriedly. Valoree had to count to ten to keep from snapping at him.</p><p>Once she feltsure she would remain calm, she turned to him with adecidedly forced smile andexplained. \"If we appear to surrender too easily, withoutmaking atleastan effort at escape, they willsurelybecome suspicious. Do younot think? \"</p><p>\"Oh, aye, \" hemumbled. She shook her head sympathetically.</p><p>\"Husband, you appear to have difficulty with giving up control of this situation. Mayhapyou should gobelowand have a drink.\"</p><p>Danielsmiled wryly. \"Iam not behaving well, amI? Well...\"</p><p>He glanced towardthe ship that drew nearer with everypassing moment.Itcertainly sailed under a black flag. \"Iwilltry to do better. I trustyou. Truly I do.You areanexcellentcaptain.

In fact, mayhap youcould oversee that.\"</p><p>\"Aha.\"Daniel nodded.\"Icando that.\" He started to turn away, then pausedand swungback. \"But why? \"</p><p>Valoreealmostsnappedat himthat it didn'tmatterwhy; she was captain at the moment and that meant he was to follow orders withoutquestion. But then shereconsidered and forced herselfto explain. \"If we weretruly trying to escape, we would attempt to lighten ourload by throwinggoods over.\"</p><p>\"Ah, so youhope to fool themby throwing the parts of the crates over.\"</p><p>\"Aye. But empty crates would float for a minute or so ere sinking, so youaregoing to break the crates into single slats, then have mencarrythem with the flatand largest sides facingthe oncoming ship. And drop them into the water as if they are heavy.\"</p><p>\"Clever, \"he said with a suddengrin. \"I shall seeto itatonce.\"</p><p>\"Great.\" Valoree felt some relief as he finally walked away, then chuckledunder her breath.</p><p>\"What's so funny? \" Bull asked beside her.</p><p>\"I was just thinking that as much trouble ashe ishavinggiving up control in this crisis, I would beworse wereit me.\"</p><p>\"Aye, \" Bullagreed solemnly. At the rather stiff lookshe threw his way for agreeing so quickly, he shrugged. \"Just look how much troublewe had getting ye married tohim.\"</p><p>Muttering under her breath, shewalked awayin searchof the women.</p><p>\"Oh, God.I should have insisted you staybelow.\"</p><p>Valoree tore her gaze away from the smalldinghypaddling toward themacross theshort spanof water separating the two boats, and frowned at Daniel.</p><p>They had pretended to attempt to outrun the pirates now crossing the water eagerly toward them, then appeared to surrenderreluctantly when it was obvious that they could not.</p><p>Pulling theEnglish flag down, theyhad replaced it with a white shirt, the best they coulddo for the colorlessflag that wasthe traditional signalof surrender. In response, the other boat had fired one singlecannonoff the starboardbowas a warning not to tryto flee, thenlaid anchor a safe distance away, just farenough not to haveto worry about the two swinging aroundin a current or stiff breeze and hitting each other. Then the pirates had lowered thesmall 'boat, filled it to overflowing with men, and begun tomake theirway acrossto mounttheValor andclaim her as their own. They leftsome of their crew aboard their own ship, of course, with the cannons trained on the Valor as an obvious threat.</p><p>Still, they thought the Valor a simple merchant ship, carrying goods, perhapsa dozenor so men, and few if anyweapons. They were in for a surprise. And at that moment, Valoree was experiencing the same mounting tensionand tingling expectation she had always enjoyedwhen climbing silently up the sides of the craft they had taken themselves. Anticipating the battle ahead, she thrilled at thedanger. She felt incredibly aliveasshealways had.Yet this time, she feltalmostanequal amount of terror as well. That was new.Always beforeshe had felt only a burning sort of rage, a desperate desire for revenge, a longing to find herself facing the scarred Spanishbastard who had killed her brother, and a complete lack of concern with death. Now, however, sheknewwith a certainty that shewouldnever again beBack-from-the-Dead Red - and never couldbe.</p><p>Now thepossibility of death was like a cloud inside her head, numbing thepart ofherbrain she needed mostandmaking her hand tremble slightly with the fear of it. She wanted to live. She wanted to spend herlife with Daniel, to see her babe born, to watch it grow. And she knewinstinctivelythather fear was what could get her killed.</p><p>\"Aye, I shouldhave lockedyou inthe cabin. Awoman has no place amid this men's work.And thisplan is madness, pure and simple. Itwill never work. Iwasa fool tolisten to a woman and her hare-brainedschemes. Here I was lettingyou act ascaptain outof pity and - \"</p><p>\"Pity!\" Valoree turned on him in amazement as his words finallysankthrough her fear and she realized whathehadbeen saying. She couldn't believe the words had spouted from his mouth. After allhisproclamationsof love and admiration, after findingher so intelligent!Now the truth was out. Eyes narrowing to glowing orbs of rage, Valoree puther nose to his and said in a hiss, \"You'd best be saving some of that pity for yourself, husband, for afterwe take careof these bastards. ThenI'll be turning my attention to you, and you can count yourself luckyif yeain't hanged from the crow'snest afterall.\"</p><p>Then she turned away to move toward the other women, pausing after only astep to whirl back. \"And ye'd bestnot mess your part up, sirrah, or I'll cut your tongueout and feedit tothe fishereI have ye hanged.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, unlike her men, who were now watching the exchangewarily, Daniel didn'tlooka bit cowedby her threat. He merely grinned and gave her a wink, which served only to infuriate her further.Hand clenching around thecutlass she held hidden inthe folds ofherskirt, she turned herattention tothe other men and said in asnarl, \"Look lively;they'reboarding. You know what todo.\"</p><p>The men turnedto see thatshe was right. Theropes that had beenloweredover the sideof the boatwere moving slightly and creaking under the weight of the menclimbing them. Her crew immediately began to take their positions, and Valoree turned away to stompover tothe other women. Eleniwas oneof them.</p><p>Sheand Petey had more than resolved their differencesinthe Thurbournekitchen over whowas in charge - theyhadmarried just two weeksbefore setting out forAinseley. Megwas there, too. Though John had begged her to stayand live with himat Beecham, Meg had feared causing him problems. Instead, she claimed shepreferredthe idea of anicelittle cottage at Ainsley.</p><p>\"Close to Henry and his roses would be nice, \" she had told Valoreeinconfidence.</p><p>Therest of the women were the wivesor thesoon-to-be wives of other crew members - except for Helen, the sweet, dark-haired girl who had taken up the role of lady's maid to Valoree. She was the only single young woman onboard. Still, the way One-Eye kept trying to charm her madeValoree think thatthe girl wouldn't be unwed for long. Eleni, Meg, and Helen were the only femaleswho were keeping a brave face on. The others were all shaking in their skirts, a couple even giving in to terrified sobs.The ruckus rubbed Valoree'salready raw nerves.</p><p>\"Quit yer sniveling, \" she snapped. \"Ye'll just be drawing attention to yerselves that way.\"</p><p>That seemed toscare thesobs right out of them, she sawwith somesatisfaction. Turningherselfslightlysothather sword hand washidden between herself and the group she stood in front of madeheradvanced stage ofpregnancy more obvious, and that was fine, too. It made her appear harmless.</p><p>\"You menreadybackthere, One-Eye? \" she said in ahiss.</p><p>\"Aye, Cap'n, \" camethesoft answer.</p><p>\"Good. On my signal.\"</p><p>\"Aye.\"</p><p>\"Nice work, \" Henry muttered, moving to Daniel's side once Valoree was out of earshot. When he simply raised an innocent eyebrow atthe remark, the older man said, \"Shewas losing her nerve. You gave it back to her by making her too mad to remember to beafraid.\"</p><p>Danielshrugged. Right at that moment, he didn'tknow if he haddone the right thing. He had seen the fear, had known it wasn't normalfor her and therefore was notsomething she could easily overcome, and had instinctively donewhat he'd needed to do. Butnow he almost thought he should haveleft her afraid. He would rather she stayed out of the fray with the other women.</p><p>That wassomethinghe knewshe wasn't likely todo now that her fear was under control again.</p><p>\"Never seen her like that before, \" Henry admitted. \"Guess ye're softening her upsome. A good thing, Ithink.\"</p><p>Daniellooked skeptical.\"What? Not sorryto see the end to CaptainBack-from the-Dead Red? \"</p><p>Henry considered that seriously for a moment, then sighed.</p><p>\"She surewas somethingto see. No fear. All rage. Takingon any andall comers, and that anger washer finestweapon.Her lack of fear scared the hellout of anyman with the sense to want to live.\"</p><p>At Daniel'sexpression, he continued. \"More often than not that attitude convinced them of the wisdom of surrendering. Not every time, mind ye. She provedher worth with a sword, too - more times than I care toremember. Andsheshowed us that all those years ofus men training her weren't fornaught. But she was lucky. We allwere. That luck couldn't hold out forever.</p><p>Jeremy's death proved that.Nay.\" Heshook hishead. \"We're best outof this business. Jeremy would want herout of it.\"</p><p>Daniel was silent for a moment, then said softly. \"I am surprisedthat heallowed her to betrained with the sword.\"</p><p>Nowit was Henry's turn to lookskeptical. \"Considering the life we led, it would have been more surprisinghad he not.\"</p><p>Daniel murmured in reluctantagreement, thenstiffenedasthe first of the pirates clambered over the side of theship.</p><p>There were twenty in all, and every oneof them was armed to the teeth. Compared to them, the twelve men of the Valor in evidence besides Danieland Henry looked almost respectable.</p><p>And that, he realizedsuddenly, had most likely been Valoree's intent. Thesemen weretheones still possessingall their limbs andbodily parts. Nota patch, a peg leg, or a missing nose among them. They were also wearing simple breechesand shirts with oneweapon each, generallya cutlass. They had nospecialleather vests or belts bristling with bladesor pistols. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brilliant, he congratulated her silently as the pirate captain came over the sidelast.That, he thought, was telling. The man wasa coward.Daniel had heardvery little about Valoree's days of high-seas robbery - by hisown choice, for while Valoree was quiet on the subject, the men had been eager to regalehimwith talesof their daring. But after learningthat she always ledthe attackand wasthefirstover the side of the ship, he had shied off hearing more. Perhaps when he was in his dotage, and already gray, he would bebetter equipped to handle hearinghowshe had putherself in danger.But nowhis poor heart could not bear it.</p><p>At that moment, however, he felt a thrill of pride at the fact that, captain or not - and having that choice - still she had always led the attack.This mandid not have thatcourage, and while thatlowered him in Daniel's estimation, it alsomade Daniel extremely wary. There was nothing more dangerous, in his opinion, than acoward. One never knew whatlengths they would goto to save their ownskin.</p><p>These thoughts running through his head, he watched grimly as the pirate captain slowlyperusedtheship, takingineach man, thenthe women, before settling onDaniel andHenry. He moved toward themat once, asupercilious smileonhis faceashe took in Daniel's matching maroon velvet waistcoat and the silly beribboned knee breeches Valoree had insisted hewear.She had said it would make him look more fey and less threatening.</p> <p>Danieltried not to grimaceas theman's gaze thendropped tothe pinkhose she hadalso insistedhe wear. He had recognized them at once as part of the livery the men had sported while they paraded as her house servants, but had donned them without argument, knowing therewas apurpose behind her every order.</p><p>Promising himselfhe wouldwipe that smirk off the man's face at the first opportunity, hebegan to wave the hankie she had pressed into hishand, in what hehoped would appear a nervous fashion. Thenhe pressed it to his upper lip and tried to look as small and\"fey\" as a six-footman with broad shoulders could as the fellow paused before him.</p><p>\"Ye'd be the captain of this herevessel, \" the fellow decided, addressing Henrywitha barely discernible Spanish accent.</p><p>\"Aye, \"thequartermaster calmly lied.</p><p>The fellow accepted that readily, then nodded in Daniel's general direction without bothering to look at him. \"Owner? \"</p> <p>\"Aye, \"Henry said again. \"And ye are? \"</p><p>There was a tense moment of silence; then he smiled.It wasn't avery pleasant smile.\"Have your mendrop theirweapons.\"</p><p>Henryhesitated, then gestured with hishand, andthere was a brief symphony of clumps and clangsas themen dropped their pistols and cutlasses.</p><p>The pirate captain made a similar gesture, and several of his men began to move around, collecting thedropped arsenal. Once that was done, he turned back to Henry. \"What are you carrying? \"</p><p>\"Linen, taffeta, silver, iron, and a bitof gold, but not much, \"</p><p>Henry said - exactly what Valoree had told himto report as their cargo.Furnitureand food might have justangered thefellow and gotten someone shot before they were ready for fighting.</p> <p>Claiming toomuch of value might have made him suspicious, however.</p><p>The pirateseemed satisfied with the list. He merely nodded, then held out ahand, palmup.\"Your weapon.\"</p><p>**** Valoree watched silently as Henry pulled out the flintlock pistol she'd hadhim put in thetop of his pants. He handed it over slowly, laying it inthe man's palmbefore reachingto remove his cutlass. Itwas while hewas distracted with the second task that the pirate captain struck. She saw himswing the gun at Henry and stiffened, but before she couldutter aword, an alarmed cry fromMeg piercedher ear. It was too lateforHenryto avoidthe blow, however, and he went down like a stone beneath it.He fell unconscious tothedeck.</p><p>Meg immediately tried torush pasther then, no doubt to help Henry, but Valoreegrabbedher arm and held her back, stepping in frontof her when the pirate captainpeered curiously toward them. Their gazes met briefly, and she found her chin rising despite her best effortsto appear frightened. Thenhebrokethe glance andturnedto address hisnow unarmed captives.</p><p>\"I am Captain Alvarez of the Bastardo. Thisismy ship now.</p><p>Andyouwill nowhave your choice: a slow death or a fast one.</p><p>Thosemenwhocooperate andhelpustransfer the cargo will die quickly and as painlesslyaspossible. Those who do not, but ask questions, or aretooslow to follow orders\" - he glanced down and kicked the unconscious Henry viciously, then smiled pleasantly ashe finished - \"willbe sportfor mymen. That means keel-hauling, eating your owntongues, things of that nature, \" he explained ina boredtone, thenshrugged. \"Iwould offersome of youtheopportunity to join my crew, but I have just taken on several from anothership, andso need no moremen.\"</p><p>\"Now, Captain? \"</p> <p>Valoree heard One-Eye's hissedwords. He sounded furious. Of course. But then, all the men would be outraged. Itwasone thing to killa man, quite another to torture himtodeath.And really, offering tokill himquickly if he sweated to help the people who wereaboutto kill him was just a touch toodamned evil. This Alvarezneeded tolearn a lesson.</p><p>\"Nay, \"she whispered back.\"Wait.\"</p><p>Alvarezturnedtoward her again, and sheatfirstthought he had heardher admonishment to One-Eye, but when shetookin hisexpression, shedecided he hadn't; he was justnowturning his interestto the women.</p><p>\"You ladies, ofcourse. ..\" he saidashe walkedtoward where they weregrouped together midship.\"Youshall not die ... right away.\" Hesmiled at Valoree, whowas in front, asif he hadjust done themthe greatest offavors;then hisgaze dropped to her stomach. He grimaced. \"We shall have to dispose of that.\"</p><p>She sawtherage flash overDaniel's face and knewher own no doubtmirrored it, but merely turned herheadaway from Alvarez, avoiding hiseyes to glanceover the position of the various men aboard her ship, then toward the Spanish vessel and the sea between.The small dinghy they had used to bring the first load of cutthroats overwashalfwaybetweenthe ships, headingback for reinforcements.</p><p>She caught movement out of the cornerof her eye, andturned backin time tosee Alvarezcatch Helen by the arm and drag her againsthis chest.</p><p>\"You are a pretty little thing.Youcan entertain me personally, si? \" Alvarez told the girl, chuckling as she began to struggle againsthim.</p><p>\"I donotthink so, \"Valoreeansweredpulling hercutlass out andslidingit againsthis throat. \"Not rightnow.\"</p><p>If thepiratecaptain was startled to suddenly find himself on thebusiness end ofa sword, he managedto hide it well; heeven smiled as he regardedher.</p><p>\"A woman withspunk, \"he commented, apparently amused by the situation.He nodded back towardwhere Daniel stoodstiff andsilent besidetheunconsciousHenry.\"Hiswife? \"</p><p>Valoree nodded silently.</p><p>\"Well, you are too much woman for him. I will showyou what areal man is like, yes? \"</p><p>He released Helen then, and Valoree tensed to see what he would donext whenexplosions rang out nearly directly behind her. The cannons, of course. It seemed One-Eyehad understood her emphasis on theword now.She hadbeen so distracted, she hadn'theard orsmelledthe burning fuses. She saw shock suffuse the pirate captain's face, thenunderstandingas he realized why the women hadbeenstanding where they had, andwhat they had been hidingwiththeir many skirts.There was a second set of boomsas the cannonballs foundtheir target.</p><p>Ahorrible rending sound rang out, and everyone turnedto see themain mast of the Spanish craftsuddenly crash ontoits deck.</p><p>The screams of its sailors were drowned out, however, by the roarof Valoree'sown crew. They began pouring out of every doorandhole in theValor and leaping from beneathcanvases laid over apparent cargo.One fellow even rose straightup out of anempty barrel, its lidflying off as if under the impact of an explosion. The deck suddenly crawled with men, all releasing bloodcurdling screeches.</p><p>Valoreeturned back to Avarez, aware as shedidthat Daniel was approachingthe man from behind.But the satisfied smile on herface died, replacedwithshock asa movementtwisted the kerchief at the pirate's throat, revealing the top of a scar. A buzzing suddenlyfillingherears, she reachedouttosnatchthe kerchief away. Her eyes glazed over with a combination of rage and horroras she saw the questionmark-shapedscar at the base of the man's throat. She could hearJeremy's raspy breathin her ear again, could see hisbloody body she'd held inher young arms.</p><p>\"A question-mark-shaped scar ... throat. Spanish bastard...</p><p>ohhh, \" hehad said ina gasp. She hadthought hewas callingthe man a name, then gasping in pain. But, nay, he had beennaming the ship. Dear Lord, all this time - Asecond setof explosionsshook herout of her shock intime to see Alvarez raise a pistol towardher.Her eyes widened atthe sight ofitand the man'sother hand reachingfor her, ignoringthe cutlass at his throat, but before she could react, the pirate suddenly stiffened. Valoree never heardthe shot; her ears were still ringing from the boom of the Valor's cannons. She just saw the way Alvarez's eyesdilated, painand surprise flashing across hisface; then a thin trickle of bloodspilled from the cornerof his mouth. Hestumbled forward, falling againsther.Valoree tried to step away, but her feet tangled up in her skirtsinher hurry to avoid him. Shestumbled, andwould have fallen with the manif theother women hadn't caught her, butthey did and held her up as he went down.</p><p>Daniel lowered the flintlock he had used to shoot Alvarez.</p><p>Dropping the spentweapon to the deck, he reached inside his now open waistcoat for the second pistol he had stowedinthe top of his breeches and moved quickly forward, prepared to shoot the managain. Butone glance at the pirate captain told him therewas no need. The man was dead.Daniel's gaze slid to his wife then, and concern filledhim at her pallor.</p><p>\"Valoree? \" heasked taking her in his arms andholding herstiff body close, \"Are youall right? \"</p><p>She nodded silently in response, but he could feel her tremble in his arms. Hefrowned as heheld herclose, his gaze shifting questioningly to the other women. Blank confusion and small shrugs were his only answer. None of them knew what was wrong.</p><p>\"Histhroat!\"</p><p>Daniel glanced around to see that Henrywas up and walking about, assisted by Meg. The oldermanloweredthe hand that had beenrubbingthe side of his head, then pointed to Alvarez. \"The scar.\"</p><p>Daniel glanced down at the villain's throat, confused.Squinting at the scar atthe base of the dead pirate's neck, hesaw that it looked very much like a question mark. At that, he stiffened, his gaze shooting back to Valoree. \"Your brother's murderer? \" he askedincredulously.</p><p>Nodding silently, Valoree stared at the man, watching unmovingas his blood seeped out, staining the deck.</p><p>\"Well, \"Henrysaid after a moment. \"Whenthis bastard's ship was spotted, I figuredthat we might be havingthat same bad luck thatweran across in London. But it seemsyouwereright after all, Captain.\"</p><p>When Valoreetoreher gaze from the pirate'scorpse to give himaquestioning look, the quartermaster shrugged slightly. He winced asthemovement caused pain from his wounded head, but he explained. \" 'Tweren't bad luck at all.Wewon.\" His mouth curved into abiggrinas he spoke, then he added more solemnly, \"And this here aboutcloses the door onthe past. Don't it? We vowed for life and vengeance, and Jeremy now'sgot it. Hecan resteasy.\"</p><p>\"Aye. Thathe can, \" Valoree agreed, and Danielcouldhear that she wasfighting tears. He knew that she would nevercry in front of her men, butalsothat this moment meantvery muchto her.</p><p>\"Captain? \" One-Eye'svoice broke in.</p><p>\"Aye? \" Valoree answered at the same time as Daniel. He squeezed her arm, giving him her strength - if she wanted it.</p><p>\"Whatdo you want we should dowith the pirates? \"thefirst mate asked. Daniel stiffened as he waited for Valoree's decision.</p><p>Thesewere the men who had murdered her brother.Would she resist avenging herself uponthem?</p><p>His wife stared blankly at One-Eye for amoment, thenglanced over the deckof theValor II, takingin the factthat every last Spaniard waslying on the deck. Those foolishenoughto fight had been killed or injured, and thosewho hadsurrenderedatonce hadbeenorderedto lie ontheir stomachs on thedeck. They were now guarded by several of her grim-faced men. Her gaze slid over toward theBastardo. With satisfaction, she saw thatit was sinking fast.\"Is the dinghystillafloat? \" she asked.</p><p>One-Eyeraised aneyebrow. \"Aye.\"</p><p>\"Then throw them over. Those still alive can swim to the dinghy.Thosedead\" - she shrugged with disinterest - \"let the sea have.\"</p><p>Daniel remained silent, onlynodding in mute agreement. Then heswept Valoree into his arms.</p><p>\"You are in charge, One-Eye, \" Valoree announced as he headed forthecabins with herinhis arms. \"Clean the ship ofthis slop, thenhead us for Ainsley.

He began to disrobe. \"What are you doing? \"</p><p>\"Getting out of these damn clothes. I feel like a dandy in them.\"</p><p>Valoree grinned. \"You don't look like a dandy in them. If anything, my lord, I think pink emphasizesyour manliness.\"</p><p>Daniel gruntedashe stepped out of the awfulknee breeches, leaving onlythe pink hose and white linen shirt. \"Somehow I do notthink Alvarezagreed with you.\"</p><p>\"Alvarez was nota woman, \" she murmured, herfacestiffening slightlyat thename. The man would be a rawtopic for quite a while.</p><p>\"What did you mean, my plan worked?

When he knelt accommodatingly before her, she captured his face in her handsand pressed asweet kiss to his lips.</p><p>\"Aye, that, mylord husband, \"she murmured, breaking the kiss before he could deepen it. \"Thank you for recognizing my weakness and helping me to overcome it.\"</p><p>\"Fear is not weakness, Valoree, \"he responded.\"Only afool does not feelfear.\"</p><p>\"Then thank you for being my strength today, for helping me to do what had tobe done.\" shesaidsoftly. Her fingers slippedfrom hisface tofall to his shoulders, and Daniel claspedher face in his much larger hands.</p><p>\"Today and always, Valoree. Whether dead or alive. I love you.\"</p> <p>Her eyes filled with tears athisgentle proclamation, and she tried to turn herface away.</p><p>\"Nay, donot try to hide fromme, \" he murmured, holding her face firmlyin his hands andcatching the first tear that slidfrom one eye with the tip of his thumb. \"Please. Never hide your feelings from me. Not your fear, not your pain, and not your love.\"</p><p>She went stillat thelast word, and he sighed and lowered his own head. \"You give me your passion, Valoree, and it is beautiful.Your anger, your laughter.Your lovemaking isfreer andmore impassioned than that ofany woman Ihave known, but I want more. I loveyou.\"</p><p>Valoree felt guilt swampher at those words.She had known for some time that sheloved Daniel, buttheopportunity to say so hadneverreallycome.</p><p>Ah, whowas she kidding? The truth was that she had been afraid to saythose words. Some part of her had feared that if she admitted herfeelings shemight lose this man as she had lost her mother, her father and herbrother. Until today, she hadnever feared dying or being injured; she had feared living. She had fearedcaring and losing those she cared for.It wastime to stop being a coward, time togiveDaniel what he so freely gave her.</p><p>Love.</p> <p>She opened hermouth todojust that, then paused to bite her lipin pain. Herstomach had suddenlycramped. Itwas notthe firstspasm she had suffered through today, but it did seem a lot more violent than those that had been tighteningher stomach sincethe Bastardo had beenspotted.Of course, that distraction might have madethose earliercontractionsseem lesssevere....</p><p>She forgotthe pain briefly as Daniel raised his head and caught the expression on her face. She knew at once he was misinterpreting her reaction. He probably thought she was unsettledby the thought of voicing herlove for him.</p><p>When he started to pull away, she caught at his shirt, determinedtotellhim what heneeded tohear. Hisexpression turned hopeful asshe opened her mouth, but all Valoreemanaged toget outwas agarbled, \"I-ugh-oh, \" asshe was struck by another cramp.She couldfeelher blood draining from herface, and she bit her lip viciously to keep from cryingout with the pain.</p><p>\"Well, good Lord, \"Daniel said snippily.\"There's no need to looksopained atthe idea.\"He tried topull away. \"Iamgoing to change and go back on deck, make sure everything isall right.\"</p><p>\"Nay, \" Valoree gasped, refusing to let him go. Seeing his building impatience, she felt her own snap. Suddenly she was furious athim, both for the painshewas suffering thanks to his child, and at the fact that he somehow hadn't yet grasped the situation. \"I - oh!\"</p><p>\"Do not trouble yourselfover my feelings. I shall be fine, \" he said icily, trying to disengage herfromhis shirt.</p><p>That only managed to makeValoree morefurious. \"Daniel!\"</p><p>she snapped asthelabor pain finally eased.</p> <p>\"What? \" he snapped back, though they were noseto nose.</p><p>Valoreeglaredat himbriefly, then snarled, \"Oh, forheaven's sake!I love you. Allright? I love you! Are you happy? \"</p><p>He stopped trying to removeher hands. \"What? \"</p><p>\"What? \" she repeatedwitha shriek as another spasm came.</p><p>\"Areyou deafnowas well? Youwanted me to say it, andIsaid it! Now - \" She paused on an indrawn breath as another contractionstruck. Groaning, shesankback down onto the bed.</p><p>Rolling into afetal position away fromhim, shefacedthe wallin misery, herconcentration taken up by the pain.</p><p>Her husband immediately crawled ontothesmallbed behind her, molding himself to her spoon-style andwrapping hisarms about her. He pressed a kiss toherneck. \"Iam satisfied.And I am suresomeday you mayeven say that without sounding so angry about it. But for now, an angry admission will do.\" He whispered that by her ear, then nibbled gently at the lobe.</p><p>Nudging himself against her, he said, \"I cannot wait until this babe is born and wecan make loveagain. Itfeels likeforever since Ihavefelt yourwarmth wrappedaround me.\"</p><p>\"Aye? Well, it won't be muchtoo long, \"she said archlyand felt him stiffen.</p><p>\"Do you not missmy lovemaking? \" he asked with a bit of pique.</p><p>\"My lord, at this moment, I loatheyour lovemaking.\"</p><p>He stiffenedatthat, his mouth droppingopen. \"Youwhat? \"</p><p>Reaching back, she grabbed his hand and pulled it around, pressing itflat to herstomach.Daniel went stiff ashe felt her stomach shift and tighten.</p><p>\"What is that? What - \"</p><p>\"Iam in labor, mylord, \"she explained dryly.</p><p>\"What? \" He was off the bed in a heartbeat, and Valoree glanced overher shoulder at him with apained laugh.</p><p>\"It isa bit latefor that, my lord, \" she pointed out. \"You should have donea little more leapingout and a little lessleapingin several months ago to avoid this.\"</p><p>Daniel gapedather. \"How longhas this been goingon? \"</p><p>Sighing, sheshook herhead. \"I felt a bit odd when Igot upthis morning, but thought it would go away. It didn't. It justgot a little stronger andharderas timepassed. But it didn't reallyset in until alltheexcitementwas over.\"</p><p>\"You mean youwere in labor thewhole time the pirates were...\" He paused at her nod and stared around blankly fora moment, then shook his head.</p><p>\"Well, makeitstop. You cannot have the baby hereona ship with abunch of pirates. We need amidwifeand - \"</p><p>\"Oh, aye, of course, \" Valoree snapped, then peered downat her stomach. \"Did you hear that, little Jermina? Yourfather says to stopnow.You should waittill we reach Ainsley and hecan find a midwife.\" She paused, cocking her head slightly, then nodded.\"I see.\" Turning, she smiledat Daniel. \"Shesays to sod off. She's coming now.\"</p><p>Daniel's eyes widened inthe horror of a sudden realization.</p><p>\"Oh, God. I amgoing to have two of you on my hands!\"</p><p>\"Aye. Lucky you. Now do you think you could go call the women in here? Maybe one of them wouldbe a bit moreuseful than yourself at the moment, \" she suggested.</p><p>Valoree'shusbandwas outthe door inaheartbeat, bare-arsed inhis linenshirt, shrieking at the top of hislungs that she wasin labor and forMeg tocome quickly. There was aroar as the men andwomen all exclaimedin mingledexcitement and horror, then the sound ofa stampede aseveryone raced acrossthedeck, eager tobe in on the action. There was nodoubt in Valoree's mind that Henry and therest ofhermen would insiston being in on this.</p><p>Anywhy not, she thought. They had been a partof everyother aspect ofher life. No doubtthey would all try to vote on what to name the babe, too.</p><p>Sighing, Valoree rubbed her belly soothingly. \"You shall love your father, Jermina.Mayhap almostas much as I do.\" Then she laid her head onthebed and triedto relax as she awaitedthe arrival of the people who loved her. This was such a large family to replace the few she had lost, she thought. And with that, Valoree suddenly realized that sometimes curses created blessings. </p> </body></html>"]
