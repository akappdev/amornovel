I jerked upright, peeled a wayward bit of paper from my nose, and stared at the phone blankly. Then the caller ID registered and I groaned. The call was coming from Madeline Hunter, the bitch who was not only in charge of the Directorate of Other Races, but was a leading member of the high vampire council, too. She was also the very last person in this world\u2014or the next\u2014who I wanted to hear from right now.</p><p>Unfortunately, given that she was now my boss, she was not someone I could\u2014or should\u2014ignore.</p><p>I hit the vid-phone\u2019s ANSWER button and said in a less-than-polite voice, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>She paused, and something flashed in the green of her eyes. A darkness that spoke of anger. But all she said was, \u201cI have a task for you.\u201d</p><p>A curse rose in my throat, but I somehow managed to leash it. \u201cWhat sort of task?\u201d</p><p>But even as I asked the question, I knew. There was only one reason for her to be ringing me, and that was to track down an escapee from hell. She had not only the Directorate at her command, but a stableful of Cazadors\u2014the high council\u2019s elite killing force\u2014and they dealt with all manner of murderers and madmen on an everyday basis.</p><p>I even had one following me around astrally, reporting my every move back to Hunter. Trust was not high on her list of good traits.</p><p>Not that I think she had all that many good traits.</p> <p>\u201cA close friend of mine was murdered last night.\u201d Her voice held very little emotion, and she was scarier because of it. \u201cI want you to investigate.\u201d</p><p>Hunter had friends. Imagine that. I scrubbed a hand across my eyes and said somewhat wearily, \u201cLook, as much as I absolutely adore working for you, the reality is the Directorate is far better equipped to handle this sort of murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Directorate hasn\u2019t your experience with the denizens of hell,\u201d she snapped. \u201cNor do they have a reaper at their beck and call.\u201d</p><p>So I\u2019d been right\u2014it was an escapee from hell. Not great news, but I guess it was my fault that these things were about in the world. It might have become my task to find the three lost keys that controlled the gates to heaven and hell, but the only one I\u2019d managed to find so far had almost immediately been stolen from me. As a result, the first gate to hell had been permanently opened by person or persons unknown, and the stronger demons were now coming through. Not in great numbers\u2014not yet\u2014but that was thanks only to the fact that the remaining gates were still shut.</p><p>Of course, given the choice, I\u2019d rather not find the other keys. After all, if no one knew where they were, then they couldn\u2019t be used to either permanently open or close the gates. But it wasn\u2019t like I had a choice, not anymore. It was either find them or die. Or, when it came to the choice given to me by my father\u2014who was one of the Raziq, the rogue Aedh priests who\u2019d helped create the keys, and also the man responsible for having them stolen\u2014watch my friends die.</p><p>\u201cAzriel isn\u2019t at my beck and call,\u201d I said, unable to hide the annoyance in my voice. \u201cHe just wants the keys, the same as you and the council.\u201d</p> <p>Not to mention the Raziq and my goddamn father.</p><p>\u201cThis takes priority over finding the keys.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>That darkness in her eyes got stronger. \u201cSince I walked into my lover\u2019s house and discovered his corpse.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her for a moment, seeing little in the way of true emotion in either her expression or her voice. And yet her need for revenge, to rend and tear, was so strong that even through the vid-phone I could almost taste it. That sort of fury, I thought with a shiver, was not something I ever wanted aimed my way.</p><p>Yet, despite knowing it wasn\u2019t sensible, I couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cI\u2019m betting the rest of the council wouldn\u2019t actually agree with that assessment.\u201d</p><p>I think if she could have jumped down the phone line and throttled me, she would have. As it was, she bared her teeth, her canines elongating just a little, and said in a soft voice, \u201cYou should not be worried about what the rest of the council is thinking right now.\u201d</p><p>The only time I\u2019d stop worrying about the rest of the council was when she achieved her goal of supreme control over the lot of them. Until then, they were as big a threat to me as she was.</p> <p>But I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to actually come out and say that to her. \u201cHunting for your friend\u2019s killer is going to steal precious time away from the search for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d she cut in coolly, \u201cjust where, exactly, is your search for the keys?\u201d</p><p>Nowhere, that was where. My father might have given me clues for the next key\u2019s location, but deciphering those was another matter entirely. We figured it was somewhere in the middle of Victoria\u2019s famous golden triangle, but given that particular region encompassed more than nine thousand square kilometers of land, that left us with a vast area to explore. It was fucking frustrating, but all Azriel and I could do was keep on searching and hope that sooner or later fate gave us a goddamn break.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably in the same place as your search for my mother\u2019s killer.\u201d</p><p>The minute the words left my mouth, I regretted them. Hunter really wasn\u2019t someone I needed to antagonize, and yet it was her damn promise to help find my mother\u2019s killer that had made me agree to work for her and the council in the first place. And while I\u2019d kept my end of the bargain, she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>For several very long seconds, she didn\u2019t reply. She simply stared at me, her expression remote and her eyes colder than the Antarctic. Then she said, voice so soft it was barely audible, \u201cTread warily, Risa dearest.\u201d</p><p>I gulped. I couldn\u2019t help it. Death glared at me through the phone\u2019s screen, and she scared the hell out of me.</p><p>I took a slow, deep breath, but it really didn\u2019t help ease the sense of dread or the sudden desire to just give it all the fuck away. To let fate deal her cards and accept whatever might come my way\u2014be that death at Hunter\u2019s hand or someone else\u2019s.</p><p>I was sick of it. Sick of the threats, sick of the fighting, sick of a search that seemed to have no end and no possibility of our winning.</p><p>Death is not a solution of any kind, Azriel said, his mind voice sharp.</p><p>I looked up from the phone\u2019s screen. He appeared in front of my desk, the heat of his presence playing gently through my being, a sensation as intimate as the caress of fingers against skin. Longing shivered through me.</p><p>Reapers, like the Aedh, weren\u2019t actually flesh beings\u2014although they could certainly attain that form whenever they wished\u2014but rather beings made of energy who lived on the gray fields, the area that divided earth from heaven and hell. Or the light and dark portals, as they preferred to call them.</p><p>Although I had no idea whether his reaper form would be considered handsome\u2014or even how reapers defined handsome\u2014his human form certainly was. His face was chiseled, almost classical in its beauty, but possessed the hard edge of a man who\u2019d fought many battles. His body held a similar hardness, though his build was more that of an athlete than a weight lifter. Distinctive black tats that resembled the left half of a wing swept around his ribs from underneath his arm, the tips brushing across the left side of his neck.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t a tat. It was a Du\u0161an\u2014a darker, more stylized brother to the lilac one that resided on my left arm\u2014and had been designed to protect us when we walked the gray fields. We had no idea who\u2019d sent them to us, but Azriel suspected it was my father. He was apparently one of the few left in this world\u2014or the next\u2014who had the power to make them.</p><p>Of course, Azriel wasn\u2019t just a reaper, but something far more. He was one of the Mijai, the dark angels who hunted and killed the things that broke free from hell. And they had more than their fair share of work now that the first gate had been opened.</p><p>If you ask me, death is looking more and more the perfect solution when it comes to the keys. My mental voice sounded as weary as my physical one. I wasn\u2019t actually telepathic, but that didn\u2019t matter when it came to my reaper. He could hear my thoughts as clearly as the spoken word.</p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t always a two-way street. Most of the time I heard his thoughts only when it was a deliberate act on his part. If I\u2019m not here to find the damn things, then the world and my friends remain safe.</p><p>He crossed his arms, an action that only emphasized the muscles in his arms and shoulders. Death is no solution. Not for you. Not now.</p><p>And what the hell is that supposed to mean?</p><p>His gaze met mine, his blue eyes\u2014one as vivid and bright as a sapphire, the other as dark as a storm-driven sea\u2014giving little away. It means exactly what it says.</p><p>Great. More riddles. Another thing I really needed right now. I returned my attention to Hunter\u2019s deathlike stare. \u201cHow did your friend die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was restrained, then drained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrained? As in, a vampire-style, all-the-blood-from-the-body draining, or something else?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, and just for a second I saw something close to grief in her eyes. Whoever her friend was, they\u2019d been a lot closer than mere lovers.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen the husk of a fly after a spider has finished with it?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what he looked like. There was nothing left but the dried remains of outer skin. Everything else had been sucked away.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her for a moment, wondering whether I\u2019d heard her right, then swallowed heavily and said, \u201cEverything? As in, blood, bone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood, bone, muscle, intestines, brain. Everything.\u201d Her voice was suddenly fierce. \u201cAs I said, all that remained was the shell of hardened outer skin.\u201d</p><p>A shudder ran through me. I did not want to meet, let alone chase, something that could do that to a body.</p><p>\u201cHow can human skin be hardened into a shell? Or the entire innards of a body be sucked away? It had to be one hell of a wound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, the wound was quite small\u2014two slashes on either side of his abdomen.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cHe did not appear to die in agony. Quite the opposite, in fact.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s some comfort\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d she cut in harshly. \u201cHow is that ever going to be a comfort?\u201d</p><p>I should have known I\u2019d get my head bitten off if I tried sympathy on the bitch. \u201cWhere is his body? And is the Directorate being called in on this?\u201d</p> <p>If they were, it could get tricky. Uncle Rhoan worked for them\u2014he was, in fact, second in charge of the guardian division these days\u2014but he had no idea I was working for Hunter and the council. And I wanted to keep it that way, because the shit would really hit the fan if he and Aunt Riley ever found out. They\u2019d always considered me one of their pack, but that protectiveness had increased when Mom had died. They\u2019d kill me if they knew I\u2019d agreed to work with Hunter\u2014although I now suspected I couldn\u2019t have actually refused to work with her\u2014and once they\u2019d dealt with me, they\u2019d track her down and confront her. And that was a situation that could never end nicely.</p><p>I\u2019d already endangered the lives of too many people I cared about by dragging them into this mad quest for the keys\u2014I didn\u2019t want to make the situation worse in any way.</p><p>\u201cYes, they are,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Jack has been made aware of my wishes in this and will ensure you get first bite at the crime scene.\u201d</p><p>Amusement briefly ran through me, although I doubted her pun had been intentional. \u201cThat really doesn\u2019t help with the problem\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhoan Jenson will not get in the way of this. You are a consultant, nothing more, as far as he is concerned.\u201d</p> <p>I snorted. \u201cA consultant you\u2019re using to hunt and kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And you would do well to remember that you remain alive only as long as the council and I agree on your usefulness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Azriel said, suddenly standing behind me. His closeness had desire stirring, even though I had little enough energy to spare. \u201cYou would do well to remember that any attempt to harm her would be met with even more deadly force.\u201d</p><p>Hunter smiled, but there was nothing pleasant about it. \u201cWe both know you cannot take a life without just cause, reaper, so do not make your meaningless threats to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I have done once, I can do again,\u201d he said, his voice stony. \u201cAnd in this case, as in the last, I would revel in a death taken before its time.\u201d</p><p>Azriel, stop poking the bear. I\u2019ve already antagonized her enough.</p> <p>That is a somewhat absurd statement, given she is clearly vampire, not bear.</p><p>Amusement slithered through me again, as he\u2019d no doubt intended. He\u2019d grown something of a sense of humor of late\u2014which was, according to him, a consequence of spending far too much time in flesh form. Whether that was true or not, I had no idea, but I certainly preferred this more \u201chuman\u201d version to the remote starchiness that had been present when he\u2019d first appeared. You know what I mean.</p><p>Surprisingly, I do. He touched my shoulder, the contact light but somehow possessive. But her threats grow tedious. She must be made aware it gains her nothing.</p><p>Hunter laughed. The sound was harsh and cold, and sent another round of chills down my spine. \u201cReaper, you amuse me. One of these days, when I\u2019m tired of this life, I might just be tempted to take you on.\u201d</p><p>And she was crazy enough to do it, too.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d she continued, \u201cthat time is not now. I will send you my friend\u2019s address, Risa. The Directorate will arrive at his home at four. Please be finished with your initial investigation before then, and report your impressions immediately.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my watch. She\u2019d given me a whole hour. Whoop-de-do. \u201cWhere does he live, and what sort of security system has he got in place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just sent you all his details.\u201d</p> <p>My cell phone beeped almost immediately. I picked it up and glanced at the message. Hunter\u2019s friend\u2014who went by the very German-sounding name of Wolfgang Schmidt\u2014lived in Brighton, a very upmarket suburb near the beach. No surprise there, I guess\u2014I certainly couldn\u2019t imagine her slumming it with the regular folk in places like Broadmeadows or Dandenong.</p><p>I read the rest of the text, then looked up at the main phone\u2019s screen again. \u201cIs the security system just key coded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Wolfgang is\u2014was\u2014a very old-fashioned vampire. He saw no need for anything more than a basic system.\u201d</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, that had gotten him killed. While there was no electronic security system on earth that would actually stop a demon, it wasn\u2019t beyond the realms of possibility that something other than a demon had killed her vampire friend.</p><p>I mean, no one could ever be one hundred percent right all the time. Not even Hunter\u2014although I\u2019m sure she\u2019d claim otherwise. And really, what sane person would argue the point with her when she wasn\u2019t?</p><p>Certainly not me.</p><p>And yet you do, Azriel commented, a trace of amusement in his mental tone.</p><p>I think we\u2019ve already established I\u2019m not always sane. To Hunter, I added, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have\u201d\u2014she hesitated, and an almost predatory gleam touched her gaze\u2014\u201ca meeting that needs to be attended.\u201d</p><p>If that gleam was any indication, the so-called meeting involved bloodshed of some kind. After all, the council\u2014and Hunter\u2014considered it perfectly acceptable to punish those who broke the rules by allowing them to be ripped to shreds by younger vampires.</p><p>Still, it seemed odd that she wasn\u2019t hanging around to garner my impressions, especially if she cared for the dead man as much as I suspected.</p><p>Like many who have lived for centuries, she has strayed from the path of humanity, Azriel commented. For her, emotions are fleeting, tenuous things.</p><p>But not all those who live so long find that fate. Uncle Quinn\u2019s not far off Hunter in age, and he\u2019s as emotional as anyone. Although he could also be as stoic and cold as any of them when the urge took him.</p><p>He is one of the few exceptions. It is very rare to live so long and hang on to humanity.</p><p>I glanced at him. Does that apply to reapers as well?</p><p>Reapers are not human, so we can hardly hang on to what we do not have.</p><p>But you are capable of emotions.</p><p>Again a smile touched his thoughts, and it shimmered through me like a warm summer breeze. Yes, we are, especially if we are foolish enough to remain in flesh too long.</p><p>In other words, I wasn\u2019t to read too much into what he said or did while he wore flesh, because when all this was over, we\u2019d both go our separate ways and life would return to normal.</p><p>I wanted that. I really did.</p><p>But at the same time, it was becoming harder and harder to imagine life without Azriel in it.</p><p>He made no comment on that particular thought, and I returned my attention to Hunter. \u201cOnce I\u2019ve checked out the crime scene, what then? Are you going to tell me more about him, or am I expected to work on this case completely blind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpressions first,\u201d she said, and hung up.</p><p>\u201cFuck you and the broom you rode in on,\u201d I muttered, then leaned back in my chair. \u201cWell, this totally sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn unfortunate consequence of agreeing to work with someone like Hunter is being at her beck and call.\u201d He spun my chair around, then squatted in front of me and took my hands in his. His fingers were warm against mine, his touch comforting. \u201cBut there is little we can do until your mother\u2019s killer is caught.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cEven if we do find her killer, do you really think she\u2019s going to let me go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know the answer to that. But once the killer is caught, we will be in a better position to deny her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d And maybe not. After all, Hunter wouldn\u2019t have any qualms about threatening the lives of my friends if it meant securing long-term obedience.</p><p>\u201cIt does not pay to worry about things that may never happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I leaned forward and rested my forehead against his as I closed my eyes. \u201cI guess we\u2019d better get moving. I want to be out of that house before the Directorate gets there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wish me to transport us there?\u201d</p><p>His breath washed across my lips and left them tingling. Half of me wanted to kiss him, and the other half just wanted him to wrap his arms around me and hold me like he never intended to let go. Unfortunately, neither was particularly practical right now.</p><p>And it was a sad statement about my life when desire gave way to practicality.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be faster if you do.\u201d While I could shift into my Aedh form and travel there under my own steam, my energy levels were still low and I really didn\u2019t want to push it. Not yet, not for something like this.</p><p>He rose, dragging me up with him, then wrapped his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I broke from his grasp and moved around the desk, striding out of my office and down to the storeroom at the other end of the hall. We kept all of RYT\u2019s\u2014which was the name of the caf\u00e9 I owned with two of my best friends, Ilianna and Tao\u2014nonperishable items up here, which meant not only things like spare plates, cutlery, and serviettes, but also serving gloves. It was the latter I needed, simply because the last thing I wanted was to be leaving fingerprints around Wolfgang\u2019s house for the Directorate and Uncle Rhoan to find. I tore open a box, shoved a couple of the clear latex gloves into the pocket of my jeans, then headed back into the office. I grabbed my cell phone from the desk and let myself be wrapped in the warmth of Azriel\u2019s arms again. \u201cOkay, go for it.\u201d</p><p>The words had barely left my mouth when his power surged through me, running along every muscle, every fiber, until my whole body sang to its tune. Until it felt like there was no me and no him, just the sum of us\u2014energy beings with no flesh to hold us in place.</p><p>All too quickly, my office was replaced by the gray fields. Once upon a time the fields had been little more than thick veils and shadows\u2014a zone where things not sighted on the living plane gained substance. But the more time I spent in Azriel\u2019s company, the more \u201creal\u201d the fields became. This time, the ethereal, beautiful structures that filled this place somehow seemed more solid, and instead of the reapers being little more than wispy, luminous shapes, I could now pick out faces. They glowed with life and energy, reminding me of the drawings of angels so often seen in scriptures\u2014beautiful and yet somehow alien. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then the fields were gone, and we regained substance. And though it involved no effort on my part, it still left my head spinning.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said, expression concerned, \u201care not recovering as quickly as you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a hard few weeks.\u201d I stepped back to study the building in front of us, even though all I really wanted to do was remain in his arms. That, however, was not an option. Not now and certainly not in the future. Not on any long-term, forever-type basis, anyway.</p> <p>Which, if I was being at all honest with myself, totally sucked. But then, I had a very long history of falling for inappropriate men. Take my former Aedh lover, Lucian, for instance.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not,\u201d Azriel said, voice grim as he touched my back and then lightly waved me forward.</p><p>Amusement teased my lips. \u201cHe\u2019s out of my life, Azriel, and no longer a threat to whatever plans you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not the threat to me I worry about,\u201d he cut in, voice irritated.</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cWell, he can hardly threaten me, given he and everyone else wants the damn keys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis need for the keys did not stop his attempt to strangle you.\u201d</p><p>Well, no, it hadn\u2019t. But I suspected Lucian\u2019s actions had been little more than a momentary lapse of control\u2014one he would have snapped out of before he\u2019d actually killed me. Although, to be honest, I hadn\u2019t actually been so certain of that when his hands had been around my neck.</p><p>I opened the ornate metal gate and walked up the brick pathway toward the front door. Wolfgang\u2019s house was one of the increasingly rare redbrick Edwardian houses that used to take pride of place in the leafy bayside suburb. The front garden was small but meticulously tended, as was the house itself. I pulled out the gloves as I walked up the brick pathway toward the ornate front door, then said, \u201cLucian is no longer our problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think that, you are a fool.\u201d</p><p>And I wasn\u2019t a fool. Not really. I just kept hoping that if I believed something hard enough, it might actually come true. I slipped the gloves on and switched the discussion back to my health. It was far safer ground.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to recover instantly, Azriel. I\u2019m flesh and blood, not\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are half Aedh,\u201d he cut in again. His voice was still testy. But then, he always did sound that way after a discussion about Lucian, whom he hated with a surprising amount of passion for someone who claimed it was only his flesh form that gave him emotions. \u201cMore so, given what Malin did to you.\u201d</p><p>Malin was the woman in charge of the Raziq, my father\u2019s former lover, and a woman scorned. My father had not only betrayed her trust by stealing the keys from under her nose, but he had also refused to give her the child she\u2019d wanted. Instead, for reasons known only to himself, he\u2019d gone to my mother and produced me.</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d My voice was perhaps sharper than it should have been. \u201cYou never actually explained what she did.\u201d</p><p>And I certainly couldn\u2019t remember\u2014she\u2019d made sure of that.</p><p>He hesitated, his expression giving little away. \u201cNo. And I have already said more than I should.\u201d</p><p>Because of my father. Because whatever Malin did had somehow altered me\u2014and not just by altering the device the Raziq had previously woven into the fabric of my heart, which had been designed to notify them when I was in my father\u2019s presence.</p><p>My sigh was one of frustration, but I knew better than to argue with Azriel\u2014at least when he had that face on. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t alter the fact that a body\u2014even one that is half energy\u2014can run on empty for only so long.\u201d</p><p>A fact he knew well enough\u2014his own lack of energy was the reason he\u2019d been unable to heal me lately. Of course, reapers didn\u2019t \u201crecharge\u201d by eating or sleeping or any of the other things humans did, but rather by mingling energies\u2014which was the reaper version of sex\u2014with those who possessed a harmonious frequency. Unfortunately for them, such compatibility wasn\u2019t widespread, and Azriel\u2019s recharge companion had been killed long ago while escorting a soul through the dark portals. The good news was that he could apparently recharge through me\u2014though why he could do this when I wasn\u2019t a full-energy being, but rather half werewolf, he refused to say. Just as he\u2019d so far refused to recharge. Up until very recently, he\u2019d been more worried about the threat of assimilation\u2014which was when a reaper became so tuned to a human, their life forces merged and they became as one\u2014than the lowering of his ability to heal me.</p> <p>All that had changed when I\u2019d almost died after a fight on the astral plane. Because, as I\u2019d already noted, without me, no one could find the keys. My father\u2019s blood had been used in the creation of the keys, and only someone of his blood could find them.</p><p>Of course, making the decision to recharge and actually doing it were two entirely different things. Especially when I barely had enough energy to function, let alone have sex.</p><p>Which was another sad statement about the state of my life.</p><p>I punched the security code into the discreet system sitting to the left of the doorframe. The device beeped, and the light flicked from red to green. I opened the door but didn\u2019t immediately enter, instead letting the scents within the house flow over me.</p><p>The most obvious was the smell of death, although it wasn\u2019t particularly strong and it certainly didn\u2019t hold the decayed-meat aroma that sometimes accompanied the dead. Underneath that rode less-definable scents. The strongest of these was almost musky but had an edge that somehow seemed . . . alien? It was certainly no smell that I\u2019d ever encountered before, although musk was a common enough scent among shifters.</p><p>Was that what we were dealing with, rather than a demon? I had to hope so, if only because I then had more of a chance of diverting the search to the Directorate.</p><p>The hallway that stretched before us was surprisingly bright and airy and ran the entire length of the house. Several doorways led off it from either side and, down at the very end, double glass sliding doors led out into a rear yard that contained a pool. Like the front yard, both the hallway and the rear yard were meticulous\u2014there didn\u2019t appear to be a leaf out of place, and there certainly wasn\u2019t even the slightest hint of dust on the richly colored floorboards. Whoever looked after this place\u2014be it Wolfgang or hired help\u2014was one hell of a housekeeper.</p><p>I took a cautious step inside, then stopped again, flaring my nostrils to define where the death scent was strongest.</p><p>\u201cThe body lies in the living area down at the far end of this hall,\u201d Azriel said. He was standing so close that his breath tickled the hairs at the nape of my neck.</p><p>I eyed the far end of the hall warily. Why, I had no idea. It wasn\u2019t like Wolfgang\u2019s husked remains would provide any threat. It was just that smell\u2014the oddness of it. \u201cDoes his soul remain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The death was an ordained one.\u201d</p><p>This meant that a reaper had been here to escort him to whichever gate he\u2019d been destined for. It probably would have been comforting news to anyone but Hunter. \u201cDoes that also mean whatever did this isn\u2019t a demon? If this death was meant to be, then surely it can\u2019t be an escapee from hell?\u201d</p><p>He touched my back and gently propelled me forward. My footsteps echoed on the polished boards, the sound like gunshots in the silence. Azriel was ghostlike.</p><p>\u201cWhether this death was the result of an attack from a demon has no bearing on it being ordained or not. If death is meant to find you, there is no avoiding it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich doesn\u2019t actually answer the question of whether or not a demon did this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be either a malevolent spirit or some kind of demon, thanks to the first portal being open.\u201d</p><p>And it was only open thanks to me.</p><p>\u201cThat thanks belongs to us all,\u201d he corrected softly. \u201cIt is a blame that lies with everyone who was involved in that first quest.\u201d</p><p>But in particular, with one.</p><p>He might not have said the words, but they hung in the air regardless. And while it was now very obvious that Lucian had an agenda all his own when it came to the keys, I didn\u2019t think he was responsible for snatching the first one. He\u2019d been as furious as we\u2019d been over its loss.</p><p>Of course, I\u2019d also been sure that he\u2019d never harm me, and his strangulation attempt had certainly proven that wrong. Yet I still believed he didn\u2019t want me dead. Not until the keys were found, anyway.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI thought you said malevolent spirits were of this world rather than from hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would the opening of the first gate affect them in any way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the dark path is a place filled with dark emotions and, with the first gate open, these emotions have begun to filter into this reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>I slowed as I neared the living area and trepidation flared, though I still had no idea what I feared. Maybe it was simply death itself. Or maybe it was just a hangover from the hell of the last few weeks. Between escapee demons, malevolent spirits, and psycho astral travelers, I\u2019d certainly been kept on my toes.</p><p>Or flat on my back, bleeding all over the pavement, as was generally the case.</p><p>\u201cMeaning,\u201d Azriel said softly, \u201cthat it feeds the darker souls, be they human or spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, basically, it\u2019s the beginning of hell on earth?\u201d Two steps and I\u2019d be in the living room. My stomach began twisting into knots. I flexed my fingers and forced reluctant feet forward.</p><p>\u201cBasically, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d As if the weight on my shoulders wasn\u2019t already enough, I now had the sanity of the masses to worry about.</p><p>I entered the living room and saw the body.</p><p>Or rather, the body-shaped parcel.</p><p>Because Hunter had left out one very important fact when she\u2019d described Wolfgang\u2019s death.</p><p>Not only had he been sucked as dry as a fly caught by a spider, but he\u2019d been entangled in the biggest damn spiderweb I\u2019d ever seen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cOh god,\u201d I said, and immediately backed away. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t retreat far, because Azriel was right behind me. I might as well have backed into a concrete wall. \u201cShe could have mentioned some kind of spider got him. I hate spiders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever was responsible for this death was something more than just a spider,\u201d he commented, a slight trace of amusement in his voice.</p> <p>I scowled up at him. \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>He obviously didn\u2019t catch the sarcasm, because he added, \u201cEither that, or this was the work of a multitude of spiders, and the pristine nature of this house precludes that possibility.\u201d</p><p>A multitude of spiders . . . A shudder went through me at the thought. I rubbed my arms and forced my feet forward again. Wolfgang had died lounging comfortably on the well-padded leather sofa that wrapped around the corner of the room. He was fully clothed, though his shirt was undone to his belly button, and his tie and shoes lay on the floor near the coffee table. His feet were crossed at the ankles, and there was a dreamy, relaxed expression frozen on the remains of his face. He\u2019d obviously died totally unaware that anything untoward was happening.</p><p>The web that encased him was anchored to the floor near his feet, then spun up his legs and along the entire length of his torso, enclosing his arms and his body in a fine, transparent filament. Two tears on either side of his belly button indicated the puncture site and, if the size of those wounds was anything to go by, we were dealing with a damn big spider.</p><p>Another shudder ran through me. I took a deep breath that did little to ease the growing sense of horror, then stopped near his feet and flared my nostrils, drawing in the air and sorting through the scents. That odd, alien aroma was stronger here, but it didn\u2019t appear to be coming from the body itself but rather the surrounding air. It was as if the scent of the creature had so heavily perfumed the room that it lingered long after it had gone.</p> <p>I hesitated, then tentatively prodded the silvery casing with a stiffened finger. It wasn\u2019t sticky as I\u2019d expected, and felt a little like plastic\u2014almost as if it had hardened in the air. I leaned a little closer to inspect the wounds. Other than a slight discoloring around the edges of the punctures, there was little blood, but the wounds themselves suggested the creature\u2019s fangs were at least as thick as my fist.</p><p>It was going to take more than one can of fly spray to get rid of this damn spider.</p><p>I closed my eyes, took another deep, shuddering breath, then said, \u201cWhat do you know about spiderlike spirits or demons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe there is a spirit known as the Jor\u00f5gumo, but I know nothing about them.\u201d Azriel moved around the coffee table, then stopped opposite me, his eyes slightly narrowed as he studied Wolfgang\u2019s remains. Power shimmered through the air, sharp and almost bitter in the stillness. It died just as quickly, and his gaze met mine. \u201cThere is no brain left in this body, so I cannot read what memories might have remained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter did say everything had been sucked away.\u201d My gaze rose to Wolfgang\u2019s face, which was free of the transparent net. \u201cIs there any way you can find out more about Jor\u00f5gumos? I mean, I can Google them, but I can\u2019t imagine Google being a reliable source of information when it comes to facts about spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can ask, but Mijai fight demons, not spirits.\u201d</p> <p>Meaning I\u2019d probably have to rely on earthbound resources. Perhaps the Brindle witches could help. I frowned. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t his body collapsed in on itself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot say. I am not an expert on spirits, let alone spiders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when it comes to spiders, my knowledge stops at either avoiding them, or killing the fuckers on sight.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my watch. Ten minutes gone and, so far, we\u2019d discovered nothing Hunter hadn\u2019t already known. I looked around the room, hoping there was something that jumped up and screamed clue. As usual, fate wasn\u2019t being overly helpful.</p><p>I spotted his jacket flung over one of the kitchen chairs and walked over to pick it up. His keys were in the left front pocket, and his wallet was in one of the inside ones. Opening the latter revealed his driver\u2019s license, several platinum credit cards, and at least five hundred dollars in cash. Robbery obviously wasn\u2019t a motive\u2014which was an odd thought when related to spiders or spirits, but perhaps not if we were dealing with some sort of shifter.</p><p>Frowning, I put his wallet back and went through the rest of his pockets. The only other thing to be found was a business card for some place called Dark Soul. I flicked it over, but the back was empty. God, I thought, this had better not be another fucking blood whore club. I\u2019d had more than enough of them lately to last a lifetime. I placed the card back where I\u2019d found it, then did a search of the rest of the house. As I expected, I found absolutely nothing.</p><p>This was useless\u2014and I told Hunter as much when I went outside to call her back.</p><p>\u201cI do not care what you think in regards to the viability of this task,\u201d she snapped. The vid-screen had been turned off at her end, and I couldn\u2019t help but be a little thankful for that. I had the distinct impression her expression would not have been pleasant. \u201cI merely want your impressions of the kill.\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t see the point of that, either, given my impressions were unlikely to be any different from hers, but I took a deep breath and said, \u201cHe was killed by something that appears to have spiderlike tendencies. There\u2019s a musky scent in the air that is not dissimilar to the musk of shifters, but if it is a shifter, then it\u2019s one I\u2019ve not come across before.\u201d My voice was as sharp as hers, which probably wasn\u2019t wise given all the shit I\u2019d said earlier, but then, she was on the other end of the phone rather than in person, so she could hardly smack me down. Not immediately, anyway. \u201cI didn\u2019t find anything that hinted at who or what else might have been here, but Azriel said there are spider spirits known as Jor\u00f5gumos, so it\u2019s possible we\u2019re dealing with one of those. I did find a business card for someplace called Dark Soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is\u2014was\u2014one of his favorite music venues. He\u2019d been planning to go there last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was he carrying one of their business cards if he went there regularly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Color me shocked, I wanted to snap, but wisely resisted the urge. \u201cSo he might have picked up his killer there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. Dark Soul is not a vampire venue. It caters to all races who enjoy alternative music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t a human who killed him.\u201d Not unless Spider-Man was fact rather than fiction.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cWolfgang was a powerful vampire. He would not have been taken easily by anyone\u2014or any race.\u201d</p><p>And yet he\u2019d sat there and allowed himself to be bound by a web and then sucked dry. I rubbed my arms against the chill that stole across my skin. How could anyone\u2014powerful or not\u2014allow something like that?</p><p>\u201cWhich means either he was drugged, or there was some form of magic involved.\u201d And if it was the former, was there enough of him left to find a trace of it?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hunter\u2019s voice still held little emotion, yet it hinted at a fury so deep it scared the hell out of me. \u201cWhich is why I wanted you to investigate. Whatever did this was not of this world. I\u2019m sure of it. I want you to hunt it down, but do not kill it. That pleasure I reserve for myself.\u201d</p><p>Well, I wasn\u2019t about to argue over that particular order. \u201cIf we can find this thing, it\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you had better find it, trust me.\u201d She paused, as if waiting for a comment, but what the hell was I supposed to say to a threat like that? After a moment, she continued. \u201cI will arrange for you to talk to Dark Soul\u2019s owner and view their security tapes. Perhaps we can identify who\u2014if anyone\u2014he was there with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re hardly likely to talk to me, given I\u2019m not anything official\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will be fixed,\u201d she cut in. \u201cKeep me informed.\u201d</p><p>She hung up again. My fingers clenched the phone so tightly, my knuckles went white, and it was all I could do not to throw the damn thing and then stomp all over it in frustration.</p><p>Azriel plucked it from my fingers. \u201cTemper tantrums, as I believe you would call such an action, will do no good. And it may well destroy a perfectly usable device.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cHave you ever had a good temper tantrum?\u201d</p><p>Amusement lurked in the rich depths of his mismatched blue eyes. \u201cNo. But I do believe that the longer I reside in your presence, the more it becomes a possibility.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cYou could be right. And for future reference, a well-timed temper tantrum is a very good form of stress release.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning, I\u2019m wrong in believing there might be more pleasing alternatives than throwing a tantrum?\u201d</p><p>I arched an eyebrow and stepped a little closer, but any reply I might have made was cut short as my phone rang. A quick look showed that it was Stane\u2014Tao\u2019s cousin, and a black marketer who just happened to be able to hack into any computer system ever created. It was an ability I\u2019d made full use of when it came to Hunter\u2019s cases as well as the search for the keys. I half thought about ignoring the call just to continue the gently teasing conversation with Azriel, but I knew Stane wouldn\u2019t be ringing unless he\u2019d uncovered something important.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, by way of greeting. \u201cWhat\u2019s the latest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see,\u201d he said, the rich tones of his voice more gravelly than usual. He\u2019d obviously been hitting the online gaming hard again. \u201cMy mother is insisting I meet the daughter of her best friend and has in fact arranged a double date for this evening. And I believe I have found that storage locker you were looking for.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at the dual information and decided to tackle the juicier one first. \u201cA double date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the mothers are coming. Won\u2019t that be fun?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His voice was dry, and I chuckled softly. \u201cOh come on, she might actually be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s taking her mother on a date. What does that say about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, your mother will be there, too, remember.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but my mother has become a conniving witch who plots incessantly to get me married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think her mother isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he grumbled, \u201cit was apparently her idea, not her mother\u2019s. Besides, the word from the pack is that she doesn\u2019t approve of wolf clubs. Hates what they represent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a werewolf, isn\u2019t she? How the hell can she disapprove of the clubs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck knows? Maybe she\u2019s a prude.\u201d</p> <p>Was it even possible to be a werewolf and a prude? It certainly wasn\u2019t a likely combination. \u201cIf you think it\u2019s going to be that bad, don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cMy mother will make my life hell if I don\u2019t go. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. Stane was afraid of his mother. Imagine that. \u201cAnd the storage container?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d There was a brief whoosh of sound, and I had the mental image of him scooting from one screen of his massive computer \u201cbridge\u201d to the other. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find anything listed under John Nadler\u2019s name, but I did find one under Genevieve Sands.\u201d</p><p>Who was one of Nadler\u2019s heirs, according to the information I\u2019d gotten from a ghost. Nadler was the man behind the consortium that had been buying up the land all around Stane\u2019s shop. Not that he wanted the land, per se; he just wanted to control what lay underneath it\u2014a major ley-line intersection. Such intersections were places of great power and could be used to manipulate time, reality, or fate. But they could also be used to create a rift between this world and the next, and we very much suspected that whoever had stolen the first key had used the power of the intersection to access the gray fields and find the gates.</p><p>Which, in turn, meant that John Nadler was either involved with the sorcerer, or was the sorcerer himself. Unfortunately, he was also a face-shifter, and it was damnably hard to track someone who could alter their facial features at will. Of course, I was also a face-shifter, but that didn\u2019t make it any easier for me to spot others of my kind.</p> <p>This particular face-shifter had assumed the identity of the real John Nadler after he\u2019d killed him\u2014a fact we were sure of only because the body of the real Nadler had turned up just as we were getting closer to pinning down the fake. We suspected that at least one of the three people named in Nadler\u2019s will was in fact the face-shifter, but so far we\u2019d yet to track any of them down.</p><p>\u201cYou want to send me the address?\u201d I said. \u201cI might go check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sent you that. I\u2019ve also hacked into their security cams so we can screen who might be coming and going. But is there anything else you need done?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help smiling at the hint of desperation in his voice. \u201cHaven\u2019t we already given you enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, I have a double date I need to get out of, remember.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled softly. \u201cThink of your mother\u2019s wrath, and\u2014as they say in the classics\u2014suck it up, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome help you are,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThe rates are going up next time you want me to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be bored to death inside a week if we weren\u2019t bugging you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said grimly, \u201cis undoubtedly true. Think of me suffering while you\u2019re off enjoying yourself somewhere tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what\u2014I\u2019ll send a bottle of Bollinger for you to drown your after-date sorrows in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least that would give me something to look forward to.\u201d His sigh was overly dramatic. \u201cChat to you later.\u201d</p><p>He hung up. Two seconds later, my phone beeped, an indication that Stane\u2019s information had arrived. The storage locker was located in Clifton Hill and wasn\u2019t all that far away from Stane\u2019s shop. I shoved the phone back into my pocket, then locked the front door of Wolfgang\u2019s house and met Azriel\u2019s gaze. \u201cCan you take us there now?\u201d</p><p>He stepped close again and wrapped his arms around my waist. I resisted the temptation to snuggle deeper into his arms, and a heartbeat later we were zipping back through the gray fields.</p><p>We reappeared near the intersection of Hoddle Street and the Eastern Freeway exit. The self-storage premises couldn\u2019t be missed\u2014it was a three-story brick building that had been painted in orange and blue stripes, with a huge white lock on the front of it.</p><p>\u201cHow do you plan to access this locker?\u201d Azriel said.</p><p>I scanned the building and noted the cameras placed strategically around the perimeter. Undoubtedly, it would be a similar story inside, and that meant it might be wise to indulge in a little face-shifting. If Genevieve Sands was connected to Nadler, then they might be keeping an eye on who went near their storage locker. It wouldn\u2019t be hard to do\u2014anyone with the right sort of knowledge would be able to hack into the security system. The last thing I wanted was for them to see how close we were. We didn\u2019t need another possible lead closing down before it led to anything\u2014or anyone.</p><p>\u201cI guess how we approach it depends on who is at the desk,\u201d I said eventually. \u201cIf it\u2019s male, I\u2019ll flirt. If it\u2019s female, you flirt.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cThe last time we did something like that, you stomped out in what I believe you would call a snit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a snit,\u201d I replied, amused. \u201cIt was mere annoyance. You were flirting with a stranger at a time you were refusing to do anything with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am still not doing anything with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d I gave a mock sigh. \u201cGod, it\u2019s been so long, I can hardly even remember what a kiss is, let alone sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps,\u201d he said, and stepped closer, \u201cI should remind you.\u201d</p><p>His lips met mine, and though the kiss was little more than a tease, it was also the sweetest damn thing I\u2019d ever experienced. It made me feel higher than a kite and warmer than the sun, cherished and oddly alive all in one quicksilver moment. And I sighed in frustration when he pulled back.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Azriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pressed a finger against my lips, silencing my protest. \u201cWhat you desire and what your body is capable of are two very different things right now.\u201d He gave me a lopsided smile that was oddly endearing. \u201cI want what you want, believe me, but I am not willing to tax your strength any more than necessary. And, right now, that\u2019s what we would be doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole point of sex is to be taxed,\u201d I replied, exasperated. \u201cIf you\u2019re not boneless and replete afterward, then you haven\u2019t put enough effort into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat effort can you put into it when you are all but exhausted?\u201d He raised an eyebrow, expression amused. \u201cTrust me, given the risks involved, I want nothing more than your maximum.\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly, then rose on tiptoes and dropped another quick kiss on his lips. \u201cBelieve me, when you give in\u2014and you will give in, reaper\u2014I\u2019ll give you one hundred percent, exhausted or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA promise I will hold you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you do hold me, I don\u2019t care.\u201d I reluctantly returned my attention to the building in front of us. \u201cCan\u2019t you just pull the information about the storage locker from the mind of whoever is manning the reception desk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could, but our sorcerer appears to have telepathic abilities, remember, and while it is unlikely he would sense any psychic intrusion on my part, it is a risk we should not take, given he is most certainly aware of my presence on this quest.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cDoes that mean clouding her perception is out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Clouding is more a sensory intrusion than a mental one, and therefore it is safer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess you\u2019d better make whoever is inside think we\u2019re cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can do.\u201d He placed his fingers under my elbow and lightly guided me across to the thick shrubs that lined one side of the nearby parking lot. \u201cIf you wish to alter your facial shape, you will not be seen here by either the cameras or those driving by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d While Azriel might be able to stop people from noticing his comings and goings, the last thing we needed was some poor driver spotting what I was doing and having a freak-out. While humanity was as aware of shape-shifters as they were vamps and werewolves, very few knew of the existence of us face-shifters.</p><p>I flexed my fingers, then closed my eyes and pictured my own face\u2014from the silver of my hair, the lilac of my eyes, the slight uptilt of my nose and defined cheekbones, to the fullness of my lips. Then I replaced it with more rounded features, thinner lips, and very short black hair. A black so rich it shone blue in the sunlight.</p><p>Once that image was frozen in my mind, I reached for the magic. It exploded around me, thick and fierce, as if it had been contained for far too long. It swept through me like a gale, making my muscles tremble and the image waver. I frowned, holding the image fiercely against the storm. Power began to pulsate, burn, and change me. My skin rippled as my features altered, and my hair suddenly felt shorter and somehow finer. As the magic faded, my knees buckled, my legs suddenly weak.</p><p>Azriel gripped my arm and saved me from falling.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d I muttered, leaning against him briefly. \u201cThat never seems to get any easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven you continue to function barely above exhaustion, it is unlikely to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I can do a whole lot about that,\u201d I muttered, and forced my knees to lock. \u201cWhat I need is for the bad guys to stop creating havoc for a month or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA situation that is unlikely. I am actually amazed that your father has let the lack of progress on finding the second key slide for as long as he has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could hardly force me to look when I was all but dead in the hospital. Even he isn\u2019t that callous.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI would not be so sure of that.\u201d</p><p>Actually, I wasn\u2019t. My father had shown a decided lack of parental care up until this point, and I had no doubt that lack would continue.</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d Azriel added.</p> <p>I took another of those deep, steadying breaths that really didn\u2019t help all that much, then nodded. He touched a hand to my back again and guided me toward the front door, his fingers spearing warmth into my spine despite the thickness of my sweater.</p><p>A deeper, more resonant energy swirled as we entered the building\u2014Azriel, touching the receptionist\u2019s mind to alter her perception.</p><p>So what will she see us as?</p><p>Police, as you wished.</p><p>Good. There were no cameras in this particular area, so the lie wouldn\u2019t immediately be uncovered.</p> <p>The receptionist gave us a cheerful smile. \u201cAnd what can I do for you both on this rather chilly autumn morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re here on official business.\u201d Azriel stopped in front of the desk and gave her a warm smile.</p><p>Her smile grew. So much for him not flirting. \u201cAnd what business would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to know if there\u2019s a Genevieve Sands renting a storage unit here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a moment, and I\u2019ll check.\u201d She glanced down at her computer, quickly typing, then said, \u201cYes, she is. It\u2019s one of the larger ground-floor units.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould we be able to look at it?\u201d</p> <p>She frowned. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t let you in without a search warrant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I said, noting with amusement\u2014and perhaps a touch of annoyance\u2014that she barely even glanced at me. \u201cWe just want to inspect its location for the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see the harm in that.\u201d She half shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s unit G-18. I\u2019ll buzz you through the security door; then follow the corridor down and around to your right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Maggie.\u201d Azriel gave her the sort of smile that would have melted the iciest heart. This poor woman had no hope whatsoever, and practically puddled on the seat. \u201cIt\u2019s appreciated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome,\u201d she all but stammered.</p><p>Amusement glittered in Azriel\u2019s bright eyes as he turned away. I followed, knowing I probably could have danced around naked and she wouldn\u2019t have even noticed. I shook my head in amusement. You, reaper, are incorrigible.</p><p>He glanced at me, one eyebrow raised, and the laughter I\u2019d caught earlier was now richer in the depths of his eyes. And why would you say that?</p><p>Because every time you have to cloud the mind of a pretty woman, you flirt.</p> <p>On the contrary, I am merely polite.</p><p>I snorted softly. Polite doesn\u2019t come in the form of a high-wattage, sexy-as-hell smile.</p><p>His amusement deepened, and it shimmered inside me, warm and enticing. So you think my smile is sexy?</p><p>I rolled my eyes and nudged him with my shoulder. Fishing for compliments, are we?</p><p>No. I merely ask a logical question. The security door buzzed as we neared it. He caught it with his fingertips, opening it and then ushering me through. It is the resonance of energy that attracts reapers rather than anything as fleeting as an expression.</p><p>I followed the receptionist\u2019s directions, making a mental note of the regularly spaced security cameras, then glanced at him with raised eyebrows and said, Does that mean you don\u2019t think my physical form is attractive?</p><p>Who is fishing for compliments now?</p><p>I grinned. Hey, it\u2019s not like you throw them around with great abandon.</p><p>No, he agreed, and touched my back again, his palm still light against my spine yet somehow oddly possessive. Or maybe that was merely wishful thinking on my behalf. And yes, I find your physical form attractive. But it is the being within that flesh, the timbre and music of all that you are, that is the most dangerous to someone like me.</p><p>Because of the threat of assimilation. It was a sobering reminder of the risk we were taking, and I had to wonder whether it was actually worth it.</p><p>But how could I be around him and not want him? That seemed as impossible to me now as it would be to stop breathing.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d he agreed softly. Almost grimly. Then he motioned with his free hand. \u201cThe locker we seek is just ahead.\u201d</p><p>I slowed as we neared it. It looked like every other unit in this area in that it was fronted by a double-sized roller door that was padlocked at either edge. I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019d been expecting something else\u2014but maybe it was simply the fact that Nadler didn\u2019t seem to do anything that could be considered ordinary.</p><p>Of course, Genevieve Sands might not be connected to him in any way\u2014but I seriously doubted that was the case.</p><p>\u201cThere is magic here.\u201d</p><p>Azriel stopped in front of the unit and crossed his arms. His expression gave little away, but blue fire flickered down the sides of his sword, radiating an energy that was oddly tense. Valdis\u2014the name of the demon trapped within the sword, giving the steel a life and energy of its own\u2014was as ready for action as her master.</p><p>I had a similar sword strapped to my back, but Amaya was shadow-wreathed and invisible. The only time anyone was truly aware of her presence was when I slid her dark blade into their flesh\u2014although she did have a tendency to scream for bloodshed, and generally at the most inappropriate times.</p><p>\u201cBut what sort of magic? Good or bad?\u201d I stopped beside him and eyed the roller door dubiously. I couldn\u2019t feel anything, but then, I wasn\u2019t always sensitive to magic.</p><p>\u201cNeither. In fact, it is almost Aedh-like in construction.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cThe only Aedh we know who play around with magic are the Raziq, and I seriously doubt they\u2019d be involved on any level with Nadler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is Lucian.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYeah, but he isn\u2019t capable of magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we know of.\u201d</p><p>True. But surely to god he wasn\u2019t linked to Nadler. Surely to god I hadn\u2019t been that gullible.</p><p>Azriel, perhaps wisely, made no comment about that particular thought.</p><p>I studied the innocuous-looking door for several seconds, then carefully raised a hand. As my fingertips neared the metal, energy began to flow across them. As Azriel had said, it didn\u2019t feel evil or dark, just wrong. It was also oddly similar to the magic in the circle of stones that had formed a protective barrier around the gateway Jak\u2014my ex, and a reporter who was helping us\u2014and I had discovered underground when we\u2019d been searching for Nadler\u2019s base of operations in West Street. And that certainly suggested I\u2019d been right in suspecting a link between Genevieve Sands and Nadler himself. According to Ilianna\u2014who wasn\u2019t only my best friend but an extremely powerful witch\u2014every spell was as individual as the person creating it. Two spells having the same sort of feel could only mean the same person was behind both.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get in there,\u201d I said. \u201cWe need to uncover what they might be hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not think that would be a wise move.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one, the magic involved prevents me from entering, and two, I would think crossing the threshold would notify Sands, or Nadler, or whoever else might be the true owner of this container.\u201d</p><p>My frown deepened. \u201cSo is the spell reaper specific, or is it more generally aimed at energy beings?\u201d Because if it were the latter, it would also prevent me from entering.</p><p>He hesitated, and his energy slithered around me as he carefully tested the boundaries of the magic. \u201cReaper specific, by the feel of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning whoever is behind this is more than a little familiar with your presence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cLucian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame him for every bit of evil we come across just because you don\u2019t like or trust him,\u201d I said, irritated.</p><p>\u201cHe is Aedh, he was your father\u2019s chr\u00e1n\u00ed, he spelled you, and he is sexually involved with a dark sorceress. Why would he not be a suspect?\u201d</p><p>Chr\u00e1n\u00ed was the Aedh word for a student or prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and it meant that even if Lucian hadn\u2019t been involved with the making of the keys, he most certainly knew a whole lot more about them than he\u2019d ever let on. And while he\u2019d been using me to keep track of everything we did to locate the keys\u2014had, in fact, placed a geas on me that had made it next to impossible for me to resist him sexually, which was important given he could read my mind only during sex\u2014my father had been keeping track of him through me. Blood called to blood, and that apparently meant he not only knew where I was at any given time, but he could read my thoughts from a distance.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not denying he\u2019s involved. I just don\u2019t think he\u2019s responsible for this.\u201d I waved a hand at the door and, as I did so, my fingers brushed the unseen magic. Light danced across them, warm and almost welcoming. Which was decidedly odd. \u201cIt seems to react to touch, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is only logical. If whoever owns this had been hiding the real Nadler\u2019s body in a freezer within, then he or she would not wish to risk anyone breaking in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why not ward against Aedh as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know.\u201d</p><p>Neither did I, and it piqued my interest. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get in there. This could be the break we\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I cut in. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to try regardless.\u201d</p><p>Irritation swirled down the link between us, thick and sharp. I might not be able to catch his thoughts and feelings unless he wished it, but every now and again emotion got the better of his control. And while that could be a dual-edged sword\u2014especially when it generally happened only when he was really angry over something I\u2019d said or done\u2014I wasn\u2019t about to wish it away. I actually liked getting glimpses of what was going on in my generally stoic reaper\u2019s mind.</p><p>I glanced toward the end of the hallway and studied the security camera. If I was going to get into the storage locker, I\u2019d have to do it in Aedh form\u2014and the last thing I needed was the transformation being caught on tape. \u201cCan you do something about those things?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA well-placed blow from Valdis would do a good job of destroying them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping for something a little more discreet than that.\u201d</p><p>He contemplated the camera for a moment, then said, \u201cPerhaps the woman at the desk can be convinced to turn them off temporarily.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you could sweet-talk the sun out of the sky if it suited you, reaper.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, though amusement creased the corners of his bright eyes. \u201cThat is an illogical statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true.\u201d I waved a hand. \u201cGo sweet-talk. I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d</p><p>He turned and left. I contemplated the battered roller door for several seconds, then turned my attention to the doors on either side. Would it be worth breaking into them on the off chance there was some form of ventilation between the two rooms? In Aedh form I was little more than mist, so even the smallest of cracks would give access. With any sort of luck, the magic that protected Genevieve\u2019s locker was concentrated at the entrance rather than being all-encompassing. A long shot, granted, but surely some sort of luck had to fall our way eventually.</p><p>I contemplated the door for a few more seconds, then retreated to the other side of the hall to wait. Azriel returned a few minutes later. \u201cThe cameras at either end of this hall have been turned off.\u201d</p> <p>I pushed away from the wall and handed him my phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to try entry from one of the other lockers. Hopefully, whoever set the spell might not have considered that eventuality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlikely. The magic feels encompassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning floor and ceiling, as well as walls?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cOddly, not the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe that will play in our favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe you just waste your time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019m still going to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are.\u201d</p><p>He said it with resigned acceptance, and I couldn\u2019t help smiling. Then I took a deep breath, releasing it slowly as I called to the Aedh within me. Despite the sheer level of fatigue that still assailed me, she answered swiftly, and with such force, I gasped. It tore through me, a whirlwind of magic that rendered flesh and muscle and bone apart, until I was little more than particles of energy amassed in the air\u2014a being who could see and hear, but not speak. I turned and headed for the locker to the right of the one registered to Genevieve Sands, sliding in through the small gap between the concrete and in the roller door. The area beyond was dark and crammed full of all sorts of boxes and antique-looking furniture. I swung around, scanning the wall that divided this locker from the other, but couldn\u2019t see anything that might give me access. But if there was going to be a gap, then it would more than likely be where the wall met the floor or roof, not in the actual wall. I rose up but couldn\u2019t see any access points along the joint between the wall and ceiling. Maybe Azriel was right\u2014maybe this was a waste of time. But that didn\u2019t mean I was about to give up\u2014not before I\u2019d checked all options, anyway.</p><p>I made my way back down, slipping between a couple of the old boxes that were crammed along the base of the wall. Dust, cobwebs, and god knows what else fell around me, the bits clinging annoyingly to the particles that were my body. It meant that, at best, I\u2019d be as itchy as hell when I re-formed and, at worst, I\u2019d be brushing bits of debris from my skin for days.</p><p>There were lots of skeletal bits of spiders and bugs along the joint between wall and floor, as well as flashes of living things that skittered away as I approached them. I\u2019d always thought being in Aedh form meant I was invisible to things that weren\u2019t either energy beings or in some way connected to them, such as the Razan, who were the human slaves of the Raziq. Obviously, I was wrong.</p><p>I slipped through another gap between the boxes, but drifted a little too high and caught the edge of the spell protecting the locker on the other side. Energy ran through my particles, a touch of lightning that didn\u2019t actually hurt. But it was warning enough that the spell, while it might not be Aedh specific, would certainly react to my presence if I got too close.</p><p>I moved on. As I neared the junction of the inner and outer walls, I finally spotted what I was looking for\u2014a slight crack between the concrete of the wall and the floor. I slithered in.</p><p>And found emptiness.</p> <p>Well, almost.</p><p>There was magic here\u2014it rippled through me like a mild summer storm\u2014electric, yet not threatening. But that wasn\u2019t all there was.</p><p>Standing in the middle of the room were two upright stones. I\u2019d seen their like once before\u2014in the tunnels Jak and I had found underneath West Street. Those stones had turned out to be a gateway, though it wasn\u2019t one we\u2019d been able to use, so we still had no idea where it went. Maybe these stones were the same.</p><p>I approached them cautiously. Warm yellow light\u2014similar in feel to the light that had danced across my fingertips when I\u2019d touched the magic guarding the door\u2014flared between the two pillars, shimmering and swirling softly in the darkness.</p><p>When I retreated, the light faded. I studied the stones for a moment longer, then dropped closer to the floor. The magic that protected the walls and ceiling wasn\u2019t evident here. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, I called to the Aedh and changed back to human form.</p><p>I was already low to the ground, so the drop onto all fours was a little more elegant than usual. I stayed there for several seconds, breathing deep, waiting for the quivering in my muscles and the fierce ache in my head to ease off. Both were the inevitable result of becoming Aedh\u2014I wasn\u2019t a full blood, and therefore paid a price that few Aedh did. This time, though, the aftereffect was nowhere near as strong or fierce as it usually was. Maybe constant use was making me more adept.</p><p>I pushed carefully to my feet, and a cloud of fibers and dust swirled around me. Another casualty of the Aedh shift was my clothes. They disintegrated just fine, but re-forming them was trickier, as the magic didn\u2019t always delineate between bits of me and other particles. And\u2014like the dirt that clung to my atoms when in Aedh form\u2014I often ended up with a dustlike sheen covering my skin rather than fully formed pieces of clothing.</p><p>I do not think this course of action wise, Azriel said. His disapproval spun down the mental lines between us, sharp but holding a hint of frustration.</p><p>You\u2019re probably right, but we need answers, Azriel, and we\u2019re not going to get them without taking chances.</p><p>You take too many chances as it is.</p><p>Maybe, but what other choice did I have? It wasn\u2019t like fate\u2014or anyone else\u2014was running around dropping clues at our feet. I drew my sword and stepped close to the gateway again. Fire flickered across Amaya\u2019s dark blade, spearing lilac light across the pillars and sparking the quartz within the stone to life. They stood about six feet tall and, like the ones we\u2019d discovered underground, were covered in writing and symbols that resembled cuneiform. It was ancient, that writing\u2014and powerful.</p><p>I swept Amaya in an arc around the floor, using her light to check if there was any sort of protection circle present. She was unusually quiet, which meant she detected no immediate threat. It should have been comforting, but it wasn\u2019t. Not when Azriel\u2019s tension flowed through me like a distant storm.</p><p>These pillars have no protection circle. The others did.</p><p>Maybe Nadler\u2014or whoever else rents this storage locker\u2014thinks the magic encompassing the perimeter was enough.</p><p>I frowned at the stones. I wonder if these stones are a means of transport like the first ones we found were.</p><p>That, he said, voice sharper, is not something you should be discovering. Not when you have no idea of the type of magic involved or where it actually goes.</p><p>Yeah, but as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re not likely to discover our answers by sitting here staring at the fucking things.</p><p>Risa\u2014</p><p>I know. I know. I\u2019m doing it anyway.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, but then, he didn\u2019t need to. His anger came through so thick and fast, it damn near suffocated me.</p><p>I gripped Amaya tighter. She began to hiss, the sound soft but fierce, filled with expectation. I continued to stare at the stones and hoped like hell I was making the right decision.</p><p>Then, before my courage gave way to common sense, I forced my feet forward and stepped in between the two stones.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>No light flare, no caress of magic, nothing. The stones were silent. Inert.</p><p>I raised a hand and tentatively brushed the stone\u2019s surface. Life pulsed under my fingertips. It was almost as if the rock had life and heart. The magic was there and ready to react. It just hadn\u2019t. Yet it had before . . .</p><p>I closed my eyes as the realization of what that meant sunk in. I\u2019d been Aedh when they\u2019d reacted, which meant these stones had been attuned to that form rather than human.</p><p>And there was only one being\u2014one man\u2014who had one, if not both, of those forms and who was also involved in the search for the keys.</p><p>Lucian.</p><p>Fuck! He really had taken me for a ride, and in more ways than one. The bastard had told me\u2014constantly\u2014that he couldn\u2019t take Aedh form, that the ability had been stripped from him by the Raziq when they\u2019d tortured him for information. It seemed that might be yet another lie in a growing list of them.</p><p>He was not lying about being tortured, Azriel said. Your father all but confirmed that.</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. You\u2019re actually defending him?</p><p>In this, yes. And it grieves me greatly.</p><p>Amusement spun through me. What about the whole \u201cstripped of his powers\u201d spiel? How much truth was there in that?</p><p>I think it was skillfully mixed with untruths. I do not, however, believe he can attain full Aedh form.</p><p>So these stones might not be for his use? And did that mean we had another Aedh\u2014someone we didn\u2019t know about\u2014lurking in the background?</p><p>Azriel hesitated. I am no expert in magic, but I suspect that if Lucian does use these stones, then they would be attuned to a full Aedh, in whatever form they might be in.</p><p>Which might explain why they didn\u2019t react when I was in human form, but not why they did when I was in Aedh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I said, I am no expert in magic, but there would be little difference between you and a full Aedh when you take on Aedh form.</p><p>I grunted and sheathed Amaya. There was really only one thing I could do now\u2014</p><p>Don\u2019t. Azriel\u2019s voice was as fierce as I\u2019d ever heard it. The risk is unnecessary. We can keep watch on this place and uncover whether Lucian\u2014</p> <p>But even if we do confirm he\u2019s using these things, that won\u2019t tell us where these pillars take him. We need to know, Azriel. We need to start taking the advantage for ourselves.</p><p>But this\u2014</p><p>Has to be done.</p><p>I cannot follow you when you are in Aedh form. The words practically stabbed into my brain. No matter where those stones deposit you, until you take human shape again, I will not be able to help you.</p><p>I know. But if I do get stuck, or I\u2019m forced to change shape, I can use Amaya until you get there. She\u2019s more than capable of handling most things. I\u2019d barely even finished the thought when Amaya\u2019s pleased hum began to run through the outer reaches of my mind. I shook my head in amusement. Trust me to get a sword that not only had a bloodthirsty bent, but also liked being complimented.</p> <p>I am aware of that. I still think this is an unnecessary risk.</p><p>It undoubtedly was, but if we really wanted to get ahead of these bastards, we needed to do the unexpected.</p><p>I stepped out of the stones and called to the Aedh again. She came, changing me almost instantly, a storm of power whose force seemed even stronger than moments before. It shook me, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if it had anything to do with whatever Malin had done.</p><p>Then I thrust the thought away and drifted closer to the pillars. Once again they came to life, the light pulsing with the same beat I\u2019d sensed when I touched the stone. Meaning I\u2019d been right\u2014they were primed to react to Aedh energy.</p><p>How they\u2019d react to me actually entering them was now the question to be answered\u2014and I wasn\u2019t going to get that answer by hovering here staring at the damn things.</p><p>I forced myself forward, into the heart of the magic.</p> <p>Just for a moment, there was no reaction.</p><p>Then power surged, tearing through my atoms, a sensation that was similar to and yet different from becoming an Aedh. It encompassed the particles of my being, then swept me into a bright orb of energy\u2014where I hung, motionless, for several seconds.</p><p>Then the energy surged again, and I was suddenly back between two stones. But not the same two, I realized. These stones were smaller, darker, and stood in a square, windowless room rather than a storage locker.</p><p>Excitement and trepidation surged in equal amounts. I carefully moved from between the two stones, then slowly turned around. The room was small\u2014maybe ten feet square\u2014with white walls and coffee-colored carpet that had seen better days. There was nothing else besides the stones, although the carpet still bore the impressions of furniture that had once been present.</p><p>I turned fully around and found the door. It was closed and, on closer inspection, locked. Not that that was a problem in this form. I squeezed through the gap between the base of the door and the carpet, and found myself in a long, wide hall. Light flooded in from the ceiling-high, almost industrial-looking window to my right and, beyond it, there was a decent-sized courtyard. To my left were four more closed doors and, down at the far end, what looked to be a kitchen.</p><p>Other than the soft ticking of a distant clock, the house was silent. If someone was here, they were deathly quiet. I hesitated, then cautiously moved to the left. I wasn\u2019t about to take any chances, even though there was little chance of anyone seeing me in this form.</p><p>Anyone human, that was.</p><p>Which didn\u2019t mean I was safe. Whoever owned this place was, at the very least, involved with a magician. At worst, they were working with either Nadler or Lucian, or both. Either way, they were likely to be more knowledgeable about all things non-human than the average human.</p> <p>The first door led into a small but neat bathroom, and the next two were bedrooms\u2014both empty. I looked around for some clue as to who might be using them, but other than the fact they were male, I didn\u2019t find much.</p><p>The fourth door led to another bedroom, but this time, it wasn\u2019t empty.</p><p>I froze near the door and studied the man sprawled on the bed. The blankets were twisted around his legs, leaving part of his butt and his back uncovered. He was muscular and thickset\u2014the body of a wrestler rather than a sprinter\u2014and his skin lightly tanned. He had two tattoos on the upper part of his shoulders\u2014one of a dragon with two swords crossed above it and the other a ring of barbed wire.</p><p>My stomach\u2014or whatever the equivalent was in this form\u2014sank.</p><p>We\u2019d seen tats like these several times now, and not only on the man who\u2019d unleashed the hell hounds on Jak and me when we were in the tunnel, but on the misshapen shifters who\u2019d attacked me in a parking lot and on the man my father used to his deliver notes to a human courier.</p><p>Was this Razan the one from the tunnel? I really couldn\u2019t say because I hadn\u2019t taken all that much notice of what he\u2019d looked like. But if he wasn\u2019t, why was he wearing the same branding as all the others? And why were there Razan involved with the machinations of a dark sorcerer in the first place?</p><p>I refused to believe my father was\u2014in any way\u2014involved with a sorcerer. Not when the magic he could command was stronger than anything a mere human\u2014light or dark\u2014could command. And given that he wanted the keys for his own quest of domination, it was hard to believe he\u2019d be in cahoots with Nadler and his schemes. And yet his Razan appeared to have the same branding as this man and the others . . .</p><p>Then the reason clicked. Anger surged, so fierce and bright, and the man on the bed stirred.</p><p>God, I thought, I\u2019m an idiot.</p><p>Lucian was the connection. He had to be. He\u2019d been my father\u2019s chr\u00e1n\u00ed, so it was more than possible his Razan bore the same markings as my father\u2019s. And he was also involved with a woman who was a dark sorceress. She might not be the one we were after, but the odds were that she at least knew him. After all, how many damn dark sorcerers could there be in Melbourne?</p><p>The man on the bed rolled over onto his back and flung his arms wide. I waited for him to settle again, then drifted forward. It was a risk, because Razan were sensitive to the presence of Aedh. There was every chance my being in his room would tug at his awareness and subsequently wake him. But it was a risk I was willing to take, if only to confirm my suspicions about Lucian.</p><p>Not that they really needed confirming, but there was still some tiny, ever-hopeful part of me that wanted to believe I\u2019d read the connections wrong, that I really hadn\u2019t been as big a fool as it was beginning to appear.</p><p>This room, unlike the previous one, was an utter mess. There were clothes strewn all over the carpet, shoes kicked into haphazard mounds, and piles of men\u2019s magazines opened to revealing images scattered everywhere. None of which told me much about the man\u2019s identity. But there was also a stack of change on the bedside table, and beside it were his wallet and watch. Unfortunately, the wallet was closed, and in this form I couldn\u2019t exactly change that situation.</p><p>Or could I?</p><p>If, as a half-breed Aedh in human form, I could reach inside a man\u2019s body, wrap my fingers around his heart, and squeeze the life from him, why couldn\u2019t I extract a driver\u2019s license from a wallet in this form? Or at least use the energy that was inherent in this form to open said wallet to get a better view of the contents?</p><p>It was certainly worth a shot.</p><p>I stared at the wallet and imagined the thing opening. Energy rippled along the length of my particles, then spun into a thin rope that glistened like lilac-tinted sunshine in the semidark confines of the room. I envisaged it wrapping around the wallet and, after a moment, the wormlike slither moved forward and did just that.</p><p>Pain ran through me, a sharp reminder that I wasn\u2019t anywhere near full strength and probably shouldn\u2019t be trying this if I wanted to function afterward. As ever, I ignored the warning and imagined the wallet flipping open. After a slight pause, the energy again reacted. The wallet flipped into the air, did a three-sixty, and dropped with a splat on the exact same side it had started on.</p><p>It certainly didn\u2019t open.</p><p>The man on the bed stirred, muttering something under his breath. I froze, ready to flee should he show the slightest hint of actually waking.</p><p>He reached down his body with one hand, roughly hauled the blankets over himself, then settled back to sleep. If I could have sighed in relief, I would have.</p><p>I glanced at the wallet again and tried opening just one side. All I achieved was flipping it completely over\u2014but it was then I finally noticed the sturdy little press stud holding the wallet closed. Until that was undone, I didn\u2019t have much hope. As hot lances began to stab through my particles, I concentrated the energy on the press stud and somehow managed to undo it. I quickly flicked the wallet open\u2014and none too soon, because the hot lances exploded into agony, and it was all I could do to maintain Aedh form.</p><p>I remained where I was, not moving, not doing anything, until the pain receded to a more comfortable ache, then carefully inched forward. The driver\u2019s license\u2014visible through a somewhat grimy plastic window\u2014said the Razan\u2019s name was Henry Mack. I might not remember what the Razan in the tunnel had looked like, but I remembered the name. It was a fake\u2014one of two this man was using. His real name\u2014which was part of the information Uncle Quinn had pulled from his mind\u2014was Mark Jackson, and he lived in a Brunswick West warehouse rather than in Broadmeadows as his license stated.</p><p>I quickly checked out the rest of the place, but didn\u2019t find anything else. I hovered in the kitchen for a moment, staring out the window, wondering if I should risk using the stones to get back to the storage place or simply get there under my own steam. Or, given the lancelike flashes of pain that were beginning to stab through my particles, get as far as I could under my own steam.</p><p>Then I actually focused on what I\u2019d been staring at rather blindly and realized it was two more stones. They were less than half the size of the ones in the small box room and formed part of the water feature that dominated one corner of the courtyard. But even from here I could see the cuneiform etched into the glistening stone, which in itself suggested they were at least created by the same hand as the others. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Curious, I headed out to investigate. The stones stood on a small rock island that had been built in the middle of the lily-filled pond. Water spurted from the top of each, then ran down their cuneiform-etched sides before trickling back into the pond.</p><p>As I approached the stones, they began to pulse with energy. This time, it was darker, more threatening. I hesitated, then mentally shrugged. I\u2019d come this far\u2014why stop now?</p><p>I entered the stones. Again the energy encaged my particles, then swept me not into brightness, but utter darkness. A darkness that was cold, devoid of sensation, and as frightening as hell. Then the energy surged, and I found myself in a very different garden. One that was lush and exotic, filled with plants and the happy calls of birds.</p> <p>Where the hell was I? The air was hot and moist, and clung uncomfortably to my particles. Somewhere in the distance water bubbled, a soothing accompaniment to all the birdcalls. Yet no birds fluttered through all the greenery, and I soon realized why\u2014the calls were being piped in from somewhere nearby. Then I saw the glass wall. I was in a greenhouse of some sort.</p><p>I moved in to the plant life. I had no sense that anything\u2014living or otherwise\u2014was close, but that didn\u2019t mean caution wasn\u2019t required.</p><p>After a few seconds I found a second glass wall, but this one looked out onto a backyard that ran down to sand and then sea. A sea that was blue and bright and vast and was nothing like Melbourne\u2019s own bay even on the best of days.</p><p>And I still had absolutely no idea where I was.</p><p>I followed the wall until I found a set of double doors that opened out into the yard and slipped underneath them. The outside air was cooler, but it was still far warmer here than in Melbourne. I slipped across the manicured lawn, then onto the sand. The sea rushed to greet me, its foamy fingers crashing upward, spraying my particles with salt water.</p> <p>I studied the beach that stretched endlessly before me and suddenly recognized the long line of high-rise buildings that crowded the shore.</p><p>I was in Queensland\u2014the Gold Coast, to be exact.</p><p>To have come this far meant those stones held some serious magic. Most transport spells\u2014or at least the ones created by human witches and white sorcerers\u2014were restricted when it came to distance. There were very few people with enough power capable of producing a spell that could take you from one state to another. Which meant that even if whoever the hell had made these stones wasn\u2019t involved with Lucian or the key quest, they were someone we needed to be very wary of.</p><p>I moved back through the greenhouse and into the house. As you\u2019d expect of a property on such a prime piece of real estate, it was vast, bright, and expensive looking. The decor was minimal and modern, and this lower floor consisted mainly of a pool and barbecue area, as well as changing rooms and a bar. The entire first floor was devoted to a massive kitchen and living area, with panoramic folding glass doors opening onto a balcony that overlooked the beach. The second floor held all the bedrooms. There were no other standing stones that I could find, so maybe the ones in the greenhouse worked both as an entry and an exit point. The one we\u2019d found underground certainly had.</p><p>The house was empty, and I could sense no other form of magic protecting it. Nor could I actually see any form of security system installed, which meant I could probably risk resuming my regular shape. I called to the Aedh once more, and the magic answered swiftly, sharply, sweeping me from energy to flesh in the blink of an eye before depositing me in an ungainly heap on the polished floorboards. Which was where I stayed, gulping down air, the pain in my head sharp enough to have tears rolling down my cheeks and my stomach jumping up my throat.</p><p>A heartbeat later, energy surged around me; then arms that were warm and familiar and oh so welcome wrapped around me and drew me close. As the side of my face pressed against Azriel\u2019s chest, I closed my eyes and listened to the steady beat of his heart, willing my own to match it. After a while, the rapid pace of my pulse began to slow, and the pain lessened.</p> <p>He shifted his grip and held me at arm\u2019s length. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and released it slowly. \u201cSurprisingly, yes.\u201d</p><p>His gaze swept me, and his expression suggested he wasn\u2019t exactly believing that. No surprise, given he was connected to my chi and knew the truth. \u201cDo you know where we are?\u201d</p><p>I half smiled. \u201cTo paraphrase Dorothy: Toto, we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bound to say that statement makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo any of my statements ever make sense to you?\u201d I brushed the solo tear tracking its way down my cheek with a somewhat shaky hand. I might have felt stronger changing to and from Aedh form, but the aftereffects still sucked. Big-time.</p><p>He rose and held out his hand. \u201cOn rare occasions, yes, they do.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly and placed my fingers in his. He hauled me up gently, but the world did a brief three-sixty around me, and it was only his grip that kept me upright.</p> <p>\u201cDamn,\u201d I muttered, swallowing bile. \u201cI really am going to have to eat something soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will refrain from saying I told you so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s mighty big of you.\u201d I turned and studied the room. We were in what had to be the master bedroom, given it was twice the size of the other four. It was pin-neat, almost sterile, with little sign that anyone lived here. But someone surely had to\u2014why else would the stones transport us here?</p><p>\u201cI cannot say whether someone lives here or not,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is magic in this place.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cReally? I didn\u2019t sense any when I was in Aedh form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is because the magic has some form of sensory boundary around it. It is very subtle.\u201d He motioned toward the closet. \u201cAnd comes from there.\u201d</p><p>I studied the double doorway somewhat dubiously, then pushed my feet into motion. The closet turned out to be another room\u2014one as big as my bedroom and filled with enough designer shoes and clothes to make even Aunt Riley\u2019s heart sing. One side held feminine things, the other male, and in the middle stood several long, intricately carved Chinese sideboards. Now that we were close, the magic within them was easy enough to feel. It radiated from the drawers and cupboards in gentle waves, caressing my skin with an electricity that felt as dark and as dangerous as the stones in the greenhouse below.</p><p>I stopped and rubbed my arms. \u201cWonder what these things hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe accoutrements of a dark sorcerer, from the feel of it. I would suggest you do not attempt to view them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a chance in hell of me doing that.\u201d Even if part of me wanted to.</p><p>I swung away from the troubling source of magic, donned my gloves again, and went through the clothes, trying to find some clue as to the identity of their owners. Interestingly, all the male clothing\u2014while exquisitely made\u2014tended to be rather old-fashioned in design. If it weren\u2019t for the modern labels, it would have been easy to believe they belonged to a time when breeches and waistcoats were all the rage. In fact, they were the sort of clothes Jane Austen\u2019s men would have been perfectly at home in.</p><p>But again, there was nothing\u2014not even a scrap of paper in pockets\u2014to suggest that the clothes had ever been worn. It was as if we were dealing with a ghost.</p><p>But while a ghost could certainly haunt this place, one couldn\u2019t actually own it.</p><p>Frowning, I spun around and checked the other bedrooms. The result was, as I\u2019d expected, more big fat zeros.</p><p>We headed downstairs. The kitchen was all shiny black and fitted out with silver appliances, and while the result was pretty spectacular, all I could envisage was the multitude of fingerprints and dust that would show unless you were vigilant about cleaning. Which whoever owned this place obviously was, because there wasn\u2019t a speck to be seen.</p><p>Thankful I hadn\u2019t ditched the gloves at the warehouse, I carefully opened the drawers and cupboards. All of them contained the usual kitchen paraphernalia, and all of them were as neat as the rest of the house.</p><p>\u201cWhoever lives here doesn\u2019t seem to agree with your philosophy when it comes to storing things,\u201d Azriel commented.</p><p>I glanced at him as I moved over to the pantry. He stood in the middle of the oversized living area, arms crossed and expression wary. Like he expected something to jump out at us at any minute\u2014and things certainly had during past investigations of places where we weren\u2019t supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cAnd what philosophy would that be?\u201d I said, opening the pantry door.</p><p>\u201cTo dump items wherever and worry about finding them again later.\u201d</p><p>I flashed him a grin over my shoulder. \u201cDo my untidy tendencies bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just find them illogical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you sound like Spock. And I know that makes no sense because you have no idea who he is.\u201d I paused, my gaze falling on the small black organizer attached to the other side of the door. \u201cBingo.\u201d</p><p>He was beside me in an instant. \u201cYou\u2019ve found something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBills.\u201d I plucked one out and opened it up.</p><p>My stomach dropped.</p><p>The person who owned this mansion was no stranger.</p><p>It was Lauren Macintyre\u2014the dark sorceress who was Lucian\u2019s lover.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>\u201cIf you were looking for a connection between our dark sorcerer and Lucian,\u201d Azriel commented, \u201cI think you just found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Lauren isn\u2019t the sorcerer we\u2019re looking for. Her magic felt different from the magic I sensed when that first key was stolen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet the cuneiform on all the stones\u2014both the ones you discovered today and the one you and Jak discovered underground\u2014bear the same markings and energy quality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich suggests she\u2019s involved, not that she\u2019s the one we\u2019re looking for.\u201d I shoved the letter back, making sure it was in the exact same position. \u201cBesides, it was a man I saw snatching the key, not a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have been mistaken. We were under extreme pressure at the time.\u201d</p><p>Extreme pressure was putting it mildly, given we\u2019d been under attack from a horde of insane mutant shifters. \u201cYes, but I\u2019m not mistaken. It was a man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere are male clothes upstairs.

Why would she own a massive place like this and have no obvious form of security?\u201d</p><p>Did Lauren feel so secure about this location\u2014or maybe even her own skills\u2014that she felt no need for protection? Or was it, perhaps, that all her security was centered on the property\u2019s perimeter rather than within the actual house itself? It would make more sense to be aware of invaders long before they actually reached your door. And while I hadn\u2019t seen a security measure when I\u2019d gone down to the beach, that didn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t one. Or that it wouldn\u2019t have reacted if I\u2019d been in human form.</p><p>\u201cObviously, she has no desire for anyone to see what goes on in this house,\u201d Azriel said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not so much what goes on, but with whom.\u201d</p><p>That someone wasn\u2019t Lucian. The clothes upstairs hadn\u2019t been his size, nor, as far as I knew, his style.</p> <p>For a change, Azriel made no comment on Lucian and simply said, \u201cDid not Stane have a miniature camera device that proved useful once before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d Said device had been made to resemble a bug, and we\u2019d used it in an attempt to get information on a man we suspected of being not only a Razan, but perhaps involved with our sorcerer. Unfortunately, he, like many other of our leads, had turned out to be a dead end\u2014in this case, literally. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if he managed to retrieve it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I glanced at my watch and sighed. \u201cBut I\u2019d better get back to work right now. I have to do Ilianna\u2019s shift, as she and Mirri are off celebrating their anniversary.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow as he took my hand and tugged me toward him. \u201cAn anniversary is something that should be celebrated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d My gaze searched his. \u201cI\u2019m gathering reapers have no desire for such frivolity?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no need for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I mean, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re incapable of emotion, and you do live in family units, so the concept of being with someone long term isn\u2019t an alien one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cReapers do not view or feel emotions in the same manner as humans do. It is more about the harmony of energy than it is emotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo a life mate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaomh,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>I made a face at him. \u201cA Caomh is someone who is in perfect harmony with you energy-wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It is rare, which is why reapers tend to live in very large family units.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning parents, grandparents, etcetera?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Ready?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSo, what about your family? Do you have any brothers or sisters?\u201d</p><p>The only answer I got was the surge of energy as he swept us from Lauren\u2019s mansion to the shadowed and minute-by-comparison confines of my office above the caf\u00e9. I blinked, caught my balance, then stepped back and said, \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have both. I do not see them.\u201d</p><p>Was that an edge to his voice? I frowned. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a dark angel.\u201d</p><p>My confusion deepened. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>He half shrugged and turned away, moving with easy grace to the sofa on the other side of the room. But red-tinged blue fire flickered down Valdis\u2019s sides\u2014a sure sign Azriel was not as calm as he appeared. \u201cBeing a hunter is a punishment rather than a glory.\u201d</p><p>I moved around the desk and sat down. \u201cBut with the first gate down and the other two threatened, it\u2019s you guys who are holding everything together, not the supposedly more prestigious soul guides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do not see it that way.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a moment, seeing the bitterness beneath the mask. \u201cThey don\u2019t, or you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>A cool smile touched his lips. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re your family, Azriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re not important.\u201d This time there was no disguising the scathing edge, but I had an odd feeling that it was aimed just as much at himself as at me. \u201cNothing and no one else matters until the task that lies before us is completed.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly and reached for the open bottle of Coke sitting on my desk. \u201cAnd when this task is completed and you go back to hunting those who come through the dark portals, you still won\u2019t see them, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not have work you must do?\u201d</p><p>Though his voice had lost the edge, there was a hard glint in his eyes and Valdis still flickered with angry fire. Frustration ran through me, but I resisted the urge to stoke the fire a little more and took a drink instead. He\u2019d told me a whole lot more in those brief few seconds than he ever had about his reaper life, and while it was nowhere near enough to quench my desire to understand him more, I knew it was better to back away for the moment. Push too hard, and he\u2019d make like a clamshell and not say anything else at all.</p><p>So I simply got back to work. It took me a couple of hours to get all the accounts done. Once I\u2019d changed into clothes that weren\u2019t literally falling off me, I headed downstairs to help out with the waitressing. Tao was in the kitchen, but we were so damn busy that we barely had time to even smile at each other.</p><p>As it neared midnight\u2014and the end of my shift\u2014I counted the takings and secured the cash upstairs, then grabbed four glasses of ice and Coke and shouldered through the kitchen\u2019s double doors. The only person in the kitchen was our pot washer, Frank. Neither Tao nor Rachel, our other chef, was in sight, although the fridge door was open and the toe end of a brown work boot was visible. It had to be Rachel\u2019s\u2014it was too small to be Tao\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Tao?\u201d I asked, handing Frank his drink.</p><p>The older man shrugged and wiped the sweat from his face with a brawny arm before accepting the glass with a smile of thanks. He was slightly simple, but he did a damn fine job and he seemed to enjoy it. At least he was reliable, unlike some of the kids we employed.</p><p>I swung around and headed for the fridge. \u201cHey, Rachel,\u201d I said, popping my head around the corner of the door. \u201cThere\u2019s a drink on the counter here for you. Where\u2019s Tao?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside I think, and thanks.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look up from her stocktaking, and I spun and headed out. The rear door was open, and the breeze was icy compared to the heat in the kitchen. I paused in the doorway, allowing my eyes to adjust to the darkness, but didn\u2019t immediately spot anyone.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cTao?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, then, \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>My gaze swung to the left, and even then it took me a minute to find him. He was hunkered down in the shadows of the Dumpster, his arms wrapped loosely around his knees.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I walked over and offered him one of the glasses. He smelled of sweat, grease, and ash. The latter had concern slithering through me.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He reached up and took it, but didn\u2019t lift his eyes. Didn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cTao, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d His voice was monotone. Clipped. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen look at me.\u201d I squatted down in front of him and gently touched his chin. I might as well have touched a furnace, and I couldn\u2019t help the reflex to jerk my fingers back.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cNice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the reason you\u2019re out here, I\u2019m gathering.\u201d The fire elemental he\u2019d consumed\u2014the one he was locked in a constant battle with over control of his own body\u2014didn\u2019t do too well in darkness and cold. Normally he\u2019d just retreat to the freezer when the thing inside him started to threaten again, but with Rachel in there doing a stock take, the night air was the next best bet. I touched his chin again, ignoring the sting of heat as I forced him to look at me. His eyes\u2014normally a rich, warm brown\u2014were alien and fire filled. \u201cNever turn away from me, Tao. You are not a monster, not now, not ever. Not to me, not to Ilianna, not to anyone that will ever matter.\u201d</p><p>He jerked out of my touch and snorted, the sound sharp with disbelief. \u201cYou say that now, but when the monster gains control, it\u2019ll be another damn story\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t,\u201d I said sharply. \u201cBecause you\u2019re stronger than it is. So stop sitting there feeling so damn sorry for yourself and tell me about your date last night.\u201d</p><p>Just for a moment, I felt the flash of his anger\u2014it rolled over me like the heated wind of a desert, drying my skin in an instant and sending little sparks dancing across my sweater. Then it dissipated, and he chuckled softly. \u201cYou really do like tempting the devil, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to deal with the devil in the form of Madeline Hunter on an almost daily basis, so maybe I\u2019ve just become a little blas\u00e9 about it.\u201d I sat down beside him, my shoulder touching his lightly. Although the heat was fierce, the tension within his body began to dissipate almost immediately. \u201cAnd you avoid talking about your dates only when they go like crap. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. She was lovely, we had a good time, and we parted making plans for another date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why all the doom and gloom?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cBecause I\u2019ll have to break it off. She really is nice.\u201d</p><p>I frowned as I took a sip of drink. \u201cI\u2019m not understanding the logic of that statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this.\u201d He waved a hand down the length of his body. \u201cHow can I commit to anyone for any amount of time when I have no idea just how long\u2014if ever\u2014it\u2019s going to take me to control this thing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I just about choked on my Coke. \u201cGood grief, did you just admit to a connection? Is the lone wolf\u2014the man who doesn\u2019t believe in long-term commitments\u2014actually thinking he might have found the woman who could change that?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cWe went on one date\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sometimes that\u2019s all it takes. You\u2019re a wolf, not a human or a monk.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted. \u201cI\u2019m half wolf, and I\u2019m certainly not a monk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeat sidestep of the actual question, my friend.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. It was a somewhat pale reflection of his usual smile, but I was happy to see it nonetheless. \u201cGod, you\u2019re more tenacious than a dog with a bone. And yes, there was a connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I can\u2019t see the harm in chasing it.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cAnd it might just give you another reason to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr another person I\u2019m fearful of hurting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d I nudged him gently. \u201cI have faith in your strength, Tao.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and released it slowly. \u201cYeah. And that scares the hell out of me, because you\u2019re seeing what I\u2019m not feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisa?\u201d</p><p>I glanced up as Rachel appeared in the doorway. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a gentleman here to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness or personal?\u201d I frowned as I glanced at my watch. It was after midnight, so it could hardly be business.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say. Just said it was urgent.\u201d She shrugged, then added, \u201cTao, I may need help in a couple of minutes. A big group just came in from the Blue Moon wanting burgers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just finish my drink and then I\u2019ll be in.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and disappeared. I climbed to my feet, then hesitated and looked down. \u201cI can pull Danny off waiter duties to help Rachel if you\u2019d like a few more minutes out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t help much. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He squinted up at me, expression half-mocking. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you\u2019re constantly telling me?\u201d</p><p>It was a rebuke\u2014a gentle one, but a rebuke nonetheless. I smiled, though it felt a little tight. \u201cYeah. And I\u2019ll keep saying it until you damn well believe it.\u201d</p><p>And with that, I left him. There was only so much I could say and do because, in the end, I couldn\u2019t help him win his war. He had to find the strength\u2014and the desire\u2014within himself to stop the elemental from taking over completely.</p><p>And, despite what I kept saying, part of me feared he wouldn\u2019t find either.</p><p>I walked back through the kitchen and into the caf\u00e9. The place was beginning to fill up again with wolves and a spattering of other non-humans, but we\u2019d rolled into the next shift roster and there were plenty of people to deal with the rush. I couldn\u2019t see anyone obviously standing by themselves, so I poked my head back into the kitchen and said, \u201cWhere did you put him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnd booth, near the bathrooms,\u201d Rachel replied, without looking up.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I headed down to the last booth, only to discover there was no one in it. But there was certainly someone standing in the shadows to the right of the booth. My gaze traveled up the long, lean length of him and clashed with his darkness.</p><p>This was no stranger. This was Markel Sanchez, one of the vampires who\u2019d been ordered to not only follow me about astrally, but report my every move back to Hunter.</p><p>And as a Cazador, he was one of the most dangerous men I\u2019d ever met.</p><p>I stopped abruptly. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am under orders, as you no doubt suspect.\u201d His voice held neither warmth nor inflection and yet somehow managed to be pleasant.</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s following me about on the gray fields right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick Krogan is currently on duty. Janice Myer shares the task at other times.\u201d He shrugged, the movement elegant. \u201cIt is my night off.\u201d</p><p>So they had female Cazadors? I guess there was no reason why they shouldn\u2019t, but it surprised me, for some reason. \u201cAnd yet here you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the wise in this world do not ignore the wishes of Madeline Hunter.\u201d</p><p>And yet I baited the bitch. What did that say about me? \u201cAre you here to poke me into action or what?\u201d</p><p>Amusement flickered through the darkness of his eyes and briefly warmed the coolness of his expression. \u201cI am not here to poke. I merely deliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering you\u2019re here under orders from Hunter, I\u2019m rather hesitant to ask what, exactly, you\u2019re delivering.\u201d</p><p>The amusement was more pronounced, but he merely reached inside his rather classy-looking black trench coat and withdrew a small leather folder. With some trepidation, I took it and opened it up.</p><p>It was a badge. According to it, I was now an official investigator for the high vampire council. Talk about the shit-hole getting deeper.</p><p>I blew out a breath that did little to ease the tide of tension and shoved my shiny new credentials into the back pocket of my jeans. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, yes.\u201d He hesitated, his dark gaze flicking past me briefly. Then, more softly, he added, \u201cTread warily with Hunter on this one, Risa. She is ready to tear someone\u2019s throat out over this loss, and you are already close to pushing her past the limit.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a moment, then swallowed heavily. \u201cThanks for the warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are most welcome.\u201d A slight smile touched his lips, and just for a moment lent his austere features a surprising warmth. \u201cI actually enjoy this duty. It makes a pleasant change from bloodshed, and you are certainly never boring.\u201d</p><p>I half smiled. \u201cYou obviously haven\u2019t been following me around for long enough, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not.\u201d He touched my shoulder lightly as he stepped past. \u201cBe respectful. At least until this killer is caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and walked away. I turned, watching him move through the crowd with ease, wondering how long he\u2019d been a Cazador. He certainly wasn\u2019t the cold-blooded killing machine I\u2019d grown up believing them to be\u2014not on the surface, anyway. Of course, neither was Uncle Quinn, and he\u2019d been a Cazador for centuries.</p><p>But that, I knew, was a rare feat. Most either died on the job or were killed by the council after the endless killing sent them insane.</p><p>I headed back upstairs. Azriel still sat on the sofa, and I shook my head as I walked over to my desk to grab my coat, purse, and keys. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever get bored, sitting there doing nothing?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cWho said I was doing nothing?\u201d</p><p>I glanced around. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what it looks like from where I\u2019m standing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps you should stand a little closer.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cI keep trying. You keep pushing me away.\u201d</p><p>He rose and plucked the jacket from my grip, holding it out for me. \u201cI did not mean in the physical sense.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly as I shoved my arms into the sleeves. \u201cWell, I can hardly get close to you mentally. The connection isn\u2019t two-way, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not talking about either physical or mental connections.\u201d</p><p>I swung around, but he didn\u2019t move his hands, and his fingers trailed across my skin. His touch was warm, electric, and stirred to life the unsatisfied embers of desire once more. \u201cWhat other connection is there?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cFor you and I, perhaps no other.\u201d</p><p>It was the \u201cperhaps\u201d portion of that statement that had me intrigued. \u201cBut reapers do have other choices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It is the manner of our beings. This world of yours is filled with a vast array of energy harmonies, and it is a beautiful and wondrous thing to listen to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd rather noisy, I would have thought.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou learn to tune out the noisier melodies.\u201d</p><p>I arched an eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to have much luck tuning me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but then, you\u2019re noisier than most. And more determined.\u201d His gaze lingered on mine for several heartbeats and, just for a moment, those bright depths showed a hunger as fierce as anything I was feeling. But it was gone just as quickly. He released his light grip and stepped away. \u201cYou\u2019re going to talk to the manager of Dark Soul now?\u201d</p><p>I sighed in frustration, but there was little point in saying anything. He\u2019d already stated that nothing would happen between us until I was stronger. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll drive, though. I feel like getting some air for a change.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI shall meet you there.\u201d</p><p>With that, he disappeared, making me wonder if he\u2019d come closer to the edge than I\u2019d presumed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer that particular thought, so I headed into the changing room, donned my leathers, then headed out to the secure underground parking lot where I kept my newly repaired Ducati.</p><p>Of course, she was no ordinary bike, but one of the first hydrogen-powered bikes to come onto the market. She was also the first thing I\u2019d bought when RYT\u2019s finally began making a profit. And while she was nowhere near as efficient or as powerful as the current generation of hydrogen-fueled bikes, she was still sleek and sharp and comfortable, and that was enough for me.</p><p>I stashed my purse in the under-seat storage, then shoved on the helmet and sat down. The leather seat wrapped around my butt like a glove, and I couldn\u2019t help smiling as I fired her up. The vibration through the metal told me she\u2019d come to life, although there was little other noise. Hydrogen bikes ran so silently that when they\u2019d first become commercially viable, state laws had required manufacturers to add a fake engine noise device to warn people of their approach. I kicked up the stand and headed out. The night was cool and the streets relatively clear of traffic, enabling me to let loose. My grin just grew. Damn, I\u2019d missed this.</p><p>Unfortunately, even though I\u2019d taken the long way around, I reached Dark Soul far too soon. I reluctantly found parking up the road from it, then stored my helmet and walked back. Azriel appeared by my side as I neared the entrance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou should do that more often,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d It was said absently as I eyed the building in front of us. Dark Soul matched its name. It might not be a vampire-only hangout, but with blacked-out windows and smoke drifting out through the gothic metal gates guarding the doorway, it certainly gave off a dangerous vibe. Or maybe that was merely the haunting, ethereal melodies drifting from the shadowed interior.</p><p>\u201cRide your bike. It makes your soul glow.\u201d</p> <p>I stopped abruptly and swung around to face him. \u201cDamn it, Azriel, you\u2019re going to have to stop doing that.\u201d</p><p>Confusion briefly crossed his features. \u201cStop what? Complimenting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I shoved my hands in my pockets and forced my feet onward again, feeling suddenly foolish.</p><p>He was beside me in an instant. \u201cWhy is this suddenly a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d I muttered. \u201cIt just makes me want you more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d Amusement laced his tones. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m betting you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you would be wrong, Risa Jones.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up, saw that flare in his eyes again, and my breath caught briefly in my throat. Because it wasn\u2019t just need. Wasn\u2019t just desire. It was far deeper\u2014far scarier\u2014than that. Something that should not\u2014could not\u2014be, if only because we were two very different beings from two very different worlds. We might have made a decision to pursue this thing between us, but he was not of my world and never could be. What I\u2019d just seen could not be anything more than an echo of my own emotions. It was an illusion\u2014one that would turn to ash and totally destroy me once all this was over.</p><p>But maybe it was already far too late to start worrying about that happening.</p><p>I swallowed heavily. \u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time, would it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. And more than likely not the last.\u201d</p><p>Sadly, a truer statement had never been made. The doorman opened the metal gates for us, and Azriel lightly cupped my elbow and guided me into the interior. It was, as the name suggested, a dark place, and it took a couple of seconds for my eyes to adjust. There was little noise in the room, even though it was full. Everyone\u2019s attention seemed to be trained on the stage at the far end of the room, their expressions one of rapture as they listened to the dark-skinned woman who played a pan flute. The music was haunting and beautiful and definitely not something you\u2019d hear on the radio. I wasn\u2019t sure it was worthy of the rapture that seemed evident around us, but then, a pan flute, however nice the sound, wasn\u2019t really my cup of coffee.</p><p>The room itself was thin and narrow. A metal bar lined the left-hand side, and the scents emanating from it suggested it wasn\u2019t only booze being served, but synth blood. Maybe that was the reason behind the darkness\u2014they didn\u2019t want to scare the human patrons with the knowledge of what they were serving vampires. It certainly wasn\u2019t illegal to serve synth blood, but it wasn\u2019t often done in places that catered to all races. Humans, vamps, and blood\u2014even if only synthetic stuff\u2014sometimes weren\u2019t a very good combination.</p><p>I made my way across to the bar. A small, thin vampire came up and gave me a pleasant smile. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to the manager.\u201d</p><p>He raised a pale eyebrow, his gaze briefly skating down my length. Or what he could see of it, anyway, given the bar stood between us. Energy spun through the air, teasing the outer edges of my mind. He was trying to read me telepathically, but he didn\u2019t have a hope in hell, thanks to the superstrong nano microcells that had been inserted into my earlobe and heel. Nanowires\u2014the predecessor of the microcells\u2014were powered by body heat, but for the wires to be active, both ends had to be connected so that a circuit was formed. The microcells were also powered by body heat, but they were contradictory forces that didn\u2019t need a physical connection. Once fully activated, the push-pull of their interaction provided a shield that was ten times stronger than any wire yet created.</p><p>With them in place, no one was getting inside my head. Well, almost no one. Azriel certainly had no problems, and I suspected Lucian could read me more than he\u2019d ever admitted.</p><p>And then there was Hunter, who always seemed to catch my thoughts at inopportune moments. Like when I was cursing her.</p> <p>The energy died and he sniffed. It was a somewhat disdainful sound. \u201cAnd who might I say is wanting her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisa Jones.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m here on orders of the vampire council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Amusement touched his mouth. \u201cJust a moment, and I\u2019ll see if she\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her she\u2019d better be, because she really wouldn\u2019t want a visit from Madeline Hunter right now.\u201d</p><p>The other eyebrow rose to meet the first, but he didn\u2019t say anything, just spun around and headed down the far end of the bar, disappearing through a rather solid-looking door.</p><p>I leaned back against the bar and studied the woman on the stage. \u201cDo you think she might be our suspect?\u201d</p><p>Azriel glanced at her, then shook his head. \u201cShe is a vampire. Whatever killed Hunter\u2019s friend was definitely something more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the music she\u2019s playing seems almost hypnotic. I mean, look at them.\u201d I waved a hand around. \u201cThey can barely take their eyes off her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is deliberate on her part. She feeds off them.\u201d</p><p>My gaze jumped sharply to his. \u201cShe\u2019s an emo vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that is a vampire that feeds off the life force of others, then yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn emo feeds off emotion, not life force.\u201d I frowned at the woman. \u201cIs anyone in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would suspect not. She appears to be taking only a small quantity from each\u2014it amounts to little more than minutes from their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shortens their lives?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, amusement lurking around the corners of his mouth. \u201cDid I not just say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d I scrubbed a hand through my short hair. \u201cShould we try to stop her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not why we are here; nor is it your place to do so. If she takes it too far, the Directorate will deal with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd will she? Take it too far, I mean?\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a moment, his eyes narrowed. \u201cThat possibility is there. It always is whenever a life depends on feeding from others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d I glanced over my shoulder, saw the barman coming back, and turned around.</p><p>\u201cYou have a couple of minutes,\u201d he said. His tone held a mocking edge as he added, \u201cSeems she\u2019d prefer not to have Hunter after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s through that door?\u201d I nodded toward the heavy wooden door.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He picked up a tea towel and began polishing glasses, his expression one of disdain. Hunter\u2019s lackeys, it seemed, were not held in high regard in this place, even if the woman herself was feared.</p><p>I pushed open the heavy wooden door and stepped into a long, semidark corridor. Several doors led off it, all of them closed except the one down at the far end. Light flickered from within\u2014some sort of computer screen, I thought, as I headed down. My footsteps echoed lightly, but no one came out to usher us into the room or greet us.</p><p>I paused at the doorway. The room was almost bare, with little more than a bank of security monitors and a large desk\u2014complete with a light-screen monitor and keyboard\u2014in the room. Behind the desk, in a chair that was larger than she was, sat a diminutive, dark-haired woman. She didn\u2019t bother looking up from whatever it was she was reading, merely waved a hand in a \u201ccome in\u201d motion.</p><p>Given there were no seats on our side of the desk, I stopped in front of it and waited.</p><p>And waited.</p><p>She tests you, Azriel commented.</p><p>I gather that. My reply was grouchy. Why is it that female vampires seem to be such bitches?</p><p>Perhaps they feel the need to prove themselves more.</p><p>I snorted softly. Or they just like being bitches.</p><p>That is also possible. Perhaps you should flex a little muscle. Or would you prefer me to?</p><p>She\u2019s hardly likely to respect me more if I ask you to beat her up. By the same token, I doubted I\u2019d actually have what it took to do that. I might be part were, but she was vampire. But then, I did have other talents I could call on\u2014talents she wouldn\u2019t have seen before.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I said, keeping my voice conversational, \u201cI came in here to ask a few polite questions about Wolfgang Schmidt, but if you\u2019d rather do things the hard way, I\u2019m more than happy to oblige.\u201d</p><p>She finally looked up, her expression mocking. \u201cAm I supposed to cower in fear? Because, let\u2019s be honest here, a werewolf provides little threat to one such as I; nor does a man who wears the mask of death.\u201d</p><p>She sees you as a reaper?</p><p>Yes. To her, he added, \u201cThen you are a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd certainly not a good judge of character.\u201d I raised a hand and called to the Aedh, then siphoned the surge of power into my raised fingertips. They went translucent in an instant, neither flesh nor Aedh, but somewhere in between. Her gaze went wide. I added, my voice still even, \u201cBecause, you see, I\u2019m not just a werewolf. I\u2019m someone who can reach into your chest, wrap my fingers around your heart, and rip it beating and bloody from your flesh.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, staring at my hand in awe and perhaps the tiniest touch of fear. And I have to admit, I liked seeing that, if only because I was getting a little sick of being on the wrong end of fear all the time.</p><p>Maybe it really was time for me to start flexing a little muscle.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d she said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, something more than a werewolf.\u201d I released the Aedh and let my hand return to full flesh. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ve finished with the games, tell me about Wolfgang Schmidt.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. The fear\u2014if indeed that was what I\u2019d seen\u2014was gone, but so, too, was her somewhat disdainful demeanor. \u201cHe\u2019s a regular, comes in two or three times a week.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd he was in here last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith anyone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Obviously, she had every intention of answering what I asked and nothing more. \u201cThen did he leave with anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say. I don\u2019t watch the movements of every single patron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why have the large bank of security monitors in the room?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThey are not trained on individuals. I simply like to be aware of what is going on in that room at all times.\u201d</p> <p>A controlling bitch, in other words. Maybe I should have called Hunter instead of flexing a little Aedh muscle\u2014the resulting fireworks might have been interesting.</p><p>\u201cThen I want access to all the tapes from last night. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can prove you are actually from the council? Because I am not inclined to show those to any random stray off the street.\u201d</p><p>I ignored her jibe and tossed my badge onto her desk. She picked it up, briefly studied it, then handed it back. \u201cWhy do you wish to see the tapes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Wolfgang Schmidt is dead. He was murdered last night after he left here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is sad news indeed.\u201d It was hard to tell whether she actually meant it or not, because there was little emotion in either her voice or her expression. \u201cYou may view the tapes in the room opposite. I shall port them over to the screen there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust the ones for the times he was here, not the entire night.\u201d</p><p>Another cool smile touched her lips. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>I spun and walked over to the other room. The lights came on as we entered, revealing another sparse room. At least there were two chairs here\u2014one behind the desk and the other in front. I sat behind the desk, found the ported tapes on the screen, and hit PLAY. The quality wasn\u2019t top notch, but I guess it didn\u2019t have to be if the only reason she had the cameras was to source out trouble before it really started.</p><p>There was no sound, but the woman spotlighted on the stage seemed to hold the audience under the same sort of spell as tonight\u2019s woman. She had pale skin, black hair with an oddly jagged red streak in it, and coal-black eyes. She wasn\u2019t playing the pan flute, however, but some sort of short-necked lute. I hit FAST FORWARD and rolled through about an hour\u2019s worth of film before I spotted Wolfgang. He came in just after midnight, sat at one of the tables close to the stage, and watched the woman with the same sort of rapt attention as everyone else.</p><p>When the woman finished her set, she came down and sat with him. They chatted for another half hour or so; then the woman retreated\u2014but not for long. She and Wolfgang left together.</p><p>We had a suspect.</p><p>I froze the screen on the woman\u2019s image, sent both Hunter and myself a copy of it, then switched off the computer and went back to see bitch-face.</p><p>\u201cYou were successful?\u201d she said, without looking up.</p> <p>\u201cWho was the entertainer you had on last night? Wolfgang left with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name was Di Shard. She wasn\u2019t one of our regulars, just someone brought in at the last minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you got her contact details?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She reached into her desk and handed me a business card. Classique Entertainers, it said. Specialist in art, chamber, and classical musicians. She added, \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cIf there is, we\u2019ll be back. Have a pleasant evening.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was as insincere as my words. \u201cOh, you, too.\u201d</p><p>I spun on my heel and got out of there. Once we were out in the cool air of the night, I drew in a deep breath and released it slowly. \u201cI hate dealing with vampires. I know the world at large doesn\u2019t care about that, but I\u2019m just putting it out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are right,\u201d a flat and all-too-familiar voice behind me said. \u201cThe world at large doesn\u2019t care. Nor do I.\u201d</p><p>I inwardly groaned, but somehow managed to fix a smile in place as I turned around. \u201cAnd to what do I owe this pleasure? Or is it simply a matter of you not trusting me to do my job?\u201d</p><p>Did Markel not warn you to be pleasant? Azriel commented. He was standing so close that Valdis\u2019s energy streamed over me, little flashes of fire that spoke of their readiness for action.</p><p>I am. It\u2019s not like I called her a bitch or anything.</p><p>Her dark eyes flashed. As usual, she\u2019d caught the one thought I didn\u2019t want her to catch. One of these days I was going to learn.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>\u201cI was told you were here. I was close by, and thought I might get a report firsthand.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot to tell. Wolfgang left with Di Shard, last night\u2019s entertainment. I\u2019ve already sent you her picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and we\u2019re currently searching for all relevant details. Unfortunately, the entertainment agency that manages her maintains regular office hours, so we will be unable to talk to them until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>How inconsiderate of them. \u201cAt least you can put an APB out on a woman matching her description or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. She is mine to find and mine to kill.\u201d</p><p>There was death in her eyes. It might not be aimed specifically at me, but it would take only the slightest nudge and I\u2019d be in her sights.</p><p>I had no intention of nudging.</p><p>\u201cThen what do you want me to do? Until we talk to the agency or she kills again, the investigation has basically stalled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I have ordered a thorough search through both Directorate and council resources. We will uncover everything there is to uncover about this woman. In the meantime, you are to keep looking, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I said it politely, without inflection, yet still that darkness flashed. Sweat began to trickle down my spine, and my heart began to race. Never a good thing when standing in front of a vampire on the edge.</p><p>But all she said was, \u201cKeep in touch.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. She shadowed, disappearing from my sight but not my senses. Only when the trail of her scent told me she had truly gone did I release my breath and turn around. \u201cWill Hunter ever cross the line and become fodder for Valdis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter has crossed the line more than once, but Valdis will not taste her flesh unless she attempts to harm you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. I was hoping you could bend that particular reaper ruling.\u201d It would be nice not to have to worry about the bitch, in any way, shape, or form.</p><p>A smile teased the corners of his mouth. \u201cTrust me, I am most aggrieved by that particular ruling myself. Do you head home now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019d better get some rest before I fall down dead or something.\u201d I rose on my toes and dropped a quick kiss on his lips. My own tingled in response, and it took a huge amount of willpower to step back. \u201cI\u2019ll see you there.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and disappeared, though the heat lingering in the air told me he hadn\u2019t gone far. I walked back to my bike and rode through the almost empty streets, half wishing I could just keep following the road out into the darkness and the countryside, away from all the madness that had become part of my life of late. But that, unfortunately, wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>Home was a square, two-story brick building situated in the heart of Richmond, and its somewhat bland gray exterior belied the beauty of its internal space. Ilianna, Tao, and I had purchased the old warehouse fresh from college and had renovated every inch of it\u2014and were still regularly updating it with the latest and greatest technology.</p><p>After parking in the garage, I ran up the stairs to the thick alloy door that was both fire- and bulletproof and looked into the little security scanner beside it. Red light swept across my eyes, and a second later the locks tumbled and the door slid silently open.</p><p>The huge industrial fans that dominated the vaulted ceiling whirled lazily, gently stirring the aromatic air. The place was silent, and though the electrochromic windows weren\u2019t on blackout, there was little light coming in from the street.</p><p>\u201cLights on low,\u201d I said as I strode toward the kitchen. Soft mellow light flared through the darkness, gleaming off the exposed metal struts and lending the brick walls additional warmth. Tao had left the remains of last night\u2019s roast in the fridge, so I made myself a sandwich and a coffee and worked my way through both as I sorted through the stack of mail sitting on the kitchen table.</p><p>With that done, I had a quick shower, then headed for bed. I woke hours later with the sensation that something was wrong. For several minutes, I did nothing more than lie there, listening to the silence and wondering what the hell it was that I\u2019d sensed. The apartment was silent, and there was little in the air to suggest that I was anything other than alone.</p><p>And yet the wrongness remained, scratching along the outer edges of my consciousness.</p><p>Frowning, I groped for my phone. No messages. Not that I\u2019d really expected any. Tao would have finished his shift several hours ago and was no doubt chasing tail at one of the clubs, and Ilianna was with Mirri. If I rang either\u2014especially given it was barely eight in the morning\u2014I would not be popular.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is nothing more than a premonition,\u201d Azriel said.</p><p>I twisted around. He stood at the window, his hands behind his back, his stance that of soldier on guard. Valdis was silent, but her hilt, touched by a glimmer of sunlight, gleamed like a star.</p><p>\u201cI can do without premonitions like that, thank you very much.\u201d I rose and padded across to where he stood. Tension rolled briefly across his shoulders, but he didn\u2019t otherwise acknowledge me. \u201cEspecially when they\u2019re that fucking vague.\u201d</p><p>My gaze dropped from the broadness of his shoulders to the stylized tattoos decorating his well-defined back. While the biggest of these was the Du\u0161an, there were others. Some were recognizable\u2014like a rose, or an eye with a comet\u2019s tail\u2014while others appeared to be little more than random swirls. He\u2019d told me once they were his tribal signature, although I had no idea what that really meant.</p><p>I raised a hand and ran my fingertips along the length of one of the swirls. The tattoo pulsed with dark fire, and tension rippled down the muscular length of his back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAzriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you want is not wise, Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d There was a hint of resignation in his voice, but he still refused to turn around.</p><p>I let my fingers trail on, tracing the outline of a comet. The tension in him grew. \u201cTell me,\u201d I said softly. \u201cIf you and I were both reapers, would you be standing there with your back to me right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I would not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t do it now.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou do not understand the risk\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf assimilation is our fate, Azriel, then it will happen whether or not we make love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not talking about assimilation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what were you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He never did when it came to questions like that. I tried a different tack. \u201cYou once said that reapers make love by combining energies. Can we at least attempt something like that, if you\u2019re so set against physical lovemaking right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cBut I doubt it would be any wiser, and for even more reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Azriel, just this once, why don\u2019t you forget reason? What the hell do you want?\u201d</p> <p>For a moment I thought he wasn\u2019t going to answer. Then he sighed and said, almost inaudibly, \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he turned around, took me in his arms, and kissed me fiercely.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>There was nothing sweet about this kiss, nothing soft, because it was filled with all the hunger of a man in desperate need. I wrapped my arms around his neck and returned it in kind, and for what seemed like ages, there was nothing but the kiss and the desire that exploded between us.</p><p>When he finally pulled back, his eyes burned with a hunger deeper than anything I\u2019d ever seen before. \u201cJust so you know, reapers do not engage in kisses like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they sure as hell should.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, then caught my hand and led me toward the bed. \u201cI agree that there is something rather satisfying about flesh-on-flesh contact, be it lips or something more intimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething more intimate?\u201d Amusement bubbled through me. \u201cThat\u2019s a polite way of putting it, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am nothing if not polite.\u201d He released my hand and sat cross-legged on the bed, then motioned for me to do the same. \u201cPress your knees against mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf a reaper\u2019s idea of sex doesn\u2019t involve more touching than this,\u201d I commented, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to like it very much. Especially given I\u2019m naked and you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, our state of dress will not matter.\u201d His smile creased the corners of his eyes and made my heart do a happy little dance. \u201cAnd I am not entirely sure this will even work\u2014although there is enough Aedh in you that it should\u2014so behave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am yours to command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only.\u201d Though his voice was bland, it held a hint of sadness that tugged at something deep inside. \u201cBecause you are still flesh based, we will have to take this slowly. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYou should know me well enough by now to guess that answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d A smile briefly lifted the corners of his mouth; then his expression became serious again. \u201cClose your eyes and concentrate on nothing more than your breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hardly sounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking and concentrate if you want to do this.\u201d It was softly said, yet held a note of iron.</p><p>I shut up.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he continued. \u201cLet go of the awareness of all that is around you, until there is no sound, no scent, just you and every intake of breath.\u201d</p><p>Meditate, in other words. I closed my eyes and concentrated on nothing more than breathing in and out. My heartbeat began to even out, and a sense of peace settled around me. As the minutes slid by, my breathing slowed further, until I was on the edge of an almost trancelike state.</p><p>\u201cFeel,\u201d he said, picking up my hand and placing it on his chest. His skin was warm under my fingertips, his heart a steady, strong drum. \u201cThe rhythm of my breath. Breathe in as I breathe out.\u201d</p><p>My fingers rose with every movement of his chest, so even though I couldn\u2019t hear his breathing, it was easy enough to set mine on a separate course to his.</p><p>\u201cNow, feel my breath on your lips,\u201d he continued softly. \u201cLet it run across your tongue and into your body. Let it fill you, become you.\u201d</p><p>Warm air teased my mouth. My lips parted and I drew it in, filling my throat with his taste and my lungs with the scent of him, until all I could feel and all I could sense was the energy of his presence. In me, around me.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I obeyed, and stepped into an ocean of blue. It was beautiful, that ocean, beautiful, but turbulent, and oh so powerful. My body began to tremble, not just with expectation and desire, but also fear. I was reaching for something I didn\u2019t understand, and it was far more dangerous than even Azriel thought. My throat tightened, and the rhythm of my breathing momentarily faltered. His fingers came to rest on my chest, his touch warm, electric.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing to fear, Risa.\u201d His voice swirled around me, soft and hypnotic. \u201cThere is no darkness here. There is just us, two beings connected by flesh, connected by air, and connected by the essence of all that we are.\u201d</p><p>The fear ebbed away, and once again there was only him. His energy, his being. Against my skin and in my mind. Burning bright, within and without, making me tremble, ache. Want.</p><p>\u201cImagine there is no flesh to separate us,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat there is only energy and desire. Call to them, Risa. Become them.\u201d</p><p>It was as if his words were some sort of trigger. Power surged, became a rush of fire that invaded every muscle, every cell, breaking them down and tearing them apart, until my flesh no longer existed and I was one with the air.</p><p>As was he.</p><p>He was bright and fierce, a being that glowed like the sun and who was as beautiful as the moon. He drew me toward him, wrapped himself around me, until the music of his being began to play through mine and mine through his. It was a dance, a caress, a tease. It was movement, heat, and desire. It was crazy and electric, a firestorm that ripped through every particle of my being. It was pleasure unlike anything I\u2019d ever experienced or felt before, and it took me ever higher. Our beings continued to entwine, tighter and tighter, until there was no separation\u2014no him, no me, just the music of the two of us combined. And oh, the song we made was beautiful, and powerful, and right. Still the dance went on, burning ever brighter, until it felt as if the threads of our beings would surely explode.</p><p>Then everything did explode, and I fell into a storm of electric, unimaginable bliss.</p><p>I\u2019m not entirely sure when, exactly, I came back to flesh, but when I did it was to an awareness of utter exhaustion. My body trembled, sweat trickled down my spine, and my breath was quick, shallow pants, as if my body couldn\u2019t get air quickly enough. And yet I felt alive in a way that was indescribable.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d I murmured, when I finally could. \u201cIs it always like that for you reapers?\u201d</p><p>He brushed a thumb lightly across my lips and smiled. \u201cNo, not always.\u201d</p><p>There was a note that almost sounded like amazement in his voice. I opened my eyes and looked at him. He glowed with health and vitality, his skin golden and his blue eyes shining. \u201cYou recharged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI hadn\u2019t meant to, but the intensity of the moment got the better of me. Unfortunately, it is the reason you are now so weak.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cDo you see me complaining?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, then leaned forward and kissed me tenderly. \u201cNo. However, you should rest now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>He briefly pressed a finger against my lips to halt my protest. \u201cFor once in your life, just do what I ask without argument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn honor of that amazing experience, I\u2019ll obey. Just don\u2019t expect it to happen too often. Me obeying, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I won\u2019t.\u201d His voice was dry as he rose gracefully from the bed. \u201cSleep, Risa.\u201d</p><p>I did. And for longer than I\u2019d expected, because it was late afternoon by the time I woke. I stretched, and suddenly realized I felt better than I had in days, if not weeks. I was refreshed, revitalized. Normal, almost.</p><p>Or as normal as someone like me could ever get.</p><p>\u201cThe recharging appears to have gone both ways,\u201d Azriel commented. \u201cWhich is good, but extremely unusual.\u201d</p><p>I glanced around. He\u2019d returned to his post by the window, but this time his stance was relaxed and his skin gleamed warmly in the afternoon sunshine. \u201cMeaning recharging for reapers is usually only one-way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you are not reaper; nor are you full Aedh. It should not have affected you as strongly as it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not complaining about it, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d I sat upright in bed, but as I did, that nagging, niggling sense of wrongness returned. I frowned and reached for my phone a half second before it rang.</p><p>I glanced at the number and saw that it was Rachel. No doubt she was simply ringing to let me know someone hadn\u2019t turned up again. But one glance at the clock told me they were midshift, not at the beginning. It couldn\u2019t be that.</p><p>Something was very wrong. Of that I had no doubt.</p><p>I hit the RECEIVE button and said, throat dry, \u201cRachel, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tao,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Disappeared? Oh fuck, please don\u2019t let it be the fire elemental. Please let it be something\u2014anything\u2014else.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d I asked. My throat was so dry with fear, it came out harsher than I\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cAbout an hour ago. He said he was hot and was going outside to cool down. Didn\u2019t think much of it, as he\u2019s been doing that a lot lately.\u201d</p><p>Because he was losing the battle. I rubbed a hand across suddenly stinging eyes. Damn it, I didn\u2019t need this on top of everything else. But then, it wasn\u2019t like Tao needed it, either, and it was my fault he was in this mess in the first place. If I hadn\u2019t included him and Ilianna\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You cannot beat yourself up over decisions others are ultimately responsible for, Azriel commented. Tao had the choice. He chose to help, just as he chose to save Ilianna by consuming the elemental.</p><p>If he weren\u2019t there, he wouldn\u2019t have had to make the decision.</p><p>And Ilianna would now be dead. You cannot have all things, Risa. Fate is not a generous woman at the best of times.</p> <p>Yeah, I\u2019m learning that. To Rachel, I said, \u201cDid you try his phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, because all his belongings are still upstairs. He didn\u2019t even change.\u201d</p><p>Damn. I closed my eyes for a moment and fought for calm. \u201cDo you need me to get someone in?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cJacques is due in next shift\u2014perhaps if you could get him to arrive a little earlier? We\u2019re not usually rushed until after six most Tuesday evenings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that. Let me know if Tao does show up again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>She hung up. I called Jacques and asked him to start early, then threw the phone onto the bed and glanced at Azriel. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose it\u2019s possible for you to locate Tao via his life force, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would depend very much on which life force is in control. If it is the elemental, then no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least we\u2019d know for sure if the elemental has taken over.\u201d</p><p>Azriel nodded. \u201cIt may take me a few minutes. Do not leave the security of this place while I am gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He disappeared. I picked up the phone again and dialed Ilianna. \u201cHey, gorgeous,\u201d she said, expression cheerful and green eyes glowing with happiness. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cThe celebrations obviously went well last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. I\u2019m one contented mare right now. Not even the fact that I have to meet Carwyn again can spoil it.\u201d</p><p>Carwyn was the stallion her parents were trying to set her up with. According to Mirri, he was rather hot\u2014in bed and out\u2014but given Ilianna\u2019s preferences, she was either going to have to be honest with her parents or get stuck with a mate she didn\u2019t want.</p><p>\u201cWhen is that happening?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cTomorrow night. I think it was supposed to be just him and me, but Mirri is coming along. She thinks we should be honest with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt, can it?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help her sexual preferences, and the sooner Carwyn was aware of them, the better it would be for them all.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a horse-shifter,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cA male horse-shifter. They don\u2019t think straight when it comes to mares.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still siding with Mirri on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraitor.\u201d The fierceness of her tone was more than a little diluted by the glint of amusement in her eyes. \u201cTo what do I owe the honor of this call?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, then said, \u201cTao\u2019s walked out of the caf\u00e9 and can\u2019t be found. I don\u2019t supposed you\u2019ve had any particular vibes were he\u2019s concerned?\u201d</p><p>Ilianna wasn\u2019t only a powerful witch, but also a very strong clairvoyant\u2014and a far more reliable one than I\u2019d ever been.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d She frowned, expression suddenly concerned. \u201cIs it the fire elemental?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it could be. I know he was having trouble controlling it earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do a locating spell and see if I can find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cThough if the elemental has taken over, will a locating spell even work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She bit her lip for a moment. \u201cA locator spell works on the energy of the person, so with Tao\u2019s body chemistry constantly changing\u2014flowing from flesh to elemental depending on which being has more control\u2014it\u2019s going to be difficult to pin him down. But I can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know the minute you find anything. In the meantime, I\u2019ll rope in Stane and Jak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would you involve Jak?\u201d Her voice held a note of disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Tao needs someone like him\u2014someone only after a good story\u2014on his case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJak has his nose to the ground and can hunt stories in places neither of us would get near,\u201d I said. To say Ilianna had a hate-on for Jak was like saying night followed day\u2014blindingly obvious.</p><p>\u201cYou be careful with him, Risa. The last thing you need in your life is another heartbreak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Jak is getting nowhere near my heart.\u201d I gave her a lopsided grin. \u201cOr my body.\u201d</p><p>She harrumphed. \u201cI\u2019ll be in contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I hung up, then scrolled through the contacts list until I found Jak\u2014though truth be told I knew the number by heart\u2014and rang him.</p><p>All I got was a recording telling me to leave a message. I did so, asking him to let me know if he heard about anything unusual dealing with fire, then tossed the phone back onto the bed and decided to grab a shower while I waited for Azriel to return.</p><p>He\u2019d done so by the time I\u2019d dressed, and one look at his expression told me everything I needed to know. I swore and thrust a hand through my damp hair. \u201cNow what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing we can do\u2014not until he regains his flesh form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He studied me for a moment, expression giving little away. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, you have a choice to make.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, my stomach suddenly twisting itself into knots. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere may be no choice,\u201d he said, voice even but somehow relentless. \u201cIf the elemental has won the war, then Tao is already lost to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I clenched my fists against the anger\u2014the useless, sick anger that was fueled part by fear and part by the knowledge that he was right\u2014and added, \u201cI will not give up on him.\u201d</p><p>While there was life, there was always hope.</p><p>Besides, I\u2019d promised Tao I would do all that I could to help him win. Giving up at the first major hurdle was not doing that.</p><p>\u201cRisa\u2014\u201d</p><p>I made a chopping motion with my hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it, Azriel. I don\u2019t care what you say. I don\u2019t care what fate plans. I don\u2019t care about being sensible. I will not give up on my friend. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He studied me for several seconds, then crossed his arms and turned back to the window. Every inch of his muscular back seemed to radiate displeasure.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad we agree,\u201d I muttered. I grabbed my phone, then stalked out to the kitchen.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t feeling particularly hungry, but I wasn\u2019t about to fall into the trap of not eating. Not when I actually felt reasonably healthy for the first time in ages.</p><p>I made myself a coffee, then sat down and consumed a large bowl of Coco Pops complete with lashings of whole milk. Not the healthiest of meals, but a slight step up from the chocolate cake that had initially tempted me.</p><p>As I rinsed the bowl out, my phone rang, and the funeral march tone told me it was Hunter. I closed my eyes and, for all of three seconds, resisted the urge to answer it. But Markel\u2019s warning loomed large in the back of my mind. I swore softly, then did the sensible thing.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been another murder,\u201d she said before I could even open my mouth to say hello.</p><p>Of course there was. I mean, why wouldn\u2019t fate just chuck more fuel into the bonfire of insanity that was my life at the moment? \u201cSame MO?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently. The report came in via Directorate channels, and it is not someone I know.\u201d</p><p>Thank god for that. The last thing we needed was for someone to be targeting Hunter\u2019s friends or lovers. She was close enough to the edge as it was. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you want me to check it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The address has been sent, so get there.\u201d Something flashed in her eyes. Something that was almost unholy. \u201cFind this thing, Risa.\u201d</p><p>She hung up. The phone beeped as her message came in. I glanced at it, noting that this time, the murder had occurred in the more middle-class suburb of Caulfield.</p><p>Azriel appeared in the kitchen. \u201cHow do you wish to travel there?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d love to go on my bike, I\u2019m thinking that when Hunter said \u2018get there,\u2019 she meant immediately.\u201d If not sooner. I grabbed some gloves out of the cupboard under the sink, then stepped toward him. \u201cReady when you are, chief.\u201d</p><p>His arms came around me, wrapping me in warmth. \u201cHardly an appropriate name when you never listen to a word I say, let alone do what I say.\u201d</p><p>Though his tone was light, there was an edge that suggested there was more emotion behind the comment than he\u2019d intended me to hear. I glanced up quickly, but his power surged, sweeping us from flesh to energy in a heartbeat before zipping us through the gray fields.</p><p>\u201cAzriel\u2014\u201d I said, as we re-formed, but the rest of the sentence was cut off by a sudden and angry, \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>And the shit just hit the fan, I thought, but plastered a smile on my face as I turned around. Uncle Rhoan stood in the doorway of the ultramodern brick and concrete two-story house, his red hair glowing in the last remnants of daylight and gray eyes glinting with anger. Obviously, Hunter had not given me priority over the Directorate this particular time.</p><p>\u201cI was asked here,\u201d I said. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m no happier about it than you are.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me for a moment, expression disbelieving. \u201cAre you saying Jack ordered you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d And heaven help me if Jack didn\u2019t back that statement up.</p><p>If Rhoan detected the lie, he gave no indication of it. He came down the steps and strode toward me. I held my ground in the face of his fierceness, even though all I wanted to do was run.</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck would he do that? You\u2019re not Directorate.\u201d</p><p>No, I was something far worse\u2014Hunter\u2019s go-to girl when it came to all things hell related. And while Jack might be the senior vice president of the Directorate and the man who ran the guardian division, it was Hunter who held the reins of overall control. She also happened to be Jack\u2019s sister, and he was undoubtedly wise enough not to go against her wishes\u2014not even when it came to something that would ultimately cause him grief. Uncle Rhoan had not been a happy camper last time I\u2019d been called in to help the Directorate, even though that had been totally accidental. The lunatic he\u2019d been hunting just happened to be the same one I\u2019d come across on the astral plane, and the creepy bastard had subsequently decided he only wanted to play his games with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a game that had almost killed me.</p><p>\u201cLook, ring him if you want to chew out someone. I\u2019m here in an advisory role only.\u201d</p><p>Rhoan snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Ris, because you know I love you to death, but what the hell can you give a murder investigation that I and everyone else at the Directorate cannot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell is precisely what I can give you,\u201d I replied, voice grim. Damn it, while I understood his anger stemmed from fear for my safety, it was fucking annoying to get chewed out over something I could not control. Not if I wanted to keep on enjoying my life, anyway. \u201cOr rather, a working knowledge of what is\u2014and isn\u2019t\u2014coming through the gates now that one has been opened. And then there\u2019s Azriel.\u201d</p><p>Rhoan\u2019s gaze cut briefly to the man standing quietly at my back. \u201cAnd whatever happened to the option of saying no? You\u2019re not employed by the Directorate. They can\u2019t force you to do anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, but Hunter could\u2014not that that was something I could admit to. I took a deep breath and released it slowly as I racked my brain for an answer that wasn\u2019t going to get me yelled at too much more. In the end, I went with the truth\u2014or as close to it as I was likely to get in this sort of situation.</p><p>\u201cI agreed because if whatever\u2014whoever\u2014is committing these crimes is a denizen from hell, then it\u2019s my damn fault that it\u2019s out there.\u201d</p><p>He continued to glare at me but, after a few minutes, muttered something under his breath and thrust a hand through his short hair. \u201cI hate that you\u2019re involved with the Directorate, however peripherally. They have a way of sucking you in deeper and deeper and never letting go. Neither Riley nor I want that sort of life for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that sort of life for me, either.\u201d I gave him the best fake smile I could manage. \u201cTrust me, you\u2019re welcome to the investigation. I\u2019m just here to see what you might be dealing with.\u201d</p><p>His expression remained uncertain. \u201cYou\u2019re hiding something, Ris. I can smell it a mile off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He snorted softly. \u201cYeah, trusting that statement, too. But for now, I\u2019ll let it drop. Come on.\u201d</p><p>He spun and headed back up the steps. I let out a silent sigh of relief and followed, putting on the protective booties and gloves as he identified me to the hovering crime-scene recorder.</p><p>The inside of the two-story home was as modern as its outside. Crisp white walls, shiny wooden floors, bright abstract art, and leather and chrome furnishings. This time the murder had taken place in an upstairs bedroom rather than in a living space, but as with the first victim, this man was fully dressed and apparently hadn\u2019t noticed the web being spun up his body.</p> <p>Rhoan stopped at the end of the bed. I halted beside him, Azriel still a warm presence at my back. The man on the bed was a thin, graying individual who looked to be in his midsixties, and he was as modern in the way he dressed as he furnished his house. But the expression frozen onto his face was one of pleasure, and his stomach bore the two fist-sized slashes that had been evident on Wolfgang. I flared my nostrils, trying to find some hint of the odd alien musk that I\u2019d smelled at the first murder scene, but either it had dissipated, or it was lost under the scent of all the crime men and women coming and going in the room.</p><p>\u201cDid you get here first?\u201d I asked, glancing at Rhoan.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He met my gaze. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you smell an unusual aroma? It\u2019s similar to the musk of a shifter, but odder, if that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was faint, but yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about at the first victim\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso present.\u201d His expression remained noncommittal, but the anger in him suddenly ramped up again. \u201cHow did you know about the scent when it\u2019s not evident now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, uh\u2014\u201d My voice faltered, and I cleared my throat, resisting the urge to step away from the anger that would undoubtedly follow if I finished that sentence. I knew he would never hurt me, but that didn\u2019t make him any less scary at times like this.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a smell common to many of the darker spirits who inhabit this world,\u201d Azriel cut in smoothly. \u201cEspecially those who are also capable of shape-shifting.\u201d</p><p>Oh, good reason, I said to Azriel. Thanks.</p><p>It is also the truth, he replied. His mental tones were still frosty.</p><p>I sighed. And just how long are you planning to remain annoyed at me over something so trivial, Azriel?</p><p>I do not know. For as long as it takes for you to regain common sense, perhaps.</p><p>You could be in for a long wait.</p><p>I am a reaper. Patience is part of our nature.</p><p>I snorted mentally. Oh yeah, you\u2019ve so totally proven that.</p><p>As you\u2019ve said to me often enough, sarcasm does not become you.</p><p>\u201cI do get the feeling,\u201d Rhoan said, \u201cthat there\u2019s a whole conversation happening that I know nothing about.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cI was just asking Azriel if he could tell whether we were dealing with a spirit or a demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the answer?\u201d His tone suggested he wasn\u2019t believing that for a second, either.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a demon, but he can\u2019t confirm or deny the possibility of a spirit because they\u2019re of this world rather than the other and therefore not his field of expertise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d He crossed his arms. \u201cAnything else you can tell us?\u201d</p><p>I frowned, my gaze drifting up the body. The silken web that encased the victim had been leashed to the bed end rather than the floor this time, but otherwise it looked almost identical. I opened my mouth to ask if they\u2019d found a Dark Soul business card in one of his pockets, then remembered I wasn\u2019t supposed to know about that. Subterfuge, I thought, sucked.</p><p>\u201cIs that wound on his stomach the only one?\u201d I asked instead.</p><p>\u201cYes. And whatever was injected through those slashes liquefied every inch of his innards,\u201d Rhoan said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left but a hardened outer shell of skin.\u201d</p><p>So it was definitely the same MO. \u201cWhat about the victim? Is he human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a hawk-shifter. He\u2019s also a perp with a long line of break-and-enter convictions behind him.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him sharply. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t his house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even his suit.\u201d Amusement briefly touched the corners of his eyes. \u201cThe actual owner is one Shamus O\u2019Callagan, and he\u2019s overseas on business. Apparently, old Sam here has been putting his psychic talents to good use and keeping himself off the street by not only sourcing out temporary high-end accommodations, but taking over the owner\u2019s identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might still be alive if he\u2019d been on the streets.\u201d</p><p>Rhoan raised his eyebrows. \u201cMeaning you think our killer has a taste for the high life?\u201d</p><p>Maybe not so much the high life, but possibly a taste for those who are psychically endowed. It couldn\u2019t be a coincidence that the first two victims were both gifted in that area. \u201cHow strong a psychic was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrong enough to easily convince doubters he really was O\u2019Callagan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been told, the first victim was a strong telepath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven he was an old vampire, that goes without saying.\u201d</p><p>Not all vamps were strong telepaths. There were a few\u2014a very rare few\u2014who missed out on that particular gift. \u201cThen being a strong psychic of some kind could be the link.\u201d I half shrugged. \u201cOf course, he was also rich. Maybe our killer is going after the wealthy. Maybe their innards taste better than us more ordinary folk.\u201d</p><p>He snorted softly. \u201cYou\u2019re about as ordinary as a blue diamond.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cI think that\u2019s the nicest thing you\u2019ve said to me for ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you keep doing dumb things.\u201d He nodded toward the body. \u201cIs there anything else you can tell us?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cNo. Bit of a waste of time, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but at least we now know we could be looking for a spirit; it\u2019ll give the witches in the Directorate\u2019s employ something to do on this one.\u201d He gave me a stern look. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to attempt to track this thing down, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless I\u2019m forced to.\u201d I gave him a lopsided smile, then rose on my tiptoes and kissed his cheek. \u201cTell Riley I\u2019ll see her on Thursday for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d advise not missing this one, or she\u2019ll be royally pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s never very pleasant for anyone,\u201d I said. \u201cTell Jack I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be of more use.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. I turned and headed out. At the front door, I stripped off the protective booties and gloves, dumping them in the hazmat bin before walking down the front steps.</p><p>\u201cNow what do you wish to do?\u201d Azriel said, as I stopped near the front gate.</p><p>\u201cRun away to a desert island somewhere with a mountain of chocolate and a refrigerator full of Coke.\u201d But running away wasn\u2019t going to solve anything. Not when I had a world to save, keys to find, and beings willing to kill those I loved if I didn\u2019t get my ass into gear sooner rather than later. I sighed. \u201cBut I guess we\u2019d better go home and see if we can do anything to pinpoint the location of the next key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome it is,\u201d he said, and had us there in a heartbeat.</p><p>I rang Hunter, but this time, she didn\u2019t answer. I left a message that our killer appeared to be going after men who were psychically strong and asked if I could grab a copy of the crime-scene report when it came through.</p><p>My phone rang the minute I hung up. \u201cIlianna,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019ve found him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, no.\u201d Frustration and concern filled her voice and expression. \u201cIf he\u2019s out there, then I can\u2019t see him. God, I hope he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>So did I. \u201cWould it be worth trying location spells every hour or so?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf he\u2019s in a state of flux, yes.

That\u2019s not going to help anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Let me know the minute you hear anything, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>I hung up, then stripped off my jacket and said, \u201cCom-screen on,\u201d as I headed into the kitchen. A light screen flared above the small, dome-shaped computer unit I\u2019d left sitting in the middle of the dining table a few days ago. Several seconds later, a laser-light keyboard appeared on the table surface near the unit. I grabbed another Coke from the fridge, as well as a wedge of the cake I\u2019d resisted earlier, then sat down and said, \u201cShow last search result.\u201d</p><p>More than twenty-five names immediately scrolled onto the screen. All were museums located within the golden triangle, with the biggest of them being Sovereign Hill, the open-air museum that re-created life of the goldfields during the mid-1800s. It was probably the most logical place to hide a dagger\u2014which was what the second key had apparently been disguised as\u2014and yet, for some reason, I had a nagging suspicion it wouldn\u2019t be there. But maybe that was due to little more than the fact that nothing else had been easy of late, so why the hell would the search for the second key be so straightforward and logical?</p><p>Besides, the clue my father gave mentioned \u201csoil being stained by rebellion,\u201d and that had to refer to the Eureka Stockade\u2014one of the biggest and bloodiest rebellions in Australian goldfields history. Given the stockade had happened on Bakery Hill in Ballarat, that removed more than half of the search results. I ran an eye down the list, then grimaced and sat back in the chair. \u201cThis is going to take forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough your father has been surprisingly patient thus far, I cannot see him waiting out eternity for the keys,\u201d Azriel said.</p> <p>\u201cEspecially since I\u2019m not immortal and haven\u2019t got an eternity to search for them.\u201d I ate some cake, then added, \u201cHell, for all we know, the bloody dagger isn\u2019t even in a museum, but rather some private weapons collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d Azriel studied the screen for a moment, then said, \u201cLogically, a dagger would not likely be found in either a pottery museum or a fine arts gallery, so that would erase at least half of those names from the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I leaned forward and looked at the list again. \u201cIf logic did play any part in the placement of this thing, then it\u2019s more likely to be at either Sovereign Hill, the Eureka Centre, or the Aviation Museum. And maybe\u2014if it was disguised as some sort of artifact\u2014maybe the Aboriginal Culture Centre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour locations is not an overly large search area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it would be better to visit them when they\u2019re open.\u201d If only because I needed to be in flesh form to feel the presence of the key, and I could hardly just pop in at this hour of night and start wandering around. Security would be on me before I got three steps. And while Stane could hack into their systems, he needed more than a few minutes\u2019 notice. I munched on the remainder of the cake, then said, \u201cThe real problem is not going to be finding the key. It\u2019ll be keeping the damn thing long enough to figure out what we\u2019re going to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the Aedh out of the equation\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Lucian who stole the first key,\u201d I cut in, more than a little annoyed at his continuing insistence on blaming all of our bad luck on Lucian. He was undoubtedly responsible for some of it, granted, but definitely not all of it. \u201cIt was a dark sorcerer. A male dark sorcerer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho might well be connected to both Lucian and his dark sorceress lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also might not. The point, however, is not who is involved with whom, but how do we stop them from grabbing the second key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple. We tell no one\u2014\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cYeah. Except that my father, the Raziq, and probably Lucian all have varying degrees of access to my thoughts. Hard to keep a secret when your mind leaks like a sieve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there is nothing we can do about that. However, your father is more than capable of creating wards powerful enough to keep the Raziq and possibly the dark sorcerer at bay. Perhaps the time has come to lean on his capabilities a little more.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cDo you really think he\u2019s going to agree to make wards strong enough to keep the Raziq out when it will also keep him out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can easily add a back door for himself in any magic he creates.\u201d</p> <p>Given my father was responsible for the wards that currently protected this building, as well as creating the Du\u0161ans, that was undoubtedly true. And yet something within me didn\u2019t want to depend on him for anything. I didn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to trust him,\u201d Azriel commented. \u201cYou just have to exploit his abilities. Besides, if you wish to keep both the Raziq and the sorcerer from the key, then there isn\u2019t anyone else who has the power required to create such magic.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and released it slowly. \u201cThen let\u2019s go talk to the bastard.\u201d</p><p>I pushed away from the table and walked back into my bedroom. I\u2019d stashed the communication cube my father had given me in a shoe box at the back of my wardrobe, hoping against hope that I wouldn\u2019t have to use the thing again. I should have known better.</p><p>I dug it out, then walked across to the bed and opened the box up. The cube sat within. It was little more than a white stone roughly the size of a tennis ball. Its surface was slick\u2014almost oily\u2014looking, and ran with all the colors of the rainbow.</p><p>I picked it up somewhat gingerly. It was warm against my fingertips, the energy within it muted and unthreatening. Yet it had been created using Aedh magic, and it was activated by blood\u2014my blood\u2014and that gave it a certain edge of darkness that made me wary.</p><p>Or maybe that wariness simply stemmed from the fact that I didn\u2019t trust the man who\u2019d made it.</p><p>And yet he\u2019d also made the Du\u0161an on my arm, and she\u2019d saved my life twice now.</p><p>I contemplated the cube for several more seconds, then tossed it on the bed and sat cross-legged in front of it. I glanced up as Azriel appeared. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could get me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d He offered me the knife hilt first, then sat opposite me and drew Valdis, placing her across his knees. Blue fire ran the length of her bright blade, a sure sign she was ready for action.</p><p>Hopefully, she wouldn\u2019t be needed.</p><p>I drew a deep breath, then released it slowly. It didn\u2019t do a lot to calm the nerves. I pressed the point of the knife against a fingertip until a drop of blood appeared, then turned my finger upside down and let the blood drip onto the cube. As it hit, the rainbow swirl of colors stopped, and everything went still.</p><p>Then light burst from the stone and quickly encased me in a cylinder of glaring white. Azriel disappeared from sight, and Valdis\u2019s fierce blue flames were little more than a shadowed flicker.</p><p>\u201cFather, are you out there?\u201d My voice echoed slightly in the odd silence of the white void.</p><p>For several seconds, there was no reply; then his voice\u2014a harsher, more masculine version of mine\u2014said, \u201cI\u2019m here. Why are you using this cube?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave it to me to communicate. I\u2019m communicating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have found the next key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you using this cube?\u201d</p><p>Impatience\u2014and perhaps a touch of anger\u2014swirled through the whiteness around me. My stomach tightened. I\u2019d felt my father\u2019s anger once before. I did not want a repeat of the bruises that had ensued.</p><p>And yet I couldn\u2019t quite help snapping, \u201cBecause if you want the damn keys, then you\u2019re going to have to do a bit more than provide indecipherable clues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot give you what I do not have. The Raziq who hid the keys are dead. I cannot call them back from whatever hell they may have gone to, so I am at a loss as to the point of this request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe request isn\u2019t more information.\u201d Which he\u2019d know if he was reading my mind. The fact that he obviously wasn\u2019t meant either he was some distance away or something else was going on. Aedh could usually read the minds of anyone nearby, and my father had implied he could read mine anytime he desired. \u201cI want to know if you can create a ward or something like that to keep both the Raziq and the black sorcerer who stole the first key out of whatever building I happen to be searching. It would need to be reusable.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment, then said, voice cool, \u201cWhen would you need such an item?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible. I don\u2019t want to start looking for the key before we have some means of protecting ourselves from outside forces.\u201d</p><p>And that outside force included him.</p><p>If he heard that particular thought, he thankfully didn\u2019t react to it. \u201cIt could be done. It would not, however, keep anything flesh based out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning it won\u2019t keep the sorcerer out?\u201d If that was the case, then it was pointless.</p><p>\u201cIt will keep the sorcerer out if he uses magic to transport in. I doubt I can make something quickly enough that would also stop him from using magic to transport out if he happened to arrive in flesh form.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cAren\u2019t they the same thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they are not. It is easy enough to bounce magic to prevent entry. It is harder to contain once in.\u201d</p><p>Ah. You learned something every day. \u201cWhat about the Raziq?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wards will be designed to react to the energy of their beings, so will restrict entry regardless of the form they take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean they will also restrict Lucian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy chr\u00e1n\u00ed has basically been reduced to flesh form, so no. But the restrictions that apply to the sorcerer would also apply to him.\u201d</p><p>Meaning he could not use any of his lover\u2019s magic to transport in and snatch the keys from under our noses, but he could certainly walk right in. If he managed to get past Azriel, that was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo how long would it take for you to get something like that to me?\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cPerhaps a day. I will have a Razan deliver it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d It stuck in my craw to actually say that, but being polite didn\u2019t cost me anything, and it was certainly a better option than pissing him off in some way.</p> <p>\u201cJust ensure no one else gets this key, or I will not be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>The energy in the cylinder became so electric, the hairs on my arms stood on end. \u201cI am not interested in your best. I just want that key.\u201d</p><p>You and everyone else. I rubbed my arms and didn\u2019t say anything. A heartbeat later, the white light died and I found myself blinking at the abrupt darkness.</p><p>\u201cYou were successful?\u201d Azriel said, then raised a hand and lightly brushed the hair from my eyes.</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cHe said whatever he creates will not restrict anyone in flesh form from entering, though, so we still could be attacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much the attack that was the problem last time, but the fact that the sorcerer used it to divert our attention from his arrival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he can still arrive, just not via magical means.\u201d I paused. \u201cIt also means Lucian will not be blocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it will be my great pleasure to deal with him if he does attempt to take the key from us.\u201d</p><p>I eyed in him for a moment, then said, \u201cYou\u2019re hoping he does, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His reply was short, sharp. Angry.</p> <p>\u201cBecause you want a reason to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because of me? Because he was using me?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, but he really didn\u2019t need to. I could feel the answer echoing deep inside of me. I reached out and placed a hand on his leg. His muscles tensed under my touch. \u201cYou cannot kill Lucian because of me, Azriel. I don\u2019t want that guilt on top of everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guilt would not be yours\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you break reaper rules to gain revenge for the way he\u2019s treated me, then that is my problem. We\u2019ve broken enough rules lately, Azriel. Let\u2019s not top it with murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some rules worth breaking.\u201d He sheathed Valdis and crossed his arms.</p><p>Talk about closing himself off, I thought with amusement. But before I could actually say anything, my phone rang. I bounced off the bed and ran into the living room to answer it.</p> <p>\u201cRisa? It\u2019s Jak,\u201d he said, rather unnecessarily given his rather handsome face was crystal clear on the phone\u2019s screen. \u201cYou wanted to know if I\u2019d heard anything unusual concerning fires?\u201d</p><p>My heart began beating a whole lot faster. \u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I might just have something. But it\u2019ll cost you.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not giving you a story, Jak. Not on this one.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. It touched his eyes, warming the dark-chocolate depths and creating the usual havoc with my pulse rate. He might have caused me untold heartache in the past, but there was still a tiny part of me that remembered\u2014and maybe even hungered for\u2014the good times.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t want a story.\u201d He paused, and the spark in his eyes grew. \u201cI want a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll talk to you later\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fucking blackmail, Jak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d His voice was cheery. \u201cI believe there\u2019s still something between us, Ris. You keep saying there isn\u2019t, but you lie, and we both know it. A date should sort it out one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJak, I\u2019m not getting into a relationship with you.\u201d Annoyance filled my voice. \u201cAccept that and move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had, but then you went and kissed me, and it just reminded me of how good we\u2019d been together.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my forehead wearily. I hadn\u2019t actually kissed Jak\u2014I\u2019d kissed Azriel. At the time, he\u2019d been wearing Jak\u2019s image, as we\u2019d thought Jak might have been the target of a sniper. Those suspicions had turned out to be wrong, but I couldn\u2019t entirely regret it, because that kiss was the reason Azriel and I had finally ended up lovers. What I did regret was telling Azriel to give Jak full memories of what had happened that night\u2014kiss included.</p><p>\u201cJak, just tell me what you\u2019ve uncovered. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question on the table, and I just might.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to say, \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, one date, no sex,\u201d but what came out instead was a flat, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jak didn\u2019t immediately say anything, but I could see his surprise. Hell, I was surprised. And yet, weirdly, I also felt free. I may not have wanted him back in my life, but at least confronting him had finally freed me from the pain of our past.</p><p>I could move on.</p><p>At least until Azriel got around to shattering my barely healed heart again.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I continued. \u201cI\u2019m not denying there\u2019s still chemistry between us, but I have to wonder how much of it is just the pull of our wolf natures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is more than just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJak,\u201d I cut in, exasperated. \u201cI\u2019m with someone else. I don\u2019t care how much lust might flare between you and me\u2014or anyone else for that matter\u2014it\u2019s not going to happen. If you can\u2019t accept that and move on, well, then, good-bye. But I won\u2019t be blackmailed into something I don\u2019t want.\u201d Not this fucking time, anyway.</p><p>He stared at me for several seconds, then took a deep breath and released it slowly. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you accept what I said, or okay, you\u2019re out the door?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThe former. You still owe me a major story, my dear, and you\u2019re not getting rid of me until I get it.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help a chuckle. He really hadn\u2019t changed. \u201cThen cut the crap and tell me what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope your reaper appreciates what you\u2019re giving up,\u201d he said, amusement teasing his lips.</p><p>\u201cWho said it was the reaper?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cAnyone with two eyes and half a brain. Don\u2019t try to kid a kidder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJak\u2014\u201d I warned.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, the amusement on his lips becoming an all-out grin. \u201cThere have been several weird fire-related reports popping up on the scanner over the last half hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the scanner you haven\u2019t got because they\u2019re illegal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hear the news, or not?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been reports of fires breaking out on freeway verges near Strathmore, Keilor East, Calder Park Raceway, and another of a grass fire near Diggers Rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I said, hoping there was more to the reports than just that. Spot fires weren\u2019t unusual, especially along freeway verges. Cigarettes being thrown out of car windows started too many fires in the summer and autumn months.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he said, \u201call reports mention a figure seen fleeing the scene.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. Here it comes, I thought. \u201cWas there any description?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all said the man was made of fire.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Damn, damn, damn!</p><p>Of course, there was always a chance it wasn\u2019t Tao, but deep in my heart I knew it was a very remote one. While he wasn\u2019t the only fire starter in Victoria, they all had one thing in common\u2014even though they could make their entire body flame, they never appeared to be made of flames. Their features were always visible underneath them. If the figure seen fleeing the string of fires did appear that way, then there could be only two reasons why: Either a witch had conjured a fresh elemental, or Tao\u2019s elemental was now in control of his body.</p><p>I rubbed my suddenly stinging eyes. \u201cHow long ago was the last report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Diggers Rest report came in about ten minutes ago.\u201d Jak paused. \u201cRis, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that I can tell you about.\u201d I swung around, walked over to the light screen, and quickly brought up Google Maps. I typed \u201cDiggers Rest\u201d in the search area and waited for the screen to respond. \u201cWhen did the first report come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout twenty minutes earlier.\u201d</p><p>Meaning it had taken him roughly twenty minutes to travel the twenty or so kilometers from Strathmore to Diggers Rest. At that rate, he\u2019d be in Gisborne in ten minutes. I kept following the freeway up with my finger, but stopped when I hit Macedon. Oh, shit. The elemental was going home. Going back to where the witch had created the flames that had given birth to it. It had to be. What other reason could there be for it to be heading up to Macedon? Obviously, the witch fire was still alive, though how that could be after all this time I had no idea. That was a question Ilianna would have a better chance of answering than me.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jak\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare hang up on me without\u2014\u201d</p><p>I hung up, then swung around to face Azriel. \u201cI have to get out there and find Tao before he creates too much more damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish me to take you?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, then said, \u201cNo. I\u2019ll go in Aedh form. It\u2019ll be easier to spot him that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, I cannot follow you or help you until you retain flesh form.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, then grabbed my keys and gave Azriel a quick kiss. \u201cWish me luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you safety,\u201d he said. \u201cLuck is not something either of us should depend on at this point of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>Ilianna\u2019s wards were still active, which meant I couldn\u2019t actually change inside the apartment. I headed out to the street, making sure the apartment was locked and the alarm on, then gripped my phone and keys tightly and reached down for the power of the Aedh. It swept through me instantly, a force stronger than ever before, switching me from flesh to energy form in the blink of an eye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An unpleasant tingle ran across my particles, a telltale sign that the wards were definitely working. I spun around and headed skyward, arrowing northwest, straight toward Macedon. There was no point in following the roads\u2014not in this form, anyway.</p><p>I was going so fast, the streetlights were little more than vivid streaks. The wind buffeted my body, occasionally throwing me sideways, but I still made good time. Soon the lights of the civilization started giving way to longer patches of darkness as I moved from the city to the country. After a while, I found the Calder Freeway and started following it, simply because the elemental seemed to be. For several miles, there was nothing more than the occasional car zooming past; then, gradually, a deeper, richer glow began to show up on the horizon. It was slightly off the highway, walking through paddocks, flicking flames through the undergrowth and sparking more spot fires.</p><p>I sped up. The closer I got, the more certain I became that it was Tao. Or rather, the elemental. Fear slithered through me, but it was fear for my friend, not fear for me.</p> <p>Soon a fiery form became visible. It was trunk shaped, with thick arms and legs and no head. It dripped fire as it moved, the molten globules sizzling as they hit the ground. The dark energy that rolled off the creature crawled through my particles, making them quiver in discomfort.</p><p>This is Tao, I reminded myself fiercely. He wouldn\u2019t hurt me. I had to trust that, if nothing else.</p><p>I flew downward, shifting shape as I neared the ground. I landed on hands and knees and skidded forward, skinning my palms and ripping the knees out of my jeans. I cursed softly\u2014more from the pain of those injuries than the incapacitating pain that usually followed such a shift\u2014and forced myself upright. The abrupt movement had the world doing a brief three-sixty around me, but I ignored it and forced my feet forward. A heartbeat later, an all-too-familiar heat ran across my skin.</p><p>\u201cI have no sense of Tao within that creature,\u201d Azriel said, voice soft and holding little in the way of emotion.</p><p>\u201cYou may not sense him, but he\u2019s still there somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf he attacks, you must defend yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I glanced at him. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t defend me, either.\u201d</p><p>Anger flickered through his eyes, even though his expression was as remote as it had ever been. \u201cIt is my duty to protect you from all danger. That includes threats from friends.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and swung around to fully face him. \u201cIf you even go near Tao, I\u2019ll fucking attack you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTao is not in control of that being,\u201d he all but growled. The fury he was barely showing washed through my mind, a whirlwind of heat that left me singed. \u201cAnd he will attack you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But he won\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p> <p>I had to believe that. Had to.</p><p>\u201cI cannot stand here and watch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d I cut in. \u201cPromise me, Azriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I haven\u2019t asked that much of you. I\u2019m asking this. Please, for me, stand back and let me deal with Tao.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me for a moment, then made a short, chopping motion with his hand. \u201cFine. I will not interfere unless I sense death is inevitable. I will not let you die. Anything more, I will not promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I turned and walked toward the fiery form. Its steps were ponderous, as if its flaming trunklike legs were a weight it could barely lift. And yet, for all the appearance of slowness, it was covering a lot of distance fairly quickly.</p> <p>The closer I got, the hotter it got. Heat rolled over me, furnacelike in its intensity. Sweat beaded across my brow and began to roll down my spine. But it wasn\u2019t all caused by heat. Some of it was definitely fear. No matter what I\u2019d said to Azriel, no matter what I believed, I knew deep down that there was a very real possibility that this encounter would not end well for one of us.</p><p>Amaya\u2019s hissing began to fill the back of my thoughts. She wanted to kill, wanted to draw the life of the elemental into her steel and feed on its flesh.</p><p>I shuddered. No way in hell, Amaya. This is a friend, not an enemy.</p><p>Not, she replied. Only way.</p><p>I ignored her. I flexed my fingers, took a deep breath, and said, \u201cTao.\u201d</p><p>There was no response. The creature kept moving forward, its heavy steps making the ground quiver.</p><p>\u201cTao,\u201d I said, louder this time.</p><p>The creature paused, then slowly turned around. It didn\u2019t have a mouth or even a face, so, basically, it just stood there, dripping fire. I wondered what was going on within the creature, wondered if Tao had any awareness of what the elemental was doing and whether somewhere deep within the flames he still fought to regain control.</p><p>\u201cYou have to retake control, Tao. It\u2019s trying to return to the fire that created it. You can\u2019t let it.\u201d Because if it did, I\u2019d never see my friend again. I was sure of that, if nothing else.</p><p>The creature twitched. Whether it was a response to my plea, I couldn\u2019t say. \u201cTao\u2014\u201d</p><p>The rest of the sentence was cut off as the creature raised a fist and punched. I swore and ducked, but not fast enough. The blow hit my shoulder rather than my face, melting my sweater and sending me sprawling backward.</p><p>Attack, Amaya screamed, her voice so strident, tears stung my eyes. Touch you not.</p><p>Damn it, no. I pushed to my feet, stripped off my still-smoldering sweater, and dumped it on the ground. The elemental had turned and was walking away.</p><p>I cursed and sprinted after it, looping around the left side of the creature until I was in front of it. \u201cDamn it, Tao, listen to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>The creature swiped at me again. This time I was ready for it and ducked. The blow sailed over my head, but the heat of its flames was so fierce, it felt like my skin was burning. I backed away fast and kept out of fist range.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t working. Tao wasn\u2019t hearing me. Maybe he was gone. Maybe the creature was too strong . . . I briefly closed my eyes. No. Tao was still within that fiery form. I was sure of it. I just had to find a way to draw him back out. But how?</p><p>Last time the elemental had tried to take over, I\u2019d physically dragged Tao into the freezer and doused him with ice\u2014something that was impossible to do out here in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>But what if it had been as much the physical contact between us as the ice that had helped Tao get the elemental under control?</p><p>No, Azriel said, the same time as Amaya screamed, Will kill.</p><p>Fuck it, both of you. Stop telling me what I can\u2019t do and start offering suggestions.</p><p>Azriel\u2019s frustration rolled through my mind, as sharp as Amaya\u2019s hissing. You can use Amaya as a shield.</p><p>How?</p><p>Flames, she said. I eat.</p><p>That will kill him, Amaya.</p><p>No. Weaken.</p><p>Azriel?</p><p>She\u2019s right. It\u2019ll weaken him. He paused. But it will also kill him if she goes too far.</p><p>His mental tones suggested this might not be such a bad thing. Anger rolled through me, but I ignored it. I had bigger battles to fight right now.</p><p>I stopped moving, drew my sword, and held her\u2014point first\u2014in front of me. Lilac flames began to roll down her sides, and her hissing became filled with anticipation.</p><p>Okay, Amaya, I said. Do what you have to do to drain his energy. But don\u2019t kill him.</p><p>Kill not. It was somewhat begrudgingly said.</p><p>Her flames leapt from her shadowed blade, then raced across to the elemental and ran up one tree-trunk leg. Her lilac fire contrasted sharply against the red and gold flames of the elemental as she ringed the creature\u2019s rotund belly. For several seconds nothing happened; then, as Amaya began to hum softly\u2014almost contentedly\u2014her steel began to vibrate and the flames around the creature\u2019s stomach suddenly seemed less incandescent.</p><p>The creature never stopped moving, however, and the closer it got, the hotter it got, until I stood in the middle of a firestorm that tore at my hair and burned my skin. Until I felt as much a creature of fire as the one who was now only feet away from Amaya\u2019s tip. And yet, for all that it burned, the creature\u2019s heat didn\u2019t destroy me, and this close, it should have. Whatever my sword was doing, it was working.</p><p>\u201cTao,\u201d I screamed, more out of fear than any real need to raise my voice above the roar of the flames that swept around me. \u201cYou must get control of the elemental again.\u201d</p><p>The creature growled\u2014an ungodly sound that came from somewhere out of its flaming middle\u2014and swiped at me. I didn\u2019t move\u2014I didn\u2019t dare, lest I break the contact Amaya had with the elemental\u2014but the blow never struck. It stopped inches from my ear, the heat of it singeing hair but not actually touching skin. The creature roared again, and this time, it was a sound of frustration. The vibration in Amaya\u2019s steel grew stronger, and fingers of dullness were quickly spreading from the creature\u2019s belly to the rest of its body.</p><p>If you\u2019re going to touch the elemental, do so now, Azriel said, his voice barely hinting at the anger and concern I could feel within him. If Amaya drinks too much more of the creature\u2019s power, she will kill both the creature and Tao.</p><p>Amaya, don\u2019t, I warned.</p><p>Fun, she grumbled. You not.</p><p>I snorted softly, then, as the creature roared and took another swipe at me, raised my hand and caught the flaming paw. This time, my skin did burn, and I screamed.</p><p>Risa! Do not expect me to stand here and see you harmed\u2014</p><p>I can, I cut in fiercely. And you will.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I gritted my teeth against the agony and the screams that pressed up my throat and gripped the fiery paw harder. For several seconds, nothing happened, and I began to wonder if Azriel was right. Maybe Tao was lost and I was burning my hand for absolutely no reason. Then, suddenly, my fingers were touching flesh rather than heat. I opened my eyes. The flames were receding\u2014grudgingly, but retreating nevertheless\u2014from the point where my fingers clasped Tao\u2019s hand. His fingers twitched, then convulsed around mine, his grip fierce. It hurt like hell, but I didn\u2019t say anything, biting my lip and blinking back tears as the flames continued to retreat, first up his arm and then across his shoulders, revealing his head and upper body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Amaya, release him.</p><p>No; want.</p><p>Do it, I said. Now!</p> <p>She hissed her displeasure, but her flames unfurled from Tao\u2019s waist and dropped to the ground, slinking back to her blade with some reluctance.</p><p>As the remaining flames flickered and died, Tao opened his eyes and blinked. Then awareness surged, and horror spread across his pale, thin face.</p><p>\u201cOh god, Ris,\u201d he said, voice hoarse and raw. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d</p><p>I quickly sheathed Amaya and tried not to think about the agony radiating from my left hand\u2014a hard thing to do given it was so bad, all I wanted to do was throw up. \u201cNothing that can\u2019t be\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut the rest of the sentence off as he collapsed, and I lunged forward to catch him. Azriel got there before me. He slung Tao like a sack over his shoulder, then swung around to face me.</p> <p>\u201cYour hand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can heal it when I change to Aedh form,\u201d I said, barely resisting the urge to cradle my hand and weep like hell. \u201cLet\u2019s just get Tao home and worry about me later.\u201d</p><p>Azriel didn\u2019t look at all happy, but he merely nodded and disappeared from sight. I took a deep breath and glanced at my hand. Bad mistake. All I saw was a raw and swollen mess, and the pain\u2014which had been bad enough up until that point\u2014became overwhelming. A chill swept me, I began to shake, and my legs went from underneath me. But even as I hit the ground, my stomach rose, and I threw up.</p><p>Then Azriel was there, holding me, supporting me. The heat of his presence fanned through my body; a warmth and strength chased the weakness from my flesh and snatched the pain from my burned and blistered hand.</p><p>Eventually, I pulled away and glanced down. Though it was still red and tender, my hand was no longer blistered or weeping, and I could flex my fingers without pain. My gaze rose to Azriel\u2019s. \u201cThank you for healing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad that I could.\u201d He brushed the sweaty strands of hair from my eyes, but despite the tenderness of his touch, there was anger in his expression. \u201cYou should not have endangered yourself that way, Risa. It could have ended very differently.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it didn\u2019t.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cWhere did you take him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome, as you wanted. I brought Ilianna in to tend to him.\u201d He placed a hand under my elbow and gently pulled me upright. \u201cAnd we should go. The police are coming.\u201d</p><p>I glanced past him and saw the approaching red and blue lights of the emergency vehicles. \u201cAt least no one got hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one but you,\u201d he commented, as he wrapped his arm around my waist and swept us from flesh to energy form. He didn\u2019t immediately release me when we reappeared in the living room, simply continued to hold me close.</p><p>My gaze rose to his again, and there was an intensity, a ferocity, that had my heart doing an odd sort of dance. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said, almost breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cDo not ever ask me to do something like that again,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I will not.\u201d</p><p>Annoyance flared. I tried to step back, but his grip tightened around my waist, pressing me closer. \u201cDamn it, Azriel. He\u2019s my friend\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I mean nothing to you?\u201d he cut in, his voice flat and even despite the fierceness that radiated from every inch of his being.</p> <p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I know,\u201d he cut in again, \u201cis that the link between us has evolved into something far stronger than a mere exchange of thoughts. I will not feel your agony like that again and not do anything about it.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught somewhere in my throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t have cared if you had.\u201d His voice was grim. \u201cI\u2019m just giving you warning never to ask that of me again.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and released it slowly. \u201cOkay. But I also meant what I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I am under no illusions where I stand when it come to your friends.\u201d</p><p>The edge of bitterness in his voice stung deep inside. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Azriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet it is nevertheless true.\u201d He released me and stepped back. \u201cGo tend to Tao.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut me off with a short, sharp motion. \u201cYou have what you wanted, Risa.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he disappeared, leaving me standing there feeling angry, confused, and oddly hurt.</p><p>\u201cRisa?\u201d Ilianna said.</p><p>I forced a smile and turned around. \u201cHow\u2019s Tao?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnconscious.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t be better. Is Tao going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Her expression was concerned. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on between you and Azriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d And everything. \u201cIs there anything I can do to help Tao?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best thing you can do is get some sleep. You look like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, I want you to get some rest. The last thing I need is to be looking after two of you. Especially given what a grouchy and unpleasant patient you can be.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cI love you, too. Give me a yell if you need anything or he wakes, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>I turned and headed for my bedroom.</p><p>\u201cRis?\u201d</p><p>I paused and looked over my shoulder. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cRemember that Azriel isn\u2019t human. You can\u2019t expect him to react the way any human\u2014or non-human, for that matter\u2014would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything of him, Ilianna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cHe\u2019s here for one reason only\u2014the keys. He needs to secure them for his side, and he needs me to do it. No matter what I may or may not feel for him, that\u2019s the one truth that can never be ignored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if it\u2019s no longer the only truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only truth that matters. In the end, he has his world, and I have mine, and as the saying goes, never the twain shall meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need to trust fate a little bit more. Or maybe you just need to enjoy what you currently have and not worry about the future.\u201d</p><p>How could I not worry about the future when the reality was I might not have one? \u201cFate is the one that got us into this mess, Ilianna. I\u2019m not trusting her to get us out of it.\u201d I waved a hand. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>With that, I went to bed and\u2014surprisingly, given how much sleep I\u2019d already had that day\u2014slept.</p><p>A death march tone woke me. I groaned and rolled over onto my back, rubbing the sleep from my eyes and cursing the idiot on the phone for waking me. Then it twigged that the idiot was Hunter, and I lunged to answer it. But I hit the VOICE ONLY button\u2014I had a feeling she wouldn\u2019t appreciate learning that I was still in bed.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t received the crime-scene report yet,\u201d I said, glancing at the clock. It was nine in the morning\u2014no wonder my stomach was grumbling. What little I\u2019d eaten yesterday, I\u2019d thrown up last night. \u201cSo I really haven\u2019t got much more to report than what I\u2019ve already said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of discussing either your report or the Directorate\u2019s,\u201d she replied, voice snappish. Definitely not in a happy mood this morning.</p><p>But then, was she ever?</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re ringing me because . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause another card was found in the pocket of the second victim\u2014this one for the Blue Angels.\u201d</p><p>Which Rhoan would have no doubt already checked out. And I couldn\u2019t see the point in me doubling his work, especially given if he had found anything worthwhile, it would have been in his report. And she, subsequently, would now be hunting down the bitch behind the kills. All of which I wanted to say, but wisely refrained. \u201cIs there any connection between the two clubs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is, actually. They both hired last-minute replacements from the same booking agency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather the Directorate has talked to the agency involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cAnd so have I.\u201d</p><p>Poor them. \u201cAnd . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told the agency owner to inform me of all last-minute requests for musicians,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAnd he just did.\u201d</p><p>Hence the reason for the call. Wonderful. I scrubbed a hand across my eyes and flicked the blankets off me. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not sending the Directorate to check her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhoan hasn\u2019t your reaper, nor your ability to sense dark spirits.\u201d</p><p>The Directorate witches had the latter, if not the former. But again, I held the comment back. She didn\u2019t want the Directorate to find this killer\u2014she wanted me to, so that she could then get her revenge. And what Hunter wanted, Hunter usually got.</p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p>I walked into the bathroom. Having a pee while talking on the phone wasn\u2019t something I usually did, but it was oddly appropriate when it came to Hunter\u2014if only because I wished I could so easily flush her from my life.</p><p>\u201cSo where is the stand-in going to be playing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be at the Hallowed Ground from midday today.\u201d</p><p>Which at least explained why Hunter wasn\u2019t going to interview the woman herself. She might be an extremely old vampire\u2014and therefore able to stand far more sunshine than most\u2014but the lunchtime hours were still as deadly to her as sunlight was to any of them. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a little unusual for nightclubs to be open during the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHallowed Ground has been around for a long time.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cIt is a haunt for those who might otherwise be alone during daylight restrictions.\u201d</p><p>Dread filled me. \u201cDoes that mean it\u2019s another blood whore club?\u201d And if it was, why were they bothering to provide musical entertainment? It wasn\u2019t like the addicted vampires would care about anything other than getting their next fix.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, voice cool but still holding an edge that sent chills down my spine. \u201cAlthough it wouldn\u2019t matter if it was. You would still be going.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was never any doubt about that. \u201cI\u2019ll report back the minute I talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she is the one\u2014report sooner.\u201d</p><p>Or else, her tone implied. I was suddenly grateful I\u2019d had the foresight not to use the vid-phone. \u201cFine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMake sure you talk to the owner, not the manager. He is next to useless.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at the odd edge of amusement in her voice. There was something going on that I didn\u2019t understand. But I didn\u2019t bother questioning her because she had already hung up.</p><p>I tossed the phone onto the vanity, then had a quick shower. Once dressed, I headed into Tao\u2019s room. And noted, with some annoyance, that Azriel had yet to make his appearance. Apparently, when reapers were in a snit, they did it properly.</p><p>Ilianna was asleep on the chair next to Tao\u2019s bed, but started awake when I walked in. I grimaced. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>She waved the apology away, then rubbed at her neck as she sat upright. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be up, anyway. I promised I\u2019d ring Carwyn to confirm tonight\u2019s date.\u201d</p> <p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re actually going?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI told you I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I figured last-minute nerves might step in and stop you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s no avoiding it. Mirri\u2019s right.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cBesides, he and I are destined to be, so I have to be honest with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDestined?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I saw a long time ago.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned. \u201cJust because you foresaw this union happening doesn\u2019t mean you should let it override your own feelings for Mirri\u2014\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt won\u2019t. You should know me better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why all this \u2018destined to be\u2019 shit? How much pressure is your dad putting on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots, but I can understand his reasons\u2014a union with Carwyn has financial advantages for both families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? What you and Mirri have is more important than anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may be in love, but we are also mares. It is a fact of life that mares end up in the herd of a stallion, whether we like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, totally.\u201d She gave me a somewhat wan smile. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve done my best to avoid the whole situation, but the reality is, I have little choice. If I reject Carwyn, it\u2019ll be some other stallion\u2014and maybe someone far less understanding and patient than he seems to be.\u201d</p> <p>I sat on the arm of the chair and gave her a quick hug. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will work something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hopefully that something will be artificial insemination,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI am not going to bed with the man if I can at all avoid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why not suggest that? What have you got to lose?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cUm, have I mentioned he\u2019s a stallion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure even stallions are sometimes capable of thinking with their brain rather than their dicks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be betting on that,\u201d Tao muttered, his voice hoarse but nevertheless music to my ears. He opened bloodshot eyes and glared at us. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you two know it\u2019s not polite to be talking about sex when a man is trying to get some sleep?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cA werewolf complaining about people talking about sex. I think the world just ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it did for a while there.\u201d He closed his eyes and scrubbed a hand across his bristly jaw. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ilianna caught his free hand and squeezed it lightly. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. Just be damn sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how the fuck am I supposed to do that?\u201d His voice was a rich mix of anger, frustration, and fear. \u201cThis damn thing inside me is strong\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so are you,\u201d she snapped back. \u201cOr you would be, if you damn well stopped feeling so sorry for yourself and started taking the offense.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m fucking sitting back, issuing the elemental an open invitation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d she snapped. \u201cThen why the hell aren\u2019t you looking after yourself? Why aren\u2019t you eating? You were told at the Brindle that you must keep strong both physically and mentally if you wanted to keep this thing contained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not fucking hard enough. You have to get serious about it, Tao, or this thing will win.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cSo you\u2019ve seen that? Then what the hell is the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point,\u201d she said, jumping to her feet and clenching her fists, \u201cis that nothing is set in stone just yet, and I don\u2019t want you lost for eternity to flame. So, damn it, fight!\u201d</p><p>My breath caught at the anger and desperation in her voice. Whatever she\u2019d foreseen had been bad, and fear again stepped through me. I half reached out to her, but Tao beat me to it. He sat up abruptly, caught her hands, and tugged her into a hug that was as fierce as his expression was alarmed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI promise, I\u2019ll try harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking better.\u201d She returned his hug for a moment, then pulled back and punched his shoulder. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to prepare you the world\u2019s biggest steak sandwich, and you will consume every fucking inch of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She turned, gave me a weak smile, then headed out.</p><p>I waited until she\u2019d left, then met Tao\u2019s gaze. \u201cHow did the elemental get loose?\u201d</p><p>He half shrugged. \u201cOne minute I was heading outside to cool down; the next I\u2019m in some random field staring at you and realizing just how close I\u2019d come to cindering my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d I dropped down into the seat, then raised my hand. \u201cSee, not even the smallest of blisters to show for my ordeal.\u201d</p><p>He eyed my fingers for a moment, then said, \u201cI could hear you, you know, but I couldn\u2019t do anything. Not until you caught my hand and drew me out.\u201d</p><p>So I\u2019d been right\u2014touch was the key to breaking the elemental\u2019s control. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t hurt me, Tao.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did, and we both know it.\u201d He took a deep, somewhat unsteady breath and released it slowly. \u201cI think I\u2019ll remember your scream for the rest of my life. And it\u2019s because of that, more than anything, that I\u2019ll fight this thing.\u201d His gaze met mine. \u201cIt hates you, Ris. A witch created it to kill you, and the minute you spoke to it out there in the field, that\u2019s all it wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat it wanted was to return to the fire that created it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrimarily, yes. But if it regains control again, don\u2019t confront it. Because next time, I may not be able to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, as Ilianna so politely put it, make sure there isn\u2019t a next time.\u201d I rose to my feet, then leaned over and dropped a kiss on his cheek. \u201cGet better. I have to go hunt a dark spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter\u2019s still on your case, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You rest up, and maybe I\u2019ll regale you with the whole sordid tale when I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t\u2014if only because in order to tell a story about hunting a dark spirit, I\u2019d actually have to do it. I headed out to the kitchen. The smell of frying steak filled the air, and I took a deep breath, savoring the delicious aroma. My stomach rumbled happily. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose you\u2019re cooking one of those for me?\u201d</p><p>She glanced pointedly at the two waiting plates of buttered toast. \u201cI\u2019m vegetarian, remember?\u201d</p><p>I grinned as I plopped my butt on the kitchen counter. \u201cHey, you\u2019re going on a date with a stallion tonight, so miracles can definitely happen.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cNot twice in one day, they won\u2019t.\u201d She studied me for a minute. \u201cDid you sort out your shit with Azriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because he isn\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always around, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is? The fact that you\u2019re scared of your own feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIlianna, stop, okay?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cBetween you and Tao, I\u2019m going to end up gray before my time.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhy? What have you seen?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, like that sounded so convincing.\u201d I studied her for a minute. \u201cSo what, exactly, did you see in Tao\u2019s future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Nothing but flames.\u201d She stared at me, and all I saw was her fear. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to lose him, Ris.\u201d</p><p>No, we\u2019re fucking not. I forced a smile. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, fate is a bitch who enjoys her games. She\u2019s just as likely to do the opposite of what you fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope you\u2019re right.\u201d She poked the steak with a stiffened finger, then picked it up on a fork, slapped it onto a piece of toast, and handed it to me. \u201cWhat are you up to today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to check out a few museums, and then I\u2019m off hunting a dark spirit.\u201d</p><p>Ilianna\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cMuseums? You?\u201d</p><p>I waved a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not on a culture kick or anything. We\u2019re looking for the next key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Especially given what had happened last time I\u2019d found one of the keys. I was already in danger of losing Tao. I wasn\u2019t about to risk losing Ilianna as well. I slapped the second piece of toast over the steak, then grabbed the sandwich one-handed and got off the counter. \u201cIf I don\u2019t see you before tonight, enjoy your date.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cThe only way that\u2019ll happen is if I get totally plastered first. And I\u2019ve promised Mirri I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell her she\u2019s a spoilsport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have, trust me.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, I walked across to the dining table to transfer the search results from the computer to my phone, then walked into my bedroom to grab a coat and my purse.</p> <p>Once I\u2019d finished my sandwich, I stood in the middle of my room and said, \u201cSo, are you going to make an appearance, or is this snit going to continue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs Ilianna has already noted,\u201d he said, voice even, \u201cI am never very far away.\u201d</p><p>I swung around. He stood several feet away from me, his arms crossed and his expression back to its usual noncommittal self. \u201cThen why couldn\u2019t I sense you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cIf you\u2019ve always had the ability to stop me from sensing you, why haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I haven\u2019t always been able to.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. Definitely not the answer I\u2019d been expecting. \u201cThen why have you suddenly gained the ability?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the same reason you are catching more of my thoughts and emotions than I might otherwise wish. The closer our link becomes, the more it opens some . . . abilities and closes down others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning it\u2019s a two-way street?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>Meaning yes. I briefly wondered just what it meant for me other than more insight into his thoughts and feelings, but I knew him well enough by now to know he was never going to tell me that sort of information. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t stop it from happening?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He regarded me steadily for a moment. \u201cWe are going in search of the next key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. As scary as Hunter is, she has nothing on the Raziq. If I don\u2019t start actively trying to find the keys, they just might stop threatening and start doing.\u201d</p><p>And Tao and Ilianna would be their first targets; of that I had no doubt.</p><p>A chill ran through me, although I wasn\u2019t entirely sure whether it was the thought of my friends coming under attack from the Raziq, or a premonition of trouble of another kind headed their way. Fast.</p><p>\u201cHow do you wish to travel to Ballarat?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, very tempted to ride the Ducati there and tell him where to shove it until he got over the moodiness, but I really didn\u2019t have the luxury of time. Not if that premonition was to be believed.</p><p>\u201cYou can take me, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Amusement briefly touched his lips, and there was something close to mischief shining in the blue of his eyes. \u201cOh, I would like.\u201d</p> <p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you better, reaper, I\u2019d think not only was that a double entendre, but you were flirting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReapers don\u2019t flirt.\u201d He stepped close and wrapped an arm around my waist. His body was warm against mine, his touch tender and yet oddly possessive. \u201cIt is merely a truth I cannot deny.\u201d</p><p>I rose up on my toes and said, my lips so close to his that I could almost taste him, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that you want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the very first moment that I saw you,\u201d he murmured; then his lips met mine and he kissed me fiercely and very thoroughly as his energy rose and swept us through the gray fields to the chill of Ballarat. Not that I actually felt, in any way, cold. Such a thing wasn\u2019t possible when Azriel\u2019s arms were still around me.</p><p>\u201cGod, get a room, will you?\u201d a woman muttered as she walked past us.</p><p>I laughed softly and stepped back. His hand slipped from my waist, and my hormones mourned the loss. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the Aboriginal Culture Centre.\u201d</p><p>I turned around. The building was modern in style, all concrete and glass, and painted in colors that reminded me of the outback\u2014reds, gold, pinks, and browns. I frowned. \u201cThis really doesn\u2019t look like a museum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is something we cannot be sure of until we go inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I half shrugged and headed for the entrance, paying the fee for both of us but refusing the guided tour. It was interesting to look around, but there was nothing in this place for us.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, once we were back out. \u201cThat was a waste of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least there is one less option on the list.\u201d He pressed warm fingers against my spine, gently guiding me away from the cultural center. \u201cWhat do you wish to do now?\u201d</p><p>I pulled out my phone and glanced at my list. \u201cLet\u2019s try the Aviation Museum. That\u2019s probably the next least likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d He wrapped his arms around my waist again and took us there. The museum, it turned out, was a big tin shed.</p><p>\u201cIt is also not open,\u201d he commented</p><p>It certainly looked that way. The huge sliding doors that ran almost the entire length of the building were closed, and the tarmac forecourt was empty. I grabbed my phone, brought up the files I\u2019d transferred, and checked the opening time. \u201cWhat sort of museum is open only on weekends and public holidays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one, obviously.\u201d</p><p>There was amusement in his voice. I smiled and lightly nudged him with my elbow. \u201cThat was a rhetorical question, not one that wanted an answer.\u201d</p><p>I scanned the outside of the building. Though I couldn\u2019t see any physical guards, there were plenty of cameras on the outside and no doubt plenty of security measures on the inside. \u201cI might just take Aedh form and have a quick look around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the second key is in there, you will not sense it in Aedh form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but at least we\u2019ll know if the place has any sort of military weapons on display.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresuming it is a military dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Given the cryptic nature of the clues, who actually knew?</p><p>I called to the Aedh, and she swept through me in an instant. In energy form, I made my way through the fence, across the tarmac, and through the small gap underneath the massive doors. The shed was huge and filled to the brim with all sorts of old-looking airplanes\u2014some single wing, some double wing, some with propellers and others without. I didn\u2019t know much about planes overall, but I had a feeling this collection was pretty impressive. There were also engines, various machine parts, and tools. But nothing that resembled an actual dagger. I turned around and headed out.</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d Azriel said, as I became flesh again.</p><p>\u201cNot as far as I can tell.\u201d I rubbed my arms against the chill in the air. \u201cI guess we should try the Eureka Centre next. If the dagger isn\u2019t there, then we\u2019re left with Sovereign Hill being the most likely location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you do not think it is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve been known to be wrong before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it best I not say anything about that particular point.\u201d</p><p>I grinned and wrapped my arms loosely around his neck. \u201cWise man.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as his hand came around my waist again, but he didn\u2019t say anything, just swept us across to the Eureka Centre. Which was also closed\u2014for renovations, this time.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit,\u201d I said, staring at the sign on the door.</p><p>\u201cWhich leaves us with Sovereign Hill, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s too big to check right now.\u201d I briefly glanced at my watch. \u201cWe\u2019ve got only an hour and a half before we have to be at Hallowed Ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you wish to do?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated and stared up at the huge blue flag with its famous five eight-point stars that formed a cross in the middle of it. Though it was now a symbol of democracy and protest, it had originally been designed as a flag of war, and it was that symbol that spoke to me now. In very many ways I was in the middle of a war myself and, like the men who had fought under her on this very hill, my war was one I suspected could not be won. Not by me, anyway.</p><p>I pushed the rather gloomy thought away and swung around to look at Ballarat. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe we should wander down to the Visitors Center, on the off chance there\u2019s something the search missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish to walk?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, then nodded and headed down the hill. He fell in step beside me, his arm brushing against mine and sending little slithers of desire skittering through me. It was, I thought with amusement, an almost normal moment in a life that had become insane.</p><p>With a little help from Google Maps, we found the Visitors Center and headed inside. It was, as was usual with these sorts of places, filled to the brim with information and souvenirs as well as local food and clothing. The thick jackets, I noted with amusement, seemed to be particularly popular today.</p><p>I walked across to the wall of information about local events, and almost immediately a brochure caught my eye. I picked it up and showed Azriel. \u201cWell, looky here\u2014an Arms and Militaria Exhibition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the one place we are certain to find military daggers. Whether it is the right place is another question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd one we won\u2019t answer until we go see it.\u201d I flicked the brochure around. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t open until tomorrow and runs until Sunday. At least that gives us plenty of time to check it out.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd plenty of time for your father to come up with a way of keeping the sorcerer and the Raziq out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I tucked the brochure into my pocket and glanced at the time. \u201cI guess we can head to Hallowed Ground. Maybe we\u2019ll get lucky and she\u2019ll start her set early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuck has not been particularly favorable to us as yet,\u201d Azriel commented, as he caught my hand and drew me closer. There was something in the way he looked at me that had my pulse racing. \u201cAnd I can think of other, more pleasurable ways to fill in our time.\u201d</p><p>A smile teased my lips. \u201cCan you, now? And what about the snit you were in not so long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather talk yet again about the reasons for the snit?\u201d he said, voice soft as he slid an arm around my waist. \u201cOr perhaps explore the possibilities of a rather quaint human expression that goes something along the lines of makeup sex being the best kind?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHard choice,\u201d I murmured, pressing myself against the warm, hard planes of his body. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never really had the chance to test that expression out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps we should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, here?\u201d I raised an eyebrow and glanced around the Visitors Center. \u201cI might have werewolf blood in me, but I\u2019m not that much of an exhibitionist.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled and touched my cheek gently. \u201cI meant in your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect\u2014\u201d</p><p>His energy swept around me even before I could finish my sentence.</p><p>And I have to say, that old saying was right. Makeup sex was the best kind.</p><p>Needless to say, we did not arrive at Hallowed Ground on time. In fact, we were a good twenty minutes late. The club was situated on the corner of Wellington Parade and Simpson Street, not far away from what most Melbournians considered hallowed ground\u2014the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The club was situated in a rather unusual two-story, redbrick building that had an old-fashioned concrete turret on one corner and small sash windows at regularly spaced intervals. The entrance was nondescript, and it would have been easy to pass by and think it was nothing more than an apartment entrance. Certainly, the small, discreet sign above the door did little to give it away.</p> <p>Azriel opened the white-painted wood and glass door and ushered me inside. Darkness greeted me, and it took a moment for my eyes to adjust. The room was midsized, with a bar to the right and a stage at the back of the room. A thin woman with an oddly ragged red streak running through the middle of her dark hair was spotlighted on the stage. She was playing some sort of lute, and the music was strange and yet somehow evocative. There were more than a dozen people sitting at the various tables scattered throughout the room, and most of them had their eyes closed, listening with something close to rapture in their expressions.</p><p>I walked across to one of the tables sitting in the deeper shadows of the room and pulled out the chair. \u201cIs she a dark spirit?\u201d</p><p>Azriel hesitated, studying her as he sat down next to me. \u201cIt is difficult to tell. She has some sort of shield around her.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cMeaning you can\u2019t break past it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could, but then she would sense that I am here. Spirits may not be the normal prey of dark angels, but they generally will not take a chance and remain in our presence if they sense us.\u201d</p><p>I studied her for a moment, noting her long, thin fingers and sharply pointed fingernails. Handy for plucking lute strings . . . or slicing stomach flesh, I thought, and shivered.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would she have a shield up if she wasn\u2019t up to no good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is sitting in a room filled with vampires, many of whom are not above using their telepathic powers to seduce or influence the thoughts of others. It is natural she would have some means to protect herself from such events.\u201d</p><p>That did make sense. I continued to frown at the woman on the stage. There was something about her that made my nerves crawl, but maybe that was nothing more than my desire for this hunt to be easy.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have to take a break soon. We can interview her when she does.\u201d I leaned back in my chair and glanced at Azriel. He was little more than shadow in this darkness, but his eyes shone brightly\u2014almost as brightly as his sword. \u201cWhy is Valdis reacting? Amaya\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Can, she said.</p><p>No. The last thing I wanted was her hissing like a banshee in my brain.</p><p>Banshee not. Her tone was a trifle huffy. Maybe she\u2019d been taking lessons from Azriel.</p><p>\u201cI had good reason for the huffiness,\u201d he replied evenly. \u201cAnd I thought we\u2019d moved past that.\u201d</p> <p>My eyebrows rose. \u201cYou heard her?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThrough you. And a banshee is a spirit; she\u2019s a demon.\u201d</p><p>Better, Amaya grouched.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cTell me, do all demon swords have such attitude?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThe attitude of the sword very much depends on the attitude of the owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying I\u2019m a sweet-tempered, silver-tongued woman?\u201d</p><p>He caught my hand in his, drew it to his lips, and kissed it. \u201cWould I dare say anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe I am merely in an exceptionally good mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood sweaty sex will do that to you every time,\u201d I replied, voice wry.</p><p>His smile grew, touching the corners of his eyes and making my heart do several little happy skips. \u201cThen perhaps I should get in a snit more often.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. The sound seemed to echo softly through the darkness, and the woman on the stage turned to look at us. Though she didn\u2019t move, there was an almost imperceptible tightening in her shoulder and arm muscles.</p><p>\u201cShe knows what I am.\u201d Azriel squeezed my hand, then released me. \u201cGet ready to move. I believe she\u2019s about to finish her set.\u201d</p><p>The woman on the stage finished the song she was playing, then rose and bowed to the audience. They didn\u2019t immediately respond, but as the spotlight died and she walked from the stage, it was as if a spell had been released and they all began to clap\u2014some conservatively, some not.</p><p>I rose and wove my way through the tables, planning to cut the woman off before she could slip backstage. She was moving deceptively fast, however, and slipped through the curtains and disappeared from sight. I swore softly and ran forward, flipping the curtains aside and following the sound of her retreating steps down a dark corridor. Somewhere up ahead, a door opened and closed. I slowed.</p><p>Valdis\u2019s blue fire flickered across the walls, highlighting the peeling paint and dusty cobwebs. I shivered, not wanting to think about webs when I was chasing a woman whose alternate form could well be the world\u2019s biggest spider.</p><p>\u201cI cannot sense her presence in the room ahead,\u201d Azriel said.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean she\u2019s escaped us? Or is it simply a matter of the shield continuing to block you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be either.\u201d</p><p>Meaning the only way we were going to find out was to enter that damn room. I flexed my fingers and opened the door. Nothing immediately jumped out at me, but the room was pitch-black and my reluctance to enter grew.</p><p>I reached to the left and brushed my hand down the wall, looking for the light switch. Something skittered across my fingertips, and I yelped and jumped backward\u2014straight into Azriel. He grabbed my arms and steadied me.</p><p>\u201cIt was only a small spider,\u201d he said.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s big or small; they\u2019re all spiders and they all deserve to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpiders are generally harmless creatures.\u201d</p><p>He reached past me. A second later, I heard the light switch being flicked up and down. No light came on, so the bulb was obviously blown.</p><p>\u201cCan I remind you that this is Australia? We have some of the deadliest spiders known to man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does not alter the fact that the one that touched you didn\u2019t actually harm you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the point.\u201d I stared at the darkness a moment longer, then drew Amaya and took a wary step. Lilac flame flared down her sides, providing enough light to view the immediate area. The room was small and furnished sparsely. There was a dressing table with an office chair in front of it, as well as a small sofa and a minibar fridge. I stepped farther inside and swung Amaya around. There was nothing and no one else in the room. Our musician had fled.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess that points to her\u2014\u201d Something dropped onto the back of my neck, and I swiped at it irritably. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Something else dropped, but this time it raced under the collar of my shirt and down my spine. I yelped and flung myself backward at the wall, hoping to squash the hell out of whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cRisa, I think we\u2019d better get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>I gulped, my heart in my mouth and fear twisting my stomach. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>But I knew why even as I asked the question. There were more than just a couple of spiders in this room. I raised Amaya and looked up.</p><p>The entire ceiling was alive and moving.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>I opened my mouth to scream, but before I could, the whole damn lot dropped down, covering both the floor and me in a mass of tiny black bodies.</p><p>Horror filled me, and for a moment I couldn\u2019t move, frozen to the spot and praying like hell that this was nothing more than a nightmare. Then thousands of tiny fangs began to dig into my flesh, and I screamed and jumped and swung Amaya around wildly, swatting at the creatures I could barely even see.</p><p>Azriel pulled me into his arms, then swept us away. We reappeared in my bathroom, but it wasn\u2019t enough. I could still feel the fangs. I raced under the shower, throwing off my clothes and stomping on the black bodies that fell like rain around me. Despite the heat of the water, I was shivering like crazy, and my skin crawled with the sensation of movement.</p><p>\u201cAre there any left?\u201d I asked, spinning around almost wildly, trying to spot the creepy little bastards.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Azriel caught my arm and made me stop. \u201cThey\u2019re gone. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered. \u201cIt still feels like they\u2019re on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cBut we should go back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no way in hell I\u2019m going back into that room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d let me finish a sentence occasionally,\u201d he said, voice a mix of amusement and annoyance, \u201cI was going to suggest you talk to the manager while I investigate the room to see if the woman left anything behind in her haste to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I gulped down some air in an attempt to calm my still-racing pulse. \u201cThat I can do. Just wait until I get dressed.\u201d</p><p>He handed me a towel. \u201cI was not intending otherwise.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you better, reaper, I\u2019d suggest there was an almost propitiatory note in your voice when you said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you would be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I started shagging Lucian again, you wouldn\u2019t care?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gave me a look. One that suggested I was being silly. I grinned.</p><p>\u201cThere is a vast difference between not caring about who sees your outer layer and whether you\u2019re with Lucian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Lucian aside, you wouldn\u2019t care if I found myself another lover?\u201d</p> <p>He crossed his arms, his expression giving little away. But tiny flickers of annoyance danced both along Valdis\u2019s sides and through the outer reaches of my mind, a sure sign that he was not as calm as he appeared. \u201cThat is not your intention, so why bring it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s sometimes amusing to see your very human reactions.\u201d I rose on my toes and kissed him. \u201cAnd now I\u2019ll get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would like to point out that the workings of your mind are sometimes incomprehensible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean I sometimes make sense?\u201d I brushed past him, dumped the wet towel down the laundry chute, then headed for my wardrobe.</p><p>His gaze followed me, a caress that sent a tingly warmth skittering all the way down to my toes. It was certainly a more welcome sensation than the tiny tickles of thousands of spidery feet.</p> <p>\u201cOccasionally. Very occasionally.\u201d</p><p>I grinned again. \u201cJust think how boring your life would be without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cPossibly more than is wise.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a glance. \u201cSo you\u2019re actually going to miss me when this assignment is over and you leave?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated again, and my amusement died. Hesitation was not what I\u2019d expected. Not now. Not after all that had happened between us. And yet, as Ilianna had so rightly pointed out, the future was not something I should be worrying about right now. But, at the same time, how could I not when it came to him and me? Because I didn\u2019t want him to leave. Not now, not ever.</p><p>Yet that was the one thing that was never in doubt.</p> <p>I ignored the ache that accompanied the thought and quickly waved a hand. \u201cSorry. Dumb question. Forget it.\u201d</p><p>I turned and grabbed the nearest clothing item. It turned out to be a short jean skirt that was more suited to summer than the chill of a day like today, but what the hell. I teamed it with a thick cashmere sweater that hugged me in all the right places, then wondered who I was trying to impress. Azriel certainly couldn\u2019t care one way or another what I was wearing.</p><p>Once I\u2019d pulled on tall leather boots, brushed my hair, and grabbed my handbag, I turned around and gave him a bright smile. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisa\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off with a sharp motion. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Azriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hardly not worry about it when you are.\u201d He caught my hand and drew me toward him. But he didn\u2019t kiss me, didn\u2019t do any of those things that a human\u2014or non-human\u2014male might have done. Instead, he said, \u201cThe future is in a vast state of disarray right now. No one, not even those of us whose duty it is to know the future of everyone who lives on this plane, can guess at where this quest might lead.\u201d</p><p>My gaze searched his. \u201cMeaning death is becoming more and more likely?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and gently brushed a stray strand of damp hair from my eyes. \u201cIt has always been a possibility.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet you got angry when I said my death might be a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there is a huge difference between taking one\u2019s own life and a death that has been foretold. I would not like to see you end up as one of the lost ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s not like I\u2019d want that, either.\u201d Yet I couldn\u2019t shake the notion that that possibility was still on the table. I sighed. \u201cAs I said, let\u2019s forget it. We need to go talk to the people at Hallowed Ground before bitch-face rings and blasts me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer time will come,\u201d he said. \u201cHave no fear of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I hope I\u2019m still around to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect that even if you are not instrumental in the event, you will at least be there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd no, I will not say more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was and am,\u201d he said grimly; then his energy swept through us, zipping us across to the Hallowed Ground in no time at all.</p><p>He dropped me in front of the place, then disappeared again before I could question him. I cursed him softly and headed inside the club. Though there was no entertainer onstage, the club had lost none of its patrons. But I guess that wasn\u2019t surprising given it was barely one thirty and most of them were vampires. I walked across to the bar and showed the man idly polishing glasses my badge. \u201cI need to talk to someone about the fill-in entertainer you hired today.\u201d</p><p>The bartender\u2014a balding, pot-bellied vampire who smelled of an odd mix of garlic and alcohol\u2014shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you, love. Not my line of work, that, and I don\u2019t talk to the entertainers much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even briefly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A non-chatty bartender was not what I needed right now. \u201cWhat about the owner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who hired the replacement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be Harry, the manager.\u201d Amusement lit his brown eyes. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t ask for the manager, now, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it could have been taken as a given, seeing I asked to talk to whoever was in charge,\u201d I said, barely holding back the annoyance in my voice.</p><p>\u201cAh, but you see, if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned over my many years of working in non-human establishments, it\u2019s that you should never take anything as a given or anyone at face value.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich isn\u2019t bad advice in general.\u201d I hesitated, remembering Hunter\u2019s warning, then gave a mental shrug. If she wanted answers, then I had to question the people who were here, whether she liked it or not. \u201cCan I speak to Harry, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. He\u2019s in the office down past the end of the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and his gaze followed me, burning a hole in the middle of my spine as I headed down. I had a feeling that it would be a bad mistake to think he was as meek and as mild as he appeared.</p><p>The office door was open, and the vampire inside\u2014a man with ebony skin and dark hair\u2014looked up before I could knock. His eyes were an almost incandescent green that glowed brightly against his skin.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d</p><p>Obviously, the bartender had psychically warned his boss of my presence. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand toward the somewhat scruffy leather chair on the other side of his desk. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>I sat down. \u201cThe fill-in entertainer you hired today.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI can tell you one thing: She won\u2019t be coming back. She did a runner well before her set was finished.\u201d He studied me for a second, something close to amusement in his eyes. \u201cSeems someone scared her off.\u201d</p><p>And I had a feeling he knew it was me. \u201cUnfortunate, given I need to speak to her.\u201d</p><p>I showed him my badge, and his eyebrows rose. \u201cSo we are hiring werewolves these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, just me. You could say I\u2019m special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I, now?\u201d He leaned back in his chair and studied me for several seconds before adding, \u201cAnd did they give you the nano microcells you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</p><p>The amusement I\u2019d glimpsed in his eyes was definitely evident in his voice, and I had to wonder what the hell was going on. \u201cNo, they are a means of self-preservation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they keep Hunter out?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t felt him attempting to read my mind, but then, with the best telepaths, you didn\u2019t. \u201cMostly.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cProbably as much as it has kept you out.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI can read only the occasional surface thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs can she, and usually the worst possible ones.\u201d</p><p>His smile grew as he leaned forward and offered me his hand. \u201cHarry Stanford, at your service.\u201d</p><p>His grip was firm, but not overpowering. A vampire who was confident in his own strength and who saw no need to display it\u2014unlike Hunter.</p><p>I studied him for several seconds, mulling over our brief conversation, then said, a little hesitantly, \u201cAre you, by chance, on the high council yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where would you get that idea, young lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it is a good one.\u201d He picked up a pen and began to tap the table lightly.</p><p>Unease slithered through me, and my pulse rate began to skip\u2014never a good thing when cornered in a small room with a vampire.</p><p>\u201cAnd, uh, were you on the side of those who thought I could be of use to the council, or one of the ones who thought it would be better for all concerned if I were killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. I could not see the sense in killing you before we\u2019d explored and discussed all possible outcomes.\u201d A half smile touched his lips. \u201cAnd I would never, under any circumstance, side with Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Great. He hated Hunter, and I was here under her orders.</p><p>\u201cNever fear,\u201d he said, almost jovially. \u201cThere is no point in killing the messenger when it is the master I would rather see dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you did attempt to harm her,\u201d Azriel said, voice flat but nevertheless deadly. He rested a hand on my left shoulder as he reappeared beside me. \u201cYou would be dead before you even left your chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the reaper himself. I was wondering when you\u2019d turn up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am never far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He studied the two of us for a moment, then said, \u201cYou do realize, don\u2019t you, that Hunter has no intention of ever letting you off her leash? Her plans for you are vast, and the keys play only a minor part of that.\u201d</p><p>The keys were hardly a minor part when the earth risked being overrun either by the denizens of hell or unhappy souls unable to move on. \u201cI got that impression. But, for the moment, I need her. Or rather, I need her resources.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His snort was disparaging. \u201cWhat, to find your mother\u2019s murderer? Do you honestly think she has any intention of allowing that? Or that she even cares, now that she has what she wants? You, in her pocket?\u201d</p><p>My unease grew. Why the hell was he saying all this? I had no damn idea\u2014but one thing was for sure. It couldn\u2019t be for any good reason. \u201cThere are Cazadors working\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was one. He found no clues, just as the Directorate found no clues. Your mother\u2019s killer might as well be a ghost, for all the evidence he left behind.\u201d</p> <p>I flexed my fingers, trying to relax, but it didn\u2019t help much. \u201cI agreed to help her if she helped me. I cannot back out of that arrangement.\u201d</p><p>Yet, I added silently.</p><p>\u201cNot unless you have the help of someone strong enough to rival her.\u201d</p><p>And there it was, I thought. The twist in the tale fate just loved applying to make my life even more interesting.</p><p>My smile was grim. \u201cI may not know much about the inside workings of the high council, but I do know that if you thought yourself her match, you could challenge her anytime you wanted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could, but that would be playing by the rules. She doesn\u2019t, so I see no reason for me to do so.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful. Another schemer. Just what I needed in my life right now. \u201cIf you\u2019re so powerful, how come you\u2019re the daytime manager of a club like this?\u201d I hesitated, then added rather hastily, \u201cNo offense meant.\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand\u2014an elegant gesture that nevertheless managed to highlight the muscular nature of his arms. \u201cIt amuses me to work here.\u201d</p><p>And it had the advantage of keeping him out of Hunter\u2019s eye, I suspected. Just as I suspected that this man was the reason for her warning about talking to anyone but the owner.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you saying all this to me?\u201d I asked, a little hesitantly. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid I\u2019ll tell Hunter? Or that she\u2019ll pick the conversation out of my thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I fear the former? No.\u201d He leaned forward and crossed his arms on the desk. \u201cAs to the latter, she is welcome to whatever remnants she can retrieve past those nano cells. She knows I plot, just as I know she plots. It is a game we have played for a very long time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not one I want to be in the middle of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet here you are, right in the middle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no. I\u2019m working for Hunter on a case, nothing more, nothing less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter intends to use you and the keys to become overlord of the council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. It was quite a pleasant smile compared to Hunter\u2019s, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t as cold-blooded and calculating as she was.</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I don\u2019t. I just believe that the council\u2014and the world in general\u2014would not only be better off if the gate situation remained as it is, but a hugely nicer place to live in without her polluting presence.\u201d</p><p>A sentiment I could totally agree with\u2014and I had to wonder if he was choosing his words to match whatever thoughts he might be catching.</p> <p>\u201cI see no point in falsehoods,\u201d he commented, thereby confirming that he was, indeed, catching some of my thoughts. \u201cEspecially when Hunter herself is my greatest asset when it comes to convincing others she must go.\u201d</p><p>Something else I could agree with. \u201cLook, I\u2019m really not interested in either your plans or Hunter\u2019s. I just want to do what I have to do to get free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you will not do without assistance.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but I very much suspect asking for your help would simply mean jumping from the frying pan into the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I am far more honorable than Hunter. And I, at least, am sane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s insane, then she\u2019s doing a good job of hiding it.\u201d I didn\u2019t like her. I didn\u2019t trust her. But she would hardly be head of the Directorate and a high-ranking member of the high vamp council if she was off her rocker. The vamps, at the very least, would not have stood for it.</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, she long ago mastered the art of hiding what she truly is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, of course, are a paragon of honesty.\u201d</p><p>He conceded that point with a regal incline of his head and a half smile. \u201cWell, you know where to find me if you change your mind. And I very much suspect you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t swear off drinking blood until that happens,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause you might well starve.\u201d</p><p>Amusement crinkled the corners of his brown eyes. \u201cI\u2019m tempted to ask if you\u2019d like to bet on that, but I suspect you are not the betting kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on stuff like this.\u201d I crossed my legs, and his gaze briefly dropped. It was only then I remembered I was wearing a short skirt. I cleared my throat softly, drawing his gaze upward again. \u201cCan we get back to the reason I\u2019m here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed we can.\u201d He leaned back in the chair again, his expression still amused. \u201cWhat do you wish to know about our Ms. Jodie Summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a start, have you used her before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Whenever we need to cover a shift, we simply ring the agency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that agency is Classique?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He reached to the left of his desk, picked up a business card, and handed it to me. It was the same card I\u2019d gotten from the manager at the other venue. I flipped the card over, but there was nothing written on the back. \u201cHave you got a contact there? I might have to talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither James Parred or Catherine Moore should be able to help you. I\u2019ve dealt with both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I tucked the card into my handbag. \u201cIs there anything you can tell me about Ms. Summer? Did you notice anything unusual about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside from the fact she was neither human, shifter, nor vampire, you mean?\u201d</p><p>I half smiled. \u201cYeah, besides that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because she had some sort of shield operating that I could not slip past.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cIt was neither a nano shield such as the one you wear, nor one of magic.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows rose. \u201cMeaning you have working knowledge of magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose of us who have been around a very long time do tend to become proficient in all manner of things.\u201d</p><p>Not just magic, then. And it did make me wonder what else Hunter had become proficient in. Beside killing and being a coldhearted bitch, that was.</p><p>He chuckled softly. \u201cIt is a wonder you\u2019re still alive if you\u2019re having those sorts of thoughts around Hunter. She can be somewhat highly strung when it comes to those who disrespect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, noticed that,\u201d I muttered, then got back to the business at hand. \u201cSo there\u2019s nothing else you can tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p><p>Meaning I was at another dead end. Hunter was not going to be pleased. I hesitated, then said, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could pull a picture of Ms. Summer from your security cameras?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you give us a couple of minutes, Jonathan will have a printout waiting for you at the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I rose. \u201cYou\u2019ve been most helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not as helpful as I could be,\u201d he said, expression back to being amused. He opened a drawer and drew out another business card. It was a simple card\u2014black background and white writing\u2014and said Harold Stanford, manager, Hallowed Ground, with a cell phone number underneath. \u201cJust in case you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>I accepted it somewhat reluctantly. \u201cI won\u2019t, you know.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt never hurts to have an escape option, Ms. Jones. That is all I am offering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for your time.\u201d I tucked the card in the side pocket of my handbag and headed out. Once I\u2019d collected the printout of our suspect, I walked back outside.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was fun,\u201d I said, making a beeline for the 7-Eleven several doors down from the club. I needed a Coke and chocolate fix to calm my still-quivering nerves.</p><p>Azriel fell in step beside me. \u201cInteresting is more the term I would use.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him sharply. \u201cYou believed his bullshit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he intends to oust Hunter from the council. I also believe he desires your help to do it.\u201d</p><p>A chime rang cheerfully as I entered the 7-Eleven. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I should trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you should. But it is certainly worthwhile keeping his offer in the back of your mind. Especially since I will not be around once the keys are found.\u201d</p><p>Him not being around was something I did not want to think about. \u201cI can hardly keep it in the front of my mind, given Hunter\u2019s predisposition for picking up all the wrong types of thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be well aware that you have talked to Stanford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m not going to rub her nose in it.\u201d I plucked a can of Coke from the refrigerator, but there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of choice when it came to smaller chocolate bars. After a couple of seconds\u2019 deliberation, I grabbed a Mars bar, then paid for them both at the self-service scanners. \u201cAnd I\u2019m certainly not going to mention the fact that he made me a counteroffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they are longtime foes, then she will guess what he will or will not have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I really don\u2019t want to be talking about Hunter right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you wish to talk about?\u201d He opened the door and ushered me outside, one hand pressed lightly against my spine.</p><p>\u201cNothing. How about we just walk down to the gardens so I can eat my chocolate and enjoy the quiet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? Requesting silence? A rare moment indeed.\u201d</p><p>I snorted and nudged him with an elbow. \u201cNo smart remarks from the peanut gallery, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what, precisely, is a peanut gallery?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cJust escort me down to the park before I die of caffeine withdrawal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His nod was decidedly regal; then he offered me his arm and said, \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>I slipped my arm through his and we walked down to the park, where I found a bench seat near the fountain and had my snack, listening to the dance of water and the songs of the birds in the trees. It was, I thought, another one of those rather pleasant\u2014almost ordinary\u2014moments to treasure in a life gone crazy.</p><p>Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t last. Just as I tossed the empty Coke can into the nearby bin, my phone rang. I dug it out of my handbag and hit the vid-phone\u2019s ANSWER button.</p> <p>\u201cStane,\u201d I said. \u201cHow\u2019d the date go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the date,\u201d he said, a somewhat bemused expression on his face. \u201cYou could say it wasn\u2019t what I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning it was worse, or better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter is something of an understatement.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cSo your mother wasn\u2019t so far off the mark when she arranged this blind date?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. Holly Green is not only pretty, but she\u2019s a gamer.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI think I\u2019m in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t invited her around to your place yet. She might yet be a clean freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one who is a gamer can be a clean freak. The two are totally incompatible.\u201d</p><p>My grin grew. The lone wolf had been snagged, and bad. \u201cI take it you\u2019ll be seeing her again\u2014sans mothers this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell yeah.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cIs that the only reason you\u2019re ringing? To boast about your hot date?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d He composed himself, his expression becoming a touch more serious. \u201cGot a hit on that storage locker. Someone just came out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019m running a scan, but nothing has come up yet.\u201d He disappeared briefly as he scooted from one screen to another. \u201cI just sent you a picture. It\u2019s a woman, so it might be Genevieve Sands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long ago did she actually leave?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cJust going out through a side door now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know the minute anyone else enters or exits. And thanks, Stane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo probs.\u201d</p><p>As I hung up, my phone chimed, telling me a message had been received. I pulled up the pic, then glanced at Azriel. \u201cYou want to take us there?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded and did so, depositing us again in the side parking lot near all the shrubs. I swung around, but didn\u2019t immediately see anyone matching the image on the phone. Then I spotted the tail end of a white overcoat disappearing around the Hoddle Street corner and raced after her.</p><p>As I ran into Hoddle Street, I spotted her. Like the woman in the photo, she was tall and thin, with short dark hair and a long, almost manly walk. She also was twenty yards away and heading briskly for a taxi.</p><p>\u201cMiss Sands?\u201d I had to yell to be heard over the roar of passing traffic. \u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, she paused and looked over her shoulder, a frown marring her pale, lightly lined features. I\u2019d expected Genevieve Sands to be a much older woman, for some reason, but she looked to be in her midforties, if that. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>I slowed to a walk, dug my badge out of my handbag, and showed it just long enough for her to see the badge but not read the finer print that said I was vamp council rather than anything more official.</p><p>\u201cI need to ask you a couple of questions.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, her amber gaze skating my length briefly before rising to mine. I had the feeling that I\u2019d been found wanting\u2014and it oddly reminded me of Lauren Macintyre\u2019s initial response to my presence.</p><p>\u201cIn regard to what?\u201d She looked down the length of her long, Roman nose at me, her voice cool and collected.</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cJohn Nadler.\u201d</p><p>She turned fully around, her handbag clasped in front of her like a shield and her expression puzzled. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Nadler, a businessman who recently died.\u201d I stopped in front of her and forced a smile. \u201cI believe you\u2019re one of his three beneficiaries.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in, he\u2019s dead and you\u2019ve been named in his will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would I be named in the will of a man I don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I frowned. If she was putting on an act, then it was a good one. And yet there was something about her, an energy radiating off her that had the hackles rising at the back of my neck. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been contacted by his lawyers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been out of town on business for a few weeks. It is possible that their communication is being held at the post office along with my other mail.\u201d</p><p>Which was a perfectly legitimate excuse, so why didn\u2019t I believe it?</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re using one of the storage units here? Because you\u2019ve been away?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat on earth has my renting a storage unit here got to do with being the beneficiary of a man I don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ms. Sands, just answer the question.\u201d</p><p>She huffed somewhat haughtily, then said, \u201cI\u2019ve been renting the unit for several months now. My house is quite small and I needed somewhere secure to stock several valuable items.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my phone out and pretended to look up some notes. \u201cAnd is your unit G-18?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She frowned. \u201cI\u2019m really not seeing the connection here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in regard to the ongoing investigation into Nadler\u2019s death,\u201d I said. \u201cWe believe there might be some connection to your unit. Would it be possible for us to have a look at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it would not. Not without a warrant.\u201d She paused, looking me up and down. \u201cProduce one, and I\u2019ll be more than happy to comply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will take a few hours. It really would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not care about what is easy or not,\u201d she cut in coldly. \u201cThe law is the law, young lady, and I will not be railroaded into doing anything that might not be advantageous to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not implying that you\u2019re in any way involved\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you implying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I\u2019m merely trying to tie up some loose ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this is one end that will remain loose until you get the proper paperwork, and not before.\u201d</p><p>Okay, then. I forced another smile. \u201cIf you happen to remember just where you know John Nadler from, could you perhaps give me a call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can do.\u201d She took out an old-fashioned notebook and pen, then looked at me pointedly. \u201cNumber?\u201d</p><p>I gave her my cell phone number, then added, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have delayed you so long, Ms. Sands.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, tucked her notebook back into her bag, then turned and strode to the still-waiting taxi.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I asked, as she climbed into the cab and slammed the door.</p><p>\u201cI could not read her.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him, surprised. \u201cThat seems to be happening an awful lot these days.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThere are humans we cannot read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. We just seem to be coming across more of them than usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she is human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there was something about her that didn\u2019t feel right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, given she was exiting a storage locker containing a sorceress\u2019s transport gate, it is very possible she is either in league with said sorceress, or the sorceress herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be the latter.\u201d I watched the taxi\u2019s blinker come on as it readied to pull away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she didn\u2019t have the same build as Lauren Macintyre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFace-shifters can change only their facial shape, not their bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does not mean there cannot be those who are able to do a full-body shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there is, I\u2019ve never heard of them.\u201d As the taxi pulled into the traffic, I added, \u201cI\u2019m going to follow her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat goes without saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut given your somewhat reckless nature, it bears repeating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had the time, I\u2019d be offended by that statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can hardly offend when it is the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly as you see it. Meet you back home.\u201d I dropped a quick kiss on his lips, then slung my handbag over my shoulder and called to the Aedh. She came in a rush, and within a heartbeat I was trailing after the taxi.</p><p>We followed Hoddle Street, went under the Swan Street rail overpass, then followed Punt Road for several miles until the taxi turned left into Greville Road and stopped at a redbrick and concrete house that looked totally alien among all the more traditional terraces.</p><p>I waited until Genevieve had stepped inside and slipped in after her. A quick look around her house didn\u2019t reveal anything out of the ordinary. It was neat and obviously well lived in, with plenty of clothes in the wardrobe and little dust on the furniture. I briefly wondered how long she\u2019d been away, because surely if it had been any length of time, there would have been dust. And if she\u2019d had the time to dust, why wouldn\u2019t she have collected her mail?</p><p>She dumped her coat and bag on her bed, checked her answering machine, then headed into the bathroom. I waited until she\u2019d filled her bath and climbed in before I gave up and retreated.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Azriel grabbed my arm as I reappeared in my bedroom, steadying me.</p><p>I shook my head, gulping down air as dizziness swept me and my stomach briefly rose. But this time, there was no my-head-is-going-to-explode pain accompanying the shift back to flesh form, and though my legs felt weak, they didn\u2019t collapse underneath me. Although no doubt Azriel\u2019s grip had something to do with that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He guided me across to the bed and sat me down.

She just went home and had a bath.\u201d I grimaced. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m just jumping at shadows, but she still feels wrong to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps our next step should be uncovering whether there are shifters capable of full transformation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I took a deep, somewhat shuddery breath, then pulled my hands from his and picked up my phone. \u201cUncle Rhoan,\u201d I said, and watched the psychedelic swirls run across the screen as the call was connected.</p><p>\u201cRis,\u201d he said, after a couple of moments. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a weird question for you\u2014are there such things as face-shifters who are capable of transforming their whole bodies?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve never come across one, but I can\u2019t see why there wouldn\u2019t be. They\u2019re probably rarer than hens\u2019 teeth, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould something like that be registered on a birth certificate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. Even face-shifters are registered only as shifters\u2014and only if they come from a known line of shifters. If it\u2019s an out-of-the-blue occurrence, or they\u2019re the product of a human-shifter mating, then probably not.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just following a woman who reminded me of someone else, but she looked nothing like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould she be a sister or a relation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t uncover much about her, let alone anything about her family. She may exist, but there\u2019s not a whole lot of paperwork to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re thinking a fake ID?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I scratched my nose. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He studied me for a moment, gray eyes narrowed. \u201cI hope this woman has nothing to do with our two spiderwebbed victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing. It\u2019s key related.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Well, the best I can do is run a search for you, but I doubt anything will come up.\u201d</p><p>And I doubted whether a search done by Directorate resources would bring up anything more than one done by Stane, but I guessed it couldn\u2019t hurt. \u201cThe woman\u2019s name is Genevieve Sands. She lives at sixty-five Greville Road, Prahran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPosh address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPosh woman.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cSpeaking of the other deaths\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Risa.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn it, I\u2019m just curious\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know what that did to the cat,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve got enough on your plate. Don\u2019t go stealing my work as well.\u201d</p><p>I half laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to your work. I\u2019m just curious as to whether you\u2019d uncovered anything interesting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did, I wouldn\u2019t be telling you. Talk to you later, Ris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith some interesting information on Sands, hopefully,\u201d I said, and hung up. I tossed the phone back on the bed and sighed. \u201cAnother dead end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly not. Despite her assertions to the contrary, she must know who Nadler is, because she would not be named heir otherwise, true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe. You occasionally see reports of strangers or even animals being gifted money in wills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is unlikely to be the case here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery unlikely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we also know she must have some acquaintance with Lauren Macintyre, as that transport portal ultimately leads to her place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it leads to the house Lucian\u2019s Razan are staying in. There\u2019s another portal that goes to Lauren\u2019s from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian\u2019s Razan?\u201d</p><p>The edge in his voice had me frowning. \u201cWhat, you didn\u2019t pick that information up from my thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>He waved the question away. \u201cThe Razan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was only one there, but his name is Mark Jackson, and he was the one we knocked unconscious in the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so sure he is Lucian\u2019s Razan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s no one else he could belong to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould not be dealing with a dark sorcerer. I might not be sure of much, but I\u2019m pretty sure of that.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cLucian was his chr\u00e1n\u00ed, and you said yourself that they often shared the same markings as their masters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be interesting to uncover whether\u2014if Jackson is the Aedh\u2019s chr\u00e1n\u00ed\u2014he was a recent creation or one that was created before his power was ripped from him by the Razan.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat difference would it make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf before, then not much. If the latter\u201d\u2014he paused, something close to hatred glimmering briefly in his eyes\u2014\u201cthen he has thoroughly concealed his true self and is far more powerful\u2014and dangerous\u2014than I suspected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning he could take on his energy form?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cNo. There is no doubt he has been trapped in flesh form for eons. But it is possible he could not only take on partial form, but have all his other powers available as well.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat sort of powers would we be talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ability to use magic, for a start. The Raziq are proficient in its use\u2014they have to be, as masters of the gates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the priests were the masters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Razan were once priests. Lucian, as your father\u2019s chr\u00e1n\u00ed, is very likely to be magically strong. Your father would not have taken him otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Meaning Lucian had never had to enlist Lauren\u2019s help to spell me\u2014he could have done it all himself. I frowned. \u201cSo why did he get Lauren to make that cube? Why wouldn\u2019t he have made it himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he would have wanted to belay any suspicions. His magic would feel very different from that of his mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve never felt any of his magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd perhaps never would. As I said, he would be extremely strong and\u2014I suspect\u2014very adept at hiding it after all those years on this plane.\u201d</p><p>I blew out a breath. \u201cI really was fooled by him, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not for as long as he might have desired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThankfully,\u201d I muttered, then jumped as my phone rang. The tone told me it was Hunter, and I groaned. \u201cLike I need to speak to her right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking on the phone is preferable to talking in person, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that.\u201d I hit the ANSWER button and said, \u201cI had nothing to report, which is why I didn\u2019t report.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was cool and disbelieving. \u201cSo the woman wasn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she was there, but she did a runner on us. We chased her to her dressing room, but she escaped and left lots of little friends behind to play with us.\u201d</p><p>And the memory of it had my skin crawling all over again.</p><p>Amusement briefly touched Hunter\u2019s lips. \u201cSpiders, I\u2019m guessing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of them, as I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow quaint that you\u2019re afraid of something so small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have an Achilles\u2019 heel. Spiders just happen to be mine.\u201d</p><p>Something glimmered in her eyes. Something that could have been humor but felt like something far darker. \u201cOh, you have more than just spiders, my dear.\u201d</p><p>I found myself clenching the phone so tight, I was in danger of cracking the case. \u201cWhat weakens can also give you strength. You might want to remember that sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, my,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAren\u2019t we all aggressive this afternoon? I wonder why.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and released it slowly. \u201cTalking to uncooperative vampires tends to do that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather you mean those who run Hallowed Ground rather than myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I kept my voice flat, without inflection. To have done anything else would have been dangerous. \u201cI didn\u2019t learn much, but I did get a picture of our suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she is the one we\u2019re after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to tell, because she was using some sort of shield that stopped Azriel sensing what she was. But given she had a boatload of spiders sitting in her dressing room, I think it likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she left nothing behind other than the spiders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cBut she\u2019s killed two nights in a row, so I\u2019d bet she\u2019ll attempt to do so again tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than likely.\u201d Hunter studied me, a deeper darkness creeping into her eyes. \u201cI believe you talked to Stanford, despite my warning not to.\u201d</p><p>I shivered, wondering how she\u2019d known. The bartender, perhaps? Then I remembered\u2014I had a damn Cazador following me around, reporting every little move back to her. \u201cI had no choice. The owner wasn\u2019t there and the bartender didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>Hunter snorted. \u201cBartenders know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this one wasn\u2019t talking.\u201d At least not to me. \u201cThe only way to get any information was to talk to Stanford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did he have anything interesting to say beyond his lack of knowledge about his fill-in entertainer?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. Stanford might be planning to oust Hunter, but he could also be doing nothing more than stirring the pot. Hell, for all I knew, he\u2019d picked up the phone and talked to Hunter the minute I was out the door. Which meant that no matter what I said, it wasn\u2019t going to make her happy.</p><p>Although I could hardly lie, given the Cazador.</p><p>\u201cNothing worth listening to,\u201d I said eventually. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Amusement touched her lips. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>I bet she was. Couldn\u2019t have her pet joining the opposition, after all\u2014not before she\u2019d done what was expected of her, anyway.</p><p>\u201cHe did give me his contacts at the entertainment agency. I thought I might go talk to them, unless you\u2019d prefer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted to get deeply involved in this case, I would have,\u201d she said. \u201cReport back to me if you uncover anything else.\u201d</p> <p>And with that, she hung up.</p><p>\u201cHunter was her charming self, I see,\u201d Azriel murmured.</p><p>I laughed, as he\u2019d no doubt intended. \u201cYeah, she was.\u201d</p><p>He caught my hand and rose, dragging me upright with him. \u201cTao is about to call for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe he is hungry.\u201d He gave me a somewhat stern look. \u201cAnd you should be eating something, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom,\u201d I murmured, as I brushed past him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ris?\u201d Tao called, just as I neared his bedroom door. \u201cYou out there?\u201d</p><p>I poked my head around the door. \u201cI am. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIlianna threatened to make the old boy go limp for the next three months if I got out of bed for anything more than a pee,\u201d he said, expression amused. \u201cBut she hasn\u2019t come back from her shopping expedition, and I\u2019m absolutely starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo get up and get something. She\u2019s not going to know.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted. \u201cMaybe, but I enjoy sex too much to risk it.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cWhat would you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything that involves lots of meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteak, eggs, and chips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have a beer while I\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cDid Ilianna really make that threat? Because you seem to be milking it a little here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah.\u201d He grinned. \u201cHaving you run around waiting on me hand and foot isn\u2019t something that happens every day. Gotta make the most of it.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly and headed into the kitchen. Half an hour later, I dished up two plates and walked back into his room.</p> <p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said, practically drooling as he accepted the plate, \u201csmells divine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen eat up.\u201d I sat down on the chair beside his bed and followed my own advice. I was about halfway through my meal when my phone rang again. This time the tone said it was Stane.</p><p>I cursed softly. \u201cI swear, people are intent on not letting me eat today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ignore it,\u201d Tao said sagely. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can\u2019t ring him back.\u201d</p><p>Azriel appeared by the chair and offered me the phone. \u201cIt could relate to the storage unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I accepted the phone and hit the ANSWER button. \u201cStane, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve Sands just got out of a taxi in front of that storage place again.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Azriel. \u201cMaybe we spooked her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should go see what she\u2019s doing.\u201d To Stane, I added, \u201cI discovered her address today. Do you think it\u2019ll help you dig up any other information about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorth a try.\u201d</p><p>I gave him the address, then added, \u201cAnd while I\u2019m thinking about it, have you still got that bug we used at the nightclub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly do. I wasn\u2019t about to let that baby go\u2014do you know how hard those things are to get?\u201d</p><p>Given they were black market, I\u2019d imagine very hard, and very expensive. \u201cWhat\u2019s the range of the thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairly extensive. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I were to place it in an apartment up on the Gold Coast, you\u2019d be able to pick up its signal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but if you were willing to fork out the cost of hiring a buddy of mine, I could get him to pick up the signal and bounce it down to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone. Can we pick it up later, after we\u2019ve checked out the storage unit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can, but I won\u2019t have everything in place by then. And I\u2019m not sure if Fitz will have the necessary relay stuff on hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I hung up and shoved my plate toward Tao. \u201cYou want to finish any of that?\u201d</p><p>He snagged the rest of the steak and gave me a thumbs-up. I took the rest out to the kitchen and dumped it in the trash, then grabbed my bag and coat and turned to Azriel. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We reappeared in the side parking lot again. The evening air was cold enough for my breath to fog, so I pulled my coat on as I walked toward the entrance.</p><p>But I\u2019d barely taken half a dozen steps when the building exploded in a gigantic ball of flame.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>The force of the blast knocked me off my feet and sent me tumbling. I landed in an ungainly heap near the shrubs that lined the parking lot, with bricks, metal, and wood thudding all around me. I didn\u2019t move, just squeezed my eyes shut, threw my hands over my head, and prayed like hell that I wasn\u2019t hit. Then Azriel landed on top of me, knocking out whatever breath I\u2019d had left.</p><p>But the minute his body covered mine, the debris stopped falling\u2014not just on us, but around us. And it became quiet. Whisper quiet. I frowned and opened my eyes. We were surrounded by a halo of blue fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValdis shields us.\u201d His warm breath tickled my ear. \u201cShe formed it the minute the building exploded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re lying on top of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was easier than transporting us both out of here\u2014especially given you would only want to come back.\u201d He hesitated, then added, with a hint of a smile in his voice, \u201cOf course, this way I also get to touch you more fully, and that is not entirely unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re beginning to sound like a regular male, and that\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, I feel like a regular male.\u201d</p><p>Laughter bubbled through me. \u201cWell, I was going to be polite and not mention that bar you have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant,\u201d he cut in, the amusement in his voice deeper this time, \u201cthat I was feeling protective. You, Risa Jones, have what I believe is called a dirty mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not the one manning up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a function of this body I have no real control over.\u201d Valdis\u2019s shield flickered and died, but he didn\u2019t immediately move. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to say yes, but the word never came out. With the shield gone, the noise hit, and it was horrendous. But the creak and groan of a dying building wasn\u2019t the worst of it. It was the screams of those trapped and injured that were the hardest to take.</p><p>\u201cOh god, Azriel, we have to help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cannot,\u201d he said, voice firm. \u201cIt is too dangerous to go in there just yet.\u201d</p><p>I bucked my body, trying to get him off me, but I might as well have tried to shift a brick wall. \u201cDamn it. I can\u2019t just lie here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can, and you will,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not within your ability to save those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is within your ability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d This time there was an edge of anger in his voice. \u201cI am not here to alter the hand fate has dealt to any of those people inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless it had something to do with the keys, which this does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly peripherally. I have no justification for interfering in either the life or the death of those within that building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Genevieve Sands? She might be connected to both the dark sorcerer and the keys, so why can\u2019t you at least go in there to see if she survived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at the building, Risa. Do you really think it possible she could be alive?\u201d</p><p>I twisted around and my gaze widened. Flames leapt high from either end, but it was the middle of the building\u2014in the area that had held Lauren Macintyre\u2019s storage unit\u2014that had taken the brunt of the explosion. It was completely destroyed. There was nothing left but the charred remnants of brick walls and the twisted remains of metal. There is no way in hell anyone in that area could have survived.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee she was actually in there at the time of the explosion. She might have set it all up and then used the stones to escape.\u201d That was what I would have done if I\u2019d been in her somewhat ugly shoes. \u201cWe need to go check the Razans\u2019 place and see if she\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>Azriel\u2019s expression went back to being noncommittal. \u201cYou cannot go in Aedh form, as they will sense you.\u201d</p><p>I met his gaze. \u201cYou could go.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI prefer not to leave you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to attack me here? The Raziq are waiting for my father\u2019s appearance, Hunter still has use for me, and anyone else I can cope with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven you do have the unfortunate habit of attracting danger, that is no comfort.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take you a couple of minutes, if that, to check. What trouble could I get into in that amount of time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty, I suspect.\u201d He rose, his movements fluid and graceful, and offered me a hand. \u201cDo not go into that building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Not in human form, anyway.</p><p>\u201cRisa\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being such a worrywart and go before she escapes us again.\u201d</p><p>He did. I brushed the dirt and grit from my hands and clothes as I studied the blackened, broken building. There was little sound coming from the building now\u2014little in the way of human sound, anyway\u2014but the flames were intense, a caress of heat that would burn my skin if I got any closer. But I had to get closer, no matter what Azriel said. Though the approaching wail of the emergency vehicles was barely audible over the fierce burn of the fire, they were little more than a couple of minutes away. If I wanted to check if anything in that locker had survived the blast, I\u2019d better do it now, before officialdom descended and perhaps destroyed whatever evidence still survived. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My gaze went to the front of the building. Fire licked along the roof, but much of the front office still seemed to be standing. Which meant that Maggie, the cheerful receptionist who\u2019d been working there yesterday, might still be alive.</p><p>And I couldn\u2019t escape the sudden notion that I needed to check\u2014not only to save her life if that were possible, but for the sake of our mission.</p><p>My clairvoyance sure picked the oddest times to kick in.</p> <p>A good-sized crowd had gathered across the other side of the road, but few of them were looking in my direction. I called to the Aedh and she rushed through me, changing my form in an instant.</p><p>Heat and dust whispered through my particles as I moved closer to the building, an unpleasant combination that made me want to scratch even though I had no flesh. I slipped through the ugly hole blown in the side of the building and made my way above the debris that had once been a corridor. The storage units on either side were little more than skeletal remnants, with boxes and god knows what else hanging out of them like the innards of a gutted body.</p><p>But the wall between the storage section and the office area was still basically intact, and though it was barely visible through the smoke and flames, hope rose.</p><p>The door into the office area hung limply from one hinge, tilted inward by the force of the explosion. Flames licked the doorframe and slipped fiery tentacles along the inside ceiling. I went through, mentally wincing as the flames danced through my energy form. It felt like red-hot fingers were being shoved inside me.</p><p>The office itself hadn\u2019t escaped damage, despite the buffer of the standing wall. Furniture was strewn everywhere, paper and glass littered the floor, and the front windows were smashed and were held in place only by the thick mesh grills covering them. The air was a morass of dust, smoke, and heat.</p> <p>I spun around, searching for any sign of life, but couldn\u2019t immediately see anything. The desk where the receptionist had been sitting had tipped over sideways and was now covered by part of the ceiling. There was no sign of life. But, by the same token, there was no evidence of blood or broken body parts.</p><p>Then what sounded like a groan came from under the debris of the desk. I swore mentally and shifted back to flesh. The air was so damn hot that it felt like I\u2019d fallen into an oven set on high, and the thick, heavy smoke swirled around me, stinging my eyes and catching in my throat, making me cough.</p><p>\u201cMaggie?\u201d I had to shout to be heard above all the noise. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>No answer came, but after a moment, I heard another groan. It was definitely coming from underneath the desk area.</p><p>I began grabbing bits of plaster and rubbish from the pile covering the desk and tossed them to one side. Another explosion ripped through the building, and the walls around me shuddered. I ducked instinctively, scraping my thigh along a jagged piece of wood as dust and bricks fell around me. The remnants of plaster still clinging to the ceiling began to crack alarmingly; it wouldn\u2019t take much to bring the rest of it down.</p><p>I swore and drew Amaya. Don\u2019t cut or burn the woman\u2019s flesh.</p> <p>Will not, she replied.</p><p>Fire ignited along her blade, the lilac flames bright in the smoky darkness. I used her steel to hack apart the larger chunks of wood, plaster, and metal that lay between me and the receptionist, kicking the smaller bits aside as Amaya\u2019s flames consumed everything else.</p><p>From somewhere under the mess came another groan.</p><p>\u201cMaggie? Can you hear me?\u201d I shoved Amaya\u2019s tip under a long piece of wood, then thrust it up and back.</p><p>There was a pause, then a weak, \u201cHere. Help.\u201d</p><p>Something shimmered in the smoky shadows near the door. I tensed, my fingers tightening around Amaya, then realized it was a reaper. She wore the image of an elderly woman and had a kind face and sorrowful blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have her,\u201d I said fiercely. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is neither your decision nor mine,\u201d the reaper replied softly.</p> <p>I blinked. None of them had ever talked to me before. None of them except Azriel, anyway.</p><p>\u201cThat is because you have never spoken directly to any of us before now,\u201d she said, her expression somewhat amused.</p><p>\u201cI had no real reason to before now,\u201d I muttered. I grabbed another chunk of wood and threw it away.</p><p>A flash of familiar heat across my skin told me Azriel had also appeared. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t coming in here in flesh form,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you knew it was a lie, so why sound so aggrieved now?\u201d I shoved another piece of wood out of the way. \u201cYou could help, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot interfere in this one\u2019s life or death, Risa, and you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it. I\u2019m not asking you to interfere. I\u2019m just asking you to help me remove some of the rubbish on top of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fuck you both, then!\u201d I raised Amaya and brought her down hard. Her blade hit the desk and, with a resounding crack, split it in two. As her lilac flames began eating into the wood, I raised a foot and kicked half of the desk with all the force I could muster. It tumbled up and back, revealing the bloody and bruised torso of the young receptionist.</p><p>I squatted beside her and gently brushed the hair from her eyes. \u201cMaggie? Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, though she didn\u2019t open her eyes, and the movement was so weak it might have been imagination on my part.</p><p>My gaze slid down her length. Her hips and legs were trapped under the remains of the desk, and the blood I hadn\u2019t seen earlier was there. Everywhere. I bit my lip, then added, \u201cI\u2019m going to get you out of here, okay?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open. She blinked, and just for a moment, confusion briefly outshone the pain in her eyes. \u201cYou. Changed again.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, not sure what she meant. Not even sure if she was seeing me. \u201cYour legs are trapped under the desk, Maggie. I\u2019m going to free you, but it could hurt. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, then nodded and closed her eyes again. I rose, stepped over her, then, as quickly but as gently as I could, grabbed the edge of the desk and flung it up and over her. She screamed. The sound cut through me, as sharp as a knife, then abruptly stopped.</p><p>The reaper stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer decision is made. Her soul moves on.\u201d The elderly reaper\u2019s voice was filled with gentle understanding. \u201cThere is nothing you can do for her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, no,\u201d I said, and looked down. A soft shimmer rolled over the receptionist\u2019s body; then her soul pulled free. She looked at peace, happy almost. I closed my eyes, not wanting to see her spirit take the reaper\u2019s hand and move on.</p><p>Not wanting to acknowledge my failure to yet again save someone.</p><p>Another explosion ripped through the building. Above, the ceiling cracked and plaster began to fall, the pieces small at first, then getting gradually larger as the cracks grew and joined.</p><p>I swore and called to the Aedh, changing form just as the remainder of the ceiling crashed down. It would have crushed me if I\u2019d still been standing there. As it was, dust and debris plumed through my particles, making me feel as if every inch was coated in grime.</p><p>I headed back into the hellhole that the main storage area had become, quickly winding my way through the remnants of the corridor until I found Genevieve\u2019s storage locker. Or rather, where it once had been, because this area was definitely ground zero. There was very little left here, nothing but a few blackened, twisted metal remains. I turned around, trying to find the middle of the unit where the stones had stood. What I found instead was the remnant of a leg\u2014though it was little more than crisped strips of skin and meat hanging from a cracked and blackened femur. I looked around for the rest of the body, but couldn\u2019t see anything. Why just that section of whoever\u2019s body it was had survived was anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p>There was little evidence left of the stones, which no doubt had been the intention of the blast. Genevieve Sands obviously didn\u2019t want to risk me investigating this locker. It\u2019s just too bad for her that I already had\u2014something she would have known if she\u2019d accessed the site\u2019s security system. For once it seemed that fate had played us a better hand than the bad guys.</p><p>I checked the rest of the storage units in the hope that someone else might have survived, but the effort was futile. All I found were bodies. There was nothing else I could do, so I turned around and headed home. Once there, I stripped off and showered, although the dust was so ingrained, I had a sneaking suspicion I\u2019d be rubbing it out of my skin for the next week.</p><p>Once I\u2019d finger combed my hair, I headed out to find Azriel. He was back in his usual spot.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it about you and windows?\u201d I grabbed some socks out of the nearby dresser and plopped down on the bed to pull them on.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt is, quite literally, a window to a small section of your world. It is endlessly interesting watching what goes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning your world is boring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy world is one of rules and duty. It is not so much boring as that nothing ever changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine the life of a Mijai would be too boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe life of a hunter-killer is exciting for only the first couple of millennia.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a moment, not quite sure I\u2019d heard him right. \u201cMillennia?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, amusement briefly touching his eyes. \u201cI am young in Mijai terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ancient in mine.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cAnd this is a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just surprising, that\u2019s all.\u201d I pulled the last sock on, then reached for my boots. \u201cDid you find Genevieve at the Razans\u2019 place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she had already moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the place on the Gold Coast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked both there and her house in Prahran. She was at neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d I thrust a hand through my hair and wondered if that meant she were dead, or if she were merely being cautious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat is a question that cannot be answered until she turns up either alive or dead.\u201d</p><p>Very true. We had no idea how involved Genevieve Sands might be with either the magic or the key quest, and it was certainly more than possible that she was dead\u2014but I was betting on the former rather than the latter. Something about the grim remains I\u2019d seen just seemed a little too convenient. \u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven we can do nothing on our own quest until tomorrow, perhaps we should concentrate on Hunter\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d I glanced at the clock. It was just after four, so there was still plenty of time to head on over to the entertainment agency and talk to either James Parred or Catherine Moore, the two contacts Stanford had given us for the agency. \u201cI might go over to the agency on my bike. My head still feels achy after all the shifting to and from Aedh form.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat you have shifted so much and have not suffered the consequences suggests you are becoming more adept at the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr it\u2019s a result of whatever Malin did to me.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cYou\u2019re determined not to give me any information about that, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I cannot. Your dealings with your father are dangerous enough as they are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust because I understand your reasons doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not frustrated by them.\u201d I gathered my phone and ID, then walked to the wardrobe to get my leather bike gear. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the front of Classique Entertainers.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and disappeared. I headed down to the garage, gearing up in my leathers before I hopped on the Ducati and drove out.</p><p>Of course, going anywhere near the city approaching peak hour always added far too much time to the journey, so it was close to 4:45 by the time I got to Port Melbourne.</p><p>The agency was located in an area that was all concrete warehouses and office buildings. I found parking under one of the trees lining the center strip, then pulled off my gloves and helmet, shoved them into the under-seat storage, and headed across the road to Classique. It was situated in a building that was basically a glass-fronted concrete box, though the colorfully painted wooden strips lining the upper half of the building on either side of the windows at least gave it a bit of personality that was sadly lacking in its neighbors.</p><p>Azriel joined me as I walked toward the steps. \u201cWould not a disguise be useful at this point, given that your uncle would not be pleased to discover you\u2019re investigating these crimes?\u201d</p><p>I stopped cold. \u201cShit, yes. Thanks for reminding me.\u201d I did a quick look around, scanning the nearby building to see if there was anyone staring out the window. There didn\u2019t appear to be, so I imaged myself with a long, thin face, with freckles over a somewhat large hooked nose, and spiky red hair. Once the shifting magic had done its work, I glanced at Azriel. \u201cWell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely not an improvement,\u201d he said, barely managing to restrain his smile.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cWhat about you? There may be cameras inside, and we can\u2019t risk Uncle Rhoan recognizing you any more than we can me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth human and electronic eyes will see a leather-clad, hairy-faced individual of impressive proportions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully not too impressive\u2014we don\u2019t want to scare them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpressive proportions toned down, then.\u201d</p><p>I grinned, loving his growing sense of humor more and more, and all but bounced up the steps. I pushed open the bright red metal doors, then stepped inside. The reception area was as modern as the outside of the building, with glass and bright colors being a central theme. The seated woman did something of a double take as we walked in. Her eyebrows rose slightly, but all she said was, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>I dug my ID out of my pocket and showed it to her. \u201cI need to talk to either James Parred or Catherine Moore about an entertainer they booked for Hallowed Ground this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>She studied the badge for a moment, then frowned. \u201cAn investigator for the high council? What the hell is that?\u201d</p> <p>She had good eyes, because I\u2019d deliberately kept the badge some distance from her.</p><p>\u201cIt means I work for the vampire high council.\u201d I kept my voice in the lower tonal ranges. There was a security camera in the corner, and while it was focused on the door, I had no idea if it was sound capable or not. The last thing I needed was Uncle Rhoan raiding their system and hearing me.</p><p>\u201cSo, not Directorate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cI take it they have been here, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yesterday.\u201d She frowned. \u201cSo are you a cop or what?\u201d</p><p>I gave her what I hoped was a reassuring smile. \u201cI lean more toward being a private investigator than something as official as a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning you don\u2019t have the same sort of powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d And I could see where this was leading\u2014me being shown the door. I glanced at Azriel. Don\u2019t suppose you can apply a little reaper charm, could you? I know you\u2019re not supposed to, but we need to get this case moving so we can concentrate on our own.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, but he gave the woman a full-wattage smile and said, \u201cWe tend to be the intermediaries between the council and the Directorate. We\u2019re used when the council does not wish a more official investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they are involved with whatever you are here to ask about, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>A woman immune to your wily ways, I said, amused. How amazing is that?</p><p>I suspect the reason is all the hair. She does not find it attractive, apparently.</p><p>Amusement bubbled through me, although I could certainly sympathize. Lots of hair wasn\u2019t on my must-have list when it came to men, either. Can you give her a little push into accepting us?</p><p>Only if it was key related, which this is not.</p><p>I mentally sighed, then said, \u201cLook, we just have a couple of quick questions, but if you think either James Parred or Catherine Moore would prefer to speak directly to the guardians, that can be arranged.\u201d</p><p>She bit the bottom of her lip, her expression uncertain, then made her decision and picked up the phone. \u201cJames, there are some investigators from the vampire council here who wish to speak to you about Ms. Summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother bloody complaint, no doubt,\u201d he replied, voice clearly audible even from where I stood. As was his annoyance. \u201cSend them in.\u201d</p><p>The woman hung up and motioned to the vibrant yellow door at the far end of the desk. \u201cThrough there, green door on your left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>We followed her directions, and a balding, middle-aged man rose from his chair and gave a welcoming\u2014if somewhat tense\u2014smile. \u201cJames Parred, at your service.\u201d</p><p>I shook his offered hand. \u201cAnnie Logan and Bear Brown,\u201d I said, grabbing at the first names that came to mind.</p><p>He glanced at Azriel, amusement briefly touching his lips. \u201cBear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is more a nickname,\u201d Azriel replied, giving me a \u201cmust-you?\u201d sort of look.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly appropriate, if you don\u2019t mind me saying.\u201d He waved a hand toward the seats, then sat back down himself. \u201cWhat do you wish to know about Ms. Summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went to Hallowed Ground to talk to her this afternoon, but she disappeared\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, damn annoying, that was,\u201d he cut in. \u201cShe did me out of a booking fee and annoyed a good customer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been in contact with her? Do you know why she ran?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI tried calling her, but she\u2019s not answering her phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have you had any problems like this with her before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have had problems?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cEarlier this week we were having problems contacting her, but she called yesterday and said her phone had been on the blink.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cObviously, it still is.\u201d</p><p>Either that, or the shape-shifting spirit behind these kills had decided to abandon the Summer identity. And that, in turn, meant we were dealing with a spirit with more intelligence than I\u2019d thought them capable of. Although why I\u2019d thought them incapable of logical thought, I couldn\u2019t say. Maybe I\u2019d just figured dark spirits were all about the need to kill and little else.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Di Shard?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, have you had a similar problem with her recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was out of contact for a couple of days, but it wasn\u2019t a problem because we didn\u2019t actually have her booked for anything.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHave you been in contact with her recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called this morning to ask if there were any bookings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing last moment. But I did have to remind her about her regular midnight booking at the Falcon Club, which was a little odd.\u201d</p><p>Meaning if our dark spirit had taken over the identities of both Summer and Shard, the Falcon Club was most likely her next hunting ground. \u201cHave you got a picture of the two women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He rifled through the paperwork on his desk and handed me two photos. Both women were tall, with thin features and dark hair. Other than the fact one had pale skin, the other dark, they could have been mistaken for sisters.</p><p>I glanced up at Parred. \u201cUntil recently, how reliable were they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cReliability and quality performances are necessary assets in this business. Without it, you don\u2019t survive that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could give me their addresses?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, but information like that is private. I couldn\u2019t hand it over without a warrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a cell phone number? It\u2019s urgent that I speak with both women.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened. \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a cell phone number,\u201d I said, using my most persuasive voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can use it to track down their addresses or anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He snorted. \u201cThe Directorate could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Directorate could have just pulled their driver\u2019s license details and gotten the information from there.\u201d</p><p>I could have, too\u2014or rather, Stane could have. But I needed to take all the right steps to satisfy Hunter, and that had to include talking to the people who employed the two women.</p> <p>He studied me for several seconds, then half shrugged. \u201cI guess it won\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, pulled an old wireless keyboard out from under his desk, and began typing. I glanced at Azriel. Don\u2019t suppose you could take a sneaky look over his shoulder without him noticing?</p><p>I could. His tone was amused.</p><p>I smiled. Then would you?</p><p>Of course.</p> <p>He appeared behind Parred. Shard lives in flat one, ten Martin Street, St. Kilda, and\u2014he hesitated, waiting as Parred did some more typing\u2014Sands lives in flat eleven, one twenty Newman Street, Kensington.</p><p>He reappeared on the seat beside me just as Parred grabbed a piece of paper and scrawled two phone numbers onto it. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, sliding the paper across to me. \u201cThe first is for Shard, the second for Sands. Hope you have better luck contacting them than I have of late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>We headed out. Once safely across the street and well out of earshot, I pulled out my phone and gave both women a call. Neither one answered. No surprise there, I guess. Especially when it was more than likely that both women were either incapacitated or dead.</p><p>I shoved my phone away and glanced at Azriel. \u201cWe\u2019ll try Di Shard first. She\u2019s slightly closer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will meet you there.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared. I called to the shifting magic and made my face my own again, then pulled on the helmet and climbed onto the Ducati.</p><p>The trip across to St. Kilda was hell, thanks to the traffic, and by the time I got to Martin Street, I was more than a little pissed off and totally wishing I\u2019d simply come here via Aedh form.</p><p>I cruised slowly past the apartment building, then parked around the corner, stored my helmet, and walked back. Ten Martin Street was a modern glass and concrete building that looked like a series of receding boxes, each layer sitting farther back, giving that \u201cbox\u201d more of a courtyard than the one below it. The top layer apparently had enough room for a large outdoor umbrella to be set up.</p><p>I glanced at Azriel as he appeared beside me. \u201cCan you sense anything inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is life in the first two apartments; nothing in the other two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there any bodies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf death occurred some time ago, as you suspect, I would not sense it. A soul\u2019s resonance does not last beyond a few days in this world, unless they become one of the lost ones.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo if Shard is dead in there, this death was meant to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I studied the building a minute longer, but I was only delaying the inevitable. \u201cRight. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my fingers around my keys and phone and called to the Aedh. Once I\u2019d changed form, I moved across the road, hesitating briefly to study the names on the intercom before slipping through the small gap between the door and the floor. Flat one, according to the directory, was up on the first floor. Shard\u2019s flat was the only one on that floor. I went in.</p><p>At first glance, there didn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong. The place was tidy, but not overly so. There was a small stack of mail sitting\u2014unopened\u2014on a glass side table near the door, dishes draining on the sink in the kitchen, and laundry sitting in the basket in the small laundry room. There was nothing that immediately jumped up and screamed \u201cproblem.\u201d Not until I went into the bedroom, anyway.</p><p>Because the entire room had become one gigantic web. Even though I was little more than particles, it seemed to cling to me, making me feel itchy and sending horror coursing through me. I backed away faster than I\u2019d ever done before\u2014in either form\u2014and returned to the relative safety of the doorway.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t noticed any motion sensors in the flat, so I shifted back to flesh form. Dizziness swept me, and I had to grab the doorframe to steady myself\u2014but the pain that slithered through me was next to nothing when compared to the state I was usually in after a shift. I might not know what Malin had done to me, but if this lack of pain was one of the side effects, then I couldn\u2019t entirely be sorry about it.</p><p>The cobweb hung from one side of the room to the other, the gossamer strands shining like gilded silver in the evening light filtering in through the bedroom window. Little white pods hung in various corners, but all of them were split open and empty of contents. I couldn\u2019t be sorry about that, considering what they\u2019d probably held was spiders. Lots and lots of baby black spiders. Goose bumps fled across my skin, and I rubbed my arms, trying without succeeding to warm the chill from them. Even Azriel re-forming behind me couldn\u2019t do anything about that.</p><p>Di Shard lay on the bed. Or what remained of her did, anyway. Like the two male victims we\u2019d seen, she was wrapped in spiderweb and her skin was like parchment\u2014brittle and almost translucent. The only difference was, she didn\u2019t have just two slashes in her abdomen. Instead, her body was littered with little cuts. Tiny cuts. As if they\u2019d been made by the fangs of thousands of little black spiders.</p><p>Another shiver ran through me. I could only hope she\u2019d been dead when they\u2019d begun consuming her.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said eventually, \u201cthis really doesn\u2019t tell us much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than the fact that she has been dead for at least a week.\u201d His hand rested lightly on my hip, the touch comforting rather than sexual.</p><p>My gaze swept the room again, but there wasn\u2019t much to find in the way of clues. \u201cWhy would she be consuming the men herself, but leave the women for her young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would probably need to keep her own strength up if she is in a breeding phase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea how long that phase is likely to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. As I have said before, I normally do not hunt spirits.\u201d He half shrugged, a movement I felt rather than saw. \u201cBut her actions so far suggest she is not working purely from instinct, but rather from intelligence.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up at him. \u201cMeaning not all dark spirits are capable of logic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are levels of spirits, just as there are levels of demons. This one is obviously one of the higher ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the Rakshasa we hunted would be have been considered a higher-level spirit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Although perhaps not as high as the spirit we seek here, because she could not ignore the call of the ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean she won\u2019t be hunting tonight? I mean, she knows we\u2019re looking for her after this afternoon\u2019s events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but remember, she is also in breeding mode. That is an imperative not even intelligence can ignore.\u201d His grip tightened on my hip, and the tension suddenly evident in his touch echoed through my being. \u201cWe should go. Someone comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then said, \u201cDirectorate. Your uncle.\u201d</p><p>I swore softly, called to the Aedh, and hoped like hell that I hadn\u2019t been in human form long enough for my scent to linger in the air. And thanked whatever gods that happened to be listening that I\u2019d parked my bike around the corner rather than directly opposite the apartment as I\u2019d first planned.</p><p>I swept out as Uncle Rhoan walked in. He hesitated, as if he\u2019d sensed me, but I just kept going. Hanging around to see if he actually had would not have been a bright idea.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wish to do now?\u201d Azriel said, the minute I re-formed beside the Ducati.</p><p>I grabbed my helmet and shoved it on. \u201cGo home and make mad, passionate love to you.\u201d</p><p>Amusement touched his lips, and desire flared briefly around me, bathing my skin with its warmth.</p><p>\u201cThat is something I would not find unpleasant.\u201d His voice was even despite the desire that pulsed between us. \u201cI suspect, however, you merely tease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suspect right. We need to check out Summer\u2019s place before my uncle beats us to it.\u201d Hell, for all I knew, he already had. Maybe there was a cleanup team there right now, photographing, cataloging, and pulling apart any clues that might be left. I had no doubt that Summer had suffered the same fate as Shard.</p><p>I flipped the helmet\u2019s visor down. \u201cI\u2019ll see you there.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and disappeared. I booted up the bike and headed across town. Thankfully, peak hour had eased now that night was setting in, and it was definitely more pleasant to be on the Ducati. At least I could weave my way through the traffic without having to worry about some impatient motorist suddenly swinging into my lane.</p><p>One twenty Newman Street turned out to be one of those modern, split-level town houses that had been popular with the upwardly mobile about fifty years ago. This one was showing its age more than most, the redbrick darkening with grime and the concrete portions showing remnants of past graffiti attacks. Still, it was in better shape than some of its neighbors, which looked to have been abandoned for many years\u2014decidedly odd given how close to the city Kensington was. At the very least, a developer should have stepped in and purchased the land because it would have been worth a fortune if developed properly.</p><p>And maybe I was thinking about that sort of nonsense rather than contemplating what might be waiting inside.</p><p>I glanced around. There weren\u2019t any Directorate cars about, and nobody seemed to be watching, so I shifted shape and silently made my way into the town house. Summer\u2019s place, like Shard\u2019s, looked lived in\u2014there was an empty dinner plate sitting on the coffee table, a mug with a tea bag sitting ready near the kettle in the kitchen, and clothes in the dryer, ready to be pulled out. For all intents and purposes, it looked as if someone were living here. And maybe they were. Maybe this was where our dark spirit had made her lair. Which meant that maybe this was where all those tiny spiders were living . . . My gaze jumped to the ceiling, but it was free of movement or threat. There wasn\u2019t even a spiderweb decorating any of the corners. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which didn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t any in the bedroom.</p><p>The bedroom door was closed, and there was no way in hell I was going to slip underneath it until I knew for sure what waited on the other side. I shifted back to flesh form, then flexed my fingers and made my feet move forward. As I gripped the door handle, I closed my eyes and sent a brief prayer to whatever gods might be listening that there wouldn\u2019t be anything untoward waiting beyond this door.</p><p>But, as usual, they had the IGNORE button pressed when it came to me.</p> <p>What lay inside wasn\u2019t only the biggest damn spiderweb I\u2019d ever seen, but a goddamn army of little black crawly things.</p><p>I jumped back, a squeak of fear escaping my lips, and hit Azriel so hard that I actually forced him back a step before his hands gripped my arms and he steadied us both.</p><p>\u201cHer nest,\u201d he said, rather unnecessarily. \u201cBut I suspect it is not her only one.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed heavily, my gaze on the ceiling and all the critters up there. There was no way in hell I was getting any closer to that room. They didn\u2019t appear to have noticed me, and I had no inclination to change that situation. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese spiders are larger than the ones who attacked us and therefore more likely to be older.\u201d</p> <p>That a dark spirit was capable of having more than one cache of babies was something I did not want to think about. I forced my gaze from the creepy-crawlies and studied the body on the bed\u2014although to call it a body was something of a misnomer. The other victims we\u2019d seen might have been little more than preserved skin, but there wasn\u2019t even that much left of Summer. Just some dark hair on the pillow and a few bits of what looked like nails and bone remnants.</p><p>A shudder ran through me. Azriel rubbed my arms, but the heat of his touch did little to combat the chill.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she have more than one lot of babies?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd if she does, why the hell aren\u2019t we overrun with spiderlike dark spirits here on earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would suggest the reason is because they\u2019re cannibalistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at the carpet. It is littered with carcasses.\u201d</p> <p>He was right. It was. In fact, the remnants of little black bodies were so thick that the gray carpet looked like patchwork. \u201cSo she kills the victims to feed her young, but when the young get old enough, they feed on one another? How does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would ensure only the strongest of them survive. It is not unusual behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe in your world, but not in mine,\u201d I muttered. I knew that there were some animal species where the young did eat one another, but only if there wasn\u2019t another food source, and it was generally rare.</p><p>\u201cChildren are not as common in my world as yours and therefore somewhat revered.\u201d His voice held a hint of censure. \u201cWe certainly would not allow them to harm one another in any way.\u201d</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t what I meant and he knew it. But I let it slide and glanced up at him. \u201cI thought reapers lived in big family groups?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would children be rare? Do you suffer the same sort of problem that has killed off most of the Aedh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Aedh breed only when their death is imminent, which kept their numbers stable for millennia. No one can say what changed, but we think the Raziq had a lot to do with it.\u201d</p> <p>That raised my eyebrows. \u201cThey killed off their own kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey believe in their cause and would certainly be capable of wiping out all opposition. In this case, that would mean those who tended and believed in the current viability of the gates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of which doesn\u2019t explain why reapers don\u2019t breed willy-nilly.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cIt is a combination of our long life spans and the fact that our recharge partners aren\u2019t always our Caomhs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you have both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRarely. And if a reaper only ever finds his recharge companion, he will not be blessed with children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have you any children?\u201d I asked, curious and perhaps a little . . . afraid. Because if he had children, that would mean he\u2019d met his Caomh, which in turn meant there was never any hope for us.</p><p>Not that there ever really was.</p><p>His expression closed over. \u201cI am not the Aedh, Risa. I do not want or need multiple partners. If I had a Caomh waiting in the fields for me, I would not be with you.\u201d</p><p>Summarily\u2014though gently\u2014chastised, I pulled my gaze from his and stepped back onto safer ground. \u201cSo what do you suggest we do about these spiders? Do we leave them, keep watch on the apartment, or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not wish to call your uncle?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cHow likely are the spiders to attack anyone who enters that room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. Their hunger stings the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why aren\u2019t they attacking us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we have not entered their lair.\u201d</p><p>And I had no fucking intention of doing so. \u201cCan they be destroyed by something like pest spray, guns, or even fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ordinary fire. Though they wear flesh, they are spirit in design. Witches would more than likely be capable of destroying them, but not someone like your uncle.\u201d</p><p>Which meant I either had to ring Rhoan and warn him\u2014and get the shit blasted out of me for interfering in his case again\u2014or get rid of the damn things myself. Great. Just fucking great.</p><p>Can kill, Amaya said with an eagerness that had me shaking my head. Will enjoy.</p><p>No doubt. I glanced up at Azriel again, and he nodded a confirmation. \u201cIt will not draw our dark spirit to us, though. She obviously does not look after her young any more than the initial feeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how come we were attacked at the club? She wouldn\u2019t have had time to lay her eggs, let alone for the things to hatch. She was only the fill-in entertainer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may have been carrying some young on her. Do not some spiders do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone that I want to meet,\u201d I replied, with another shudder. I drew Amaya and held her in front of me. Lilac fire raced down her sides, and her eagerness ran through the back of my mind. \u201cGo for it.\u201d</p><p>She did. Fire exploded from her tip and spread out in a deadly wash that consumed all that stood in front of it without actually burning the walls or ceiling. The fire alarms went off regardless, but their strident ringing was almost lost to the roar of Amaya\u2019s flames. The thick web shriveled against the onslaught of heat, dripping in silver globules onto the carpet. The spiders tried to flee, attacking one another as they scrambled to seek refuge from the flames. Only there was no refuge\u2014Amaya devoured everything. Web, spiders, furniture. Even Summer\u2019s few remains fell victim to her hunger.</p><p>Soon there was nothing left. Nothing but scorched plaster and melted carpet. Amaya\u2019s flames retreated back to the steel, and her roar became little more than a contented hum. If she\u2019d been a cat, I suspected she would have been purring. Loudly.</p><p>I sheathed her, then rubbed my arms. It didn\u2019t do a lot against the chill still invading my limbs. \u201cWould she have felt the death of her young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know enough about her kind to say for sure, but it is a possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning she might not turn up for her performance tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she has more young to feed, she might have no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning it would be helpful if we knew more about the breeding habits of the Jor\u00f5gumo\u2014if that\u2019s what this thing is.\u201d I bit my bottom lip for a moment. \u201cI wonder if the Brindle witches can tell us anything about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven they are the keepers of all witch knowledge, it is more than likely they could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s where we\u2019ll go next.\u201d My phone rang, the abrupt noise making me jump. I took a calming breath, then hit the ANSWER button and said, \u201cMirri, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard from Ilianna, have you?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cNo. I thought she was supposed to be meeting you. Didn\u2019t you have that date with Carwyn tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing\u2014she hasn\u2019t turned up.\u201d</p><p>My heart began to beat a whole lot faster. \u201cWhat do you mean? Has she backed out again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. At least, I don\u2019t think so. She was pretty determined to hash everything out with Carwyn tonight.\u201d She paused, and even through the phone\u2019s tiny screen, her worry was evident. \u201cRisa, I think something has happened to her.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>For a second I swear my heart stopped. Just thinking that something had happened to Ilianna made my stomach churn so badly, it felt like I was about to vomit. Damn it. I couldn\u2019t lose Ilianna. Not when there was a very real possibility we would lose Tao.</p><p>Panic surged, thick with fear, but I somehow reined it in and said, \u201cHave you tried calling her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Tao? Or her parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and yes. No one\u2019s heard from her, Risa. She\u2019s just gone. Completely and utterly disappeared.\u201d</p><p>No, I thought, swallowing heavily against the bile rising up my throat. She hadn\u2019t disappeared. She was somewhere. It was just somewhere Mirri couldn\u2019t find.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the hospitals?\u201d As much as I hoped she hadn\u2019t been hurt, it was always a possibility, and certainly one we had to consider before we pressed the panic button too far.</p><p>\u201cAlso checked. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>At least that was something. I took a quivering breath and released it slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll find her, Mirri.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cWhat about Carwyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here with me at the restaurant. He\u2019s got a friend in the police force he\u2019s going to hit up for any information that might come through official lines.\u201d</p><p>If it came through police sources, then it wouldn\u2019t be good. But Mirri knew that just as well as I did. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go across to the Brindle, so I\u2019ll talk to Ilianna\u2019s mom. Maybe she can scry for her or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot.\u201d There were tears in Mirri\u2019s dark eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t think something bad has happened to her, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I gave her a reassuring smile and hoped it didn\u2019t look as forced as it felt. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just something dumb\u2014like her phone running out of charge and her car breaking down.\u201d</p><p>A tremulous half smile touched her lips. \u201cShe does have a habit of letting her phone run out of charge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, she does.\u201d But rarely to complete emptiness. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her, Mirri.

I pocketed my phone, then glanced at Azriel. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could do a sweep and see if you could find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d He studied me for a moment. \u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo to the Brindle, as I said. I vaguely remember Ilianna saying her mom was on night shift this week, so I can kill two birds with one stone.\u201d My stomach tightened as the words left my mouth. Damn it, she wasn\u2019t dead. I\u2019d know. Surely to god I\u2019d know. I hesitated, then added, voice a little hoarse, \u201cIf she were dead, would you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cBut I could find out if you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be good. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and disappeared. I took another of those calming breaths that did jack all to calm, then called to the Aedh and got the hell out of there. I left the Ducati where she was\u2014right then, I didn\u2019t particularly care if Rhoan saw it or not. All that mattered was getting to the Brindle and talking to Ilianna\u2019s mom. If anything had happened to her, surely she\u2019d be the one person who would know.</p><p>I zoomed through the night with all the speed I could muster, reaching the Brindle in record time. I shifted shape, splatted with my usual inelegance onto the carefully manicured lawn in front of the building, then thrust to my feet and pulled the remnants of my clothes into some semblance of order as I ran for the front steps.</p><p>The Brindle was a white, four-story building that had once been a part of the Old Treasury complex. It had been built in the Victorian era and was both beautiful and grand in design. It wasn\u2019t until you neared the steps and felt a tingling caress of energy against your skin that you realized this place was very different from its brethren. It was the home of all witch knowledge, and it was protected by a veil of power so strong that it snatched away the breath of those who were sensitive to these things. I\u2019d never considered myself overly sensitive to magic, but I\u2019d always been aware of it. This time, though, the feeling was weirdly different. It wasn\u2019t just awareness\u2014it felt like the power of this place was alive. Fingers of energy crawled across my skin, its touch sharp, electric. It made my flesh itch\u2014crawl\u2014and almost felt as if it were testing me. The Brindle didn\u2019t suffer evil to enter, but it had never troubled me in any way before.</p> <p>So why the change? Did it have anything to do with the key quest or what the Raziq had done to me?</p><p>Possibly. And yet Kiandra\u2014who was the head witch at the Brindle\u2014had told me that as powerful as the magic around the Brindle was, it could not stop the Aedh from entering. Logically, therefore, it shouldn\u2019t be able to stop me. But then, I wasn\u2019t full Aedh. I was both flesh and energy.</p><p>That will change, an inner voice whispered darkly.</p><p>I shivered, but thrust the odd premonition out of my mind and took the steps two at a time. The huge\u2014almost medieval-looking\u2014wood and wrought-iron doors had been closed for the night, so I walked to the left side of the massive entrance and pulled the discreet cord. Deep inside the building, a bell chimed. I waited, and after a few minutes, footsteps approached. One door opened, revealing a brown-haired, slender, tunic-clad figure. It wasn\u2019t someone I\u2019d met before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019re closed for the night.\u201d Her voice was soft, gentle. Raised voices were rarely used in this place of power.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I need to speak to Custodian Zaira, please.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that she\u2019s here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen check,\u201d I cut in. Then, at the flash of annoyance that crossed her face, added, \u201cPlease. Tell her it\u2019s Risa Jones, and it really is important.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze swept me assessingly; then she nodded and closed the door. I listened to the retreat of her footsteps and wondered whether she was simply walking away or doing what I asked. After a few minutes, I heard her talking. Misplaced mistrust, I thought, and gave myself a mental slap. After a few minutes, she returned and opened the door, wider this time.</p><p>\u201cZaira has agreed to see you. Please, come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I stepped through the doorway. The foyer wasn\u2019t exactly inviting, even in the daylight, but at night, its sheer size seemed to weigh on the shadows, so that they almost appeared to loom over me. It was a weird sensation\u2014almost as if the walls themselves were standing in judgment of not only me, but all those who walked past.</p><p>I very much suspected I would be found severely wanting. At least at the moment.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d the woman said softly.</p><p>She led the way down the long hall. The energy of this place was so strong that every step was accompanied by a spray of golden sparks. The old-fashioned electric sconces threw just enough light to ensure we didn\u2019t run into the walls, but they did little to otherwise lift the shadows.</p><p>The young witch led me into the visitors\u2019 waiting room, told me to wait, then went through the door behind the small desk and closed it firmly behind her. I knew from previous visits that you didn\u2019t get past this area without either a witch escort or special dispensation from Kiandra, but I was a little surprised at being held here this time. I\u2019d have thought Ilianna\u2019s mom would have been here given I\u2019d mentioned it was urgent.</p><p>That she wasn\u2019t probably meant we were all panicking over nothing.</p><p>No, that dratted inner voice whispered, you\u2019re not.</p><p>I crossed my arms and began to pace. Several minutes crawled by, ratcheting up my tension and frustration. When footsteps echoed in the hall outside, I swung around and all but ran out\u2014and almost collided with Ilianna\u2019s mom in the process. Only quick reactions on her part kept us both upright.</p><p>\u201cRisa,\u201d she said, her soft tones holding a hint of surprise and perhaps amusement. \u201cThis is not a place where speed is required.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and tried to calm down. \u201cI know, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Ilianna had inherited her palomino coloring and her shifting abilities from her dad, as Zaira was human. But Ilianna had the same powerful green eyes as her mom and right now they\u2019d narrowed considerably. \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo things.\u201d I hesitated, but there was no easy way to say it, so I just came straight out with it. \u201cFirst off, we think something has happened to Ilianna.\u201d</p><p>Zaira frowned. \u201cMirri called earlier looking for her, but I didn\u2019t get the impression that she was in any way worried.\u201d</p><p>Then Mirri was better at containing her concern than I was. \u201cI know. But Ilianna hasn\u2019t turned up for her date with Carwyn, and we can\u2019t get her on the phone.\u201d</p><p>The older woman smiled, although there was a slight edge of tension emanating from her now. \u201cWell, given she isn\u2019t too pleased about our matchmaking efforts, her standing him up again is not entirely surprising.\u201d</p><p>I was shaking my head before she\u2019d even finished. \u201cNot this time. Mirri said she was determined to talk to him about the match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk him out of it, you mean,\u201d she said. But the tension in her ratcheted up several more notches. She studied me for a moment, then abruptly turned and walked away.</p><p>\u201cCome along, child,\u201d she said over her shoulder, when I didn\u2019t immediately follow.</p><p>I hurriedly caught up. \u201cI was hoping you could do a scrying or location spell for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA location spell won\u2019t work.\u201d She opened a door and walked into another dark hall. \u201cShe learned to divert such spells at a very early age.\u201d</p><p>There was an odd mix of annoyance and pride in her voice. I half smiled. \u201cHow young?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cShe was twelve. Even at that age it was evident she was very gifted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why wasn\u2019t she ever asked to become a custodian?\u201d</p><p>Our footsteps beat a sharp tattoo against the marble floor, and the sound echoed in the hushed shadows that surrounded us. I half wondered if we\u2019d wake anyone up. I knew from past experience that there were at least two dozen witches staying here at any one time, some of them permanent residents like Kiandra, and some, like Ilianna\u2019s mother, here only when rostered on for duty.</p><p>Zaira turned left at the end of the hall and started up some stairs. Lights flickered on as we approached, then went dark once we\u2019d passed, and there wasn\u2019t a sensor to be seen.</p><p>Zaira gave me a quick but nevertheless shrewd glance over her shoulder. \u201cShe did begin training as a custodian, but her tenure was brief.\u201d</p><p>I knew that. I also knew she\u2019d seen something that scared the hell out of her. \u201cShe has mentioned that, but she\u2019s never said why she left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she would not.\u201d We entered another hall. For a moment I thought that was the end of the conversation, but she surprised me by adding, \u201cThis place, and all the wisdom it holds, is not only protected by magic, but sometimes by steel and bloodshed. Ilianna witnessed a latter event and was too young to understand the necessity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not too young now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d There was a smile in her voice. \u201cBut she is incredibly stubborn. I fear she will not come back to us until Kiandra leaves.\u201d</p><p>Meaning Kiandra was the one who had done the bloodshed, obviously. Still, it was odd. Ilianna wasn\u2019t the squeamish type; nor was she illogical. And she was certainly more than capable of understanding the necessity to sometimes use force to protect what was, basically, the spiritual home of witches here in Australia. There had to be more to the story. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo what did she see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, I\u2019m afraid, I cannot tell you.\u201d</p><p>I guess I had to be thankful she\u2019d told me as much as she had, although it was certainly frustrating to pick up a little more knowledge and yet know there was a whole lot more to uncover.</p> <p>We continued on down the darkened hall. This was an area I\u2019d never been through before and, if it had been day rather than night, I might have slowed and had a good look around. As it was, I could barely see anything more than the darkly stained wood panels that lined the hall.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your other reason for coming here?\u201d Zaira asked.</p><p>It took me a moment to remember. \u201cOh. Yeah. Do you know anything about Jor\u00f5gumos?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI am by no means an expert, but I can tell you they are particularly nasty spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d I said grimly, \u201cthey are.\u201d</p> <p>She shot me a glance. \u201cMeaning there\u2019s one active here in Melbourne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Anything you can tell us about them would be helpful.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cThey\u2019re often called whore spiders, and for good reason. When they come into season, they take on the form of beautiful women and lure their chosen victims by playing magical Biwas, which is a type of Japanese lute. Once their prey is ensnared, the Jor\u00f5gumos bind them in order to either devour them or feed them to their young, depending on where the particular Jor\u00f5gumo is in her breeding cycle.\u201d</p><p>Which was an exact description of what was happening. This thing was a Jor\u00f5gumo. \u201cDo you know how many kills they need per breeding cycle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp to half a dozen.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cDepends on the size and age of the Jor\u00f5gumo.\u201d</p><p>Meaning this spider spirit wasn\u2019t finished hunting yet. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know an easy way to find this one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. But they rarely stray from established hunting patterns. Work that out, and you should be able to ascertain where she will attack next.\u201d</p><p>In other words we were already on the right track. Zaira opened a door about midway down and flicked on a light. As had been the case in the hall, warm light spread across the room but barely lifted the shadows.</p><p>We were in a small, sweet-smelling office that was basically furnished. An old wooden desk dominated the center of the room, and with it was a leather chair that had seen better days. Shelves lined all the walls and were overflowing with books of every size and color. The weight of them had many of the shelves bowing, and the smell . . . I drew in a deep breath and sighed in appreciation. There was nothing quite like the scent of old books, even when it was almost overwhelmed by the richer scents of lavender and rose.</p><p>Zaira sat down at her desk, pulled open a drawer, then carefully lifted a silk-covered ball onto her desk. This wasn\u2019t any old ball, but one of power. I could feel the energy radiating off it even from where I stood in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll attempt a scrying,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019ll work. As I\u2019ve said, she learned long ago to block my efforts of tracking her.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms and leaned a shoulder against the doorframe. \u201cI just want to know if she\u2019s okay. I know I may be panicking over nothing, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are your mother\u2019s daughter and, in many respects, even more powerful. I would never ignore your premonitions, however slight, and neither should you.\u201d</p><p>Surprise rippled through me. More powerful than my mother? That was unlikely, because her talents had been sharpened and honed in a madman\u2019s laboratory. While I was more than adept at using my psychic skills, I\u2019d certainly never honed them\u2014something that had frustrated the hell out of Mom.</p> <p>But all I\u2019d ever wanted was a normal life\u2014or as normal as it could ever be given who my mother was and how wealthy we were\u2014and in many respects, my psychic abilities had stood in the way of that desire. I had learned to control and use the skills that being half Aedh endowed, simply because Uncle Quinn had always stressed the danger of doing otherwise. I might be stubborn, but I wasn\u2019t a fool.</p><p>But it was moments like this, when I was standing here in Zaira\u2019s office, having to rely on her for information, that I wished I\u2019d listened to Mom.</p><p>Zaira unwrapped the crystal and placed her hands on either side of the ball. Light flickered deep in its heart and sent sprays of silver cascading around the walls. Zaira took a deep breath, released it slowly, then closed her eyes and placed her palms on either side of the crystal. Her breathing grew deeper and, after several minutes, the crystal became cloudy and the silver cascade muted.</p><p>I watched, wondering what she was seeing and whether it involved Ilianna. Mom had sometimes used a crystal ball when trying to contact the dead for her clients, but it was never her favorite method. She preferred s\u00e9ances, simply because a physical connection with the living relative made communication with the dead easier. For her, it was also less taxing and more accurate.</p><p>But Zaira was witch trained. She would be able to do far more with a crystal ball than Mom could ever have imagined.</p><p>Time seemed to slow to a crawl, and tension curled through me. I hating waiting, hated not knowing what, if anything, was happening. The only reason I didn\u2019t start pacing was the knowledge that it would more than likely disrupt Zaira\u2019s scrying.</p><p>But eventually she sighed and removed her hands from the crystal. The cloudiness eased immediately and the swirling silver light returned.</p><p>Zaira leaned back in her chair and rubbed her forehead wearily. \u201cWell, the good news is that she\u2019s not dead.\u201d</p><p>That was at least something, though it didn\u2019t exactly ease the tension still curling through me.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d I said, because there very obviously was one.</p><p>\u201cBut I can get no feel for her. Something is blocking my ability to pin down her essence, and I cannot tell whether that something is her own magic or something else.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat else could there be?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cAll magic can be blocked, whether by magical means or physical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysical? How do you block magic physically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertain elements\u2014white ash and iron, for instance\u2014are immune to magic and therefore can be either used as a weapon or shield against it.\u201d She wrapped the silk covering around the ball and placed it carefully back in her drawer. \u201cWhatever is being used, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t get past it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d She rose. \u201cAnd it might just mean, despite her assertions to the contrary, she had last-minute qualms about meeting Carwyn. Which would be unfortunate, because she would not find a better match herself.\u201d</p><p>It was a point Ilianna had finally acknowledged\u2014if only to me\u2014but it didn\u2019t change the fact that she\u2019d rather remain in a relationship with just Mirri than join Carwyn\u2019s herd and risk the dynamic between them changing. I couldn\u2019t actually say that to Zaira, though, given she didn\u2019t even know her daughter was gay.</p><p>\u201cI know she doesn\u2019t want to be forced into a herd, but I doubt she\u2019d back away at the last minute. Not without informing Carwyn, at the very least. She has better manners than that.\u201d</p><p>Zaira smiled as she walked around the desk. \u201cThat she has.\u201d</p><p>She motioned me into the hall, then walked beside me as we made our way back down to the foyer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll call me the minute you find her?\u201d she said as she unlocked the front door.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d I touched her arm in reassurance. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry to have worried you over what will probably turn out to be nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to the safety of my daughters, I would rather be worried over nothing than something.\u201d She placed her hand briefly over mine and lightly squeezed. \u201cBe careful. I might not have found Ilianna, but I did sense the shadows that surround you. There are people in your life who are more dangerous than you know.\u201d</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t something she needed to tell me. I forced a smile. \u201cThanks. I will be.\u201d</p><p>I headed out. The night air was cool after the warmth of the Brindle\u2019s halls, the gentle breeze like ice. I zipped up my jacket as I ran down the stairs. Azriel reappeared in front of me, forcing me to stop on the bottom step.</p><p>\u201cI could not find her,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she is alive. Her death is not slated for this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because she\u2019s not meant to die now doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t. Accidents happen.\u201d Nevertheless, relief slithered through me. If both Zaira and Azriel were saying she was alive, then surely to god she was. But that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t die. That she wasn\u2019t in trouble. \u201cDamn it, something is wrong, I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you wish to do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we really can do.\u201d I bit my lip for a moment, then said, \u201cMaybe Stane can locate her through the GPS in her car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she is not in her car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe via her phone.\u201d I half shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s the only option I have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we will try it.\u201d</p><p>He held out a hand. I placed my fingers in his and allowed him to tug me into his embrace. For a second, he did nothing more than hold me, surrounding me in his warmth and silently offering me the comfort I so desperately needed. Then his energy surged and we swept through the gray fields to Stane\u2019s.</p><p>He jumped and swore a blue streak when we re-formed in the middle of his living room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever do that to me again,\u201d he said, leaning back in his chair and holding his hand rather dramatically over his heart. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could survive the shock a second time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not slated for death until you are old and gray,\u201d Azriel commented. \u201cSo do not fear the strength of your heart.\u201d</p><p>Stane gave him a somewhat dubious glance. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure whether to be comforted by that statement or not.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cI\u2019m gathering something dramatic has happened?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. Ilianna\u2019s gone missing.\u201d I sat in one of the spare chairs and scooted it across to his \u201cbridge\u201d of computer screens. \u201cI need you to hack into either her car\u2019s GPS signal or locate her via her phone.\u201d</p><p>He gave me the sort of look a father might give a child that was being exceptionally dumb. \u201cAnd have you tried using Latitude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no?\u201d Mainly because I was of the opinion that if my friends wanted to find me, they could damn well ring and ask me.</p> <p>He sighed. \u201cDid I not tell you all to sign up for it some time ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. I told you, it\u2019s the easiest way ever invented to uncover where your buddies might be hiding, and it doesn\u2019t even require GPS.\u201d He swung around, swiped one of the screens across to Google, and logged in. A map of Melbourne appeared, dotted with arrowed face pics. He leaned forward a little, studying all the names, then grinned.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d he said, enlarging the screen. \u201cShe\u2019s at South Bank.\u201d</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t that enlightening given how big the place was. Although, if I remembered right, Carwyn had booked a table at Harvest Time\u2014did this mean she was headed there? That she was okay, despite being incommunicado? \u201cWhere in South Bank?\u201d</p> <p>He frowned, zoomed the screen in a little more, then said, \u201cAccording to this, she\u2019s at Wilson\u2019s Parking, just off Freshwater Place.\u201d He glanced up at me. \u201cIt\u2019s the riverside quay area, if you don\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, but we\u2019ll find it.\u201d I jumped up and dropped a kiss on his unshaven and definitely scratchy cheek. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo probs. Just give me some warning next time you decide to drop by.\u201d He gave Azriel another dubious look. \u201cDespite what your friend here says, my heart really can\u2019t take surprises like that.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll send some more champers to make up for it.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI haven\u2019t got the last lot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll need it if you keep popping into existence willy-nilly. Now, go find Ilianna so I can get back to my gaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>I stepped into Azriel\u2019s arms and he whisked us out of there. We reappeared on the center strip that divided the two lanes of Freshwater Place, the eight-story parking garage in front of us and the remaining wall of an old brick warehouse behind us. Several cars zoomed past, briefly spotlighting us before sweeping on.</p><p>I grabbed Azriel\u2019s hand and ran across the road. \u201cCan you sense her?\u201d I asked, as we headed into the garage via the exit lane.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His fingers squeezed mine lightly. \u201cBut that does not mean she is not here.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t mean she was, either. I ignored the fear that rose with the thought and hurried on. The garage had eight levels, and we found Ilianna\u2019s car on the seventh.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in it.</p><p>I swore vehemently and punched the roof of her Jeep hard enough to actually dent it.</p> <p>\u201cThere are security cameras dotted around this place,\u201d Azriel commented. \u201cI would suggest you avoid such outbursts unless you wish company.\u201d</p><p>I flexed my fingers, somehow managed to control the somewhat insane desire to continue to take my frustration out on Ilianna\u2019s car, and peered in through the windows instead. And there, sitting on the front seat, were not only her phone, but her purse and coat as well.</p><p>Ilianna might have left her phone behind if it had gone dead, but she sure as hell wouldn\u2019t have left her purse.</p><p>Something had happened to her.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d I all but exploded. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d I cut in, voice bitter. I leaned back against the car and closed my eyes. \u201cThis day has just gone from bad to fucking worse. Maybe we should just quit while we\u2019re ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sentiment I would agree with, except for the fact that Hunter, at the very least, would not be pleased by such an event.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, my phone rang. And the tone told me it was Hunter.</p><p>\u201cThe bitch obviously has her phone linked to my thoughts,\u201d I muttered, but nevertheless dug it out of my pocket and hit the ANSWER button. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t found her yet. I haven\u2019t found anyone fucking yet.\u201d</p><p>Amusement touched her lips, though it did little to lift the shadows from her bright eyes. \u201cI take it the day has not been a good one for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Ilianna has gone missing.\u201d I paused. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d know anything about that, would you?\u201d</p><p>She arched an eyebrow. \u201cAnd why would I bother with such an endeavor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you did make less-than-veiled threats against my friends if I didn\u2019t do what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, I remember.\u201d Her amusement grew. \u201cBut given you are doing as I desire, there is no need for such action as yet, is there, now?\u201d</p><p>Her reply was almost purred. If I could have reached down the phone and strangled the bitch, I would have.</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d It was said through somewhat clenched teeth. \u201cBut the fact of the matter is that I\u2019m not having much luck tracking down the Jor\u00f5gumo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you found two of her nests. Or was the burned-out bedroom not your handiwork?\u201d</p><p>I mentally swore and rubbed my forehead wearily. I was starting to get one hell of a headache, and I suspected it wouldn\u2019t go away in a hurry. Not unless I drowned it under several gallons of alcohol, and that wasn\u2019t particularly practical right now\u2014even if it sounded like the best idea I\u2019d had for ages.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Rhoan say in his report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat something or someone destroyed what appeared to be a nest of spiders in one Ms. Summers\u2019s bedroom.\u201d</p><p>And how had he come to that conclusion given that Amaya\u2019s flames had consumed just about everything? And why hadn\u2019t I received a phone call demanding to know why the hell I was even anywhere near the place given my promise not to investigate? He surely wouldn\u2019t have missed the fact that the Ducati was parked right outside. If she was still parked outside, that was. Knowing my uncle, he\u2019d probably ordered her confiscated, just to teach me a lesson.</p><p>\u201cI burned the bastards because I didn\u2019t think anyone would want a friggin\u2019 nest of Jor\u00f5gumos remaining in existence,\u201d I said, with a touch more annoyance than was probably wise. Just because she seemed to be amused didn\u2019t mean she actually was. \u201cThey were too young to be in any form other than spider, so it was unlikely the Directorate witches would have gotten any information out of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about the mama spider?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s supposed to be performing at someplace called the Falcon Club at midnight, but I don\u2019t like our chances of catching her there.\u201d</p><p>The amusement faded. Rapidly. \u201cAnd why would that be?\u201d</p><p>Because I burned her babies and it\u2019s more than likely she sensed it. But I wasn\u2019t about to actually say that. My life might not be fun at the moment, but I sure as hell wasn\u2019t ready to see it end just yet.</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re not dealing with a dumb spirit here. She spotted me at Hallowed Ground and did a runner. She knows we\u2019re after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even a spirit can deny the urge of a mother to feed her young,\u201d Hunter commented. \u201cShe didn\u2019t kill this afternoon, so if she still has young to feed, she will be forced to do so either tonight or tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Undoubtedly. \u201cSo do you want me to go to the Falcon Club, or would you rather?\u201d I kept my fingers crossed for the latter, because the last thing I really felt like right now was traipsing off to another bloody club.</p><p>As usual, it was a forlorn hope.</p><p>\u201cI have no desire to be involved in the grunt work of investigating. That is what underlings are for.\u201d</p><p>A smile touched her lips, but it was in no way a nice smile. Just for a moment, I thought about Harry Stanford\u2019s offer and was tempted. Seriously tempted.</p><p>But only briefly. However desperate I might be feeling, I wasn\u2019t insane, and there was no way in hell I was going to cross the line and go up against Hunter.</p><p>\u201cJust remember to contact me once you have found her,\u201d she continued, in that same sweet, do-it-or-I\u2019ll-kill-you voice. \u201cBecause I very much intend to do to her what she did to Wolfgang.\u201d</p><p>Consume her? Not just her blood, but her intestines, guts, and brain? Surely to god that wasn\u2019t possible for a vampire to do\u2014blood yes, but not the innards as well? And yet if any vampire could be capable of it, then it would be Hunter.</p><p>Somehow, I managed to keep the horror out of my voice as I said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be the first person I call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had best be the only call you make where this case is concerned.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d meant the comment sarcastically\u2014it wasn\u2019t like I could call anyone else, anyway. But I didn\u2019t bother replying. I just hung up, shoved the phone away, and glanced at my watch. \u201cWell, it\u2019s nine o\u2019clock. Given I can\u2019t do anything else to find Ilianna, and I have no intention of going to that damn club earlier than I have to, we\u2019ve got only one option left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d Azriel said, the slightest hint of a smile breaking his otherwise bland expression.</p><p>\u201cWe go home and make mad, crazy love to each other. Let\u2019s grab a moment of utter normality before the shit hits the fan completely.\u201d</p><p>Because a storm was coming. I could feel it. And I had a bad, bad suspicion I might not survive it.</p><p>Azriel caught my hand and tugged me into his arms. \u201cWhile I am alive, you will remain so. I promise you that, if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>I melted into his embrace and listened to the strong, steady beat of his heart. \u201cIf death is my fate, even you cannot change that.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, and my stomach dropped. I looked up quickly and caught the flash of . . . something dark\u2014perhaps even a little guilt\u2014in his eyes. Then it was gone, and all that remained was tenderness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you?\u201d I asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThat is a question I hope I will never be forced to answer,\u201d he said. Which wasn\u2019t exactly an answer, but I knew him well enough now to understand it was all I was about to get. \u201cNow, about this business of mad, crazy lovemaking. I\u2019m not sure I understand the concept.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThen take me home and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p> <p>He did, and I did.</p><p>And it was glorious.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>The Falcon Club was decidedly seedy. The air was thick with the scents of cigars, alcohol, and unwashed flesh, and it was packed with people\u2014mainly men, but there was a good smattering of women here as well, most of whom were scantily dressed and very obviously working the room. Sex, I suspected, could be found here for a price.</p><p>My nose twitched at the unpleasant aromas surrounding me, but I ignored them the best I could, grabbed a drink from the bar, then wound my way through the shabby tables, choosing one in the thicker shadows near the bathrooms. It was far enough away from the bar\u2014and most of the patrons\u2014that the air was almost breathable and had the added bonus of affording a good view of the small stage situated to the left of the bar.</p> <p>I sat down and nursed the icy glass of beer between my palms. This club obviously wasn\u2019t one of your more upmarket ones, so it was a little surprising that they\u2019d employed someone like Di Shard to provide their entertainment. Given the state of this place\u2014and the less-than-dapper look of its customers\u2014a stripper would probably have been more appropriate. Or, at the very least, a rock band\u2014although given the club\u2019s close proximity to homes, noise regulations would probably have stopped that.</p><p>I took a drink of beer and briefly caught the eye of a tall, somewhat hairy individual several tables over. He reminded me somewhat of the visage Azriel had said he\u2019d adopted when we\u2019d visited Classique, and I couldn\u2019t help smiling. The bear-shifter\u2014he couldn\u2019t really be anything else looking like that\u2014obviously took my smile as a go-ahead signal, because he rose, hitched up his trousers, and began wandering over. He was little more than four feet away when he abruptly turned and headed off toward the bar.</p><p>I just about choked on my drink. And here I was thinking you couldn\u2019t interfere with the thoughts or actions of others unless it involved the key search in some way.</p><p>Given the direction of that man\u2019s thoughts, you should be thankful I did turn him away.</p><p>I grinned at the annoyance in his mental tones. And what if I\u2019d wanted to be mauled by a hairy bear type?</p><p>You have far better taste than that.</p> <p>The amusement bubbling through me got stronger. That wasn\u2019t what you were saying when I was with Lucian.</p><p>The Aedh\u2019s attraction was magic enhanced.</p><p>And the fact that he was also a fantastic lover had absolutely nothing to do with it. That comment was greeted by stony silence. I somehow controlled my amusement and switched to safer subjects. No sign of our spider-spirit yet?</p><p>We\u2019d decided that\u2014given the Jor\u00f5gumo\u2019s sudden retreat last time we\u2019d tried to confront her\u2014it might be wiser if Azriel remained outside, in the vague hope that out of sight would mean out of sensory range. I could hide my features easily enough\u2014and was, in fact, now green-eyed, brown-haired, and definitely not anything you\u2019d label pretty\u2014so it was unlikely she\u2019d even recognize me, let alone sense I was anything more than just another non-human. Spirits, Azriel had assured me, weren\u2019t often attuned to the Aedh. Amaya\u2019s presence on my back was another matter entirely, but given I wasn\u2019t about to go anywhere without having her close at hand, it was a risk we had to take.</p><p>No sign of her, he said. But she is unlikely to arrive early given she is aware that we hunt her.</p><p>Which makes me wonder if she\u2019ll even turn up. I mean, if she\u2019s as smart as you said, she\u2019d be stupid to come here.</p><p>But, as Hunter noted, sometimes maternal demands overrun common sense.</p><p>I took another sip of beer. It was, despite the grimy air of the place, surprisingly good. A couple walked past me, the man radiating lust and grinning with expectation. The woman\u2019s expression was rather world-weary. Just another mark for her, I thought, as they made their way into the bathroom. I grimaced at the thought. If the bathrooms were as grimy as the rest of this place, it sure as hell wouldn\u2019t have been my first choice for a rendezvous. Even the lane behind this joint would have been cleaner.</p> <p>Trying to tune their noise out, I said, If she merely wishes to feed her young, why wouldn\u2019t she just snatch someone off the street?</p><p>Perhaps she requires more in a victim than just mere flesh and blood. Her male victims were strong psychically, remember. And she consumed them, not her young.</p><p>Meaning maybe I should do a quick reconnoiter and see if I can sense any psychically strong targets in the room.</p><p>You do not need to subject yourself to the less-than-savory nature of those in the club. His mental tones held a note that I would have sworn was proprietary had it been anyone else. There are four such people in the room.</p><p>Who?</p><p>As I am not in the room, I cannot say precisely. I merely sense the vibrations of their souls.</p><p>Which isn\u2019t much good given the room is packed. Our task would be easier if we knew who to keep an eye on. I downed my drink in several gulps and rose. I\u2019ll take the long way to the bar and see what I can uncover.</p><p>If you wish. His tone suggested he didn\u2019t think it was necessary, and I couldn\u2019t help grinning all over again. My reaper might have accused me of being jealous over his flirting with other women on more than one occasion, but it really was beginning to sound like he was suffering from the same affliction. And I couldn\u2019t help but be happy about that, if only because it suggested that I wasn\u2019t imagining the caring I sometimes sensed in him.</p><p>Of course, taking the long way to the bar did mean walking past a lot of very merry men, many of whom seemed to think a female rump in close proximity really did need a pinch, if not a good fondle. It irked the hell out of me, but I kept my temper in check and a smile on my face and was rewarded by finding all four psychics. Two had parked themselves at the bar, one was sitting with a dark-haired woman near the front door, and the last one leaned casually against the wall opposite the bar, sipping his beer and idly surveying the crowd.</p><p>His gaze met mine briefly, and a frisson of recognition raced through me. Not because I knew him, but because I knew the type.</p><p>If he wasn\u2019t Directorate, I\u2019d eat my damn hat. If I\u2019d been wearing a hat, that was.</p><p>At least his gaze slid past me and continued on. My inner devil was tempted to go over and chat him up, not only because he was one of the few half-decent-looking guys in the room, but because it would have been interesting to see if I could tease any information out of him.</p><p>But we were both here to catch a killer, and that sort of behavior wasn\u2019t something either of us needed. Besides, it wasn\u2019t like I needed another man in my life, however briefly I might flirt with the idea.</p><p>I made my way back to my table, but had barely sat down when Azriel said, She\u2019s here.</p><p>Where?</p><p>Just entering the club via a rear door. He paused. She can sense me.</p><p>I swore softly and pushed up from the table so quickly that I half spilled my beer. Meaning she\u2019s running again?</p><p>No. I retreated fast, and she remains.</p><p>I sighed in relief. Keep your distance, then. With the Directorate here, we can\u2019t do anything until she picks out a victim and leaves with him.</p><p>The guardian will follow her, just as we plan to.</p><p>Yeah, but we can knock out his car or even him. Though it would undoubtedly be easier to do the former rather than the latter. He might be a shifter rather than a vampire, but he was still a guardian and therefore dangerous.</p><p>I sat back down and took a sip of beer. I had only half of it left, but I wasn\u2019t going to walk over to the bar to get another one. Given our target had entered the building, it was better if I remained where I was.</p><p>After a few more minutes, a tall, thin man walked onto the stage and lightly tapped the microphone to get everyone\u2019s attention. Unfortunately for him, just about everyone but me ignored him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid tonight\u2019s entertainment has been canceled. The lively Di Shard called in sick at the last moment, and we weren\u2019t able to get a replacement.\u201d</p><p>The news was greeted by general indifference, but it had me frowning. Azriel, has she left again or is she still here?</p><p>She\u2019s there. I cannot pinpoint her location precisely because doing so means moving closer and increases the chances of her sensing me again.</p><p>So why the hell would the manager announce she was unavailable?</p><p>I cannot say.</p><p>Neither could I, and it was damn worrying. And it wasn\u2019t like I needed anything else to worry about given the whole key situation and now Ilianna\u2019s disappearance.</p><p>I searched for the four psychics again and spotted all but the guardian. I saw him a couple of seconds later as he jumped onto the stage and followed the manager into the back room. He was obviously intending to question the man\u2014something I really would have liked to have done but now couldn\u2019t. The guardian might not have recognized me, but he\u2019d know I was wolf. The last thing I needed was him reporting a werewolf working for the vamp council questioning the manager. Rhoan could put two and two together as easily as the next man.</p><p>My gaze swept the room again, but I didn\u2019t see anything that spiked the internal radar. Then a tall, somewhat slender woman pulled away from the deeper shadows to the left of the stage\u2014in fact, it looked almost as if she was re-forming from them. And maybe she was.</p><p>She was tall, brown-haired, and had a faint red stripe running along her center part. She didn\u2019t physically resemble either Shard or Summer\u2014except for that stripe\u2014but then, that was no surprise given she was able to take on different forms. And she would, because she knew she was being chased.</p><p>I wrapped my hands around my almost empty glass and tried not to be overly obvious about watching her. She looked around the room for several minutes; then her gaze centered on one of the shifters standing near the bar. She strolled toward him and trailed her fingers along the nape of his neck as she sat on the vacant barstool beside him. He jumped as if he\u2019d just been stung, and maybe he had. She was a spider after all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They began to chat and were soon as animated as old friends. She wasn\u2019t overly obvious with her flirting, just went with encouraging smiles and the occasional casual touch. But the psychic energy radiating off her was strong enough that I could feel it from here\u2014and it felt hungry.</p><p>I shivered. In the back of my mind, Amaya began humming, the soft sound filled with expectation. This one is not for you, I\u2019m afraid.</p><p>It hunts, she replied, somewhat testily. Should kill.</p> <p>Oh, she will be killed, just not by us.</p><p>Task mine.</p><p>Not this time.</p><p>I swear she swore\u2014although if she had, it was in a language I couldn\u2019t understand. Did demons even have their own language?</p><p>Of course, Azriel commented, his tone amused. All sentient beings do.</p> <p>I guess I just didn\u2019t expect it from a demon in a sword.</p><p>Remember, before she was in the sword, she was a very powerful demon causing a great deal of havoc.</p><p>Havoc good, she commented. Should cause more.</p><p>I snorted. Bloodthirsty little beast, aren\u2019t you?</p><p>She preened. I shook my head, then tensed as the shifter and the Jor\u00f5gumo rose in unison. My gaze swept the club, but I didn\u2019t see any sign of the guardian. Maybe he\u2019d left after talking to the manager.</p><p>Not entirely, Azriel said. He\u2019s outside, watching the entrance.</p> <p>Damn. I should have guessed a guardian wouldn\u2019t abandon his post so easily. Or that we\u2019d be that lucky. We need to take him out.</p><p>The shifter and the spider-spirit didn\u2019t head for the front door, however, but rather turned and walked, arm in arm, in my direction. I swore softly, but kept my head down and sipped the remains of my beer.</p><p>Awareness crawled across my skin. The closer she got, the worse it got, until it felt like thousands of tiny black feet were skittering all over me. My grip on the glass became so fierce, my knuckles went white\u2014how it didn\u2019t shatter, I had no idea.</p><p>They walked past, whispering like lovers. I resisted the urge to jump up and follow them, forcing myself to remain still and listen to their retreating footsteps. They didn\u2019t go into the bathroom as I\u2019d half expected, but rather through the rear fire exit.</p><p>I thrust to my feet and followed them, catching the door with my fingertips before it closed again. The alarm, I noted, had been disconnected\u2014and had been for a while, if the state of the wires was anything to go by. Obviously, the Jor\u00f5gumo and her lover were not the first to make a retreat out the rear door.</p><p>I cautiously peered out. The two of them were halfway down the small lane that ran the length of the row of buildings in this block. I waited until they\u2019d neared the main street, then slipped out, stopping the door from slamming closed before moving\u2014as stealthily as I could\u2014down the lane. The minute the two of them turned left and were out of my sight, I quickened my pace but didn\u2019t run. Even a drunk shifter had damn good hearing. While he might not connect my footsteps with them being followed, he might just mention it. I couldn\u2019t risk the Jor\u00f5gumo fleeing again.</p><p>Where are they going? I asked.</p><p>They have stopped near a car. Azriel paused. The guardian is on the move as well.</p> <p>Shit. He must have put either movement sensors or temporary cameras in the lane. My gaze swept the shadows around me, but I couldn\u2019t spot either of them. Of course, he very obviously wouldn\u2019t have put them anywhere that they could be easily seen.</p><p>If there were damn cameras, though, it might lead to trouble for me. A brown-haired woman following the Jor\u00f5gumo and her next victim might not make this guardian suspicious, but it certainly would prick Uncle Rhoan\u2019s internal radar.</p><p>Where is he?</p><p>He\u2019s just turned left into the street you move toward.</p><p>Great. Unless I wanted him following the Jor\u00f5gumo and perhaps interfering with Hunter\u2019s desire for revenge, I had to take him out. I looked around for some sort of weapon, but there wasn\u2019t anything particularly handy lying about. But there was some sort of industrial Dumpster near the far end of the lane. I spun, ran back, and climbed in. After a few seconds of fishing around the stinking refuse and building rubbish, I found something usable\u2014an old chair leg about one foot long.</p><p>I jumped out of the Dumpster, brushed off the worst of the gunk clinging to my jeans, then shoved a hand in my purse and wrapped my fingers around my phone and keys as I called to the Aedh. The magic transformed me in an instant, and I scooted down the lane. Now I just had to hope that the guardian wasn\u2019t sensitive to energy forces.</p><p>I paused at the junction of the lane and the street and glanced left. The shifter and the Jor\u00f5gumo were about one street down, getting into a pale blue Toyota. I swore mentally and spun left, searching the shadows flowing across the footpath for the guardian.</p><p>He was moving with surprising speed for someone who wasn\u2019t a vampire, and something silver glinted in his fist. Tracker, I thought. That was the last thing I needed.</p><p>I flowed past him, then spun around and moved up behind him. How the hell was I going to knock him out? Total re-formation was out of the question, especially given my less-than-stellar re-formation technique. Which left me with the option of doing a partial one\u2014something I had done when in flesh form, but never from Aedh. Or on the move.</p><p>I snuck closer, then called to the Aedh. This time, I controlled the surge of power, channeling its fury, containing its strength, focusing it on just the arm that held the old chair leg. Making both real and solid.</p><p>The guardian must have sensed something was happening because he suddenly spun, but I\u2019d already let loose with the chair leg. It smashed against the side of his head with a heavy crack, and he dropped like a ton of bricks. Guilt flickered through me. I hoped like hell he wasn\u2019t hurt too badly, but it wasn\u2019t like I could stop and check.</p><p>I drew my arm back to Aedh form and raced down the street just as the shifter\u2019s car pulled away from his parking spot.</p><p>He drove fast, obviously eager to get home, and I had to wonder what the hell I\u2019d do if he got pulled over by the cops. I couldn\u2019t keep attacking law enforcement officers\u2014especially given few cops traveled alone these days, and all of them had onboard cameras in their cars.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t pulled over, and eventually he stopped in front of a small weatherboard home that looked as unkempt as the shifter. Obviously, it was just the psychic power our dark spirit was attracted to rather than the sort that came with success and wealth.</p><p>He climbed out of the car, ran around the rear of it, and opened the Jor\u00f5gumo\u2019s door, ushering her out and taking her arm as he escorted her through the front gate and up the steps. I waited until they\u2019d gone inside, then re-formed. Once I\u2019d picked myself up off the pavement and sorted out my clothing, I grabbed the phone and rang Hunter.</p><p>She answered almost immediately. \u201cI do hope it\u2019s good news, Risa dear,\u201d she drawled. \u201cI am not in the mood for the other sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing outside of an old weatherboard house. The Jor\u00f5gumo is inside, about to feast on another victim.\u201d</p><p>Something dark, dangerous, and very, very hungry flashed in her eyes. \u201cGive me the address immediately.\u201d</p><p>I did. \u201cWhat do you want us to do? Wait here or leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want you to do is go in and pen the bitch. As much as I do not care about the shifter himself, Jack has insisted I not risk more lives than necessary in my quest for revenge.\u201d</p><p>Meaning Jack actually held some sway over her actions? Somehow, I suspected that would be the case only if his requests meshed with her own desires.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea how the hell I\u2019d pen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how you do it; just do it,\u201d she cut in. \u201cI will not be pleased to arrive and find her gone.\u201d</p><p>A displeased Hunter was not someone I wanted to face. \u201cFine,\u201d I muttered, and hung up.</p><p>Heat swirled through me, warm and familiar as Azriel appeared beside me.</p><p>\u201cIs it safe for you to re-form?\u201d I leaned my shoulder against his to steal more of his warmth. The night air hadn\u2019t gotten any warmer, that was for sure.</p><p>\u201cI am as far away now as I was back at the club, so I would presume so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell are we going to cage her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot we,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cYou. The minute I get nearer, she will run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fabulous.\u201d I rubbed my arms, but it didn\u2019t do a whole lot against the sudden sense of dread. \u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmaya should be capable of containing her long enough for me to get in there and help complete the task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s capable of consuming her, too,\u201d I muttered. My sword\u2019s response to this was what sounded like a wicked chuckle.</p><p>\u201cYes. You will have to be firm with her.\u201d</p><p>Easier said than done. \u201cWhen the Jor\u00f5gumo appeared in the club, she seemed to merge from the shadows\u2014can she actually do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost spirits who can take on flesh can just as easily dissolve. You will have to be quick to capture her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hope like hell she doesn\u2019t decide to attack rather than run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she attacks, I will be there.\u201d</p><p>If she flung little black babies at me, him arriving quickly was not going to help. \u201cSo, wish me luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you speed and strength,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I have noted before, it is not wise to rely on luck in this sort of situation.\u201d</p><p>I guess not. I drew Amaya and gripped her fiercely. Okay, we are going to cage her, not consume her; you got that, Amaya?</p><p>Fun not.</p><p>I don\u2019t care.</p><p>She muttered for several seconds, the words indecipherable but their meaning clear. Happy not, as she would say. Then she said, Can nibble?</p><p>Not even a little taste. She is Hunter\u2019s meal, not yours.</p><p>Eat Hunter, she muttered.</p><p>That, I replied grimly, might yet be an option in the future.</p><p>She perked up no end at this and began humming happily. I took a deep breath, released it slowly, and wished the nerves and the tension would just fuck off. They didn\u2019t, however, so I just called to the Aedh once again and carefully made my way inside the house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To hear music rather than the sound of lovemaking.</p><p>I inched forward, following the haunting, melodious sound, and found the shifter and the Jor\u00f5gumo in the living room. He was sitting on a chair, his jacket dumped on the floor and his shirt undone to the waist. His eyes were closed, and his expression was one of bliss. I couldn\u2019t actually see why\u2014the music, while different, wasn\u2019t exactly a sound that would put me into raptures. But then, my tastes tended to run to pop and rock rather than more classical stuff.</p><p>Besides, his state didn\u2019t really have a whole lot to do with the actual music, but rather the lute it came from. Zaira had said the instrument was magic, and the room was thick with it.</p> <p>The Jor\u00f5gumo knelt at his feet, her head bent and her dark hair cascading over what looked to be a small, odd-shaped lute. She plucked the strings with nails that were long and glistened with silver\u2014silver that fell onto the wood floor and spun up and around the shifter\u2019s sneakered feet.</p><p>Her web.</p><p>The music spelled him, distracted him, while she spun her cocoon around him.</p><p>Remember, I said to Amaya, although I wasn\u2019t entirely sure she could hear me when we were both little more than energy particles. No consuming. Just containment.</p><p>With that, I called forth the Aedh and re-formed\u2014but only enough to give Amaya room to do her stuff. There was no way in hell I was about to risk baby spiders being thrown at me.</p> <p>The minute Amaya formed, she flung fire at the Jor\u00f5gumo, but the spider woman reacted with lightning speed, throwing herself sideways and out from under the range of the flames. They chased her, eagerly crawling across the floor toward her, but already she was dissolving, her face and torso becoming little more than wisps that trailed behind the rest of her body as she continued to run from Amaya\u2019s flames.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I said, and regained full form. \u201cAmaya, grab her legs!\u201d</p><p>A rope of fire lashed out instantly, whipping around what remained of the Jor\u00f5gumo\u2019s limbs. She screamed and stumbled, crashing to the floor and finding form again.</p><p>Only her form was spider rather than human this time, and she was big and black, with skin that writhed and pulsated. I did not want to know what was causing that movement. I really didn\u2019t.</p><p>The Jor\u00f5gumo lunged at me, her fangs bared and as thick as my arm. I yelped and jumped backward, but my calves clipped the edge of the coffee table and I tipped ass over the top of it. I landed awkwardly, but had barely rolled onto my back when Amaya screamed a warning. I looked up to see a hairy black leg coming straight at me. I swore, swung my sword, and steel met flesh with a clang that sounded oddly like a death knell. Not mine, I hoped. Amaya\u2019s screaming was fierce as her steel bit deep into one of the fleshier parts of the Jor\u00f5gumo\u2019s leg, and blood flew. As did little black objects.</p><p>It was my worst fear come to life. There were baby spiders under her skin.</p> <p>Somehow I kept a lid on the utter horror that crawled through me and rolled out from under her leg.</p><p>\u201cAzriel!\u201d I screamed, wrenching Amaya free as I jumped upright. \u201cI need some damn help here!\u201d</p><p>Already here.</p><p>His mind voice was sharp, distracted, and I risked a glance across the other side of the room as I continued to back away from the Jor\u00f5gumo. A second creature had appeared, only this one was made up of thousands of little tiny bodies that writhed and moved and hissed and yet acted as one deadly enemy. Azriel attacked the mass with Valdis\u2019s steel and flame, moving so fast, he was little more than a blur. But for every part of the mass they destroyed, others just crawled in and resumed the attack.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck!</p><p>Mom Jor\u00f5gumo lunged at me again, liquid dripping from her fangs. I ducked away from her attack and smashed Amaya across her fangs. One went flying but the other remained. Liquid splashed across my clothes, stinking to high heaven and stinging where it hit flesh. Hoping like crazy the stuff had to be injected to actually work, I batted away another attack, then leapt high, twisted in midair, and came down on the middle part of her body, right behind her eyes. Amaya screamed again, the sound echoing across the room as well as in my head.</p><p>Don\u2019t kill, I ordered her fiercely. Just blind and bind.</p><p>Then I swung her with all the strength I had. Her steel bit into the bitch\u2019s eyes just as the Jor\u00f5gumo flung herself at the wall. We hit hard, and breath whooshed from my body. Not satisfied with merely winding me, the Jor\u00f5gumo hissed and writhed, and I fell, ending up on the floor underneath her. One foot scraped my leg, cutting deep, and a scream rolled up my throat. I bit down on it and crawled out from underneath her, barely avoiding several strikes of fang and leg. A hand grabbed me and dragged me upright.</p> <p>\u201cAmaya!\u201d Azriel said. \u201cFlame and ensnare. Now!\u201d</p><p>My sword responded instantly, and twin lances of flames rolled out from the swords, shooting across the writhing creature\u2019s body, spreading out in vibrant fingers, weaving in and out of each other, joining the rope of flames that still encased two of the Jor\u00f5gumo\u2019s legs, until it had formed a net that encased the spider-spirit\u2019s entire body.</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop writhing and screaming, but she was trapped and not going anywhere.</p><p>I collapsed back against the wall and closed my eyes in relief. My head was pounding, and my leg was bleeding, I was aching all over from my encounter with the wall, but hey, I was alive and the spider wasn\u2019t dead. As outcomes went, it wasn\u2019t all that bad.</p><p>\u201cI guess the fact you have only one injury is something to be grateful for,\u201d Azriel agreed, voice wry. \u201cHowever, it would have been nice if you could have remained wound free for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to the bad guys who keep attacking me.\u201d I opened my eyes. Azriel stood several feet away, his body covered with tiny wounds that gave his skin a bloody glint. Concern rolled through me. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI am energy, remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re wearing flesh.\u201d I pushed away from the wall, took two steps, and gently ran my fingertips across the worst of the wounds on his arm. \u201cIf the babies were as venomous as their mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will burn off their venom the minute I return to energy form.\u201d He gave me a sweet, somewhat lopsided smile. \u201cBut I appreciate the concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t want to lose you over something dumb like getting bitten by a damn spider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not something I would be overly pleased with, either.\u201d</p><p>Amaya\u2019s steel began to vibrate in my hand, and I glanced down with a frown. Both swords were still blazing, but Amaya\u2019s flames were beginning to pulse. It was almost as if her strength was faltering.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Azriel commented. \u201cWhich means she\u2019s now drawing on your strength to help hold her share of the net.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t she hold it herself?\u201d</p><p>Strength not right, she muttered, the surliness in her mental tones suggesting she was very put out by the fact.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s young in demon terms,\u201d Azriel commented. \u201cShe will get stronger with both age and your continuing merger.\u201d</p><p>Merger. Not something I really wanted to be doing with a demon spirit with a hankering for bloodshed, but I guess that option had gone out the window the minute I\u2019d taken her steel and stabbed her into my flesh.</p><p>And, if I was being at all honest, for all my wariness about owning a demon sword, I really wouldn\u2019t want to be without her now. Having her so readily at hand had saved my ass more than once.</p><p>\u201cI hope Hunter gets here quickly, then.\u201d I paused. \u201cOr can you and Valdis hold the Jor\u00f5gumo yourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can kill her, but containing her as we are takes more strength and generally requires two swords.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cThey were never designed for this.\u201d</p><p>I guess they weren\u2019t\u2014and they were doing it now only because Hunter wanted bloody revenge.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Hunter, she approaches the front door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning we now have the problem of getting her into the house.\u201d As a vampire, she had to abide by the old \u201cinvite only\u201d rule.</p><p>\u201cCan she not telepathically order such an invite?\u201d Azriel said.</p><p>\u201cNo. It has to be freely given.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang. I shot a look down the hall and saw her silhouette through the glass panes. \u201cNow what do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would suggest you get the door open, Risa dearest,\u201d Hunter replied, proving the keenness of her hearing yet again. \u201cOtherwise I will not be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinda hard to do when the owner is unconscious.\u201d But I walked over and booted the cobwebbed heel of his shoes. \u201cHey, wake up.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t flinch. I tried again, harder this time. Still nothing. \u201cCan you wake him?\u201d I said, glancing at Azriel.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t, but given the growing precariousness of the situation\u2014\u201d He paused, his expression one of concentration. After a moment, the shifter groaned and rubbed his eyes. Then he saw us.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d He jerked upright abruptly. \u201cWho the hell are you two? And what the fuck is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d I said grimly, \u201cis the woman you brought home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t particularly care if you believe me or not,\u201d I said, voice tart. \u201cThe fact is you have the mother of all spiders in your living room and you were almost her dinner. Now, be a good chap and go invite Director Hunter into your house so she can deal with the beast.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cThe director? As in, the Directorate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and mentally ordered the man to just go. It wouldn\u2019t have done any good, of course, even if I had been telepathic, because of the whole \u201cfreely given\u201d restriction.</p><p>But if he didn\u2019t hurry, things were going to get bad pretty quickly. The throbbing in Amaya\u2019s steel was stronger, as was my damn headache. And I didn\u2019t even want to think about the amount of blood I was losing, but my socks were beginning to feel rather wet.</p><p>\u201cIf this spider escapes the power net,\u201d I continued, \u201cwe\u2019ll all be damn dinner. So please, just go open the door.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked from me to the spider, then to Azriel, and rose\u2014and just about fell flat on his face again. I\u2019d forgotten about the web wrapping his feet and lower legs.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell, it was trying to eat me!\u201d His voice held edges of both anger and hysteria.</p><p>\u201cBut it didn\u2019t!\u201d I cut in harshly. \u201cJust hop down the damn hall and open the door. We can\u2019t hold this bitch much longer.\u201d I paused. \u201cWe\u2019ll explain everything later.\u201d</p> <p>He gave me a \u201cyou\u2019d better\u201d look, then hopped in a rather ungainly fashion down the hall and opened the front door. Two seconds later, Hunter was striding toward us. There was little emotion on her face, but her pupils had expanded to the point where there was little green left and the sheer depth of hunger that radiated off her stole my breath and had my gut churning. This was Hunter as I\u2019d hoped I\u2019d never see her\u2014eager for her revenge, ravenous for the blood of her enemy.</p><p>Thank god I had Azriel with me.</p><p>I glanced back down the hall. The shifter was still standing by the open door, but his expression was slack.</p><p>\u201cHis expression is as empty as his mind,\u201d she said, her low voice vibrating with anticipation. \u201cDo you think I desire a witness to what I am about to do?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed heavily. \u201cWe\u2019re witnesses.\u201d</p> <p>She turned her black gaze on me, and I took an involuntary step back.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured, voice silky. \u201cBut I have nothing to fear from you; do I, Risa dear?\u201d</p><p>I felt like a rabbit caught in the spotlight, only this particular one shone with a dark, dark light and promised a bloody, brutal death.</p><p>\u201cYour threats grow tedious, Hunter.\u201d Azriel\u2019s voice held little inflection and no doubt for good reason. It wouldn\u2019t take much to set her off. \u201cAnd you are here for the Jor\u00f5gumo, remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s gaze returned to the caged spider, and the energy radiating off her suddenly spiked. Only it wasn\u2019t aimed at any of us, but rather the Jor\u00f5gumo herself. Her form began to flicker, change, shrink, until what stood before us was once again a woman.</p> <p>A woman who looked suddenly scared.</p><p>Just for a fraction of a second, I almost felt sorry for her. Then I remembered what she was and what she\u2019d done. The death Hunter was about to give her was surely quicker than the one she\u2019d given any of her victims.</p><p>\u201cLower the force of your flames and allow me access,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>Chills raced across my skin. There was nothing human behind those words.</p><p>Lower Amaya\u2019s flames so they leash just her legs, Azriel said.</p><p>I echoed his words to my sword, and she obeyed. Hurry must, she said. Weak growing for both.</p><p>Yes, it was. I bit my lip and tried to ignore the fact that my head felt like it was about to explode.</p><p>Amaya\u2019s flames followed Valdis\u2019s down the Jor\u00f5gumo\u2019s body until they encased just the lower half of her legs. The spider-spirit didn\u2019t move. I suspected the energy radiating off Hunter had a whole lot to do with that.</p> <p>\u201cFor the crime of killing four, you are sentenced to death,\u201d Hunter said, stepping so close to the Jor\u00f5gumo that she was practically in her face. \u201cBut for the crime of killing one of those four, you are sentenced to death by me.\u201d</p><p>And with that, she attacked.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t just sink her teeth into the Jor\u00f5gumo\u2019s neck and drink her blood. She rendered her apart and consumed everything.</p><p>Absolutely everything.</p><p>Even her soul.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>It was sheer survival mode that kept me rooted to the spot and watching, even though every instinct in my body was screaming to get the hell out of there\u2014to get away from the monster that was consuming one of its own kind.</p><p>Hunter might not be a Jor\u00f5gumo, but given what I was witnessing, it was impossible to think of her as just another vampire\u2014however powerful and old she was.</p><p>Normal vampires didn\u2019t consume flesh and bone and brain matter. Normal vampires didn\u2019t drink souls.</p><p>How I didn\u2019t lose the entire contents of my stomach, I\u2019ll never know.</p><p>Unbidden, Harry Stanford\u2019s words came back into my mind. Oh, trust me, she long ago mastered the art of hiding what she truly is.</p><p>I guess the question that needed answering now was, what sort of monster had she become?</p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t a question I could exactly ask anyone in the know. I had a more than vague suspicion questioning Hunter herself would not be a good idea, and the only other people I could approach who might have some clue were Uncle Quinn and Harry Stanford himself. Both were out of the question, for very different reasons.</p><p>So I swallowed the bile backing up in my throat, kept my knees locked, and ignored the ever-increasing shuddering in both Amaya\u2019s steel and my body. And found myself looking anywhere but at the scene in front of me.</p><p>But it seemed to take far too long for the Jor\u00f5gumo to meet her end.</p><p>My knees and Amaya\u2019s flames gave out at the exact same time. I hit the floor with a grunt and drew in shuddery breaths, my head swimming and my body on fire.</p><p>A heartbeat later, Azriel knelt in front of me, his concern radiating through me like the wash of a warm summer breeze. He pressed his hand against the wound, my blood oozing up through his fingers as energy radiated from the epicenter of his touch. It flushed strength through my shaking muscles as it began to heal my leg, and, after a few seconds, I felt decidedly better.</p><p>My gaze met his. In the depths of his differently colored eyes, barely leashed fury burned.</p><p>If she but gives me the tiniest of excuses, he said, mind voice flat and in many ways scarier than even Hunter herself, she will be dead.</p><p>She won\u2019t. I lightly brushed some spider goo from his cheek. His skin was far cooler than usual, and concern sharpened anew. Will you please shift into energy form and burn away the venom?</p><p>Your wound is not fully healed, and I am in no danger as yet\u2014</p><p>I don\u2019t care about my wound\u2014</p><p>A continuing problem with you, he cut in. There was both amusement and frustration in his mental tones.</p><p>I smiled. I\u2019m okay, so just humor me and heal yourself, will you?</p><p>If you insist.</p><p>He disappeared, leaving me once again staring at the scene in front of me. There actually wasn\u2019t that much to see anymore. All that remained of the spider woman were the bits I\u2019d sliced off\u2014some leg pieces, her fang, and one of the spinnerets. Everything else\u2014all the gore and other body parts\u2014had been consumed.</p><p>Hunter turned and our gazes met. I froze again, pinned by the awful darkness of her eyes, and for a moment feared that I was about to become her second victim. Then she blinked, and the darkness retreated.</p><p>But the air still burned with the wrongness of her being. Worse still, blood and flesh covered the lower part of her face and dripped from her chin, and her shirt was soaked with gore.</p><p>My stomach once again threatened to rebel, but I had a feeling vomiting all over her no-longer-shiny shoes would be a sign of weakness I could not afford. I just wished I could control my pulse rate as easily, because right now it was through the roof.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, \u201chave you got anything to say?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was cool, unthreatening, but my skin crawled. \u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, revealing razor-sharp, blood-stained canines. \u201cWise choice.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed heavily and wished like hell I could take back the words that now bound me to this woman. But breaking our deal was an option I\u2019d never really had, no matter how much I might have flirted with the idea. Yet I had no doubt those flirtations were the reason behind her revealing her true nature here today. She\u2019d wanted to show me just what would happen to Ilianna and Tao if I ever stepped out of line.</p><p>It was my desperate need for revenge that had led them into this woman\u2019s sights, and I hated myself for that.</p><p>But what was done was done, and regretting the path I\u2019d chosen in a desperate moment of pain and anger didn\u2019t help anyone, particularly them.</p><p>I licked dry lips and said, \u201cAre you going to call in the Directorate, or do you want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s no need for them to be advised of events here.\u201d There was cold amusement in her voice. \u201cThe Jor\u00f5gumo is dead and I will erase the shifter\u2019s memory. I\u2019m afraid this is destined to become just another of the Directorate\u2019s cold case files.\u201d</p><p>And how many of those files, I wondered, were cold because of Hunter\u2019s intervention?</p><p>\u201cThen I can go?\u201d I tried not to sound overly eager, but failed dismally, if the gleam in her eyes was anything to go by.</p><p>\u201cYou may. Just remember, I want to be advised if you do find the next gate key at that gun exhibition later today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven you have Cazadors following me about like trained puppies, that goes without saying,\u201d I snapped, and regretted it almost instantly.</p><p>That darkness flared in her eyes again. My breath froze in my throat, and I took an involuntary step back. Even that one small movement had her half baring her teeth, and it wasn\u2019t only Amaya who began screaming inside my head. I was at full voice, too.</p><p>Then Azriel appeared in front of me, providing a physical barrier against the wash of hunger and darkness coming from Hunter and allowing me to breathe normally again\u2014although the fury and tension rolling off both him and his sword wasn\u2019t any less breathtaking.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI will enjoy watching your soul be escorted through the gates of hell.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t even blink. Then she smiled\u2014still all teeth\u2014and said, \u201cOh, I will give you your chance, reaper, but not now. Not yet. There is still much to be achieved.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, first high council domination, next the world. Azriel reached back and caught my hand, squeezing it in either reassurance or in warning. Then his energy surged around us, tearing us apart swiftly, but he didn\u2019t take his gaze off Hunter until the gray fields were around us.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d I said, as we reappeared in the secure surrounds of my bedroom, \u201chas she become?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI cannot say.\u201d He turned around, but didn\u2019t immediately release my hand. \u201cI suspect the only people who would know are the two people you\u2019ve already noted.\u201d</p><p>Stanford and Uncle Quinn. I rubbed my free hand across my eyes wearily. \u201cWhat the hell are we going to do, Azriel? Stanford is right about one thing\u2014whatever she is, she\u2019s not sane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I would suggest the opposite. However, she is a being without emotion, someone whose soul lost contact with all that is humanity a very long time ago. She is incapable now of seeing beyond her own needs, desires, and plans.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned. \u201cYou can\u2019t say she\u2019s without feeling given she had us chasing the Jor\u00f5gumo for revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat did not come from either the heart or the soul, but rather a far darker place. Someone took something of hers, and she could not let the matter slip unchallenged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I ever did?\u201d</p><p>His smile was somewhat wry. \u201cYou challenge her every time you speak to her.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cI meant seriously challenged. As in, agree to work with Stanford.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better hope I am still around to defend you.\u201d</p><p>Fear swirled through me. I knew I wasn\u2019t any sort of match for Hunter, even with Amaya at my back, but still, hearing Azriel basically confirm it was as scary as hell.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not actually something I\u2019m planning, however much I\u2019d like to see the bitch dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is the first sensible statement you\u2019ve made for quite a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am capable of sensible on occasion.\u201d I rose up on my toes and quickly kissed him. \u201cI\u2019m going for a shower. If you want to be useful, you could make me something to eat.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cI am not adept at human domestic duties.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, that,\u201d I said, voice wry, \u201cis a comment echoed by men the world over. All you need to do is slap some of the lamb that\u2019s in the fridge between a couple slices of bread, squeeze on some tomato sauce, and I\u2019ll be one happy lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can manage.\u201d He raised my hand, kissed my fingertips, then disappeared.</p><p>I checked my phone to see if Ilianna\u2014or anyone else for that matter\u2014had called, then headed into the shower. By the time I\u2019d dried my hair, dressed in comfortable jeans and an old sweater, Azriel had set the dining room table with not only a sandwich, but a glass of Coke and a steaming mug of coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I said, as he pulled out a chair and seated me. \u201cYou might just become a keeper if you carry on like this.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t immediately answer, but when he did, his voice was oddly formal. \u201cAnd would you wish that, if the situation were different?\u201d</p><p>I paused, the sandwich halfway to my mouth, and met his gaze. \u201cIf the situation were different, if we weren\u2019t who we were, and the option was there, yes, I would like that very much.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and it oddly felt as if an agreement had been reached. I frowned, wondering what exactly that might have been, but his expression\u2014or lack thereof\u2014very much suggested he wasn\u2019t about to elaborate.</p><p>\u201cBecause there is nothing to elaborate,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWhat happens next lies in the hand of the fates.\u201d</p> <p>I swallowed against a suddenly dry throat and tried to ignore the tiny slivers of both hope and fear that began coursing through me. \u201cMeaning there could be some way we could explore this thing further?\u201d</p><p>While that possibility scared the hell out of me, I couldn\u2019t help the leap of excitement at the thought of being able to explore whether what was between us had the strength to blossom into something real and permanent.</p><p>But all he said was, \u201cThat is for the fates to decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the answer is probably no, because fate and I have not been on friendly terms of late.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, and there was little to be read in his expression. I bit into my sandwich and had to bite back a groan of sheer pleasure. Besides sex and a cold glass of Coke, the best thing in life had to be a fabulous lamb sandwich.</p><p>My phone rang just as I finished my meal. The tone told me it was Jak, and my heart began to beat a whole lot faster. Something was wrong. I was certain of it even before I answered the damn thing. I pushed up from the table and ran across to my handbag, fishing around for several seconds before I found my phone.</p><p>\u201cJak,\u201d I said, my heart seeming to beat somewhere high in my throat. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you. Urgently.\u201d</p><p>Despite his words, he neither looked nor sounded worried. In fact, he looked rather distracted.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say on the phone, but you\u2019ll want to hear it, believe me.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, frustrated with both his reticence to answer the damn question\u2014although that was something I should have gotten used to, seeing as everyone was doing it of late\u2014and that inner voice that kept insisting something was wrong. But was it clairvoyance, or the simple knowledge that every time the phone rang, the shit got deeper? \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Larry\u2019s, in Brunswick.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a place I knew, but then, that was what Google was for. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cTen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Jak, you\u2019re not giving me much time to get\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut the rest of my sentence off as my damn phone beeped, then shut down. The stupid battery was dead.</p><p>I swore softly, threw it down, then stalked across to the computer and Googled Larry\u2019s in Brunswick. It was situated on Hope Street, not far down from Sydney Road.</p><p>I grabbed my keys, then glanced at Azriel. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not wish me to take you?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. That niggly sense of wrongness was still present, but I wasn\u2019t really sure whether it was related to Jak, or the still-missing Ilianna. I bit my bottom lip, weighing options, then said, \u201cCan you go to Stane\u2019s first and ask him to keep an eye on police reports, just in case something comes through about Ilianna?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhy not ring him? He does not appreciate me suddenly appearing on his premises.\u201d</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t, but he wasn\u2019t about to keel over in shock from it, either, according to Azriel, and he should know. Besides, I needed information on Ilianna, and Stane was probably our best method of getting it\u2014and it was stupid of me not to have asked him when I was there earlier. \u201cMy phone is dead, and I don\u2019t want to waste time going there myself. And I\u2019m only meeting Jak. He\u2019s not a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, but given your own sense of unease\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, impatience edging my voice\u2014which wasn\u2019t really fair given he was only trying to keep me safe. But there was safe and there was mollycoddling, and this had the feeling of the latter. \u201cIt\u2019ll take you all of three seconds to get to Stane\u2019s and less than that to ask him to scan the police frequencies. I can hardly get myself into too much trouble in that short time.\u201d</p><p>Surely even I wasn\u2019t that clever.</p><p>He studied me, clearly unhappy, then nodded abruptly and disappeared. I headed out the front door, locked up, then called to the Aedh. A sliver of pain ran through my head, but I wasn\u2019t entirely sure whether it was a warning that I was pushing my limits again\u2014despite the energy Azriel had given me\u2014or the mere fact that I was too close to the wards that prevented the Raziq from entering our home. But if pain and pushing my limits found Ilianna, then I really didn\u2019t care\u2014though I had no idea why I thought Ilianna might be the reason behind Jak\u2019s sudden demand for a meet. Maybe it was nothing more than stupid hope.</p><p>I zoomed through the streets, the bright lights little more than a blur underneath me. Larry\u2019s, it turned out, was an old, somewhat rambling warehouse structure that had obviously been no more successful as a bar than it had as a warehouse. I re-formed and pulled the somewhat holey remains of my sweater together, my gaze sweeping the grimy, blue-painted building dubiously. I couldn\u2019t imagine any good reasons for Ilianna being in a place like this, and I sure as hell did not want to think about bad reasons. But maybe this wasn\u2019t about her\u2014after all, it was Jak who\u2019d collected the information that had led us to the standing stone gateway under the run-down warehouse near Stane\u2019s. Maybe he\u2019d found another one.</p><p>I walked across the road, every sense I had attuned to the old building. Nothing stirred, and I couldn\u2019t see or hear anyone near. The night air was cool and whispered through the holes in my clothes, chilling my skin and causing goose bumps. Or maybe they were simply the result of growing unease.</p><p>\u201cJak?\u201d I kept my voice soft. If he was here, he\u2019d hear.</p><p>\u201cInside.\u201d His voice was as hushed as mine, but oddly lacking warmth.</p><p>Unease growing, I grasped the door handle and wrenched it open. Unfortunately, I used more force than necessary and it crashed back, trapping my hand between the door handle and the wall. I bit back my yelp and shook my fingers, my gaze searching the dark room as I eased inside. I couldn\u2019t see anything, couldn\u2019t hear anything.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>He sounded closer, but no warmer. Trepidation prickled across my skin, and my footsteps slowed even further. \u201cWhere the hell are the lights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t risk them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in here, and you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Impatience threaded his distant tones, and just for an instant, he sounded like his old self. Maybe I was just being paranoid.</p><p>Maybe I should just wait for Azriel . . .</p><p>Damn it, no. I couldn\u2019t keep relying on him to keep me safe. Sooner or later, he would leave, but I was stuck with Hunter long term. If I wanted to survive her post-Azriel, then I had better not start jumping at shadows the minute he wasn\u2019t at my back.</p><p>Still, it was with a whole lot of trepidation that I continued to move into the darkness. \u201cJak, I can\u2019t see a goddamn thing in here. Can\u2019t you at least use the flashlight app on your phone?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d certainly be using mine if the damn thing hadn\u2019t decided to die on me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He paused. \u201cTake three steps to your right, then five to the left. Watch the table\u2014\u201d</p><p>I crashed into said table and bit back another curse. \u201cWarning me a little earlier might have been handy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>There was little amusement in his voice, and again I frowned. This whole thing felt decidedly off . . .</p><p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d he added. \u201cJust one more step.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, then cursed myself for doing so. Jak wouldn\u2019t harm me. Bed me\u2014given half a chance\u2014yes, but not harm. Not only did he need me to get his story, but he was well aware just how thick and fast trouble in the form of Uncle Rhoan would hit him if he in any way caused me damage\u2014physical or emotional.</p><p>I took that step.</p> <p>Realized almost instantly it was the wrong thing to do when something grabbed me and held me.</p><p>But that something wasn\u2019t flesh and blood but rather magic. I had one moment to wonder what the hell\u2014who the hell\u2014had me this time and even less time to fear; then thought was torn away and I knew no more.</p><p>Waking was a slow process and felt rather like the tedious climb to awareness that often accompanied a heavy alcohol binge. Thanks to our faster metabolic rate, it was harder for werewolves to get drunk than humans, but it was certainly possible if you applied yourself well enough. I had on several occasions, generally when I\u2019d stupidly embarked on a drinking contest with Liana and Ronan, Riley\u2019s two eldest. But at least I\u2019d had the pleasurable buzz of consuming all that alcohol first. There was none of that joy here, just the sick queasiness and thick head that generally hit after consumption had well and truly finished.</p><p>For several minutes, I did nothing more than simply lie there, willing my head to stop pounding even as I wondered where the hell I was.</p><p>But as awareness of my surroundings grew stronger, I discovered that not only was I in a bed and naked, but I was spread-eagle, with my hands and feet tied.</p><p>What the hell was going on?</p> <p>My first thought\u2014naturally enough\u2014was that I\u2019d been raped, but I had no sense of violation. It didn\u2019t feel like anyone had abused me in any way other than tying me. My body did ache, but I suspected it was more a residue of whatever magic had knocked me out rather than someone having forced themself on me.</p><p>Of course, no one ever had, so how could I be so certain that it hadn\u2019t happened? God, the way I was tied certainly suggested that even if it hadn\u2019t happened, it was very much in the cards. It was a thought that should have frightened me, but all it actually did was make me mad. Werewolves had a free and easy attitude when it came to sex, but force was an entirely different matter\u2014and one that was not dealt with lightly. Fortunately, it was something that rarely happened among werewolves. But then, rape was rarely about sex and all about either gaining power over\u2014or causing degradation to\u2014another person.</p><p>Who the hell would wish either of those on me?</p><p>Even as the thought hit, the answer came. Lucian.</p><p>Touch not, Amaya said, her sharp voice cutting like razor blades through my brain. Tried.</p><p>Lucian?</p><p>Him, she spat. Tried to slice it off. Missed.</p><p>I blinked. As statements went, that was pretty dramatic, and it was one that had just a touch of amusement vibrating through me. At least I\u2019d had a defender when I was unconscious.</p> <p>It was just a damn shame that she\u2019d missed.</p><p>I very much wanted to open my eyes and see where the hell I was, but caution prevailed. Until I had some sense of what was going on around me, it was better that Lucian thought I was still unconscious.</p><p>There was little in the way of movement or sound\u2014other than the nearby rumble of traffic\u2014to indicate there was anyone close, but the air was thick with the scent of dust and mold and age. Wherever we were, it wasn\u2019t Lucian\u2019s apartment. But he was here. His scent\u2014lemongrass, suede, and musky, powerful male\u2014was a strong undercurrent to the other scents.</p><p>So why wasn\u2019t Azriel here, ripping Lucian\u2019s head off his fucking shoulders?</p><p>Can\u2019t, Amaya muttered. Blocked.</p><p>She had to mean magically, because there were few physical forces that could actually stop him.</p><p>So did those same restrictions apply to me becoming Aedh? I quickly reached for the magic. The pounding in my head sharpened dramatically\u2014suggesting that part of me was trying to respond\u2014but I remained as I was. In flesh and bound.</p><p>And that was a little frightening. We\u2019d guessed Lucian had been capable of magic, but I hadn\u2019t thought it possible that he could create a spell powerful enough to either bind an Aedh to human form or stop the movement of a reaper. And if he could do that, then he probably knew how to kill them, too. It made me suddenly glad that Azriel wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>Besides, I wanted the pleasure of killing the bastard myself.</p><p>Not self, Amaya said, her background noise ramping up a notch. Me include.</p><p>Trust me, you\u2019ll be included.</p><p>The hissing changed to a happy humming. I still wasn\u2019t entirely sure whether that was an improvement.</p><p>I pulled on the ropes binding me to test their strength. There was no give and no sign that they\u2019d break easily. No surprise there, I guess. Lucian was well aware of what I could and couldn\u2019t do.</p><p>Just as, I suddenly realized, he was well aware that my friends were very much my Achilles\u2019 heel.</p><p>God, was he the reason for Ilianna\u2019s disappearance?</p><p>I hoped like hell he wasn\u2019t, but the dread that filled me suggested otherwise.</p><p>I opened my eyes. The ceiling was wood and heavily stained and draped with cobwebs that hung in long, dusty strings. The walls to the left and the right had been semidemolished, but there was little to see in the rooms beyond except rubble.</p><p>The bed itself was wide and would have been comfortable if not for the ropes holding me so tightly. They snaked from my wrists and my ankles over each corner of the bed and were, I presumed, anchored somehow to the floor.</p><p>I lifted my head to see if I could spot anything else. There were industrial-looking windows running the length of the wall in front of me, but they were all covered with black plastic. Wouldn\u2019t want the neighbors seeing what he was up to, after all.</p><p>Why the hell was I even here? Why hadn\u2019t I been rescued? Azriel might not be able to get into this place, but he\u2019d have to know I was here. Why hadn\u2019t he called for help from Riley, Quinn, or even Tao?</p><p>I had absolutely no idea, and given it was a question that couldn\u2019t immediately be answered, I turned my attention back to the ropes. They were thick, coarse, and tight, and my wrists were red but not yet bleeding. I yanked on the left one as hard as I could, but the only thing I managed to do was rub my wrist raw. The fucking rope didn\u2019t give.</p><p>Amaya, any chance that you can cut the damn things?</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, but half a second later, her energy began to burn through my flesh. Slowly but surely, she moved from her position near my spine to the right side of my body, then into my shoulder. It was a weird sensation, and even weirder to see the broader end of her blade and her hilt find substance and stick out of my shoulder. Her sharp tip appeared near my wrist, and a second later, that arm was free.</p><p>She repeated the process with my left arm. This time, the Du\u0161an twisted around to watch, though it kept its tail firmly wrapped around the bracelet of leaves inked into my skin. Of course, it was no more a tat than the Du\u0161an was\u2014it was one of Ilianna\u2019s charms that the Du\u0161an had made a permanent part of me. Just how she\u2019d done it, nobody knew. The Du\u0161ans weren\u2019t supposed to be active on this plane, but for some reason no one could explain, mine was.</p><p>The minute both wrists were free, I sat upright and reached for Amaya.</p><p>But in that moment, I realized I was no longer alone.</p><p>\u201cMake no further move to free yourself, my dear,\u201d Lucian said, \u201cbecause I really would hate to shoot you.\u201d</p><p>His familiar tones flowed over my skin like a warm summer breeze and made me hunger for the touch of his clever fingers. It was a reaction that annoyed the fuck out of me, if only because I knew my response couldn\u2019t entirely be blamed on the spell he\u2019d placed on me. Some of it was simple, old-fashioned lust.</p><p>He stood in the wide, unfinished doorway, an image of golden perfection, holding a gun. He was tall, muscular, and, if I was being at all honest, a perfectly formed piece of manhood. Lucian\u2019s faults were internal rather than external, emotional rather than physical. His wishes, his desires were all that mattered to him. The wants and needs of others were of little relevance, even if he sometimes offered others utter bliss. He\u2019d certainly offered it to me often enough, but he\u2019d also magically bound me to ensure I kept coming back to him. He might have wanted my body, but he\u2019d also wanted the knowledge of not just what was happening with the key search, but also my father and the Raziq. Lucian hated them with a passion and depth that was as fierce as it was frightening.</p><p>And the only way he could completely keep track of both their movements and mine was to read my mind when we fucked.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Lucian?\u201d My voice was amazingly calm given the anger that surged through me. \u201cHave you got a death wish or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reaper may want to kill me,\u201d he said with a half shrug. \u201cBut he will not overstep the rules to justify his own petty desires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong.\u201d My fingers twitched against Amaya\u2019s hilt, and it took every ounce of willpower not to aim her steel at his black heart and release her. But he wasn\u2019t a fool, and that meant I couldn\u2019t be. Not until I knew the full length and breadth of whatever he had planned. \u201cBy kidnapping me, you\u2019ve given him carte blanche to break the rules where you\u2019re concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he is most welcome to try to kill me. But I doubt that he will.\u201d</p><p>His confidence was as irritating as it was unnerving. \u201cWhat do you want, Lucian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I have always wanted.\u201d His low tones were laced with amusement and slid across my skin like silk. \u201cI want to fuck you senseless.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shivered\u2014a reaction that was a weird mix of loathing and desire. \u201cAnd suck me dry information-wise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, that is a luscious side benefit.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYou cannot deny that our time together was mutually satisfactory.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. Side benefit, my ass. If anything had been a side benefit, then it was the sex. And yeah, it had been great, but the truth of the matter was, I was just another cog in the many wheels he had spinning.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you were so damn sure of your prowess in bed that you had to place a spell on me to ensure I came back.\u201d</p><p>Something flickered in his eyes. Something that was dark and ultimately dangerous. It was a quick reminder that for all the time I\u2019d spent fucking this man, I didn\u2019t really know him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves, Risa.\u201d His voice was as soft as his expression was dark. \u201cIt was not just the spell that kept you coming back, but your own insatiable desire. And we both know if I were to touch you now, you would beg me for more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you tried touching me, the only thing you\u2019d feel is Amaya\u2019s steel.\u201d I paused, then added somewhat cattily, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right, you\u2019ve already had a close encounter of the ugly kind with her.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. It was a short and sharp sound, but held little of the anger and frustration I could sense within him. \u201cYes. I wasn\u2019t aware that demon swords were capable of thought or action when the bearer was out of it. To discover the sharp end of a sword literally sticking out of your cunt was something of a surprise.\u201d</p> <p>Thank you, thank you, thank you, I said silently to my sword.</p><p>Kill him to thank.</p><p>I have to admit, it was a very tempting thought. But until I knew whether he was at all involved with Ilianna\u2019s disappearance, my hands were still as tied as my feet.</p><p>\u201cSo you kidnapped me just to fuck me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t intend to just fuck you, my dear.\u201d Amusement played about his mouth, but there was something decidedly dark in the green depths.</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell did you intend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat I intended,\u201d he drawled, \u201cwas to seed you with my child.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>For a moment I simply stared at him, wondering if he\u2019d gone absolutely bonkers in the brief time we\u2019d been apart. He\u2019d been in this world long enough to know it was law that all werewolves\u2014even those of us who were half-breeds\u2014had to be chipped at puberty to prevent conception. The government still seemed to think\u2014despite centuries of evidence to the contrary\u2014that just because we fucked like rabbits, we\u2019d breed like them, too.</p><p>\u201cWell, you wouldn\u2019t have had much luck with that,\u201d I bit back. \u201cEven without Amaya\u2019s well-placed intervention, I\u2019m chipped. If you took it out, it would still take several cycles for me to conceive.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. It held a very nasty edge. \u201cYes, but you are no longer what you were. You have been remade by the Raziq.\u201d</p><p>My stomach flip-flopped, but I didn\u2019t let the sudden surge of fear show. \u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are fully fertile, for one thing.\u201d His gaze slid down my body, and despite the distaste that rolled through me, I nevertheless reacted as strongly as I ever had. My hormones, I thought in frustration, needed to be bitch slapped. \u201cIt is such a shame your sword intervened, but in truth, I am not so annoyed. I do prefer my partners awake and willing.\u201d</p><p>A statement that had trepidation crawling through me all over again. But what was more interesting was the fact that he\u2019d intended to breed. Aedh felt that imperative only when their life was coming to an end. Of course, thanks to an Aedh\u2019s long life span, that end could be many years away. Hell, my father was still going strong, more\u2019s the pity.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love to say I\u2019m sorry to have disappointed you, but I\u2019m not. Now, why don\u2019t you just put that fucking gun down and release me. You\u2019re not going to get what you want from me\u2014no baby, no fucking keys, no revenge\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he cut in, his expression altogether too confident for my liking. \u201cThat\u2019s where you are very, very wrong.\u201d</p><p>Again that sick, fearful feeling began to rise up my throat. My fingers tightened against Amaya\u2019s hilt, but I didn\u2019t draw her free from my flesh and throw her at the bastard\u2019s heart. But I wanted to. Oh, how I wanted to.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The edge in my voice was fear and anger combined.</p><p>\u201cSimply that I have combined my need for offspring with my desire for revenge on all those who have made me less than I am.\u201d</p><p>That feeling of dread ramped up several notches. My throat was so restricted, I could barely even say, \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>But I knew.</p><p>And he knew I knew. That was very evident by the amused glitter in his bright eyes. \u201cIlianna.\u201d</p><p>My reaction was instant. Without thought. In one smooth movement, I drew Amaya free, swept her across the ropes binding my ankles, then lunged at him. But he was even faster than me. He jumped back and fired the gun. The shot tore through my hand, blowing apart two fingers before it hit Amaya\u2019s hilt and ricocheted into the nearby wall. Pain and blood surged, but all I felt was anger. My anger, Amaya\u2019s anger, and the utter need to just rid the world of the man who might well have destroyed my best friend. I attacked him, Amaya raised high above my head and screaming for blood.</p><p>Just for a moment, surprise flitted across his features; then he retreated from my onslaught and held up the gun.</p><p>\u201cKnow that I will shoot you again if I need to,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd know, too, that if I die, so will Ilianna.\u201d</p><p>That stopped me. Even Amaya muted her screams. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that.\u201d He paused, but the tension in his body suggested he was very much ready to react the minute I so much as twitched. \u201cIf I do not contact the people holding your friend every hour, they will kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bastard.\u201d</p><p>Amusement flitted across his features. \u201cAll Aedh are bastards, dear Risa, because we seed and leave. We are not prey to the emotions and needs that wreck so many human lives.\u201d</p><p>And were poorer for it. \u201cBut to rape Ilianna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no rape,\u201d he cut in, sounding oddly annoyed. \u201cAn Aedh\u2019s kiss always ensures that their chosen breeder is more than willing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIlianna is gay. You would have had to force a kiss, if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Though anger kept the worst of the pain at bay, I was bleeding all over the place and would be in very serious trouble if I didn\u2019t do something about it soon. Yet I remained still. To do anything else would not have been wise right now.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but we both know I was not her first male lover.\u201d</p><p>No, because Ilianna had experimented when she was young. After the attack on her sister had left her incapable of conceiving, her parents\u2019 desire for grandchildren had fallen solely onto Ilianna\u2019s shoulders. The weight of their expectations had all but forced her to least try to have a relationship with a male. But she could no more change her orientation than the moon could rise during the day.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t alter the reality that you forced yourself on her. Whether the magic made her willing or not doesn\u2019t matter in the end.\u201d And I would kill him for it. If not now, then later.</p><p>I shifted Amaya to my left hand and tried to ignore the warm slickness covering her hilt. The pain was getting stronger, a monster ready to consume. I clenched what remained of my fingers on my shattered hand, but it did little to stem the tide of blood.</p><p>He made a \u201cwho cares\u201d motion with his free hand. \u201cIt has been done. She will bear my child, no matter what happens to me. The decision you have to make is whether she actually gets to live or die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why the hell would you impregnate her if all you intended to do is kill her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome now, let\u2019s not play dumb, Risa. She is captive to your good behavior. And, of course, she is not the only one I have seeded.\u201d His smile was all arrogance. \u201cThe Raziq may have stolen many things from me, but they did not take my potency.\u201d</p><p>I wished they fucking had. \u201cSo does your dark sorceress know she\u2019s about to become a mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always did catch on to the inconsequential things faster than most,\u201d he murmured, looking amused. \u201cBut no, she does not. It is not necessary. Besides, she has not entirely upheld her part of our agreement, so I see no problem in not entirely upholding mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a decidedly risky game to play when dealing with a sorceress as powerful as Lauren Macintyre.\u201d But maybe she\u2019d kill him and save the rest of us the trouble.</p><p>\u201cYes, but there is also great pleasure to be found in playing such games.\u201d</p><p>I resisted the urge to glance at his body and see for myself just how much delight he was taking in this game. \u201cSo what\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, you find the keys; then we both go to retrieve them, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Dizziness swept me. I licked my lips and tried to ignore the trembling that was beginning to hit my muscles. \u201cBut what the hell are you going to do with them once you get them, Lucian? It\u2019s not like you can get onto the gray fields anymore.\u201d</p><p>Again that dark and dangerous energy flashed through him. \u201cPerhaps, but I can use them as a bargaining chip with the Raziq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think they\u2019ll agree to restore you to full Aedh in exchange for the keys, you\u2019re not playing with a full deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will have no choice.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cThey tortured you once for information on the keys. What makes you think they won\u2019t do it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I will have them placed where even the Raziq can\u2019t get them\u2014hell itself.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. He was insane. He had to be to even think that was a logical solution. \u201cI\u2019m sure the inhabitants of hell are going to be as happy as all get-out when they discover what they\u2019ve been handed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not so foolish as to simply hide them,\u201d he growled. \u201cThey will be guarded by the most powerful demons in hell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd suddenly Lauren\u2019s presence in your life makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything I do, I do for a reason, Risa.\u201d He nodded down at my hand. \u201cYou\u2019d better do something about that. I need you fit and able to find the keys later today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much for being able to read my mind only during sex,\u201d I spat. \u201cIs everything that comes out of your mouth a fabrication?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly when it suits me.\u201d His smile was lazy and arrogant. \u201cThat, however, was not a total lie. The only time I can generally read you is during sex\u2014it just doesn\u2019t have to be between you and me.\u201d</p><p>My stomach clenched, and I came so close to throwing up that the bitter taste of bile filled the back of my throat. Every time I\u2019d had sex with Azriel, he\u2019d been reading me. God, was there no end to this man\u2019s depravity?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fucking kill you. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cKeep believing that if it makes you feel better, Risa. However, you are no more capable of doing that than I am of sprouting wings\u2014and not even the banshee you hold in your hand will alter that one fact.\u201d</p><p>Banshee not, Amaya growled. Throw. Will gladly eat.</p> <p>Not until we find Ilianna. To Lucian, I said, \u201cYou always were an arrogant sod. I just didn\u2019t think you were stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess only time will prove which of us is right.\u201d He shrugged, the movement casual and elegant. \u201cNow, as I suggested before, you\u2019d best heal that hand.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down. Blood streamed from what remained of my fingers, and the ever-enlarging pool underneath them shimmered softly in the semilit darkness. And just like that, the anger gave way and the pain hit. My legs started trembling, and my head began spinning so badly, it was all I could do to remain standing.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t even sure I could heal a wound this bad, but if I didn\u2019t try soon, then I\u2019d be unconscious and in his power again. If he moves near me, I ordered Amaya, slice him up. Just don\u2019t kill him.</p><p>Pleasure.</p><p>I closed my eyes and called to the Aedh. It came in a trickle rather than a rush, a sure sign the magic that had prevented me from changing in the bedroom still held some sway out here. Either that or I was simply reaching the limits of my strength. And in the end, the result was pretty much the same.</p> <p>I grabbed at that trickle fiercely, forced it down into my arm, imagined my fingers and hand fading into energy. I felt the burn of power roll down the muscles, and an instant later, the ever-growing throb of pain was gone as my lower arm and hand became particles rather than flesh.</p><p>The trembling in my body grew stronger, and my control began to slip. I bit my lip, called up the Aedh again, and imagined fingers that were healed and whole. But this time, the energy was little more than a weak wash.</p><p>Then my knees went out from under me and I hit the concrete. Hard. I bit back a yelp and, with some trepidation, opened my eyes. I had four whole fingers back on my hand, but they were still a bloody\u2014and very painful\u2014mess. But the bleeding had at least slowed to little more than a trickle.</p><p>I met Lucian\u2019s gaze again. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid insolently down my body and my stomach clenched. He not touch, Amaya warned. Will slice.</p><p>Her fierce readiness to defend my honor was infinitely gratifying, but I had no doubt that having sex with him would be the ultimate price for setting Ilianna free. He didn\u2019t want just any offspring, no matter how much he\u2019d loaded the bases with Ilianna and Lauren. He wanted our offspring. Wanted a child that was as close to full Aedh as someone like him was ever likely to get.</p><p>And if that was the price of freeing Ilianna, then it was one I would pay, however much I\u2014and my sword\u2014might hate it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think is next?\u201d</p> <p>The desire radiating off him was so fierce and strong, it hit like a summer storm. My body trembled under its force, and my nipples puckered, reactions that only increased the strength of the storm.</p><p>\u201cIf I knew, I wouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201d I continued to meet his gaze steadily, even though my heart was beating a million miles an hour and my throat was dry.</p><p>A smile played about his lips. \u201cYou lie, Risa Jones.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t reply, because there was very little I could say or do at this point. If sex was what he now intended, then it would happen, no matter what. And if I killed him, as I ached to, it would be Ilianna who paid. I was the reason she\u2019d been kidnapped, raped, and impregnated, and that was guilt enough. I couldn\u2019t bear the weight of her death as well.</p><p>He took several steps toward me, then stopped. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>I rose slowly and somewhat unsteadily. Lust continued to roll off him in waves, and tiny beads of perspiration began to dot my skin. My damn nipples were so hard, they ached and, as much as I hated it, I couldn\u2019t entirely ignore the desire that slithered through me. And while most of it was undoubtedly the spell he\u2019d placed on me, some of it was not.</p><p>I might hate him, but I also wanted him.</p><p>But I\u2019d be damned if I admitted it.</p><p>Our gazes clashed for several more nerve-racking minutes; then he raised a hand, pressed a fingertip between my breasts, and pushed me backward. Amaya\u2019s screams echoed in my head, and I ordered her to shut up and not cut.</p><p>My back hit the wall, the wood rough and grimy against my skin. He kept me pinned, not moving, not saying anything, just watching me with that smug, insolent expression I was beginning to hate.</p><p>Then he stepped back.</p><p>For a moment, hope leapt, but the amusement touching his lips soon killed that.</p><p>\u201cUndress me,\u201d he ordered. \u201cSlowly.\u201d</p><p>I flexed my fingers, battling anger and the urge to do as Amaya desired, then raised my hands and unbuttoned his shirt. When the last button came undone, I placed my hands on his skin and slid them upward, over the taut muscles of his stomach and chest and then under the shirt. As it slipped to floor, I ran my hands back down his body and played with the waist of his pants.</p><p>His warm breath fanned across my skin, its tempo one of expectation. Mine was no better, despite my loathing of the situation. My gaze rose to his. Desire burned in those green depths, but so, too, did warning.</p><p>I unfastened his pants. His cock strained against the restriction of his silk boxers, thick and hard and ready for action. I hooked my fingers into the waist of both and slid them down his legs. He stepped out, then pressed a hand against my head, keeping me down.</p><p>\u201cSuck me.\u201d</p><p>I did as he bid, sucking and licking and teasing until the salty taste of come began to fill my mouth.</p><p>Abruptly, he tangled his fingers in my hair and yanked me upright. He spun me around so that I faced the wall, then pulled my head backward, kissing me fiercely as he entered me from behind. What followed was animalistic and hard, and, despite my loathing of both him and the situation, felt good. But I did not give voice to my pleasure. There wasn\u2019t much I could keep to myself given the situation, but I refused to give him that.</p><p>He came with a shout that was as fierce as it was triumphant, pumping hard as he emptied himself inside me. I closed my eyes, my body still trembling with unfulfilled desire, his fluids dribbling down my thighs and hate in my heart.</p><p>He withdrew, turned me around, and kissed me fiercely again. But just as quickly, he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cRespond like you mean it, dear Risa, or I will not make the call that is keeping your friend alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep either of us forever, Lucian,\u201d I said, my voice edged with the anger I was barely keeping leashed. I could almost taste his death, and god, it tasted sweet. \u201cSooner or later, this will have to end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it will.\u201d He bent, picked me up in his arms, then spun and walked back to the bedroom. \u201cBut the military exhibition does not open until ten, and that gives me five hours to fuck you senseless.\u201d</p><p>He threw me onto the bed, but didn\u2019t immediately join me. \u201cBy the time you leave here, you will be carrying my child. And that will be the greatest revenge I could ever have on your reaper.\u201d</p><p>My flesh-and-blood reaper. If he could bleed, if he could gain human emotions when in flesh too long, why then would he not also be fertile? If the Raziq had taken the chip out, then it was more than possible that I was already pregnant.</p><p>God, wouldn\u2019t that be the perfect twist? If I had to be pregnant, then I would much rather the father be someone I actually cared about than someone I intended to kill.</p><p>Of course, given fate\u2019s apparent desire to crap all over my life, it was not a likely outcome, but my heart still sang at the thought.</p><p>And it was a hope that got me through the hours that ensued.</p><p>I woke to the scent of mold, dust, and age. Similar scents, yet different from what I\u2019d woken to before. Disoriented, I rolled onto my back, feeling the rough edges of wood rather than the silk of sheets. My eyes were heavy and my head was booming, and that \u201cdrank too much\u201d sensation was well and truly back.</p><p>He\u2019d obviously transported me magically rather than just letting me go. I couldn\u2019t remember his doing it, but then, I hadn\u2019t actually been around for the last few hours of our encounter. I might not have done much astral travel, but I\u2019d learned enough to get the hell out of my body. Lucian either hadn\u2019t noticed or hadn\u2019t cared. He might have paid lip service to wanting me to be an eager, vocal participant, but in the end all he\u2019d wanted was a body to impregnate.</p><p>And I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what I\u2019d do if I was pregnant, especially since there was just as much chance of it being Azriel\u2019s as Lucian\u2019s.</p><p>God, please, let it be Azriel\u2019s.</p><p>A desperate plea that in itself suggested the psychic part of me already knew my fate in that regard.</p><p>I opened my eyes. Daylight drifted in from the grimy windows to my right, highlighting a mess of upturned tables, broken chairs, and graffiti-littered walls. It had to be Larry\u2019s, and I wondered if Jak had ever been here. Lucian was much more than we\u2019d ever suspected, and maybe magic wasn\u2019t the only thing he\u2019d become adept at. Maybe he could imitate voices, as well. Right now, I wouldn\u2019t put anything past him.</p><p>I pushed into a sitting position. The first thing I saw was the ring of black stones that surrounded me. But they weren\u2019t just any old stones; they were wards. I raised a hand and carefully touched one. Color swirled through its dark heart, but it didn\u2019t react in any other way. Their presence, however, might explain why Azriel\u2014or anyone else, for that matter\u2014hadn\u2019t come to my rescue. Warding stones were generally used to keep things either out or in, but I knew they could also be used to confuse. Maybe no one had rescued me simply because they\u2019d been unable to pin down my location. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I carefully flicked the nearest stone out of sequence. It rattled noisily across the old floorboards, the sound almost thunderous in the hush holding the building captive. A heartbeat later, energy burned across my skin and Azriel was in front of me, pulling me into a hug as fierce and as desperate as any I\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>I melted into him, enjoying the security and warmth of his embrace. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I said eventually. My words were muffled against his chest, but I wasn\u2019t about to move. Not yet. Not until the trembling that was as much utter relief as it was weakness stopped. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there for most of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Aedh\u2019s death will be slow and very painful.\u201d Azriel\u2019s voice was flat but filled with such fury, it momentarily stole my breath. \u201cAnd I will savor every single moment of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut not until we find Ilianna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cannot get away\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not kill him.\u201d I pulled away from him, my gaze searching his. Saw the anger, the pain, and knew it was all for me. It warmed me just as much as it worried me. \u201cFar worse can and has been done to me, Azriel. Ilianna is a hostage against my good behavior, and until we can find her, then Lucian has to live.\u201d</p><p>He said something in his own language, the words soft but vehement. It didn\u2019t take much imagination to know he was swearing. \u201cYou cannot seriously think we should allow him in on the search for the keys. That is taking things too far.\u201d</p><p>Things had already gone too far, and it was too late to stop it all now. \u201cI am, and he will.\u201d I gave him a lopsided smile. \u201cAt the very least, it means we can keep an eye on him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would much rather keep a sword on him, if it\u2019s all the same to you.\u201d He tugged me close again and wrapped his arms around me. It felt like heaven. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home.\u201d</p><p>If I was in his arms, then I was home, but I didn\u2019t give that particular thought voice. His energy swept around me, and in no time we\u2019d zipped through the fields and were re-forming in the middle of my bedroom. I stepped back and glanced at the clock on my side table. It was just after ten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a shower and clean up; then we can go see if the key is at the exhibition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if we find it?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI guess what happens next depends on what sort of security they have in place.\u201d</p><p>He studied me for a moment, then said, \u201cWhat of the Aedh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to meet us there at eleven thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we should try to get there sooner\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I cut in. \u201cRemember Ilianna.\u201d</p><p>He swore again. I smiled, dropped a quick kiss on his lips, and said, \u201cI know. Trust me, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you do not.\u201d</p><p>He caught my broken hand and gently ran his fingers over the mangled remnants of mine. Energy flowed from his touch, renewing my reserves even as my fingers began to heal. Or rather, heal as much as they were ever going to. But I could bend them, use them, and the scars\u2014which were red and fierce-looking right now\u2014would eventually fade. I\u2019d been lucky, and I knew it. If not for the fact I was half Aedh, I would have lost them.</p><p>He raised my fingers to his lips, brushing a sweet kiss across them, then said, \u201cGo. I will prepare you something to eat.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared, and I headed for the shower. For the longest time, I did nothing more than stand under the water, letting the heat wash the ache from my bruised body and the scents of lust and Lucian from my skin. I wished it could similarly wash the niggling sense of violation from my mind, but there was nothing in this world that could do that except time.</p> <p>I ran my fingers across my belly and wondered if I did indeed carry the beginnings of life deep inside. Wondered how I would feel if it turned out to be Lucian\u2019s rather than Azriel\u2019s.</p><p>Another two questions only time could answer.</p><p>I took a somewhat shuddery breath, then got the hell out of the shower and dressed. Worrying over events far in the future was not particularly the best way to spend my time at the moment. Not when I had keys to not only find but, hopefully, this time, keep. How we were going to do that given the whole Lucian situation, I had no idea, but one thing was certain. The bastard might think he held all the cards, but there was always, always, a way out. You just had to look hard enough.</p><p>And perhaps be willing to pay the ultimate price.</p><p>But that price would not be Ilianna\u2019s death. That was the one place I would not go.</p><p>Azriel, it seemed, had been picking up cooking tips from somewhere, because this time he\u2019d produced the world\u2019s biggest steak and some steamed veggies.</p><p>I sat down and tucked in with gusto. Once I\u2019d demolished everything on my plate, I grabbed my Coke, sat back, and asked the one question that had been quietly bugging me. \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you able to rescue me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, as you have already guessed, he used magic to not only snatch you, but to disguise your whereabouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnharmed.\u201d His voice was as neutral as his expression. \u201cI will admit to a somewhat angry response to his part in your abduction, but I controlled it the minute I realized he was an unwilling participant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning you beat him up, then healed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d He returned my gaze evenly. \u201cHe does not now remember the event.\u201d</p><p>Meaning the event, as he put it, had been pretty bad. \u201cI told you Jak wouldn\u2019t willingly betray me, Azriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has before, so that is an illogical statement.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps it was, but I nevertheless believed it. \u201cWhat, exactly, did Lucian do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing more than luring him to the warehouse with the promise of a story, then capturing his mind.\u201d</p><p>Which was why Jak hadn\u2019t really sounded himself. They had been Lucian\u2019s words, not Jak\u2019s. I drank some Coke, enjoying the fuzzy goodness for several seconds before saying, \u201cWe need to find Ilianna. Until she\u2019s free, we\u2019re stuck doing whatever Lucian wants us to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would suspect that he has her position well hidden by his magic.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cDoes it take much magic to do that sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, the movement brief but somehow elegant. \u201cI am not knowledgeable when it comes to magic, but I would suspect so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo perhaps what we need is someone who is not only knowledgeable in all matters magic, but who is able to detect such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIlianna\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and thrust upward. \u201cWe need to go see\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut the rest of the sentence off as a phone rang. It wasn\u2019t my phone\u2014I hadn\u2019t yet gotten around to charging the damn thing\u2014but rather a phone coming from Tao\u2019s room. It was answered after a few seconds, but that didn\u2019t do much to ease the tension suddenly running through me.</p><p>I knew who was making that call. Knew why.</p><p>After a few minutes, Tao stumbled out, looking somewhat disheveled and far from awake. \u201cIt\u2019s Mirri,\u201d he said, thrusting the phone at me. \u201cShe\u2019s not making sense. Is Ilianna missing or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I grabbed the phone and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mirri. I know what\u2019s happened to her, and she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank god.\u201d Tears filled her bright eyes. \u201cI was so afraid something bad had happened to her. Where is she? Why hasn\u2019t she contacted me?\u201d</p><p>Something bad had happened, but I wasn\u2019t about to tell her that. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t not tell her what was going on. I hesitated, then said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid she\u2019s being held hostage against my good behavior. She hasn\u2019t been hurt, and won\u2019t be, as long as I do everything her kidnapper says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck.\u201d</p><p>That, ten times over, I thought grimly. \u201cI think we\u2019ve worked out a way to free her, Mirri\u2014\u201d</p><p>The phone was snatched from her hand, and suddenly I was staring at a man with piercing, light blue eyes, pale skin, and silver-white hair. Albino, I thought, and then realized this was probably Carwyn.</p><p>\u201cI want in on any rescue attempt,\u201d he said, voice deep and fierce.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that Ilianna would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may not yet be her mate,\u201d he cut in. \u201cBut I will be. Whoever did this to her must pay.\u201d</p><p>And that was both the stallion and the man speaking, I thought grimly. And yet I couldn\u2019t do everything. If I were to have any hope of prizing Ilianna away from Lucian\u2019s clutches, then it would have to be when Lucian was otherwise distracted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find her first,\u201d I said; then, when he opened his mouth to obviously argue, I quickly added, \u201cThe minute we do, we\u2019ll ring you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be standing by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I hung up and handed the phone back to Tao, who was looking decidedly more awake.</p><p>\u201cIlianna\u2019s really missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian\u2019s snatched her and hidden her location through magic. I\u2019m about to go over to the Brindle to see if her mom can find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I cut in. \u201cTime is of the essence. We\u2019ll come back here the minute we uncover anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo echo Carwyn\u2019s words, I\u2019ll be standing by.\u201d He half turned, then clicked his fingers and added, \u201cOh, a parcel was delivered for you an hour ago. I dropped it on the coffee table so you\u2019d see it coming in, which you obviously haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>No, because I hadn\u2019t come in the regular way, but rather via the Azriel express. I walked across to pick up the small white box. It wasn\u2019t particularly heavy, and the writing was my father\u2019s. This had to be the wards he promised. Heart beating a whole lot faster, I glanced up at Tao and said, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s not one of those parcels, is it? Because you\u2019re suddenly looking a whole lot paler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve asked for this time.\u201d I forced a smile. \u201cHopefully, it\u2019s something that\u2019ll keep the hordes at bay while we grab the next key.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShame it couldn\u2019t also keep Lucian at bay,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cA sword would,\u201d Azriel commented, voice as flat as his expression. \u201cAnd I know two that would gladly cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does make an excellent point,\u201d Tao said, then held up his hands as I opened my mouth. \u201cYes, I know. We can\u2019t do anything until Ilianna is safe. But that doesn\u2019t stop either of us from wishing the worst on the bastard, does it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t wish anything worse on him than I am, trust me.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop the bitterness in my voice, and Tao\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cIs there something else going on you\u2019re not telling me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He didn\u2019t look convinced, but then, I guess he had known me a long time. \u201cI\u2019ll call you when we find anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d</p><p>I turned to Azriel. He caught my hand unasked, drew me to him, and whisked us through the fields to the Brindle. I handed him the box, suspecting the Brindle would not react kindly to Aedh magic being taken into its midst, then ran up the steps and into the foyer. A geyser of golden sparks followed me as I ran through the shadows.</p> <p>A gray-clad woman appeared. \u201cPlease, there is no need for haste\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s every need,\u201d I bit back, but I nevertheless slowed. \u201cI urgently need to see Custodian Zaira.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisa, what draws you here in such a state?\u201d The familiar voice was as soft as the shadows around us and just as powerful.</p><p>I glanced past the gray-clad young woman and watched the willowy figure approach. Kiandra wasn\u2019t only the woman charge of the Brindle, but one of the most powerful witches I\u2019d ever met. \u201cI need to speak to Zaira urgently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs Indara was no doubt about to tell you, Zaira is not on duty today.\u201d She stopped several feet away and studied me. The power so evident in her gray eyes, was breathtaking. \u201cIs this about Ilianna?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s been kidnapped, and we suspect magic is being used to stop anyone from finding her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you wish us to find her by tracking the magic itself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I have no idea if it\u2019s possible\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d She tilted her head, and just for an instant it felt like she was seeing into my mind, reading all my hopes and fears. Judging me. My breath caught somewhere in my throat, and I found myself hoping I came up to scratch. After a moment, she added, \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>Once again I was led through the Brindle\u2019s quiet, shadowed halls and into yet another area I\u2019d never been before. This one felt and looked far older than the other areas I\u2019d visited, and power seemed to ooze off the walls. It was almost as if the centuries of spell making had infused the old stones with a magic all of their own.</p><p>We made our way through the dimly lit corridors, each one getting progressively smaller and darker, and eventually stepped into a room that appeared little more than an antechamber. The air was rich with such a riot of scents that my nose twitched and I didn\u2019t even bother trying to sort them all out. There was power here, too, and the force of it made my skin itch and tingle.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d Kiandra murmured, waving an elegant hand toward the two small chairs that were positioned on either side of the doorway. \u201cYou are not an initiate and therefore cannot follow me into the next room. I will see what magic there is to be found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t feel like human magic,\u201d I said. \u201cBecause it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t ask what type of magic it could be, but then, given she appeared to know all about my key quest and the forces that fought for control of both me and them, maybe she didn\u2019t need to.</p><p>Without further comment, she turned and walked into the next room. The door closed behind her with a heavy click, leaving me alone in the silent shadows. I sat for all of three seconds, then got up and began to pace. I couldn\u2019t help it. So much of what we could do next depended on the information Kiandra did\u2014or didn\u2019t\u2014find for us.</p><p>It seemed to take forever. I didn\u2019t have my watch or phone, but I guess the reality was closer to ten minutes. I spun around as the door opened and she reappeared, a slight haze of smoke and magic accompanying her as she walked toward me. Her expression gave little away, so it was with some trepidation that I asked, \u201cDid you find her?\u201d</p><p>She stopped and clasped her hands in front of her. Her expression held an odd sort of excitement. \u201cIlianna is with child?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes for a moment and swore internally. If Kiandra knew, then Ilianna\u2019s mother would more than likely find out sooner rather than later. Given her desire to see Ilianna join Carwyn\u2019s herd, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure how\u2019d she react. Or, indeed, how Carwyn would.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than possible. The man who holds her is an Aedh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her child will be as you are: born of two worlds, powerful in magic, and gifted with foresight.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because you do not acknowledge such things does not mean they do not exist or that you are not capable.\u201d She paused, her gray eyes glowing molten silver with the shadows that held the room hostage. There was more than just power in her gaze now. There was excitement. \u201cThe old ritual site on Mount Macedon would not have acknowledged you in the manner that it did if it were not so.\u201d</p><p>The site had acknowledged me? When? Then I remembered the odd sense of watchfulness and the feeling that the trees themselves were sentient. Remembered that I\u2019d been able to become Aedh when the magic of that place barred all such beings entry.</p><p>\u201cIlianna may not choose to keep\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will,\u201d Kiandra said, with a certainty I couldn\u2019t help but believe. \u201cBecause she knows, as I know, that this child has been a long time coming, and a long time needed.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kiandra agreed. \u201cBut Ilianna does. There are many reasons she ran from us. What she witnessed when young was the excuse but not the truth.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my forehead wearily. Fate, it seemed, had been brewing her plans for us all for a very long time. \u201cLook, right now, all I want to do is rescue her. Did you find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And you were right\u2014great magic holds her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning we won\u2019t get past it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning that neither you nor your dark defender will. It is aimed at energy beings rather than mere flesh and blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Tao and Carwyn would get past it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect so.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cThere are beings within who guard her, but I could gain no true sense of them. They may or may not be human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, neither are Tao and Carwyn, and both are pretty pissed off right now.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt may be enough. Just tell them not to go in all guns blazing, because that will have dire consequences.\u201d</p><p>For Ilianna, I thought, not for them. I swallowed and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll pass on the message.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cShe is being held in an abandoned warehouse in Link Court, Brooklyn. The magic lies within the building, not along the perimeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning they\u2019d need to be wary of other security measures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She moved past me and led the way back through the warren of shadowed, powerful corridors. When we neared the front door, she stopped and lightly touched my shoulder. \u201cBe careful, Risa Jones. There are more games being played than you realize.\u201d</p><p>My smile was almost a grimace. \u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are two people in your life who are in reality one, and their deception goes deeper than you think.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She half shrugged. \u201cWhat I see is not always clear. But I would suspect that a shape-shifter of some kind has entered your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is\u2014he stole the first key. It\u2019s tracking the bastard that is proving the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps you should start looking closer to home.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cAre you saying it\u2019s a friend?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cAcquaintance, perhaps. As I said, these things are not always clear.\u201d</p><p>Then I wished she hadn\u2019t mentioned it, because now I\u2019d be looking at everyone suspiciously and suspecting the worse. But I forced a smile and said, \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll keep an eye out.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and, with one eloquent gesture, ushered me out of the building. But I was aware of her gaze as I ran down the steps, and it made my back itch. She knew more than what she\u2019d said; of that much I was sure.</p><p>Azriel appeared near the bottom step. \u201cYou were successful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now we just need to plot our next move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to your apartment, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need to go see Aunt Riley. She\u2019s the expert in this sort of stuff. As much as I hate to do it, I think I need to bring her in rather than risk using only Tao and Carwyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd once again, you do something thoroughly sensible. There is hope for you yet, I think.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t say that too loud. Wouldn\u2019t want the word getting around and spoiling my reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour secret is safe with me.\u201d He wrapped his arms around my waist, dropped a kiss on my nose, then zapped us across to my aunt\u2019s.</p><p>To say our sudden appearance in the middle of her living room was something of a surprise would be the understatement of the year. I waited until she stopped swearing, then dropped a kiss on her cheek. \u201cAnd good morning to you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was a good morning until you scared the life out of me and made me spill my coffee.\u201d Amusement teased her mouth and lit her gray eyes as she walked into the open kitchen area and grabbed a cloth. She tossed it to me, then added, \u201cSeeing as I have to make a fresh cup, do you want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t the time.\u201d I bent and wiped up the spillage. \u201cI\u2019m actually here for help.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m gathering it\u2019s not key related, given your determination not to involve any of us in that search.\u201d Her voice was wry. \u201cWhich, by the way, is neither warranted nor necessary. We have faced far worse in our lifetimes than rogue Aedh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is precisely why I don\u2019t want you involved.\u201d And she knew that. \u201cBut this is related. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p> <p>She crossed her arms and regarded me steadily. A rock I could always depend on, no matter what, I thought with a half smile.</p><p>\u201cLucian has kidnapped Ilianna and is holding her hostage against my good behavior at a warehouse in Link Court, Brooklyn. According to the Brindle witches, she\u2019s protected by magic that will allow neither Aedh nor reaper entry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m surprised Lucian is still alive. In a similar situation, I would have killed the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sentiment I totally agree with,\u201d Azriel said.</p><p>I gave him a look over my shoulder, but he merely raised an eyebrow at me.</p> <p>\u201cThen why isn\u2019t he dead?\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt would solve the problem of being forced to do what you do not wish to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t report in every hour, the men holding her have orders to kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, I do not think those men are human.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNon-human I can deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but these are non-human and Razan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeaning the fight will be infinitely more exciting.\u201d She grinned and cracked her knuckles. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a good fight in quite a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is because you\u2019re supposed to be settling down to a quiet life.\u201d Uncle Quinn\u2019s gently lilting tones seemed to come out of the air itself. \u201cAnd you were intending to call me in on this, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He re-formed next to Riley, his expression a mix of love and amusement. Like me, he was half Aedh, and was, in fact, the man who had taught me all of my skills.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she replied, a smile on her lips and her eyes sparkling. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to miss out on the excitement.\u201d</p><p>Quinn rolled his eyes and glanced at me. \u201cWhat do we face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic, electronic security, and more than likely Raziq.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cTao and Carwyn\u2014Ilianna\u2019s potential mate\u2014want in on the action.\u201d</p><p>Quinn frowned. \u201cGiven we face an unknown number of combatants, I don\u2019t think it wise to involve anyone who isn\u2019t fight trained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but the magic is aimed at those who are energy or half-energy beings, so it\u2019ll prevent you from getting in.\u201d I switched my gaze to Riley. \u201cI know you\u2019re one of the best, but I don\u2019t want you going in there alone. I couldn\u2019t stand to see you hurt.\u201d Or worse. I didn\u2019t say it, but it hovered in the air, regardless.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t be alone. I have a twin, remember, and he loves a fight even more than I do.\u201d She smiled, walked over to gather me in her arms, and hugged me fiercely. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, Risa,\u201d she added softly. \u201cIt always is.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung my eyes, and I blinked them away rapidly. And wished, with all my heart, that I could believe her. But deep down I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be all right, that it was never going to be all right. All right had long ago passed me by, and I was sliding faster and faster into the darkness that my mother had foreseen wrapped around me all those years ago.</p><p>\u201cWhat we need,\u201d Quinn said, \u201cis eyes on the situation. Once we know what we face, we can plan our attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStane can hook into all the security cams in the area\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can the Directorate,\u201d Riley said. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll be easier and faster. I\u2019ll get Rhoan on it immediately.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>She waved my objection away as she picked up her phone. \u201cJack owes me more than one favor. Besides, if this goes sideways, it\u2019s better that the Directorate be involved.\u201d</p><p>Please, God, don\u2019t let it go sideways. I licked my lips, then nodded. As Riley made the call, I glanced at Quinn. \u201cI\u2019m meeting Lucian at eleven thirty. I know that doesn\u2019t leave much time to plan anything, but I can delay him for at least an hour.\u201d</p><p>He said, \u201cThe longer you can delay, the better it will be. We\u2019ll ring\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. My phone is dead and I left it home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will shoot you a telepathic message when we\u2019ve freed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m wearing nano microcells\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich have not the capacity to stop me, no more than they could Riley.\u201d Quinn glanced at her as she got off the phone. \u201cAll set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhoan is gearing up surveillance as we speak, and Jack has approved full Directorate participation.\u201d Her gaze met mine. \u201cHe said he owed you a favor. Care to explain that?\u201d</p><p>I kept my expression\u2014and thoughts\u2014carefully neutral. \u201cI was asked for advice on some demon-related killings Rhoan\u2019s investigating. Couldn\u2019t do a whole lot to help, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Her expression suggested she very much didn\u2019t believe my reply, even though it was the truth as far as it went. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to need your friends, so tell Tao and Carwyn to cool their jets. We\u2019ll contact them the minute we can.\u201d</p><p>If they are not going to help free Ilianna, perhaps we should bring them in on the key\u2014</p><p>No, I said, before he could finish. Definitely not.</p><p>Risa, I do not trust the Aedh, and it might be wiser\u2014</p><p>I won\u2019t risk my friends again, Azriel. I\u2019ve already done enough damage to them. Out loud, I said, \u201cYou\u2019ll let me know the minute you have her? And you\u2019ll both be careful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will, on both counts.\u201d Quinn glanced at his watch. \u201cIf you were planning to scout the area before you met Lucian, you had better hurry. It\u2019s almost eleven now.\u201d</p><p>We left.</p><p>But not without a prayer to the fates and whatever gods were listening that everything went as planned and everyone got out alive.</p><p>And that included me and Azriel.</p><p>Because the shit, I suspected, was about to hit the fan big-time.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>The Arms and Militaria Exhibition was being held in a beautiful redbrick building that had once been a post office. It sat on one corner of a street that was a mix of old architecture and more modern\u2014but infinitely uglier\u2014concrete buildings, a grand old lady that time had not diminished.</p><p>The street itself wasn\u2019t crowded, although the parking lot across from the old post office was full, and I doubted they were all here for the nearby florist or the computer shop.</p><p>A roundabout was situated at the right end of the old building, but to the left there was a small metal gate and a green covered pathway that led\u2014presumably\u2014around to the back. Handy, given I had to set up the ward somewhere it wouldn\u2019t be noticed\u2014presuming it was a ward in the box my father had sent, and not something else.</p><p>\u201cWhatever lies in the box,\u201d Azriel said, \u201cit certainly involves some form of magic. It crawls over my skin.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhy would it have that reaction? It\u2019s supposed to keep the Aedh out, not you.\u201d</p><p>Azriel\u2019s smile was tight, without humor. \u201cYour father does not want me in possession of the keys any more than he does anyone else.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my head wearily. \u201cYou know, I hadn\u2019t even thought of that possibility.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt is better to have us all locked out than none of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bet my father won\u2019t be locked out. Or the Razan.\u201d Not to mention the dark sorcerer. I doubted he was going to miss out on the action, given his success stealing the first key.</p><p>And then there was Lucian, the joker in the mix.</p><p>My gaze dropped to the box Azriel still held. \u201cShould we use it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He handed it to me. \u201cI can patrol the perimeter and cut any off who attempt to breach the wards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father can\u2019t gain flesh form, so even if he has created a back door in the ward\u2019s magic, he still needs you to actually find and retrieve the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs me to find it,\u201d I said darkly. \u201cBut he has Razan to retrieve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if any do get past me, the Aedh will be beside you to stop them.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a surprised look. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would rather Tao be in there beside you, but it is an inescapable truth that the Aedh wants the keys for himself. He will fight anyone who gets in his way.\u201d He regarded me steadily. \u201cDo not turn your back on him.\u201d</p><p>Definitely not. The bastard was just as likely to fuck me as kill me. I glanced down at the box in my hand, then took a deep breath and, with slightly shaking fingers, opened it. Inside were four small stones in varying shades of gray and a note. I tucked the box under my arm and opened the note.</p><p>Place these wards on each corner of the building, it said. Activate them in sequence, light to dark, with a drop of your blood.</p><p>Losing more blood, even if it was only a couple of drops, wasn\u2019t exactly what I needed right now. Especially to activate damn wards. Still, if it kept the hordes out, then I guessed it was worth it.</p><p>I rolled the stones out onto my hand. They felt extraordinarily light and yet oddly warm. I couldn\u2019t sense any magic in them, but my skin still crawled at their touch. I forced my fingers closed around them, then glanced up at the building again. Placing stones on three sides of the building would be easy enough, but the last side was right on the intersection corner, with only a small strip of pavement between it and the roundabout. Placing a stone there, however close to the building, was risking it either being kicked away or picked up by some curious kid. Not that there were actually kids in the street at the moment, but knowing my luck, they\u2019d flood the place the minute I started activating the wards. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about the roof?\u201d Azriel said. \u201cHe did not define that the corners had to be the base of the building.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up. The roof was tiled and not particularly steep, but it was very visible from all parts of the street. If I got up there, I\u2019d attract all sorts of unwanted attention.</p><p>\u201cThen you must risk the last stone at the corner.\u201d</p><p>I guess I did. I took another deep breath that did next to nothing to release the tension in me, then said, \u201cLet\u2019s get this done before Lucian turns up.\u201d</p> <p>I walked across the road, glanced up and down the footpath to see if anyone was paying undue attention to us, then pushed through the old wrought-iron gate and quickly headed around the corner. Ivy and shrubs crawled all over the fence lining one side of the path, which would have been the perfect place to hide a stone except for the fact they had to be on the corner of the building. I found a crack in the concrete that was as close as I was ever going to get and wedged the lightest-colored stone into it. \u201cBlood,\u201d I said suddenly. \u201cAmaya won\u2019t cut me, will she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is incapable of doing so, even if requested.\u201d He drew Valdis and held her point down, near my leg. Her steel flickered with an odd purple fire. It was almost as if she were displeased. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>His hesitation was brief, but nevertheless there. \u201cBecause of the connection we have formed.\u201d</p><p>I studied him for a moment, sensing that was the truth as far as it went, but knowing there was a whole lot more to it than that\u2014and that he wasn\u2019t about to explain it. I lightly pressed a fingertip against Valdis\u2019s point. Blood welled. I let it drop onto the ward. In an instant it was gone, sucked into the stone itself. Dark, bloody light flickered deeply in its heart, then stilled. But it was not inert. It was waiting.</p> <p>I shivered, then stood and walked to the next corner. This time I wedged the ward into the strip of garden bed that ran the length of the rear of the building. When I dropped blood onto it, that dark, bloody light began to beat very slowly.</p><p>They were coming to life.</p><p>I repeated the process with the third stone, and this time the magic was tangible. It crawled across my skin, a force waiting for completion.</p><p>I jumped over the rear fence and walked up to the final corner. There was absolutely nowhere to safely put the ward. It was pavement right up to the edge of the building, and there were no cracks in either the concrete or the bricks.</p><p>\u201cThen let me make one.\u201d Azriel pressed Valdis\u2019s sharp tip against the lowest visible brick near the corner of the building. Her flames flared briefly and, in seconds, there was a small, thumb-sized hole large enough to securely hold the last ward.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d I squeezed my finger to get a final drop of blood, put it on the stone, then hurriedly dropped it in place.</p> <p>The energy that crawled across my skin expanded in a rush, sweeping out and up, creating a wall of power that was invisible, but not entirely silent. It reminded me of the crackle and hum often heard when standing under high-voltage power lines. It would certainly be a warning to those who were sensitive to such things that something major now protected this building.</p><p>I rose and met Azriel\u2019s gaze. \u201cAre you sure the wards will keep you out?\u201d</p><p>In answer, he raised his hand and held it close to the wall. Little bolts of lightning shot toward his fingertips, a warning of what was to come if he pressed closer.</p><p>He lowered his hand. \u201cThe Aedh is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bastard is early.\u201d I flexed my fingers against the sudden urge to grab Amaya and thrust her sharp point into Lucian\u2019s dark heart, then forced a smile and walked around the corner.</p><p>He waited in the middle of the three arches that made up the main entrance into the building. \u201cLucian,\u201d I said, voice somehow very neutral. \u201cHow pleasant to see you.\u201d</p><p>Amusement touched his lips. \u201cAnd said with such sincerity, too. Just as well you\u2019re a restaurateur rather than an actress, my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your anything.\u201d I stopped several feet away and crossed my arms. \u201cIt\u2019s seven bucks an adult to get into the exhibition. You can pay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d But his gaze wasn\u2019t on me; it was on Azriel. \u201cAnd it was, many times.\u201d</p><p>The anger that exploded from Azriel was so strong, it actually forced me forward a step. How he managed to rein it in, to not attack Lucian, I had no idea. But he did.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, either. Maybe he simply couldn\u2019t, lest it break the wall of control.</p><p>\u201cLucian, cut the shit and just get inside,\u201d I growled. \u201cWe\u2019re here to find the key, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we are,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut it is infinitely satisfying to know that I have succeeded where he has failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so certain of that,\u201d I bit back, then pushed him up the stairs. Just for a moment, darkness flared in his eyes, yet another reminder that the man I\u2019d spent so much time with was not the person he truly was.</p><p>I followed him up the steps and into the shadowed confines of the building\u2019s foyer. Old bank-teller-type windows lined one wall, and it was behind several of these that tickets could be purchased.</p><p>\u201cI see your father has done his bit to make this place safe,\u201d Lucian said, smiling at the woman as he paid the entrance fees.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate he was unable to keep the likes of you out.\u201d</p><p>Lucian chuckled softly, handed me a ticket, then grandly ushered me forward. \u201cAfter you, my sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stick the politeness where the sun don\u2019t shine,\u201d I muttered, then handed the ticket to the collector at the main door and went in.</p><p>The next room was vast and had obviously once been the main mail sorting area. There were three rows of exhibits here and, at the rear, a sign stating there were more up the stairs. There were also about a dozen people wandering around and a guard for each of the aisles.</p><p>I scanned the room for security cameras and saw four\u2014one on each corner. Between them and the glass covering the majority of the display tables, there was little chance of snatching the key inconspicuously\u2014if it was here, that was.</p><p>I made my way to the first aisle and slowly walked through, lingering near each table for several seconds to see if I got any reaction to the items within. This aisle seemed to be a mix of pistols and swords, but none of them set off the internal radar. I walked on.</p><p>It was a slow process and one that was utterly nerve-racking. Not just because I needed the key, but because of the rising expectations of the man who followed so closely behind me. Of course, the growing sense that the shit was about to hit the fan didn\u2019t help all that much, either. By the time I reached the end of the last aisle, I was so wound up, I was shaking.</p><p>I flexed my fingers again, trying to relax. A hard thing to do, given the tension radiating through me and around me. Tension that was mine, Lucian\u2019s, and Azriel\u2019s, all combining to make a stomach-churning mix. How I was managing to not throw up was a miracle.</p><p>\u201cThere are more exhibits upstairs.\u201d Lucian wrapped his fingers around my upper arm and propelled me forward.</p><p>I wrenched my arm free, but bit back the anger and somehow managed to say, almost civilly, \u201cI\u2019m well aware of that. There\u2019s no need to manhandle.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, the amusement playing about his lips at odds with the cool distance in his eyes. \u201cYou and I both know that you are not averse to a little force now and again, no matter how much you might say otherwise. This morning\u2019s efforts are a case in point.\u201d</p><p>Which explained the bruises I couldn\u2019t remember getting. God, how had I ever been fooled by this man?</p><p>Because he hid behind magic and years of pretending to be what he never was, Azriel said.</p><p>You weren\u2019t fooled.</p><p>No, but then, there were other reasons for that. He paused. Be wary. The Raziq approach.</p><p>Concern shot through me. How many? God, don\u2019t fight them\u2014</p><p>I will do what I must, he said, in a tone that suggested he wasn\u2019t about to listen to reason no matter what I said. You worry about finding the key. Let me do what I am here to do.</p><p>I grabbed the banister and began climbing the stairs. You\u2019re here to keep me safe and find the keys. Getting dead isn\u2019t a part of that.</p><p>I have no plans in that direction.</p><p>It isn\u2019t your plans I worry about.</p><p>Ah, but you should, Risa, he said, his mental tones soft and almost wistful.</p><p>I frowned. Azriel, I really don\u2019t need to be worried about your motives on top of everything else, so quit it.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t talking about motives, he said, then, in more normal tones, added, But as you say, this is not the time. Razan have arrived.</p><p>Fear shot through me. What about the Raziq? And how many Razan?</p><p>I reached the top of the stairs and hesitated. The floor plan was a mirror image of the one below, but there were more people up here. My gaze swept the walls. Another four cameras. I wondered if anyone was watching them, or if they merely recorded events for viewing later if something went wrong.</p><p>Because something was most certainly about to go wrong. Just not in the way they suspected.</p><p>The Raziq keep their distance and wait. There are six Razan. Azriel hesitated. They do not feel right.</p><p>Oh, great. Meaning?</p><p>They have been infected with magic.</p><p>My stomach twisted a few more knots. You mean like the ones who attacked us when we lost the first key?</p><p>The same. His mind voice was grim. I will stop them, but it will attract attention. It is also possible they are little more than a diversion. Stay wary.</p><p>\u201cI suspect your mind is not on what you are supposed to be finding,\u201d Lucian murmured, cupping my elbow and propelling me toward the row of long rifles. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be bitching to the reaper, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would it matter to you if I was?\u201d I snapped, and yanked my arm free again. \u201cBut as it happens, he was informing me that Razan have arrived. Wouldn\u2019t be yours, would they?\u201d</p><p>His expression darkened. Meaning he wasn\u2019t overly excited by this news and, warped or not, it cheered me up no end. I mean, anything that pissed him off had to be a good thing, if only marginally, right? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do not have enough magic left to create Razan,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if they come, they are not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut has your dark sorceress got enough magic to create them? Or something similar to them?\u201d</p><p>He shot me a glance, his expression unreadable. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCall it an educated guess. You\u2019re the one who said you don\u2019t do anything without reason. Perhaps your apparent lack of magic strength\u2014by Aedh standards, I\u2019m guessing, not human\u2014is the real reason you\u2019re making out with a very powerful sorceress. I bet she could create all manner of magic with a little help from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said. \u201cBut those Razan are not here under my orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but maybe they\u2019re here under hers.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer that particular accusation, meaning I\u2019d hit the nail on the head. And if she was behind the creation of the twisted Razan who\u2019d run interference when the first key was stolen\u2014and who were here now\u2014then maybe she was more involved than we\u2019d thought. After all, there had been male clothes in her Gold Coast apartment. Maybe Lucian was being played just as much as he was playing us.</p><p>\u201cJust find that key,\u201d he growled.</p> <p>\u201cIt may not even be here,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cAnd don\u2019t stand so fucking close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you\u2019ll do what?\u201d he mocked. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget who holds all the cards here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all the cards,\u201d I retorted. \u201cYou still need me to find the damn keys, and standing so close, radiating tension all over me, is interfering with that.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, but only a pace or two. Still, it gave me not only breathing room, but room enough to draw Amaya if I needed to.</p><p>From downstairs came a shout, then the sound of fighting. I knew Azriel was involved, but I resisted the urge to reach out to him. Distractions were the last thing he needed.</p><p>I walked on, scanning the displayed weapons, finding nothing, sensing nothing. Then, as I reached the end of the aisle, energy slithered across my skin\u2014a caress so light, it barely brushed the hairs on my arm. But the Du\u0161an stirred in my flesh and my gaze swept the remaining aisle. It was in one of them, somewhere.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve found something?\u201d Lucian said, excitement in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d I hesitated as another wash of energy ran over my skin, but this one was stronger and darker. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside from the hullabaloo your reaper is causing downstairs, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My gaze swept the room. There were still a dozen men up here, and none of them seemed overly interested in what was going on downstairs. In fact, they appeared to be deliberately ignoring it. Even the guards. Unease stirred. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wards your father so kindly created have stopped the Raziq. Your reaper is taking care of the Razan. There is nothing and no one else here to worry about, Risa.\u201d</p><p>He was wrong. Totally wrong. But I guessed he knew that. Guessed whatever or whoever I was sensing were either his people or his magic, or those belonging to his dark sorceress.</p><p>I forced myself to keep moving and tried to catch the elusive sensation that would lead me to the next key. The awareness of danger grew until it was a pulse beating in tune with my heart. My skin itched and sweat began to trickle down my spine, and all I could smell was fear. It was thick and rich and it was all mine.</p><p>I walked down the next aisle, drawn by the growing pull of power. The Du\u0161an\u2019s movements grew stronger, and she appeared to be moving from the left to the right. Knowing that the last time she\u2019d done this, she\u2019d actually been hinting at the key\u2019s location, I walked to the end of this aisle and into the next one.</p> <p>And stopped abruptly. The key was here.</p><p>But every sense I had screamed that pinning down its exact location was not a good thing to do right now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve found it.\u201d It was a statement, not a question, and again suggested that Lucian had not been altogether truthful when he\u2019d said he couldn\u2019t read my thoughts. Like that was a surprise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s there somewhere.\u201d I pointed to the largest of the three remaining display cases.</p><p>But the words were barely out of my mouth when the shit hit. The dozen strangers in the room turned as one, and for the first time I saw their faces. They weren\u2019t just men. They were the half-human, half-animal beings that had attacked us the first time.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Lucian yanked me backward and drew a long knife from god knows where. Its sides gleamed with an unearthly fire that matched the glow in his eyes. \u201cYou will not take it from me this time,\u201d he growled.</p><p>And with that, he attacked. Three of the shifters met his charge head-on. The remainder flowed around him and came straight at me.</p><p>I swore, drew Amaya, and fell back. Her anger filled me, but it did little to shore up my courage. I knew what these fucking things could do, and I knew that against so many I stood little chance.</p><p>I swung my sword, slashing right and left, Amaya\u2019s blade little more than a blur as she cut through the air and flesh with equal efficiency. Blood and body parts flew, and my arms shuddered with every strike, but nothing seemed to halt the creatures\u2019 onslaught. They didn\u2019t feel pain, didn\u2019t even acknowledge limb loss, never hesitated for one moment in their mad charge. Their eyes were filled with the desire to kill, to rent and tear and taste blood, and yet, oddly, they didn\u2019t. They attacked, but it was nine against one, and even with Amaya in my hands, the odds should have been overwhelming. But while they kept forcing me back, they hadn\u2019t yet done any serious damage.</p><p>And maybe that was the whole point. Distraction, not destruction.</p><p>The key, I thought, and desperately jumped sideways, trying to see past the wall of twisted flesh. A dark figure stood near the display cabinet, sweeping everything within it into a large rucksack.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I screamed, but was hit by one of the shifters and sent tumbling backward, over the guardrail. I hit one of the display cases below with a resounding crash and for a moment saw stars. Every breath hurt, and pain slithered down my back and right leg. Then twisted flesh replaced the spinning stars, and I threw myself sideways, off the broken display case and onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cHey, what the hell do you think\u2014\u201d someone shouted, but the sound was cut off abruptly as one of the shifters leapt at him.</p><p>There was a gargled cry and somewhere a woman started screaming, but I barely had time to scramble to my feet before the rest of the shifters were on me. I slashed Amaya across the face of one, sending bits of flesh and blood flying, then spun and stabbed upward, hitting another square in the chest. Amaya screamed as her flames leapt from steel to flesh, eating into him even as she sucked his life into her steel.</p><p>I shuddered at her voraciousness, then pulled her free and ran as hard as I could for the stairs. The remaining shifters came after me, snapping and snarling at my heels. Fingers snagged my foot on the third step and brought me down. I twisted and booted the shifter in the face with my free foot. His head snapped back under the force of the blow, and he snarled, revealing a bloody mouth and broken canines. But he didn\u2019t let go. I swore and swept Amaya from left to right. Her steel bit into the shifter\u2019s neck and she screamed in pleasure as she severed arteries and sprayed blood all over us both. I bit back bile and scrambled to my feet, only to be brought down again by another shifter. Teeth tore into my arm, and I screamed as he worried at my flesh like a dog with a bone. I hit him with my free hand, clawing at his eyes, trying to force him to release me. His teeth were biting deeper and deeper, and my fingers were beginning to lose strength. Amaya was stuck like glue, but it was her doing, not mine. I gouged my fingers deeper, until one of his eyeballs popped. He snarled and his grip on my arm momentarily lessened. I pulled free, clenched my bloody fist around Amaya\u2019s hilt, and hit him, as hard as I could. His head snapped backward and he went tumbling back down the stairs, knocking down several others in the process. But they were only down, not out, and already others were leaping over them and coming at me. I spun and raced up the rest of the stairs.</p><p>And saw Lucian thrust his arm into the middle of a shifter\u2019s chest and literally blow him apart.</p><p>I stopped cold.</p><p>Watched the bloody body parts fall as if in slow motion. Saw in the way they fell an echo of my mother\u2019s death.</p><p>And knew, with absolute cold certainty, that it had been Lucian who\u2019d killed my mother.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>My mind went dead.</p><p>For several seconds I couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t do anything. I just stood there, horror filling every part of me, as the man who had fooled me in more ways than I\u2019d ever imagined stepped over the broken remnants of the body and turned around. He didn\u2019t see me, didn\u2019t even look in my direction. He just raised the knife and ran at the darkly shadowed person still stuffing weapons into the rucksack.</p><p>The thief swore; the voice was male, not female. Not Lauren, then, some distant, still-aware part of me registered. Then magic surged and the cloaked stranger disappeared. Lucian screamed his fury, and it was that sound, more than anything, that unfroze my lips and got my mind working again. Suddenly, I became aware of the footsteps behind me and Amaya\u2019s screams. I swung, lashing out as hard and as fast as I could, slicing across the chest of the nearest shifter. As blood flew, I twisted and lashed out with a booted foot, knocking the second into the first and sending them both back down the stairs. Then I turned and ran straight at Lucian.</p><p>He saw me. He was always going to see me, given the noise Amaya was making. He made a mocking half bow, then threw something to the floor. Power surged, and he began to disappear. No fucking way, I thought, and threw myself at him. I hit him at the precise moment the energy reached its peak, and the power tore through us both, disintegrating flesh and body and bone in a manner very similar to the Aedh shift. It swept us into a void that lasted for several seconds; then the power surged again, and suddenly we were skin, rather than energy, and tumbling to the ground in a tangled mess. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ground, not floor, not concrete. Wherever the hell we were, it wasn\u2019t back at his apartment, as I\u2019d half expected.</p><p>He threw me off, then scrambled to his feet. \u201cWhat the fuck are you playing\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t give him a chance to finish. I just attacked. Amaya was little more than a blur of my hands, and her steel spat flames that sprayed all around us. Lucian swore and parried every blow with his long knife, retreating slowly but surely, his expression intent but not unduly worried.</p> <p>When energy surged around me, I realized why. By reacting without thinking, I\u2019d very neatly stepped into his trap.</p><p>He lowered his weapon and shook his head, his expression somewhat bemused. \u201cThis cage was not meant for you, but I\u2019m damn glad I set it up, all the same.\u201d</p><p>I slammed Amaya against the wall of power that surrounded me. Spidery veins of red spread for several inches from the impact point, then faded away, and Amaya hissed in fury.</p><p>Break can, she said. Time needed.</p><p>\u201cThat cage was designed to hold a sorcerer,\u201d Lucian said, amusement in his voice. \u201cNeither you nor your sword have the power to break it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you do it, Lucian?\u201d I growled, hitting the wall again. This time, I left Amaya against it. She hissed and spat, her steel throbbing as she sucked at the power of the cage. \u201cJust tell me that.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and held his hands wide, as if pleading his innocence. For the first time it actually registered that we were underground. Both the walls and ceiling that soared high above us were stone, and the air was thick with the scents of moisture and damp earth.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t steal the key, Risa. Indeed, I was hoping to trap the thief in the cage that now surrounds you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the fucking key, Lucian, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened. For half a second I honestly believed he had no idea what I was talking about; then I remembered what a consummate actor he was. What a liar he was.</p><p>\u201cTrust me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Never again. \u201cI\u2019m talking about my mother. You killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His voice was soft. \u201cThat.\u201d</p><p>Rage exploded, and I leapt at him without thinking. The cage bowed under the force of my impact but it didn\u2019t break, and I was flung backward, landing in an inelegant heap on the floor.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d I hissed. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve got to say about my mother\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cShe died well, with great grace, if that is of any consequence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you killed her.\u201d</p><p>Amusement touched his lips. \u201cYes, I believe we\u2019ve already established that fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d The word was torn from me. \u201cWhat the hell did my mother ever do to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing, of course. But without her presence, without her advice, you were infinitely more alone and vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d killed her merely to make me more accepting of his advances?</p><p>\u201cYou bastard.\u201d Bastard, bastard, soon-to-be-dead fucking bastard.</p><p>\u201cAnother fact we have already established.\u201d His amusement was stronger this time. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I have taken her from you for all eternity, Risa, so please cut the dramatics. You and she will meet again on another plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is beside the point!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is not, because I could have done otherwise.\u201d</p><p>A chill went through me. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but this time, there was nothing pleasant or amused about it. \u201cI may be one of the fallen, but I still retain my power over souls. I could have stopped her from moving on, if I\u2019d so desired. You should be grateful that I left you the chance to meet her again in another lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrateful? Grateful?\u201d</p><p>He tsked. \u201cEnough with the dramatics, Risa. It is time to concentrate on things we can still do something about. Like retrieving the key.\u201d</p><p>Amaya, I hope you\u2019re going to get that fucking wall down soon.</p><p>Trying, she growled. Patience must.</p><p>Coming from my sword, that was almost amusing. I rolled my shoulders, trying to ease the tension. It didn\u2019t do much, but I suspected little would. Not until the Aedh in front of me was in bits all over the floor.</p><p>\u201cSo are you intending to enlighten me on who stole the damn thing? Because it\u2019s very obvious you know them and are maybe even working with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking is not quite the right term to use,\u201d he replied. \u201cLet\u2019s just say we have a somewhat fluid agreement.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cMeaning you\u2019re both doing your utmost to stab the other in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does add a degree of excitement to the proceedings,\u201d he said, voice droll. \u201cMuch like fucking you, really.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cOnly in that you\u2019re betraying us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd fucking you both.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cThe person who took the key was a man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? As I have said before, it is pleasure that matters, not source.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re fooling around with two dark sorcerers?\u201d I asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he replied. \u201cPerhaps not. I am hardly likely to give you such information, my dear, when I still need cards to play if I am to survive this encounter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we both know you\u2019re not going to survive; otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have been such a busy little beaver trying to impregnate any woman you could get your grubby little paws on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was merely a precaution.\u201d He glanced at his watch, and I suddenly remembered Ilianna.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck! Had she been rescued, or had the whole thing gone ass up?</p><p>\u201cA precaution?\u201d I bit back, relief filling me when he didn\u2019t immediately dig out his phone. We obviously still had some time left before he needed to make his next call. \u201cAnother lie. Aedh breed only when their death is imminent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs your father only bred?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cLike him, I have a few years left before I am forced to leave this world permanently.\u201d</p><p>Amaya\u2019s steel was getting heavier in my hand, her hissing more strident in my mind. I hoped that meant the wall was weakening rather than her.</p><p>\u201cIs the person who stole all the weapons out of that display case,\u201d I growled, \u201cthe same person who stole the first key?\u201d</p><p>He considered me for a moment, expression a mix of amusement and condescension. \u201cIt was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is that person a dark sorcerer who is also a shape-shifter?\u201d</p><p>God, it felt like we were playing twenty questions. But this wasn\u2019t a game, and I had to get as much information out of him as I could while I was still trapped, because there wasn\u2019t going to be any talking once I was free. Not by me, anyway.</p><p>Amaya, on the other hand, was a whole different story.</p><p>\u201cI believe that might also be correct.\u201d The amusement got stronger. \u201cYou will never guess their identity, Risa, but you are most welcome to try for as long as you like. However, it will not get us that key back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it even possible to get the key back, given what happened to the first one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe difference that time and this,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it wasn\u2019t only the key stolen, but rather a whole bunch of weapons in which the key is just one. Our thief has not the capability to find it himself and will need our help.\u201d</p><p>Relief slipped through me. We may have momentarily lost the key, but it still was within the realms of possibility that it could be retrieved. That was something, at least.</p><p>\u201cOur help, or yours? You can sense the key when you\u2019re close, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I need you to pin down its location. Which is why I suggest an agreement would be in order\u2014\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cThe only agreement you\u2019re going to get from me is one at the end of a sword.\u201d</p><p>He tsked again. \u201cNow, let\u2019s not forget Ilianna here. I would hate to have to kill her after all the effort I\u2019ve put into snatching and seeding her.\u201d</p><p>Amaya\u2014</p><p>Close, she growled. Close.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of agreement?\u201d I spat. \u201cAnd why the hell would you even expect me to believe you\u2019d actually uphold your end of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect trust,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do expect that you\u2019ll remember I hold your friend\u2019s life in my hands and that you\u2019ll control not only your own need to kill me, but that of your reaper\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn exchange for what?\u201d I spat.</p><p>\u201cIn exchange for the key, of course. What else matters?\u201d</p><p>Indeed, what else did? For him, my father, the Raziq, and even Azriel, there was nothing else. And if Lucian thought I could control the actions of any of them, then he was seriously insane.</p><p>\u201cI can speak only for myself and Azriel, but we both know there are other players in the mix who want the key just as much as you.\u201d</p><p>Ready soon, Amaya said.</p><p>Anger\u2014and the need to kill, to rent and tear\u2014surged, and I could almost taste his death on my tongue. And I knew that this time, it wasn\u2019t Amaya\u2019s need, but my own. I wanted his blood on my hands, wanted to feel his life slipping away, wanted to watch the realization of defeat dawn in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWith the keys in my possession, neither your father nor the Raziq will be a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they will not move against me until they are sure of the keys\u2019 location.\u201d</p><p>I pushed to my feet but made no other move to give away my readiness to react the minute I got the all clear from both Amaya and Uncle Quinn. God, please, let him contact me soon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overconfident, Lucian, and that\u2019s never a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have lived many lives in this world in that state, and I have always surpassed my own expectations.\u201d He glanced at his watch again. \u201cAnd now, I believe, a phone call is required.\u201d</p><p>Amaya!</p><p>Through, she screamed back. Attack!</p><p>At the same time, Uncle Quinn\u2019s lilting tones said, We have her. She\u2019s safe and well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Lucian dug his phone out of his pocket, I launched myself. There was a brief flare of magic, a moment of resistance, and then I was free and running. He looked up and swore, the phone smashing to the stone floor as he brought his sword up. Steel clashed with steel, and Amaya screamed, the sound one of fury.</p><p>Magic, she screamed. Burns.</p><p>I guess it was no surprise that Lucian had a weapon prepared against Amaya, given he was well aware I never went anywhere without her.</p><p>I pivoted and lashed out with a booted foot, hitting him square in the chest and forcing him backward. He laughed\u2014laughed!\u2014then brought the long knife down. I jumped back but not fast enough, and the knife slashed through my boot and into flesh. The warmth of blood began to flood my boot, but I ignored it, ducked under another blow, then thrust upward with Amaya. He twisted out of her way, but not fast enough, and her sharp steel skated along his ribs, instantly drawing blood.</p> <p>More, she screamed, her noise within my head and without.</p><p>Lucian\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cIt talks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I bit back, \u201cand she\u2019s eager to drink in your death.\u201d</p><p>He avoided another blow, then lashed out with a clenched fist. I ducked but not fast enough. It skimmed my chin and rattled teeth, and I almost missed his follow-up. I jumped over the sweep of his legs, then raised my sword and brought her down hard. He twisted, so rather than splitting his head open as I\u2019d intended, it hit his shoulder. A shudder ran through her steel; then blood sprayed and his arm was swinging uselessly from the few remaining bits of flesh and tendons that Amaya hadn\u2019t severed.</p><p>And just like that, all his amusement was gone.</p> <p>What remained was anger. Anger that was deep and dark and utterly, utterly inhuman.</p><p>\u201cFor that, you will wish you were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me,\u201d I retorted. \u201cYou can\u2019t find the fucking keys without me, remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I would kill you,\u201d he replied softly. \u201cI merely said you will wish for it.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he attacked, a whirlwind of power and speed and sheer, bloody force. I weaved and dodged and blocked, using every skill, every instinct. Amaya was a blur in my hands, her flames sparking off every stone and her fury stinging the air itself.</p><p>But as fast as I was, as fast as she was, he was faster. He was also bigger and heavier, and his reach was twice that of mine.</p> <p>It was inevitable that some of his blows would get through my defenses; one slashed my hip, another my thigh, but I was still upright, still mobile, after several minutes of heavy fighting. And he was hampered by his useless left arm and was now bleeding from wounds on his chest and legs. It enraged him further, as I\u2019d hoped it would. I needed him reacting, not thinking. It was only through blind rage\u2014his, not mine\u2014that I truly had any hope of winning.</p><p>He came at me again, a blurring mass of muscle and sheer bloody anger. I spun and kicked. Lucian sucked in his gut, and my blow missed. Not so his knife. It sliced across my foot and sheared the end off my boot. Only quick reactions on my part stopped my toes from joining it on the stone. But it was the same foot that had previously encountered his blade, and without the boot to restrict it, blood began to flow more readily and pain surged.</p><p>I jumped back, limping now.</p><p>He laughed, the sound a weird mix of anger and amusement. \u201cThe first of many, dear Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re enjoying yourself, Lucian,\u201d I said, catching the edge of his blade with Amaya, holding it still as her flames leapt from her steel to his and she screamed blue murder. Nothing happened. The knife didn\u2019t melt. Amaya\u2019s flames died even as I added, \u201cBecause as an aunt of mine has been known to say, a condemned man should always enjoy his last meal.\u201d</p><p>He merely laughed and attacked. Again and again. I dodged, attacking him when opportunities arose, taking more and more hits but unable to find a way through his defenses. In the end, I knew there was only one way I was going to get the upper hand.</p><p>Do what must, Amaya said.</p><p>Do what must, I repeated grimly, then lowered her steel and stepped into his next blow. His blade punched into the middle of my stomach and right out the other side. As his fist came to a rest against my skin, I swung Amaya low and hard. Her blade reverberated as she hit flesh, but then she was cutting, sawing, burning her way through his legs. He barely had time to open his mouth when he dropped, dragging his long knife from my stomach as his body went one way and his legs the other.</p> <p>I swung Amaya again, removed his good arm, then dropped to my knees and pressed one hand over my stomach, vainly trying to stop the flow of blood and gore as I stared at the man I had all but beaten.</p><p>His expression was one of utter amazement. There was no pain, no sense of loss, just sheer disbelief I\u2019d done what I\u2019d done.</p><p>Kill! Amaya screamed. Finish!</p><p>Not you. Me.</p><p>And with that, I released her, and with my now free hand, I dragged myself forward.</p><p>\u201cYou killed my mother,\u201d I said softly. \u201cYou raped my friend; you worked with a dark sorceress to steal the keys and threatened the safety of this world. You betrayed me in more ways imaginable, and for all those crimes, you must die.\u201d</p><p>And with that, I dredged up the last of my reserves, called to the Aedh, and forced it into my arm. Then I shoved my fist into his chest and blew him apart.</p><p>Just has he\u2019d blown my mother apart.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>It was over. I\u2019d done what I\u2019d sworn to do\u2014found my mother\u2019s killer and dealt with him. Without help, on my own.</p><p>There should have been a sense of victory. Should have been a sense of relief. There wasn\u2019t.</p><p>There was only an odd numbness.</p><p>It was almost as if I\u2019d given all there was to give and there was nothing\u2014absolutely nothing\u2014left inside of me. I raised my re-formed, bloody hand and, as if from a great distance, watched the bits of flesh and blood dribble toward my elbow.</p><p>Then, without warning, my stomach heaved and I threw up. The pain hit seconds later, and I was shaking and crying and wanting nothing more than to just let it all go. The pain, the horror, the guilt, and the expectations of others, just let it all wash away and become someone else\u2019s problem.</p><p>Can\u2019t, Amaya said sharply. Finished not.</p><p>Isn\u2019t it? I wondered. I closed my eyes and fought the wash of weakness in my body, and yet I could not deny the allure of ending it all here and now. Why not let fate take whatever course she\u2019d decided to take and no longer fight it?</p><p>Everyone would be better off without me. Everyone. No one could hold them hostage against my behavior; no one could kidnap and rape them, and\u2014perhaps best of all\u2014there would be no one to find the remaining keys and threaten the very safety of the world.</p><p>That alone was worth one life.</p><p>That alone was certainly worth my life.</p><p>Everyone not safe, Amaya said. I not. The life within not.</p><p>A life that might well be Lucian\u2019s. God, he\u2019d murdered my mother\u2014how on earth was I to survive looking at his child every day and being reminded of his deed? How was that fair to the child? Or to me?</p><p>I couldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>The death I\u2019d seen so long ago wasn\u2019t the truth. I wasn\u2019t going to die in an automotive accident. I was going to die here, underground, all alone except for a nagging sword.</p><p>My arms collapsed underneath me, and I fell face-first onto the stone. For several minutes I simply lay there, my breathing becoming more and more labored and my life leaking out through various wounds in not-so-slow rivers.</p><p>And wondered, just for an instant, where Azriel was.</p><p>Magic, Amaya spat. Stops.</p><p>It was a shame. I wouldn\u2019t have minded seeing him just one more time . . .</p><p>No, Amaya screamed. Go not!</p><p>Must, I replied, the roar in my mind going stronger. It\u2019s too late.</p><p>Not! she bit back; then she was in my hand. Power exploded around us, through us, merging steel and flesh with equal ferocity. It was a storm that tore my core apart, fiber by fiber, then pieced me back together, all within a matter of heartbeats.</p><p>Then it was no longer me, but we.</p><p>Die not, she said with fierce determination. Live must.</p><p>And with that, she forced my limbs into action, and I found myself crawling, slowly, painfully, past all the bloody, broken remnants of flesh toward two standing stones I hadn\u2019t even realized existed. Only they weren\u2019t just standing stones, but ancient, cuneiform-marked ones. Another gateway.</p><p>She kept me crawling, even though every movement had more blood pouring out and the pain was so intense I could barely even breathe. Energy washed across my skin, fierce and dark, but something was wrong with my eyesight because I could no longer see the stones, let alone tell whether they were active.</p><p>Not go! Stay!</p><p>I can\u2019t\u2014</p><p>She wasn\u2019t listening. She never did, I guess. That surge of energy grew closer and closer even as my mind seemed to drift farther and farther away. It tore through me like a summer storm, sharp and electric, breaking me apart, then sweeping me away. I have no idea where it deposited me. I was no longer capable of caring.</p><p>My world was one of darkness and peace, and I smiled. Yes, I thought, I\u2019m ready.</p><p>And not even Amaya\u2019s howls of protest could stop me from stepping free of my soul.</p><p>Light flared all around me, light that was warm and golden and peaceful. The figure of a woman appeared, her face glowing and serene. I smiled, unsurprised that the image the reaper who\u2019d come to escort me onward had chosen to wear was the countenance of my mother. Of everyone I knew, she was the one person I trusted utterly.</p><p>Though Azriel had come pretty close.</p><p>As my thoughts turned to him, the light around me seemed to dim. No, I thought with determination. I was ready to move on.</p><p>The reaper wearing my mother\u2019s face smiled and offered me her hand. I hesitated and, just for a moment, thought of Tao and Ilianna, Riley and Quinn, Rhoan and his partner, Liander, and everyone else I was leaving behind. They would undoubtedly mourn my loss, but by my leaving, they could no longer be hurt by the madness that surrounded me.</p><p>And this was my chance, perhaps my only chance, to be with my mother again. I wanted that. More than anything, I wanted to see her, be with her, one more time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I closed my eyes briefly, took a deep breath, then stepped forward.</p><p>It was then that Azriel appeared and blocked my path to the reaper.</p><p>What on earth are you doing? The words seemed to echo across the golden light, and an odd hush fell around us.</p> <p>I\u2019m sorry, Risa, but this cannot happen.</p><p>It is my time\u2014</p><p>Yes, it is, but that does not mean I can let you go.</p><p>It is better for everyone\u2014</p><p>Not everyone, he said and with such ferocity the very world around us quivered under its force. Definitely not everyone.</p> <p>Then he reached out, grabbed my arm, and yanked me forward.</p><p>Not into death.</p><p>Into life.</p><p>I have no idea how long it took me to wake. I know I fought it for a very long time, desperate to snatch back what had been taken. Desperate to find that reaper again and move on, to be with my mother and far away from the pain and the hurt and the guilt and the never-ending expectations of others.</p><p>But that was an option that was not mine to take. Not now.</p><p>When I finally did open my eyes, it was to discover I wasn\u2019t alone. I guess that was no surprise. I did have people who cared for me, even if a tiny part of me actually resented that fact right now. If I\u2019d moved on, as fate had destined me to, then I would not once again be responsible for their safety.</p> <p>You are not responsible for our safety, Risa. We are more than capable of taking care of ourselves.</p><p>The voice wasn\u2019t Azriel\u2019s. It was Aunt Riley\u2019s.</p><p>I turned my head and looked at her. She was standing at the end of my hospital bed, her arms crossed and her expression severe. \u201cYou, my girl, will stop wishing yourself dead and start celebrating the fact you were given a second chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t given anything,\u201d I retorted. \u201cIt was forced onto me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning away, however you intended to do it, is never the answer\u2014trust me on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have been a hell of a lot easier than remaining here and being forced\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut the words off before I could reveal a little too much, and she narrowed her eyes. \u201cBeing forced to do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bidding of the fucking Raziq and my father and god knows who else. Ilianna was kidnapped because of me. Tao fights for control of his own body because of me. My mother is dead because of me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She sucked in her breath. \u201cHow did Dia get into this?\u201d</p><p>Tears stung my eyes, and all that anger suddenly just washed away. \u201cIt was Lucian who killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell and truly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She moved up the side of the bed, then sat and gathered my hand in hers. \u201cI know it feels right now that death would be the easier option, but trust me, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the keys\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can sort out the key problem together,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you cannot allow yourself to fall into the trap of death. There are those in this world who can recall spirits and force them to do their bidding. What makes you think they will not do that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they need me in flesh form to find\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ve told you,\u201d she cut in, \u201cbut are you certain it\u2019s the truth?\u201d</p><p>No, I wasn\u2019t. I took a deep, shuddering breath and released it slowly. \u201cLife,\u201d I said softly, \u201csucks.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and bent over to drop a kiss on my forehead. \u201cYeah, it often does. But I\u2019m so glad you decided to stay with us. I couldn\u2019t bear to lose you so soon after losing your mother.\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d wanted me in tears, then she\u2019d damn well succeeded. She smiled and brushed them away with a gentle finger. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud of you if you were one of my own. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I knew. In her eyes, she\u2019d always had six children, not five. Dia might have given birth to me, but Riley had nevertheless adopted me. And I loved her almost as much as I loved my own mother. Which was why I couldn\u2019t let\u2014</p><p>She pressed her fingers against my lips. \u201cEnough with the self-sacrificing behavior. You can and will have our help, whether you like it or not. Now,\u201d she added, brisk and businesslike, \u201cIlianna is waiting out in the hall, desperate to see you, but she\u2019s under strict orders from the nurses and from me not to be more than a few minutes. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She went out. Two seconds later, Ilianna appeared. I smiled, utterly relieved to see her safe and sound, but there was tension in me, too. I was ultimately responsible for what had happened to her, after all.</p><p>But when my gaze rose to hers, all I saw was complete and utter acceptance of all that had happened. There was no hate, no bitterness, not even regret or reproach. Just acceptance.</p><p>And I found myself wishing I could find even half of her serenity. Those damn tears welled again. \u201cGod, Ilianna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRis, it\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cThis event was foretold a long time ago, and even though I had thought it would be Carwyn\u2019s child I\u2019d bear, I can\u2019t regret what happened. Not knowing what I do of her fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he forced you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe used magic, yes, and it wasn\u2019t pleasant, but neither was it life-ending. I hate him, but I can\u2019t hate the result.\u201d</p><p>Which made me all the more ashamed, because I could. I didn\u2019t want to bear Lucian\u2019s child. No ifs, buts, or maybes.</p><p>But could I abort the child? Could I do that, when there was also a slim chance that the child was Azriel\u2019s?</p><p>That was a question I just couldn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I caught Ilianna\u2019s hand and squeezed it lightly. \u201cWhere\u2019s Tao? And Carwyn? Last time I saw them, they were both all fired up to ride to your rescue.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWell, right now they\u2019re both more than a little pissed at missing all the action. I believe Carwyn had pictured himself coming to my rescue and sweeping me off my feet in the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have no doubt about that.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cDoes he know what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But I\u2019ll tell him soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will that affect things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t. He\u2019s after the merger with my family more than just me.\u201d She shrugged, expression unconcerned. But then, it wasn\u2019t like it was a love match. She had that in Mirri. \u201cStallions never take kindly to the offspring of others, but he won\u2019t hurt the child, and she\u2019ll be allowed to remain in his herd until grown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s everything. At least everything that matters.\u201d She smiled. \u201cTao said he\u2019d visit tonight, seeing your aunt is adamant you get no more than one visitor at a time, lest it weaken you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can be rather fierce about these things,\u201d I said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cToo right she can,\u201d the woman in question said. \u201cIlianna, time\u2019s up. You can visit her tomorrow. Right now, she needs to rest.\u201d</p><p>Ilianna dropped a kiss on my cheek, then, with a promise to be back, left.</p><p>And that, basically, was the pattern of the next four days. Visitors in between bouts of resting, but no sign of the one person I really wanted to see.</p><p>Azriel.</p><p>It was deliberate on his part; of that I had no doubt. He\u2019d crossed a line, with me and with death, and there would be a price to pay. Whether by me, or by him, or by us both, I had no idea.</p><p>On the fifth day, the doctors declared my werewolf heritage had worked another goddamn miracle and that I was fit enough to go home. That was music to my ears.</p><p>I rang Ilianna and arranged for her to pick me up, then climbed out of bed and took a shower. I was clean, dressed, and ready to get the hell away from the hospital and the awareness of death that continuously washed over me, thanks to the presence of the sick and the dying, when a different kind of awareness hit.</p><p>Azriel had finally decided to show up.</p><p>He appeared on the other side of the room, his arms crossed and his stance easy. And, as usual, his expression gave nothing away. He was holding his emotions\u2014and his thoughts\u2014very much in check.</p><p>I studied him for a moment, then said, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I did,\u201d he replied, voice even. \u201cI made you live.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cOkay, let me rephrase that. How did you do that?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cBy leashing our energy beings together.\u201d</p><p>Fear curled through me. A fear unlike anything I\u2019d ever experienced before. \u201cYou leashed our beings? As in, forever bound together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you die, I die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I die, you take my place.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. Did that mean . . . ? \u201cNo, that\u2019s not possible. I\u2019m a flesh-and-blood being. I can never be what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never just flesh and blood, Risa. You were born half Aedh and became more so after what Marin did. When I snatched you from fate\u2019s pathway, I altered not only your destiny, but your very being.\u201d</p><p>No, no, no! How was something like that possible? How could I be born one thing and be made, on death, into another?</p><p>\u201cWhat if I die? What if I decide to kill myself rather than become something I never wanted to be?\u201d</p><p>Something flickered through his eyes. Anger, fear, hurt. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure. \u201cYou would not kill yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if I did?\u201d I all but shouted.</p><p>\u201cThen you would still become what I am\u2014a dark angel.\u201d</p><p>I just stared at him. I couldn\u2019t do anything else. I was stunned. Broken. Betrayed. Again.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Azriel, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mission. The key.\u201d I swung away, not wanting to look at him, not wanting him to see the hurt. It was always the damn key. Always about the damn mission.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the damn mission or the key!\u201d The sharp denial was accompanied by an explosion of anger that rolled my senses and just about fried my mind. \u201cAnd if you\u2019d listen to your heart and your body, you\u2019d know it!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I closed my eyes. Listen to my body, he said. Which implied he knew not only that I was pregnant but that the child was his.</p><p>So he\u2019d saved what was rare and precious in his world. Not me. Never me.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Risa, that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d I cut in and scrubbed a hand across suddenly aching eyes. I wouldn\u2019t cry. I wouldn\u2019t. \u201cI listened to my heart, Azriel. I let you in. And you repaid that trust by taking away everything from me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took my future, Azriel! When I die, I won\u2019t move on. I won\u2019t be reborn.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t ever meet Mom again. \u201cHow can you stand there and say you haven\u2019t taken everything away?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything. Didn\u2019t deny anything.</p><p>I closed my eyes and leaned my forehead against the windowpane. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore, Azriel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>Just for a moment, I swear there was fear in his voice. But that had to be imagination. Reapers didn\u2019t do fear. Didn\u2019t do emotions. Not the way I wanted emotions, anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou. Me. I can\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t want you near me. I don\u2019t want you in my life. I don\u2019t want you following me around anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisa, that\u2019s not possible without\u2014\u201d</p><p>I swung around, my fists clenched against the sudden explosion of anger. \u201cI don\u2019t care what is or isn\u2019t possible. I just want you out of my life!\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for several minutes, his expression stony. Not even Valdis was emoting. \u201cIf you take this step, if you force me to go, I may not be allowed to come back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I should be sad about that?\u201d I spit out. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not like you won\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Not with the chi link\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat link was cut when you stepped onto death\u2019s plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you still able to read all my thoughts and emotions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I can, Risa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d I said, my voice rising again. \u201cIf I knew, I wouldn\u2019t be asking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d he said, bitterness edging his tones.</p><p>Leaving me none the wiser. But then, nothing was ever easy, nothing was ever straight, when it came to my reaper.</p><p>\u201cNo more, Azriel. I just\u2014\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He made a short, sharp motion with his hand. \u201cSo be it, then.\u201d</p><p>He winked out of sight, and I closed my eyes against the instinctive need to call him back and tell him I didn\u2019t mean it, that it was just anger and fear talking.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Because it wasn\u2019t. Not entirely.</p><p>One thing, he said, his mind voice cool and distant as it flowed through my thoughts. Rephael.</p><p>What?</p><p>It is my name. If you ever need me, for whatever reason, say it. Wherever I am, whatever I am doing, I will hear.</p><p>And with that, he was gone, leaving me wondering if I\u2019d just made the biggest goddamn mistake of my entire life.</p><p>Fuck it, no!</p><p>I would stand on my own feet and get on with whatever life I had left. I would sort out the mess that was the keys and Hunter and the Raziq the best I could, and I would goddamn survive in the process.</p><p>But the very first thing I needed to do was get drunk. Absolutely, mind-numbingly drunk.</p><p>Because before I could do anything else, the first thing I needed to do was forget.</p><p>If only for a day or so. </p> </body></html>"]
