His clothes were chain mail and boiled leather, his thoughts were strategy and conflict, and at night he dreamed of the screams of his enemies and in his sleep he smiled...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>APRIL 1741</p> <p>LONDON, ENGLAND</p><p>As the mother of a seven-year-old boy, Lily Stump was used to odd topics of conversation. There was the debate on whether fish wore clothes. The deep and insightful discussion over where sugared plums came from and the subsequent lecture on why little boys were not allowed to break their fast with them every day. And, of course, the infamous controversy of Why Dogs Bark But Cats Do Not.</p><p>So truly it wasn\u2019t Lily\u2019s fault that she did not pay heed to her son\u2019s announcement at luncheon that there was a monster in the garden.</p><p>\u201cIndio,\u201d Lily said with only a tiny bit of exasperation, \u201cmust you wipe your jammy fingers on Daffodil? I can\u2019t think she likes it.\u201d</p><p>Sadly, this was a blatant lie. Daffodil, a very young and very silly red Italian greyhound with a white blaze on her chest, was already happily twisting her slim body in a circle in order to lick the sticky patch on her back.</p> <p>\u201cMama,\u201d Indio said with great patience as he put down his bread and jam, \u201cdidn\u2019t you hear me? There\u2019s a monster in the garden.\u201d He was kneeling on his chair and now he leaned forward over the table to emphasize his words, a lock of his dark, curly hair falling into his right, blue, eye. Indio\u2019s other eye was green, which some found disconcerting, although Lily had long ago grown used to the disparity.</p><p>\u201cDid he have horns?\u201d the third member of their little family asked very seriously.</p><p>\u201cMaude!\u201d Lily hissed.</p><p>Maude Ellis plonked a plate of cheese down on their only-slightly-singed table and set her hands on her skinny hips. Maude had seen five decades and despite her tiny stature\u2014she only just came to Lily\u2019s shoulder\u2014she never shied away from speaking her mind. \u201cWell, and mightn\u2019t it be the Devil he saw?\u201d</p><p>Lily narrowed her eyes in warning\u2014Indio was prone to rather alarming nightmares and this conversation didn\u2019t seem the best idea. \u201cIndio did not see the Devil\u2014or a monster, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Indio said. \u201cBut he hasn\u2019t horns. He has shoulders as big as this.\u201d And he demonstrated by throwing his arms as far apart as he could, nearly knocking his bowl of carrot soup to the floor in the process.</p> <p>Lily caught the bowl deftly\u2014much to the disappointment of Daffodil. \u201cDo eat your soup, please, Indio, before it ends on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tisn\u2019t a dunnie, then,\u201d Maude said decisively as she took her own chair. \u201cQuite small they are, \u2019cepting when they turn to a horse. Did it turn to a horse, deary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Maude.\u201d Indio shoved a big spoonful of soup into his mouth and then regrettably continued talking. \u201cHe looks like a man, but bigger and scarier. His hands are as big as... as...\u201d Indio\u2019s little brows drew together as he tried to think of an appropriate simile.</p><p>\u201cYour head,\u201d Lily supplied helpfully. \u201cA tricorn hat. A leg of lamb. Daffodil.\u201d</p><p>Daffodil barked at her name and spun in a happy circle.</p><p>\u201cWas he dripping wet or all over green?\u201d Maude demanded.</p><p>Lily sighed and watched as Indio attempted to describe his monster and Maude attempted to identify it from her long list of fairies, hobgoblins, and imaginary beasts. Maude had grown up in the north of England and apparently spent her formative years memorizing the most ghastly folktales. Lily herself had heard these stories from Maude when she was young\u2014resulting in quite a few torturous nights. She was endeavoring\u2014mostly without success\u2014to keep Maude from imparting the same stories to Indio.</p><p>Her gaze drifted around the rather decrepit room they\u2019d moved into just yesterday afternoon. A small fireplace was on one charred wall. Maude\u2019s bed and her chest were pushed against another. Their table and four chairs were in the middle of the room. A tiny writing table and a rickety dark-plum settee were near the hearth. To the side, a door led into a small room\u2014a former dressing room\u2014where Lily had her own bed and Indio his cot. These two rooms were all that remained of the backstage in what had once been a grand theater at Harte\u2019s Folly. The theater\u2014and indeed the entire pleasure garden\u2014had burned down the autumn before. The stink of smoke still lingered about the place like a ghost, though the majority of the wreckage had been hauled away.</p> <p>Lily shivered. Perhaps the gloominess of the place was making Indio imagine monsters.</p><p>Indio swallowed a big bite of his bread and jam. \u201cHe has shaggy hair and he lives in the garden. Daff\u2019s seen him, too.\u201d</p><p>Both Lily and Maude glanced at the little greyhound. Daffodil was sitting by Indio\u2019s chair, chewing on a back paw. As they watched she overbalanced and rolled onto her back.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps Daffodil ate something that disagreed with her tummy,\u201d Lily said diplomatically, \u201cand the tummy ache made her think she\u2019d seen a monster. I haven\u2019t seen a monster in the garden and neither has Maude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there were that wherryman with the big nose, hanging about the dock suspicious-like yesterday,\u201d Maude muttered. Lily shot her a look and Maude hastily added, \u201cEr, but no, never seen a real monster. Just wherrymen with big noses.\u201d</p><p>Indio considered that bit of information. \u201cMy monster has a big nose.\u201d His mismatched eyes widened as he looked up excitedly. \u201cAnd a hook. Per\u2019aps he cuts children into little bits with his hook and eats them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndio!\u201d Lily exclaimed. \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mama\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Now why don\u2019t we discuss fish clothing or... or how to teach Daffodil to sit up and beg?\u201d</p><p>Indio sighed gustily. \u201cYes, Mama.\u201d He slumped, the very picture of dejection, and Lily couldn\u2019t help but think that he\u2019d someday make a fine dramatic actor. She darted a pleading glance at Maude.</p><p>But Maude only shook her head and bent to her own soup.</p><p>Lily cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m sure Daffodil would benefit from training,\u201d she said a little desperately.</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d Indio swallowed the last spoonful of his soup and clutched his bread in his hand. He looked at Lily with big eyes. \u201cMay I leave the table, please, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, very well.\u201d</p><p>In a flurry he tumbled from his chair and ran toward the door. Daffodil scampered behind him, barking.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go near the pond!\u201d Lily called.</p><p>The door to the garden banged shut.</p><p>Lily winced and looked at the older woman. \u201cThat didn\u2019t go well, did it?\u201d</p><p>Maude shrugged. \u201cMayhap could\u2019ve been better, but the lad is a sensitive one, he is. So were you at that age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I?\u201d</p><p>Maude had been her nursemaid\u2014and rather more, truth be told. She might be superstitious, but Lily trusted Maude implicitly when it came to the rearing of children. And a good thing, too, since she\u2019d been left to raise Indio alone. \u201cShould I go after him, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, in a bit. No point now. Give him a fair while to calm himself.\u201d Maude jerked her pointed chin at Lily\u2019s bowl. \u201cBest get that inside you, hinney.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Lily\u2019s mouth curled at the old endearment. \u201cI wish I could\u2019ve found us somewhere else to stay. Somewhere not so...\u201d She hesitated, loath to give the ruined pleasure garden\u2019s atmosphere a name.</p><p>\u201cUncanny,\u201d Maude said promptly, having no such trouble herself. \u201cAll them burnt trees and falling-down buildings and not a soul about for miles in the nights. I place a wee bag of garlic and sage under my pillow every evening, I do, and you ought as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Lily murmured noncommittally. She wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to wake up to the reek of garlic and sage. \u201cAt least the workmen are about during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a right scruffy bunch, the lot of them,\u201d Maude said stoutly. \u201cDon\u2019t know where Mr. Harte got these so-called gardeners, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he found them in the street. Or worse\u201d\u2014she leaned forward to whisper hoarsely\u2014\u201cgot them off a ship from Ireland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Maude,\u201d Lily chided gently. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you have this dislike of the Irish\u2014they\u2019re just looking for work like anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Maude snorted as she vigorously buttered a slice of bread.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Lily said hastily, \u201cwe\u2019re only here until Mr. Harte produces a new play with a part for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where would he be doing that?\u201d Maude asked, glancing at the charred beams over their heads. \u201cHe\u2019ll need a new theater first, and a garden to put it in afore that. It\u2019ll be at least a year\u2014more, most like.\u201d</p><p>Lily winced and opened her mouth, but Maude had gotten the bit between her teeth. She shook her piece of bread at Lily, showering crumbs on the table. \u201cNever trusted that man, not me. Too charming and chatty by half. Mr. Harte could sweet-talk a bird down from a tree, into the palm of his hand, and right into the oven, he could. Or\u201d\u2014she slapped a last daub of butter on the bread\u2014\u201ctalk an actress with all of London at her feet to come play in his theater\u2014and only his theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to be fair, Mr. Harte wasn\u2019t to know his pleasure garden and the theater would burn to the ground at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, but he did know it\u2019d put Mr. Sherwood\u2019s back up.\u201d Maude bit into her bread for emphasis.</p><p>Lily wrinkled her nose at the memory. Mr. Sherwood, the proprietor of the King\u2019s Theatre and her former employer, was a rather vindictive man. He\u2019d promised Lily that he\u2019d make sure she\u2019d not find work anywhere else in London if she went with Mr. Harte and his offer of twice the salary Mr. Sherwood had been paying her.</p><p>That hadn\u2019t been a problem until Harte\u2019s Folly had burned, at which point Lily had found that Mr. Sherwood had made good on his promise: all the other theaters in London refused to let her play for them.</p><p>Now, after being out of work for over six months, she\u2019d gone through what few savings she\u2019d had, forcing her little family to vacate their stylish rented rooms.</p><p>\u201cAt least Mr. Harte let us stay here free of charge?\u201d Lily offered rather feebly.</p><p>Fortunately, Maude\u2019s reply was nonverbal since she\u2019d just taken a bite of the soup.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I really ought to go after Indio,\u201d Lily said, rising.</p><p>\u201cAnd what of your luncheon, then?\u201d Maude demanded, nodding at Lily\u2019s half-finished soup.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have it later.\u201d Lily bit her lip. \u201cI hate it when he\u2019s upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou coddle the boy,\u201d Maude sniffed, but Lily noticed the older woman didn\u2019t make any further protest.</p><p>Lily hid a smile. If anyone coddled Indio it was Maude herself. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201d</p><p>Maude waved a hand as Lily turned to the door to the outside. The door screeched horribly as she pulled it open. One of the hinges was cracked from the heat of the fire and it hung askew. Outside, the day was overcast. Deep-gray clouds promised more rain and the wind whipped across the blackened ground. Lily shivered and wrapped her arms around herself. She should\u2019ve brought her shawl.</p><p>\u201cIndio!\u201d Her shout was thinned by the wind.</p><p>Helplessly she looked around. What had once been an elegant pleasure garden had been reduced to sooty mud by the fire and the spring rains. The hedges that had outlined graveled walks were burnt and mostly dead, meandering away into the distance. To the left were the remains of the stone courtyard and boxes where musicians had played for guests: a line of broken pillars, supporting nothing but sky. To the right a copse of straggling trees stood with a bit of mirrored water peeking out from behind\u2014what was left of an ornamental pond, now clogged with silt. Here and there green poked out among the gray and black, but she had to admit that, especially on an overcast day like this one, with wisps of fog slinking along the ground, the garden was ominous and rather frightening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lily grimaced. She should\u2019ve never let Indio out to play by himself, but it was hard to keep an active young boy inside. She started down one of the paths, slipping a bit in the mud, wishing she\u2019d stopped to put on her pattens before coming outside. If she didn\u2019t see her son soon, she\u2019d ruin the frivolous embroidered slippers on her feet.</p><p>\u201cIndio!\u201d</p><p>She rounded what once had been a small thicket of trimmed trees. Now the blackened branches rattled in the wind. \u201cIndio!\u201d</p><p>A grunt came from the thicket.</p> <p>Lily stopped dead.</p><p>There it was again\u2014almost an explosive snort. The noise was too loud, too deep for Indio. It almost sounded like... a big animal.</p><p>She glanced quickly around, but she was completely alone. Should she return to the ruined theater for Maude? But Indio was out here!</p><p>Another grunt, this one louder. A rustle.</p><p>Something was breathing heavily in the bushes.</p> <p>Good Lord. Lily bunched her skirts in her fists in case she had to leg it, and crept forward.</p><p>A groan and a low, rumbling sound.</p><p>Like growling.</p><p>She gulped and peeked around a burned trunk.</p><p>At first what she saw looked like an enormous, moving, mud-covered mound, and then it straightened, revealing an endlessly broad back, huge shoulders, and a shaggy head.</p><p>Lily couldn\u2019t help it. She made a noise that was perilously close to a squeak.</p> <p>The thing whirled\u2014much faster than anything that big had a right to move\u2014and a horrible, soot-stained face glared at her, one paw raised as if to strike her.</p><p>In it was a wickedly sharp, hooked knife.</p><p>Lily gulped. If she lived through the day she was going to have to apologize to Indio.</p><p>For there was a monster in the garden.</p><p>THE DAY HADN\u2019T been going well to begin with, reflected Apollo Greaves, Viscount Kilbourne.</p><p>At a rough estimate, fully half the woody plantings in the pleasure garden were dead\u2014and another quarter might as well be. The ornamental pond\u2019s freshwater source had been blocked by the fire\u2019s debris and now it sat stagnant. The gardeners Asa had hired for him were an unskilled lot. To top it off, the spring rains had turned what remained of Harte\u2019s Folly into a muddy morass, making planting and earth moving impossible until the ground dried out.</p><p>And now there was a strange female in his garden.</p><p>Apollo stared into huge lichen-green eyes lined with lashes so dark and thick that they looked like smudged soot. The woman\u2014girl? She wasn\u2019t that tall, but a swift glance at her bodice assured him she was quite mature, thank you\u2014was only a slim bit of a thing, dressed foolishly in a green velvet gown, richly over-embroidered in red and gold. She hadn\u2019t even a bonnet on. Her dark hair slipped from a messy knot at the back of her neck, waving strands blowing against her pinkened cheeks. Actually, she was rather pretty in a gamine sort of way.</p> <p>But that was beside the point.</p><p>Where in hell had she come from? As far as he knew, the only other people in the ruined pleasure garden were the brace of so-called gardeners presently working on the hedges behind the pond. He\u2019d been taking out his frustration alone on the dead tree stump, trying to uproot the thing by hand since their only dray horse was at work with the other men, when he\u2019d heard a feminine voice calling and she\u2019d suddenly appeared.</p><p>The woman blinked and her gaze darted to his upraised arm.</p><p>Apollo\u2019s own eyes followed and he winced. He\u2019d instinctively raised his hand as he turned to her, and the pruning knife he held might be construed as threatening.</p><p>Hastily he lowered his arm. Which left him standing in his mud-stained shirt and waistcoat, sweaty and stinking, and feeling like a dumb ox next to her delicate femininity.</p><p>But apparently his action reassured her. She drew herself up\u2014not that it made much difference to her height. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Well, he\u2019d like to ask the same of her but, alas, he really couldn\u2019t, thanks to that last beating in Bedlam.</p><p>Belatedly he remembered that he was supposed to be a simple laborer. He tugged at a forelock and dropped his gaze\u2014to elegantly embroidered slippers caked in mud.</p><p>Who was this woman?</p><p>\u201cTell me now,\u201d she said rather imperiously, considering she was standing in three inches of mud. \u201cWho are you and what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her face\u2014eyebrows arched, a plush rose lower lip caught between her teeth\u2014and cast his eyes down again. He tapped his throat and shook his head. If she didn\u2019t get that message she was a lot stupider than she looked.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he heard as he stared at her shoes. \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d She had a husky voice, which gentled when he lowered his gaze. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter. You can\u2019t stay here, you must understand.\u201d</p><p>Unseen, he rolled his eyes. What was she on about? He worked in the garden\u2014surely she could see that. Who was she to order him out?</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d She drew the word out, enunciating it clearly, as if she thought him hard of hearing. Some thought that since he couldn\u2019t speak he couldn\u2019t hear, either. He caught himself beginning to scowl and smoothed out his features. \u201cCannot. Stay. Here.\u201d A pause, and then, muttered, \u201cOh, for goodness\u2019 sakes. I can\u2019t even tell if he understands. I cannot believe Mr. Harte allowed...\u201d</p><p>And it dawned on Apollo with a feeling of amused horror that his frustrating day had descended into the frankly ludicrous. This ridiculously clad woman thought him a lackwit.</p><p>One embroidered toe tapped in the mud. \u201cLook at me, please.\u201d</p><p>He raised his gaze slowly, careful to keep his face blank.</p><p>Her brows had drawn together over those big eyes, in an expression that no doubt she thought stern, but that was, in reality, rather adorable. Like a small girl chiding a kitten. A streak of anger surged through him. She shouldn\u2019t be out by herself in the ruined garden. If he\u2019d been another type of man\u2014a brutal man, like the ones who\u2019d run Bedlam\u2014her dignity, perhaps even her life, might\u2019ve been in danger. Didn\u2019t she have a husband, a brother, a father to keep her safe? Who was letting this slip of a woman wander into danger by herself?</p><p>He realized that her expression had gentled at his continued silence.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me, can you?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He\u2019d met pity in others since the loss of his voice. Usually it made him burn hot with rage and a sort of terrible despair\u2014after nine months he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever regain the use of his voice. But her inquiry didn\u2019t provoke his usual anger. Maybe it was her feminine charm\u2014it\u2019d been a while since any woman besides his sister had attempted to talk to him\u2014or maybe it was simply her. This woman spoke with compassion, not contempt, and that made all the difference.</p><p>He shook his head, watching her, keeping his face dull and unresponsive.</p><p>She sighed and hugged herself, looking around. \u201cWhat am I to do?\u201d she muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t leave Indio out here by himself.\u201d</p><p>Apollo struggled not to let surprise show on his face. Who or what was Indio?</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d she said forcefully, suddenly enough that he blinked. She pointed a commanding finger behind him.</p><p>Apollo fought back a grin. She wasn\u2019t giving up, was she? He slowly turned, looking in the direction she indicated, and then swiveled back even more slowly, letting his mouth hang half open.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Her little hands balled into fists as she cast her eyes heavenward. \u201cThis is maddening.\u201d</p><p>She took two swift steps forward and placed her palms against his chest, pushing.</p><p>He allowed himself to sway an inch backward with her thrust before righting himself. She stilled, staring up at him. The top of her head barely came to his mid-chest. He could feel the brush of her breath on his lips. The warmth of her hands seemed to burn through the rough fabric of his waistcoat. This close her green eyes were enormous, and he could see shards of gold surrounding her pupils.</p><p>Her lips parted and his gaze dropped to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>The hissed word made them both start.</p><p>Apollo swung around. A small boy was poised on the muddy path just outside the thicket. He had shoulder-length curly dark hair and wore a red coat and a fierce expression. Beside him was the silliest-looking dog Apollo had ever seen: a delicate little red greyhound, both ears flopped to the left, head erect on a narrow neck, pink tongue peeping from one side of its mouth. The dog\u2019s entire demeanor could be labeled startled.</p><p>The dog froze at Apollo\u2019s movement, then spun and raced off down the path.</p><p>The boy\u2019s face crumpled at the desertion before he squared his little shoulders and glared at Apollo. \u201cYou get away from her!\u201d</p><p>At last: her defender\u2014although Apollo had been hoping for someone a bit more imposing.</p><p>\u201cIndio.\u201d The woman stepped away from Apollo hastily, brushing her skirts. \u201cThere you are. I\u2019ve been calling for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mama.\u201d Apollo noticed the child didn\u2019t take his eyes from him\u2014an attitude he approved of. \u201cDaff an\u2019 me were \u2019sploring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, explore nearer the theater next time. I don\u2019t want you meeting anyone who might be...\u201d She trailed away, glancing nervously at Apollo. \u201cErm. Dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Apollo widened his eyes, trying to look harmless\u2014sadly, nearly impossible. He\u2019d hit six feet at age fifteen and topped that by several inches in the fourteen years since. Add to that the width of his shoulders, his massive hands, and a face that his sister had once affectionately compared to a gargoyle\u2019s, and trying to appear harmless became something of a lost cause.</p><p>His apprehension was borne out when the woman backed farther away from him and caught her young son\u2019s hand. \u201cCome. Let\u2019s go find where Daffodil has run off to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mama,\u201d the boy whispered loudly. \u201cWhat about the monster?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take a genius to understand that the child was referring to him. Apollo nearly sighed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry,\u201d the woman said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Mr. Harte as soon as I can about your monster. He\u2019ll be gone by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>With a last nervous glance at him, she turned and led the boy away.</p><p>Apollo narrowed his eyes on her retreating back, slim and confident. Green Eyes was going to be in for a shock when she found out which of the two of them was tossed from the garden.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The king had a great army and with it he marched across field and mountain, subjugating all the peoples he met until at last he came to an island that lay in an azure sea like a pearl in an oyster shell. This he conquered at once and, seeing how beautiful the island was, sent for his queen, and caused a golden castle to be built there for their home. But on the first night he slept in that place a black bull came to him in a dream...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>For a man who owned a pleasure garden, Asa Makepeace certainly didn\u2019t live in luxury\u2014if anything, he sailed perilously close to squalor.</p><p>Apollo finished climbing the three flights of rickety stairs to Makepeace\u2019s rented rooms the next morning. Makepeace lived in Southwark, which was on the south bank of the River Thames, not terribly far from Harte\u2019s Folly itself. The landing held two doors, one to the right, one to the left.</p><p>Apollo pounded on the right-hand door, then paused and placed his ear to it. He heard a faint rustling and then a groan. He reared back and thumped the wood again.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you mind?\u201d The left door popped open to reveal a shriveled elderly man, a soft red velvet cap on his head. \u201cSome like to sleep of a morning!\u201d</p><p>Apollo turned his shoulder, shielding his face behind his broad-brimmed hat, and waved an apologetic hand at the man.</p><p>The old man slammed his door shut just as Makepeace opened his own.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Makepeace stood in his doorway, swaying slightly as if in a breeze. \u201cWhat?\u201d His tawny hair stood out all around his head like a lion\u2019s mane\u2014assuming the lion had been in a recent cyclone\u2014and his shirt was unbuttoned, baring a heavily furred barrel chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least he was wearing breeches.</p><p>Apollo pushed past his friend into the room\u2014although not far. There simply wasn\u2019t much space to move. The room was swarming, teeming, breeding with things: towers of stacked books stood on the floor, a table, and even the big four-poster bed in the corner, a life-size portrait of a bearded man leaned against one wall, next to a stuffed raven, which stood next to a teetering pile of chipped, dirty dishes, and next to that was a four-foot-tall model of a ship, rigging and all. Colorful costumes were piled haphazardly in one corner and papers were scattered messily on top of nearly everything.</p><p>Makepeace shut his door and a few sheets fluttered to the floor. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>Apollo pointed to a large pink china clock sitting on top of a stack of books on the table before looking closer and realizing the timepiece had stopped. Oh, for God\u2019s sake. He chose a more direct way to show the time by dodging around the table, crossing to the only window, and yanking the heavy velvet curtains open.</p> <p>A cloud of dust burst from the fabric, dancing prettily in the early morning sunlight streaming into the room.</p><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d Makepeace reacted as if skewered. He staggered and flung himself back on the bed. \u201cHave you no mercy? It can\u2019t be noon yet.\u201d</p><p>Apollo sighed and crossed to his friend. He pushed one leg over ungently and perched on the side of the bed. Then he took out his ever-present notebook and a pencil stub.</p><p>He wrote, Who is the woman in the garden? and shoved the notebook in front of Makepeace\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Makepeace went cross-eyed for a second before focusing on the writing. \u201cWhat woman? You\u2019re mad, man, there isn\u2019t any woman in any garden unless you\u2019re talking about Eve and that garden, which would make you Adam and that I\u2019d pay to see, especially if you wore a girdle of oak leaves\u2014\u201d</p> <p>During this ramble Apollo had taken back the notebook and written more. Now he showed it to the other man, cutting him off mid-rant: Green eyes, overdressed, pretty. Has a little boy named Indio.</p><p>\u201cOh, that woman,\u201d Makepeace said without any show of embarrassment. \u201cLily Stump. Best comic actress in this generation\u2014perhaps any generation, come to think of it. She\u2019s impossibly good\u2014it\u2019s almost as if she casts a spell over the audience, well certainly the male members. Uses the name Robin Goodfellow on the stage. Wonderful thing, made-up names. Quite useful.\u201d</p><p>Apollo gave him a jaundiced look at that. Asa Makepeace was more commonly known as Mr. Harte\u2014though very few knew both of the man\u2019s names. Makepeace had taken the false name when he\u2019d first opened Harte\u2019s Folly nearly ten years ago. Something to do with his family being a religious lot and disapproving of the stage and pleasure gardens in general. Makepeace had been vague about it the one time Apollo had quizzed him on the subject.</p><p>Apollo scribbled in the notebook again. Get her out of my garden.</p><p>Makepeace\u2019s eyebrows shot up when he read the note. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s actually my garden\u2014\u201d</p><p>Apollo glared.</p> <p>Makepeace hastily held up his hands. \u201cAlthough, of course, you have a significant investment in it.\u201d</p><p>Apollo snorted at that. Damned right a significant investment\u2014to wit: all the capital he\u2019d been able to scrape together four and a half years ago. And since he\u2019d spent most of the intervening time ensconced in Bedlam, he hadn\u2019t been able to acquire any other capital or income. His investment in Harte\u2019s Folly was it\u2014his only nest egg and the reason he couldn\u2019t simply flee London. Until Harte\u2019s Folly was once again on its feet and earning, Apollo had no way of getting his money back.</p><p>Hence his decision to help by overseeing the landscaping of the ruined garden.</p><p>Makepeace let his hands drop and sighed. \u201cBut I can\u2019t make Miss Stump leave the garden.\u201d</p><p>Apollo didn\u2019t bother writing this time. He just arched an incredulous eyebrow and cocked his head.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t anywhere else to stay.\u201d Makepeace rolled off the bed, suddenly alert.</p><p>Apollo waited patiently. One good thing about being mute: silence had a tendency to make others talk.</p><p>Makepeace sniffed his underarm, grimaced, and then pulled off his shirt before he broke. \u201cI might\u2019ve stolen her away from Sherwood at the King\u2019s Theatre, which for some reason Sherwood took personally, the ass. He\u2019s made it impossible for her to get work anywhere in London. So when she came to me last week unable to pay the rent on her rooms...\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged and tossed the dirty shirt in a corner.</p><p>Apollo\u2019s eyebrows snapped together and he wrote furiously. I can\u2019t keep in hiding with strangers running about the garden.</p><p>Makepeace scoffed. \u201cWhat about the gardeners we\u2019ve hired? You haven\u2019t made a fuss about them.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t help them\u2014we need the gardeners. Besides. None of them are as intelligent as Mrs. Stump.</p><p>\u201cMiss Stump\u2014there\u2019s no Mr. Stump, as far as I know.\u201d</p><p>Apollo blinked, sidetracked, and cocked his head. The boy?</p><p>\u201cHer son.\u201d Makepeace reached for a miraculously full jug of water, which he poured into a chipped basin. \u201cYou know how theater folk are sometimes. Don\u2019t be such a Puritan.\u201d</p><p>So she wasn\u2019t taken by another man. Not that it mattered\u2014she thought him a literal idiot and he was in hiding from the King\u2019s men after escaping Bedlam.</p><p>Apollo sighed and wrote, You need to find her other lodging.</p><p>Makepeace cocked his head to read the outthrust note, and dropped his mouth open like a gaffed carp. \u201cGood God, what a wonderful idea, Kilbourne! I\u2019ll just send her to my ancient family castle in Wales, shall I? It\u2019s a bit rundown, but the seventy or so servants and acres and acres of land should more than make up for any inconvenience. Or maybe the ch\u00e2teau in the south of France would be more to her liking? I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of that myself, what with my many, many\u2014\u201d</p><p>Apollo cut short this diatribe by shoving his friend\u2019s head in the basin of water.</p><p>Makepeace came up roaring, shaking his head so vigorously that Apollo might as well have taken the dip himself.</p><p>\u201cAhem.\u201d</p><p>Both men whirled at the gentle cough.</p><p>The aristocrat who stood just inside the door to Makepeace\u2019s rooms wasn\u2019t particularly tall\u2014Asa had several inches on him and Apollo topped him by more than a head. The man was posed, one hip cocked gracefully, his hand languidly holding a gold-and-ebony cane. He was attired in a pink suit lavishly embroidered in bright blues, greens, gold, and black. Instead of the common white wig, he wore his golden hair unpowdered\u2014though curled and carefully tied back with a black bow. Apollo had mentally named Valentine Napier, 7th Duke of Montgomery, a fop the first time he\u2019d met him\u2014the night Harte\u2019s Folly had burned\u2014and he\u2019d had no cause to change that impression in the intervening months. He had, however, added an adjective: Montgomery was a dangerous fop.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen.\u201d Montgomery\u2019s upper lip twitched as if in amusement. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not interrupting anything?\u201d</p><p>He looked slyly between them, making Apollo stiffen.</p><p>\u201cOnly my morning toilet,\u201d Makepeace said, ignoring the insinuation. He grabbed a cloth and vigorously rubbed his hair. \u201cFeel free to go away and come back at a more convenient time, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you\u2019re such a busy man,\u201d Montgomery murmured, poking with his gold-topped cane at a stack of papers piled on a chair. The papers slid off, landing with a dusty crash on the floor. A tiny smile flickered across Montgomery\u2019s face and Apollo was reminded of a gray cat his mother had once kept when he was a boy. The creature had loved to stroll along the mantelpiece in his mother\u2019s sitting room, delicately batting the ornaments off the shelf. The cat had watched each ornament smash on the hearth with detached interest before moving on to the next.</p><p>\u201cDo have a seat,\u201d Makepeace drawled. He pulled open a drawer in a chest and took out a shirt.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Montgomery replied without any sign of embarrassment. He sat, crossed his legs, and flicked a minuscule piece of lint off the silk of his breeches. \u201cI\u2019ve come to see about my investment.\u201d</p><p>Apollo frowned. He\u2019d been against taking money from Montgomery from the start, but Makepeace had somehow talked him into it with his usual glib tongue. Apollo couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that they\u2019d made a pact with the Devil. Montgomery had been abroad for over ten years before his abrupt return to London and society. No one seemed to know much about the man\u2014or what he\u2019d been doing for those ten years\u2014even if his title and family name were well known.</p><p>Such mystery gave Apollo an itch between the shoulder blades.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Makepeace said loudly. \u201cEverything\u2019s going just dandy. Smith here has the landscaping well in hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssm-i-th,\u201d Montgomery drew out the ridiculous name Makepeace had given Apollo, making the sound into a sibilant hiss. He turned to Apollo and smiled quite sweetly. \u201cAnd I believe that Mr. Makepeace said that your first name is Samuel, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe prefers Sam,\u201d Makepeace growled, tacking on a hasty \u201cYour Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Montgomery was still smiling, almost to himself. \u201cMr. Sam Smith. Any relation to the Horace Smiths of Oxfordshire?\u201d</p><p>Apollo shook his head once.</p><p>\u201cNo? A pity. I have some interests there. But it is a very common name,\u201d Montgomery murmured. \u201cAnd what plans do you have for the garden, may I ask?\u201d</p><p>Apollo flipped to the back of his notebook and showed it to the duke.</p><p>Montgomery leaned forward, examining with pursed lips the sketches Apollo had made.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d he said at last, and sat back. \u201cI\u2019ll drop by the garden later today to take a look, shall I?\u201d</p><p>Apollo and Makepeace exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cNo need for that, Your Grace,\u201d Makepeace began for the both of them.</p><p>\u201cI know there\u2019s no need. Call it a whim. In any case, I shan\u2019t be denied. Expect me, Mr. Smith.\u201d</p><p>Apollo nodded grimly. He couldn\u2019t put his finger on why it bothered him, but he didn\u2019t like the idea of the duke sniffing about his garden.</p><p>Montgomery twirled his walking stick, watching the glint of light off the gold top. \u201cI collect that we\u2019ll soon be in need of an architect to design and rebuild the various buildings in the pleasure garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s just started work on the garden,\u201d Makepeace said. \u201cHe\u2019s got quite a lot to do\u2014you\u2019ve seen the state the place is in. There\u2019s plenty of time to find an architect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Montgomery replied firmly, \u201cthere isn\u2019t. Not if we\u2019re to reopen the garden within the next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin a year?\u201d Makepeace squawked.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Montgomery stood and ambled to the door. \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m quite an impatient man. If the garden isn\u2019t ready for visitors\u2014and the money they\u2019ll spend\u2014by April of next year, I\u2019m afraid I shall need my capital repaid.\u201d He pivoted at the door and shot them another of his cherubic smiles. \u201cWith interest.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door gently behind him.</p><p>\u201cWell, bollocks,\u201d Makepeace said blankly.</p><p>Apollo couldn\u2019t help but agree.</p><p>\u201cIS WANTONISH A real word?\u201d Lily asked Maude several days later.</p><p>She sat at the kitchen-cum-dining-room table while Maude hung their washing next to the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cWantonish,\u201d Maude said, rolling the word around her mouth. She shook her head decisively as she twitched one of Indio\u2019s shirts into place over the drying rack. \u201cNo, never heard of it.\u201d</p><p>Damn! Lily pouted down at the play she was writing, A Wastrel Reform\u2019d. Wantonish was such a wonderful W word\u2014and she really needed more of those. \u201cWell, does it matter if \u2019tisn\u2019t a real word? William Shakespeare devised all sorts of new words, didn\u2019t he?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maude gave her a look. \u201cYou\u2019re right clever, hinney, but you\u2019re no Shakespeare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Lily bent back to her play. Wantonish sounded like a perfectly lovely word to her\u2014quite sly and suggestive, rather like the heroine of her play. Just because no one had thought of the word before now didn\u2019t seem like a good enough reason not to use it.</p><p>She dipped her quill in the inkpot and wrote another line: \u201cA Wastrel might indeed be wantonish but he\u2019d surely not be wastefulish as well.\u201d</p><p>Lily cocked her head, eyeing the drying ink. Hmmm. Two imaginary words in one line. Best not tell Maude.</p> <p>Someone knocked on the theater door.</p><p>Both Lily and Maude paused and stared at the door, because that had never happened before. Granted, they\u2019d lived at the theater for less than a sennight, but still. It wasn\u2019t the sort of place most people happened by.</p><p>Lily frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s Indio?\u201d</p><p>Maude shrugged. \u201cWent out to play right after luncheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him to stay close,\u201d Lily muttered, feeling a faint twinge of apprehension. She\u2019d walked around to Mr. Harte\u2019s rooms the day after she\u2019d met Indio\u2019s \u201cmonster,\u201d but the man had been ridiculously adamant that the hulking brute couldn\u2019t be moved from the garden. None of Lily\u2019s well-reasoned arguments had persuaded the stubborn man and in the end she\u2019d been forced to come away again, quite unsatisfied. Fortunately the mute hadn\u2019t ventured near the ruined theater since. Unfortunately Indio had acquired a strange fascination with him. Several times the boy had disappeared with Daffodil into the garden, despite Lily\u2019s dire threats regarding pudding and little boys who didn\u2019t mind their mothers.</p> <p>She sighed as she rose to get the door. She was going to have to speak to Indio again about his \u201cmonster\u201d\u2014always assuming her son emerged from the garden.</p><p>Lily pulled open the door to find a man dressed in a violet suit standing without, his back to her as he surveyed the garden.</p><p>He turned and she was dazzled by his alarming prettiness. He had bright-blue eyes, long chocolate lashes, cheekbones sharp enough to cut glass, and a soft, curving mouth that she really wasn\u2019t envious of. And to top it all off\u2014as if to prove Providence really, truly wasn\u2019t fair\u2014he had guinea-gold hair, smooth and curling perfectly.</p><p>When Lily had been a very small girl she\u2019d prayed every night for golden hair.</p><p>She blinked now. \u201cErm... yes?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Lethally. \u201cHave I the pleasure to address the illustrious Robin Goodfellow?\u201d</p> <p>Lily straightened and raised her chin, employing her own smile\u2014which, she had on good authority, could be quite devastating. Lily Stump might occasionally have bad posture, might have hair that wasn\u2019t gold and sometimes wasn\u2019t perfectly arranged, might in the dark of night have fears and self-doubts, but Robin Goodfellow had none of those things. Robin Goodfellow was a very popular actress who was beloved by all of London.</p><p>And she knew it.</p><p>So Robin Goodfellow smiled with just the right amount of impishness at the very pretty man\u2014and by God made him blink.</p><p>\u201cYou do indeed,\u201d she said throatily.</p><p>A spark of admiration lit within his gorgeous blue eyes. \u201cAh. Then may I introduce myself? I am Valentine Napier, Duke of Montgomery. I was informed by Mr. Harte that you resided here and I thought to make your acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>He swept the lace-trimmed black tricorn from his head and bowed low, holding his stick in the other hand.</p><p>Behind her, something clattered.</p><p>Lily didn\u2019t turn to see what Maude had dropped. Instead she inclined her head coquettishly and dipped into a curtsy. \u201cI\u2019m most pleased to meet you, Your Grace. Won\u2019t you take a dish of tea with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be honored, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Lily pivoted and exchanged a significant look with Maude. They hadn\u2019t planned for such a contingency, but Maude was an old hand in the theater and knew well the art of a false facade. \u201cIt\u2019s such a lovely day. We\u2019ll take our tea in the garden, Maude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Maude said, immediately assuming the mask of a perfect servant.</p><p>When Lily looked back, the duke was eyeing her speculatively. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit cold for tea outside?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t so much as narrow her eyes. He knew damned well why she wouldn\u2019t let him in the wretched theater\u2014she wasn\u2019t about to parade her lowered state of affairs before him.</p><p>\u201cLa, Your Grace, but I like the fresh air. Of course should you prefer a stuffy indoor setting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d he demurred, a gleam in his eye.</p><p>She\u2019d scored that point and well he knew it. But he seemed to take the setback in good humor. He stepped aside as Maude hurried out with two chairs\u2014mismatched, of course, but Lily knew better than to apologize. To show any sort of weakness to a man like the duke was as ill-advised as a mouse\u2019s bolting in front of a waiting cat.</p><p>He gestured gallantly to a seat and she settled herself gracefully, watching as he took his own chair. The duke moved with a sort of lazy elegance that, she thought, belied how dangerous he might be.</p><p>He glanced around at the devastated garden. \u201cIt\u2019s a rather macabre spot, don\u2019t you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, Your Grace,\u201d Lily lied. Surely he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d catch her out with such a mundane snare? \u201cThe atmosphere of the garden is terribly mysterious. I find it altogether charming\u2014and a wonderful influence for my stagecraft. An actress must always find inspiration for herself and her art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gratified to hear you say so,\u201d the duke replied smoothly, \u201cfor as you know, I am now part owner of Harte\u2019s Folly.\u201d She must\u2019ve given herself away somehow\u2014a slight, involuntary movement or a widening of the eyes\u2014for he leaned forward. \u201cAh, you didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Wretched creature. She made herself relax. \u201cLa, I\u2019m not apprised of every little business dealing with the garden, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he murmured as Maude came out with a small footstool. She set it between them and disappeared back into the theater. The duke cocked an eyebrow at the plain wooden footstool and addressed it. \u201cBut this \u2018little business dealing\u2019 does put me in the position of your\u201d\u2014he cleared his throat delicately and looked up at her\u2014\u201cemployer.\u201d</p><p>Maude returned with a tray of tea at that moment, saving Lily from an ill-conceived reply.</p><p>Lily smiled as Maude set down the tray and poured tea for them both. Maude handed her the dish of tea with a question in her eyes. Lily held her gaze and murmured her thanks, signaling that she wasn\u2019t in need of help.</p><p>The maidservant gave a quiet huff and left.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very loyal, isn\u2019t she?\u201d the duke observed.</p><p>Lily took a sip of the tea. It was weak\u2014Maude must\u2019ve used the last of the good tea leaves\u2014but hot. \u201cAren\u2019t all good servants loyal, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head as if seriously considering her comment, before replying decisively. \u201cNot necessarily. A servant can serve quite adequately\u2014even superbly\u2014without any loyalty to his master at all.\u201d He smiled, quick and mercurial. \u201cAs long, of course, as the master has fitted the servant with a proper bit between his teeth.\u201d</p><p>Lily repressed a shiver. What a very loathsome image. But then aristocrats weren\u2019t like other people. They played with the lives of ordinary folk as easily as Indio poked a stick into an ant\u2019s nest, never considering the destruction they caused.</p><p>\u201cI find I don\u2019t much like the thought of bits,\u201d Lily murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he asked. \u201cWould you allow horses to run free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople aren\u2019t horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but servants are quite close,\u201d he retorted. \u201cBoth servants and horses live to serve their master\u2014or at least they should do. Otherwise they\u2019re quite useless and need to be put down.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, watching for the twinkle of the eye, the twitch of the lip, to indicate he jested.</p><p>His countenance was pleasant but grave.</p><p>Was he jesting?</p><p>He took a sip of tea, watching her. \u201cDon\u2019t you think so, Miss Goodfellow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Grace,\u201d she said sweetly, \u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>At that his wide lips did break into a smile\u2014beautiful and corrupt. \u201cYou speak your mind, ma\u2019am. How refreshing. Tell me, have you a protector?\u201d</p><p>Oh, dear God, she\u2019d rather bed a snake. Not to mention the insultingly frank way he\u2019d made his proposition.</p><p>She smiled again\u2014though it was becoming harder and harder to keep her expression polite. \u201cYour Grace flatters me with his attention, but I have no wish for a protector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d He let his gaze travel skeptically over the falling-down theater she lived in. \u201cBut no doubt you know best your own circumstance.\u201d His voice was politely doubtful. \u201cI have another use for your, er, person that you might find more to your liking: an acquaintance of mine is hosting a house party in a few weeks and is planning to stage an especially written play as part of the festivities. He has engaged a theatrical troupe of players, but the lead actress has unfortunately found herself unable to play.\u201d He made a slight moue. \u201cA delicate indisposition, you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do indeed,\u201d Lily said coolly, feeling pity for the actress who had discovered herself with child and thus out of work. She hoped the poor woman had someone to care for her. Without Maude she wasn\u2019t sure what she would have done when Indio arrived. \u201cBut I\u2019m surprised, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, his blue eyes sparkling with interest. \u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think the arranging of a simple house party play quite beneath your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He smiled almost to himself. \u201cI find I do like doing the occasional favor. It makes the receiver so much more in my debt.\u201d</p><p>Lily swallowed. Would the duke consider her in his debt now? Probably, but it really didn\u2019t matter: she needed the work. Private theatricals were quite popular, but naturally expensive to produce and thus few and far between. She was lucky to have the offer. \u201cI\u2019d be pleased to act in the play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d the duke said. \u201cI\u2019m told that rehearsals won\u2019t begin for another fortnight or so, as the play isn\u2019t finished yet. I\u2019ll contact you at the appropriate time, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly. \u201cYour talents are very much praised, Miss Goodfellow. I find myself looking forward to the party\u2014and the play\u2014with unforeseen anticipation.\u201d</p><p>Lily was still considering the proper reply to such a complicated comment when a muddy whirlwind burst from the blackened trees, followed closely by a tumbling ball of red-and-black mud. \u201cMama! Mama! You\u2019ll never guess\u2014\u201d</p><p>Indio skidded to a stop as he caught sight of their guest, falling abruptly silent.</p><p>Sadly, Daffodil had no such impulse. The little greyhound halted by her friend and began yapping shrilly, the force of her barks making her front legs bounce off the ground.</p><p>The duke narrowed his eyes very slightly at the dog and Lily suddenly felt an irrational fear for her pet.</p><p>Maude came out of the theater and snatched up Daffodil, who decided to turn affectionate, laving the maidservant\u2019s face with her pink tongue.</p><p>\u201cEnough of that now,\u201d Maude scolded. \u201cCome here, Indio.\u201d</p><p>She held out her hand for the boy and Indio started forward.</p><p>\u201cA moment,\u201d Montgomery drawled. He halted the boy with a touch of his hand to Indio\u2019s shoulder. The duke glanced at Lily. \u201cThis is your son?\u201d</p><p>Lily nodded, her fingers balling into fists in her lap. She didn\u2019t know why the duke should take an interest in Indio, but she didn\u2019t like it. Not at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Montgomery placed a long forefinger under Indio\u2019s chin and tilted his face up, staring at his curious eyes for several heartbeats.</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d the duke drawled softly at last, \u201cthe dissimilar colors of his eyes. I believe I\u2019ve only seen the like once before.\u201d</p><p>And he turned and smiled his beautiful snake smile at Lily.</p><p>THE BOY WAS watching him again.</p> <p>It was late afternoon a day later and the sun was giving up the struggle behind a barrier of gray clouds as Apollo examined the ornamental pond. He and the other gardeners had spent the last three days dredging the stream that fed the pond, clearing it of debris so the pond might once again be filled with freshwater. It had been filthy, muddy work, but the result was already apparent: the water level in the pond was rising. An old stone bridge arched to a little island in the middle and Apollo raised both hands, palms out, fingers together and pointed up, thumbs at right angles, making a frame for the view between.</p><p>Nearby the bushes rattled as the boy shifted\u2014and then froze like a hare hiding from a fox.</p><p>Apollo was careful to show no sign that he\u2019d noticed the child.</p><p>He considered the picture within his frame. Originally he\u2019d thought to tear the bridge down\u2014it was much the worse for wear from the fire\u2014but looking at it now, he thought it might become a rustic ruin with the right plantings around it. Perhaps an oak at the near shore and a grouping of reeds or a single flowering tree on the island.</p><p>He sighed and dropped his hands. Trees were his most pressing problem. Most hadn\u2019t survived the fire, and of course for one to mature took many years. He\u2019d read about transplanting fully grown trees\u2014the French were said to be able to do so\u2014but he\u2019d never tried it himself.</p> <p>Time enough to worry about that. For today he still had to pull yet another dead tree from the ground. He pivoted\u2014and exhaled hard as his right foot slid on the slippery pond bank. Apollo caught himself and grimaced down at his boot, covered with the stinking green slime that still lined the bank where the pond had retreated from the original shoreline.</p><p>From the bushes came a gasp, presumably at his near fall. What the child found so fascinating about him, Apollo had no idea. His work was the same as the other gardeners\u2019\u2014tedious and wearying\u2014yet the boy seemed to spy only on him. In fact, Apollo had noticed that Indio\u2019s hiding place became closer every day, until today the boy was only feet away. He was beginning to wonder if the boy wanted to be noticed.</p><p>Apollo bent to pick up his long-handled adze. He swung it over his head and then down into the soft ground at the root of a stump. The heavy adze hit with a satisfying thump and he could feel that he\u2019d struck one of the main roots.</p><p>He wiped his brow with the sleeve of his shirt and heaved the adze free from the stump. Then he swung again.</p><p>\u201cDaff,\u201d came a hiss from the bushes.</p><p>Apollo\u2019s lips twitched. Indio hadn\u2019t chosen a particularly adept spy-mate. The greyhound obviously didn\u2019t understand his young master\u2019s need for stealth. Even now she was wandering out of their hiding place, nose to the ground, more interested in some scent than Indio\u2019s frantic call. \u201cDaff. Daffodil.\u201d</p> <p>Apollo sighed. Was he really expected not to notice the dog? He was mute, not blind\u2014or deaf.</p><p>Daffodil ambled right up to his feet. She\u2019d apparently lost her fear of him in the last week of spying\u2014or perhaps she was simply bored of sitting still. In any case she sniffed the tree stump and the adze, and then abruptly sat to scratch one ear vigorously.</p><p>Apollo extended a hand for the little dog to sniff, but the silly thing jumped back at his movement. She was quite near the pond bank and her sudden leap caused her back legs to slip in the mud. She tumbled down the bank and into the water, disappearing beneath the surface.</p><p>\u201cDaff!\u201d The boy ran from his hiding place, his eyes huge with fear.</p><p>Apollo put out his hand, blocking him.</p><p>The boy tried to dart around his outstretched arm. \u201cShe\u2019ll drown!\u201d</p><p>Apollo seized him and swung the boy off his feet and then set him down firmly, placing his hands on his shoulders and bending to stare into his eyes. He narrowed his eyes and growled, never so frustrated by his loss of speech as now. He couldn\u2019t argue with the child\u2014tell him what he meant to do and instruct him to obey, and thus he was reduced to animal grunting. Better the boy should fear him, though, than drown trying to rescue his pet.</p><p>Indio gulped.</p> <p>Apollo stepped back, keeping his eye on the boy, and pulled off his shoes, waistcoat, and shirt. He hesitated a moment, staring suspiciously at the boy.</p><p>Indio nodded. \u201cYes. Please. Please, help her.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting further, Apollo turned and waded swiftly into the water. The little dog had reemerged at the surface, but she was thrashing in panic instead of trying to swim.</p><p>Apollo grabbed her by the scruff of the neck and lifted her clear from the pond. She hung pathetically, water streaming from her rat-thin tail and drooping ears. He turned and waded back to the shore.</p><p>The boy hadn\u2019t moved from where Apollo had stopped him. Indio watched him intently.</p><p>Apollo picked up his shirt and wrapped the shivering greyhound in it before handing the little dog to the boy.</p><p>Indio clutched her to his chest, his eyes swimming in tears as the dog whimpered and began to lick his chin. He looked from the pet in his arms up at Apollo. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Daffodil coughed, choked, opened wide her narrow mouth, and vomited up a thin trail of pond water all over the shirt.</p><p>Apollo winced.</p><p>He turned and found the worn cloth bag he\u2019d brought his lunch in. Fortunately, he\u2019d placed his notebook in it earlier, so that at least wasn\u2019t wet. Apollo repressed a shuddering shiver as he crouched and rummaged in the sack. Earlier he\u2019d eaten his luncheon\u2014a pork pie\u2014and wrapped a leftover piece in a cloth. Apollo rose with the bundle and the little dog immediately leaned from her master\u2019s arms, sniffing eagerly at the cloth. Apollo unwrapped the morsel and broke off a piece, holding it out. Daffodil snatched it from his fingers and gulped it down.</p><p>Apollo almost laughed.</p><p>\u201cShe likes piecrust,\u201d the boy said shyly.</p><p>Apollo merely nodded and fed Daffodil another bit.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Course she likes bread and sausage and chicken and green beans and apples and cheese as well,\u201d Indio continued. Not so shy after all, then. \u201cI gived her a raisin once. She didn\u2019t like that. Is that your dinner?\u201d</p><p>Apollo didn\u2019t answer, simply offering the last of the pie to Daffodil. She gobbled it and then began nosing his hand, looking for crumbs. She seemed to have forgotten her unexpected swim already.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of you to give it her,\u201d Indio said, stroking Daffodil\u2019s head. \u201cD\u2019you... do you like dogs?\u201d</p><p>Apollo glanced at him. The boy was staring up at him hopefully and for the first time Apollo noticed that his eyes were of different colors: the right blue, the left green. He turned away to stuff the bit of cloth back into his bag.</p><p>\u201cUncle Edwin gived me Daffodil. He won her in a game of cards. Mama says a puppy is a silly thing to wager for. Daff\u2019s an Italian greyhound, but she didn\u2019t come from Italy. Mama says Italians like skinny little dogs. I named her Daffodil because that\u2019s my favorite flower and the prettiest. She doesn\u2019t know to mind,\u201d Indio said sadly as Apollo rose.</p><p>Daffodil wriggled and the boy set her cautiously on the ground. The greyhound struggled from the folds of the shirt, shook herself, and then squatted, watering the ground\u2014and a corner of the shirt.</p><p>Apollo sighed. He really was going to have to wash that shirt.</p><p>Indio sighed as well. \u201cMama says I ought to train her to sit and beg and most \u2019portantly come when we call her, but\u201d\u2014he took a deep breath\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know how to.\u201d</p><p>Apollo bit his lip to keep down a smile. It was too bad that he\u2019d already fed all the scraps to the dog. He glanced at the boy.</p><p>Indio was staring at him frankly. \u201cMy name\u2019s Indio. I live in the old theater.\u201d He pointed in the direction of the theater with a straight arm. \u201cMy mama lives there and Maude, too. She\u2019s a famous actress, my mama, that is. Maude\u2019s our maidservant.\u201d He chewed on one lip. \u201cCan you speak?\u201d</p><p>Apollo shook his head slowly.</p><p>\u201cI thought not.\u201d Indio dug into the mud with the toe of one boot, frowning down. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>Well, he couldn\u2019t answer that, could he? Time he was back at work, anyway. Apollo reached for his adze, half expecting the boy to run away at his movement.</p><p>But Indio simply stepped back out of his way, watching with interest. Daffodil had wandered several feet away and was now digging energetically in the mud.</p><p>He was wet and chilled from the air, but work would soon fix that. Apollo took another swing at the tree stump, hitting it with a thwock!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you Caliban,\u201d Indio said as Apollo lifted the adze again.</p><p>Apollo turned and stared.</p><p>Indio smiled tentatively. \u201cIt\u2019s from a play. There\u2019s a wizard who lives on a island and it\u2019s all over wild. Caliban lives there, though he can speak. But he\u2019s big like you, so I thought... Caliban.\u201d</p><p>Apollo was still staring helplessly at the boy through this explanation. Daffodil had paused to sneeze and glance at them. Her nose was adorned with a clot of mud.</p><p>There were dozens of reasons to refuse the boy. Apollo was in hiding, a price on his head, wanted for the most awful of crimes. The boy\u2019s mother had already made plain that she wanted him nowhere near her son. And what did he have to offer the boy after all, mute and overworked and on the run?</p><p>But Indio smiled up at him with mismatched eyes and cheeks made red from the wind, and an air of sweet hope that was simply impossible to refuse. Somehow, against his better judgment, Apollo found himself nodding.</p><p>Caliban. The illiterate knave from The Tempest. Well, he supposed he could\u2019ve done worse.</p><p>Indio might\u2019ve chosen A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u2014and named him Bottom.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>The black bull was without mark, both beautiful and terrible, and it opened its jaws and spoke in the language of men: \u201cYou have overthrown my island, but I will have my price.\u201d</p><p>When the king awoke he marveled on the oddity of his dream, but thought no more of it...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>\u201cIndio!\u201d</p><p>Lily paused and glanced around the blackened garden an hour later. She hated to keep Indio locked inside the old theater, but she was going to have to if he insisted on disappearing like this. The sun would soon be setting. The garden held all manner of dangers for a little boy\u2014and that was without the interest the duke had shown her son yesterday afternoon. Lily hadn\u2019t liked that comment Montgomery had made about Indio\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Not at all.</p><p>A sense of urgency made her cup her hands around her mouth to shout again. \u201cIndio!\u201d</p><p>Oh, let Indio be safe. Let him return to her, happy and laughing and covered in mud.</p><p>Lily trudged onward toward the pond. Funny how she\u2019d learned to pray again when she\u2019d become a mother so suddenly. For years she\u2019d never thought of Providence. And then she\u2019d found herself whispering beneath her breath at different, frightening points in Indio\u2019s short life:</p><p>Let the fever break.</p><p>Don\u2019t let the fall be fatal.</p><p>Thank you, thank you, for making the horse swerve aside.</p><p>Not the pox. Anything but the pox.</p><p>Oh, dear God, don\u2019t let him be lost.</p><p>Not lost. Not my brave little man. My Indio.</p><p>Lily\u2019s steps quickened until she found herself almost running through the charred brambles, the clutching branches. She\u2019d never let him out again when she found him. She\u2019d fall to her knees and hug him when she found him. She\u2019d spank him and send him to bed without his supper when she found him.</p><p>She was panting as the path widened and she came to the clearing by the pond. She opened her mouth to call yet again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she was struck dumb instead.</p><p>He was there\u2014Indio\u2019s monster. He was in the pond, his back to her.</p><p>And he was quite nude.</p><p>Lily blinked, frozen in place. The garden was all of a sudden eerily still as the day made its last farewell. His massive shoulders were bunched, his head lowered as if he saw something in the water. Perhaps he was struck by his own reflection. Did he know himself when he saw that man beneath the water\u2014or was he frightened at the sight? She felt a flash of pity. He could not help his own huge size\u2014or the deformity of his brain. She ought to speak, ought to make her presence known, ought to...</p> <p>All thought left her head as the giant plunged beneath the water.</p><p>Lily\u2019s mouth half opened.</p><p>The setting sun broke through the cloud cover and bathed the pond in golden light, reflecting off the ripples left by his movement. He burst from the water. He was facing her now. The muscles bunched on his arms as he slicked his wet, shoulder-length hair back from his face. The mist swirled amber over the surface of the water, adorning his gleaming skin as if he were the tributary god of this ruined garden. Her pity evaporated, burned away by the sudden realization that she had it all wrong.</p><p>He was...</p><p>She swallowed.</p> <p>Good Lord. He was magnificent.</p><p>The water trickled down his chest, trailing through a diamond of wet, dark hair between his beaded nipples, down over a shallow, perfectly formed navel, and into a dark line of wet hair that disappeared\u2014rather disappointingly\u2014into the concealing misted water.</p><p>She blinked and glanced up\u2014only to find that the giant, the beast, the monster was looking directly back at her.</p><p>She ought to be ashamed. He was a mental defective and she was ogling him as if he were able to reciprocate any feeling she might have... except his expression didn\u2019t seem stupid now. He almost looked amused by her stare.</p><p>Not defective at all.</p><p>And an awful, terrible, mortifying thing happened: she felt herself grow wet.</p> <p>Just yesterday she\u2019d had tea with the most beautiful man she\u2019d ever seen. The Duke of Montgomery had aristocratic cheekbones, sapphire-blue eyes, and shining, golden hair\u2014and he\u2019d moved her not at all.</p><p>Yet this... beast before her, this man with his wild muddy-brown hair, his animallike shoulders, his big, knobby nose, his wide, crooked mouth and heavy brow. Him she found attractive.</p><p>Obviously she needed to take a new lover\u2014and soon.</p><p>He began wading to the shore, his leaden expression returned. Had she imagined the look of intelligence, supplying one where none existed?</p><p>Lily squeaked as he neared, but sadly, did not turn her back.</p><p>She had a moral defect\u2014a despicable personal flaw\u2014for she simply could not look away. Her eyes dropped to the wet black tangle between his legs as he strode toward her, the water swirling about his muscled thighs. There was a hint of the flesh below, crude and male and\u2014</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>Lily jumped, whirling, her hand on her heart, which surely had stopped, poor, worn thing.</p> <p>\u201cIndio!\u201d she gasped, rather breathlessly, for her wretched son had chosen this moment to emerge from the shrubbery. He was standing on the path she\u2019d just come from, a leaf stuck in his curly black hair. Daffodil, looking even muddier than usual, capered up to her and planted filthy paws on her skirts.</p><p>\u201cMama, can Caliban come for supper?\u201d Indio asked, his mismatched eyes wide and entirely too innocent.</p><p>\u201cI... what?\u201d Lily asked weakly.</p><p>\u201cCaliban.\u201d Indio gestured behind her.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder to find\u2014to her mingled relief and disappointment\u2014that the man was slowly buttoning the falls of a ragged pair of breeches. The setting sun limned the wet slope of his shoulders, but his big fingers fumbled on the buttons. Whatever intelligence she\u2019d imagined in his eyes was gone. But then it\u2019d probably never been there in the first place.</p><p>She looked back at Indio, brow knitted. \u201cCaliban? That\u2019s Caliban?\u201d</p><p>Her son nodded. \u201cI named him just today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...\u201d She shook her head. She\u2019d found\u2014shortly after Indio learned to talk\u2014that letting him lead a discussion could result in a tangled web, incomprehensible to anyone over the age of seven. Sometimes one must simply cut through the tangle. \u201cIndio, it\u2019s suppertime and Maude is waiting for us. Let\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Indio came closer and took her hand, pulling her down to whisper in her ear, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t anything to eat and he\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She looked helplessly back at Caliban.</p><p>He\u2019d donned his shirt and was staring at her with his mouth half open. As she watched he scratched his... well, his male parts, quite obliviously, just as a half-wit might.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. He\u2019d not looked half-witted at all a minute ago. Perhaps she\u2019d imagined it. Perhaps she\u2019d wanted to condone her own baser impulses by giving the object of her thoughts reason that simply wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>And perhaps she was dithering over the matter too much.</p><p>She glanced back at Indio\u2019s pleading face and made her decision. She straightened and said loudly, \u201cOf course, darling, let\u2019s invite your friend to supper.\u201d</p><p>A choking sound came from behind her, but when she turned, Caliban\u2019s face was stupidly blank. He snorted, hawked, spat into the pond\u2014ew!\u2014and scrubbed his hand across his mouth.</p><p>She smiled widely. \u201cCaliban? Would you like to eat? Eat?\u201d She mimed lifting a spoon to her mouth and then chewing. \u201cEat. With. Us.\u201d She pointed back along the path. \u201cAt the theater. We have good food!\u201d</p><p>Her exaggerated miming was ridiculous\u2014and if he wasn\u2019t mentally defective, it was insulting. She watched him closely to see if he\u2019d break\u2014change expression, show in any way that he did harbor normal intelligence.</p><p>But he simply stared back blankly.</p><p>It certainly wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d misread a man. Sighing\u2014and telling herself firmly that she most certainly wasn\u2019t disappointed\u2014Lily began to turn away.</p><p>Indio started forward and took the big man\u2019s hand as naturally as he\u2019d taken his mother\u2019s. \u201cCome on! Maude\u2019s making roast chicken and there\u2019ll be gravy and dumplings.\u201d</p><p>Caliban looked at the boy and then her.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. She\u2019d already pled her piece\u2014she wouldn\u2019t do so again. Not for a lackwit.</p><p>Was there something behind the muddy-brown eyes? A glimmer, a glint of challenge? She couldn\u2019t tell, and in any case she was no longer certain of her own perception.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t matter. Caliban nodded slowly.</p><p>Lily turned and started back up the path, Daffodil scampering ahead. Her heart, that silly, mercurial thing, was beating in double time.</p><p>This was going to be interesting.</p><p>THIS WAS A very bad idea.</p><p>Apollo followed Lily Stump, watching her skirts sway from side to side as she walked. Her back was rigidly straight, but the nape of her neck was soft and unguarded, trails of dark hair curling down from the knot at the crown of her head. He had an animal urge to set his teeth against her nape, test the tender flesh, taste the salt on her skin.</p><p>He swallowed, glad the cool evening air kept him from embarrassment. There was no reason for him to have accepted her offer of supper. He had another cold pork pie safely stowed in the ruins of the musician\u2019s gallery where he\u2019d set up camp while he worked in the garden. He was tired and sore and still damp from washing off the sweat and mud of the day. His recently rinsed shirt clung, wet and uncomfortable, to his shoulders.</p><p>Everything\u2014everything\u2014he\u2019d worked for would be forfeit if anyone discovered who he really was.</p><p>And yet he was holding the hand of a little boy and trailing the boy\u2019s exasperating mother. Perhaps he was lonely. Or perhaps it was the look in her eyes when he\u2019d emerged from the pond and found her watching him that urged his footsteps on. It had been a long time\u2014a very, very long time\u2014since a woman had last looked at him like that. As if she saw something she liked.</p><p>As if she might want more.</p><p>He\u2019d spent four years in Bedlam, most of them chained in a stinking cell. He\u2019d escaped last July, but in the months since, he\u2019d been in hiding\u2014not a situation conducive to finding a willing wench. And of course there\u2019d been that last beating\u2014the one that had stolen his voice. The prison guard had reached for his falls. Had\u2014</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t think of that now.</p><p>Apollo inhaled, shoving aside a black mass of shame and anger.</p><p>Indio looked up at him. \u201cCaliban?\u201d</p><p>Apollo realized he\u2019d squeezed the boy\u2019s hand. Deliberately he made himself relax his hold and shook down his shoulders. Stupid for a man as big as he to feel such wretched fear. He was out of Bedlam. He\u2019d made sure\u2014damned sure\u2014that guard was no longer a threat to anyone.</p><p>He was free.</p><p>Free.</p><p>Free.</p><p>He tilted back his head, watching the sun cast her flame-colored skirts upon the sky as she set over his ruined garden. Beyond the theater, between the tops of blackened and burnt trees, one could just make out a glitter that was the mighty Thames.</p><p>This had once been a lovely pleasure garden. When he was done with it, it would be a wondrous pleasure garden, even better than before.</p><p>But right now they were nearing the theater.</p><p>Apollo assumed the blank expression that he wore around the other gardeners\u2014and only just in time. The door flew open and a tiny, gray-haired woman stood in the opening, arms set akimbo on hips.</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d she barked, \u201cis that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a guest for supper tonight,\u201d Miss Stump replied, and as she glanced back at him he thought he saw a mischievous glint in her eye. \u201cIndio\u2019s monster, in fact\u2014though Indio now calls him Caliban.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaliban?\u201d Maude narrowed her eyes, cocking her head as she examined him critically. \u201cAye, I can see that, but is he safe in the theater with us is what I\u2019m wanting to know?\u201d</p><p>Apollo felt a tug on his hand. He looked down at Indio, who whispered, \u201cShe\u2019s nice. Truly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuss, Maude,\u201d Miss Stump murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my friend,\u201d Indio explained earnestly. \u201cAnd he fed Daff all his dinner.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of her name, the little dog ran over and, growling in what she no doubt considered a ferocious manner, began to worry the ragged hem of Apollo\u2019s breeches.</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d Maude said, her tone as dry as dust. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, better come inside, all of you.\u201d</p><p>Indio bent and rescued Apollo\u2019s breeches by picking up Daffodil, who immediately began bathing his face with her tongue. He laughed and trotted past Maude. His mother gave Apollo an indecipherable look and motioned him in ahead of her. Apollo ducked his head and entered the charred theater, trying to quell his unease. There was no reason to think she\u2019d seen through his subterfuge.</p><p>The last time he\u2019d been in the building was on the night the garden had burned. Asa Makepeace was an old friend and the only one Apollo had trusted to keep his whereabouts secret when he\u2019d been rescued from Bedlam. He\u2019d hidden in the garden for only a day before the place had burned down. Then the theater had been smoldering and had stank of smoke and devastation.</p><p>Now there was still the faint smell of charred wood, but there were other changes. Miss Stump had obviously attempted to make the place more comfortable\u2014a table and chairs were in the center of the room, and a print of ladies in bright dresses hung on the wall. A fire crackled on the grate, and a rack had been erected nearby to dry clothes. Someone had been knitting, for two knitting needles and a half-finished sock were stuck in a ball of gray yarn on a stool near the hearth. A tiny side table held a messy sheaf of papers, a corked bottle of ink, and a chipped mug with several quills. On the mantel sat a single, rather ugly black-and-green enameled clock\u2014working, unlike Makepeace\u2019s. Before the fire was an incredibly plain purple settee, one corner propped up with several bricks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t much\u2014certainly not as grand as some of the houses he\u2019d once seen as a young buck new to town, before his fall from grace\u2014but it was homey. And that was all that mattered.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Maude demanded, pointing to one of the chairs at the table. \u201cHave a seat, milord.\u201d</p><p>For a terrible second Apollo couldn\u2019t breathe. Then in the next moment he realized that the honorific had been meant sarcastically. He nodded, hoping his face hadn\u2019t betrayed his surprise, and pulled out a chair to sit.</p><p>Maude was still scowling. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him? Can\u2019t he talk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he can\u2019t,\u201d Indio said simply, saving Apollo from having to do his dumb show.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Maude blinked, obviously taken aback. \u201cHas he had his tongue cut out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaude!\u201d Miss Stump cried. \u201cWhat a horrible thought. He has a tongue.\u201d Her brows knit as if from sudden doubt and she peered worriedly at Apollo. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even bother resisting the urge. He stuck out his tongue at her.</p><p>Indio laughed and Daffodil began barking again\u2014obviously her first reaction to nearly everything.</p> <p>Miss Stump stared at Apollo for a long second and he was aware that his body was heating. Carefully he withdrew his tongue and snapped his mouth shut, giving her his most uncomprehending face.</p><p>She humphed and abruptly took her seat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fair enough question, it is,\u201d Maude defended herself. \u201cWhy can\u2019t he talk, then, if\u2019n his tongue works well enough, I\u2019d like to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why he can\u2019t talk.\u201d Indio took the chair next to Apollo. \u201cBut he saved Daff from drownding today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Miss Stump paused in the act of reaching for the plate of sliced chicken on the table. \u201cYou\u2019re not to go near the pond, you know that, Indio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t near the pond,\u201d Indio explained with a boy\u2019s complicated logic. \u201cDaff was. Caliban went in and took her out and wrapped her in his shirt. And then Daff spewed on his shirt.\u201d</p> <p>Both women swung their heads to eye his shirt askance.</p><p>Apollo repressed an urge to lift his arm and sniff to see if the shirt still stank of dog vomit.</p><p>Miss Stump blinked. \u201cSpew isn\u2019t a nice word, Indio, I\u2019ve told you before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is?\u201d Indio asked\u2014rather reasonably, in Apollo\u2019s opinion. \u201cCan I have some of the chicken now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Miss Stump began to serve the chicken, the skin crisp and brown, the meat tender and moist. \u201cActually, we don\u2019t talk about such things at the dinner table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d Indio looked very puzzled.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d his parent said quite firmly.</p><p>\u201cBut if Daff eats an earthworm like she did last week, how\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo how did Caliban come to be nearby when Daffodil went into the pond?\u201d Miss Stump asked loudly.</p><p>\u201cHe was chopping at a stump with a funny-looking ax,\u201d Indio said, and Apollo wanted to tell him, adze, but instead he took a bite of the chicken. \u201cAnd me an\u2019 Daff were walking. But not,\u201d he added, \u201cto the pond. We was walking not near the pond.\u201d</p><p>Apollo chanced a glance at the ladies and winced. Neither woman had swallowed that particular story.</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019s a gardener.\u201d Miss Stump picked up her wineglass and eyed him with far more interest than was safe.</p><p>\u201cNot just any gardener,\u201d Indio said. \u201cHe tells all the other gardeners what to do.\u201d</p><p>At which point Apollo nearly swallowed his bite of chicken the wrong way. He choked and gasped and Miss Stump pounded him hard on his back.</p><p>\u201cDoes he indeed?\u201d she asked, with a pointed look at him.</p><p>How the hell did the boy know that? Not even the other gardeners knew he\u2019d designed the garden. He had a rather complicated method of leaving written instructions for the lead gardener\u2014a slow but methodical man named Herring\u2014so that none of them realized their employer was working right under their noses.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d Maude asked interestedly.</p><p>Apollo flicked his wrist and knocked his plate to the floor. It was a sad waste of good roast chicken, but not to be helped. The plate smashed on impact, shards skidding across the charred boards, gravy and meat oozing everywhere. Daffodil rushed over and began gobbling chicken as Indio and Maude tried keep her from inadvertently eating a piece of crockery.</p><p>In the melee Apollo looked over and met Miss Stump\u2019s gaze. Her green eyes were narrowed speculatively on him and he felt a thrill shoot through him, low and visceral.</p><p>The feeling might\u2019ve been simple fear, but on the whole he thought it was something far, far more dangerous.</p><p>MAUDE AND INDIO were shouting, grappling with Daffodil and the mess on the floor, but Lily was frozen, staring into murky brown eyes. Not eyes the color of coffee or chocolate or that lovely China tea that came in a little red paper packet and that she could no longer afford. No, Caliban\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t like any delicious beverage. They were simply brown. As dull and uninspiring as a dumb animal\u2019s.</p><p>Except...</p><p>Except that they were surrounded by the lushest lashes she\u2019d ever seen on a man: short, black, and thick, and exotically beautiful in their own way. Why hadn\u2019t she noticed before? Caliban\u2019s eyes were simply breathtaking.</p><p>But what was more disturbing, there was a glimmer, somewhere in the muddy-brown depths, that made Lily draw in her breath. It was a glimmer of intelligence\u2014sharp intelligence\u2014and it made her afraid. Because if Indio was right, if this man\u2014this stranger\u2014was not just a simple gardener, but was somehow in charge of the other gardeners, then he wasn\u2019t at all what she\u2019d first taken him for. She was aware, suddenly, of how huge he was, of how male. He was in her home, with her little boy and an old woman, and they had no defenses.</p><p>She knew all too well what destruction a big man could wreak.</p><p>She drew a shaky breath as Indio sat back down again, between Lily and Caliban.</p><p>Indio leaned close to the giant and whispered, \u201cYou can have some of mine.\u201d</p><p>Lily swallowed, gripping her apprehension firmly. Perhaps Indio had misunderstood something he\u2019d seen. Surely a mute couldn\u2019t be the head gardener? Surely Caliban was exactly what he\u2019d seemed when she\u2019d first come upon him in the garden?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right, Indio,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cMaude can serve him another portion.\u201d</p><p>Her former nursemaid shot Lily a quick look, but said nothing as she fetched the only other plate they owned and began filling it.</p><p>\u201cIndio,\u201d Lily said carefully as she touched her wineglass. Her own appetite had fled completely. \u201cTell me about how Daffodil fell into the pond?\u201d</p><p>Her little boy crinkled up his nose. \u201cWe-ell, we was walking, me an\u2019 Daff, and then Daff sort of skidded.\u201d</p><p>She waited, but Indio was looking at her with an expression of suspicious innocence.</p><p>\u201cIndio,\u201d she started, but her son took that as a prompt to speak again.</p><p>\u201cHe was real quick, Caliban was. Fished Daff out of the water like a... a... well. A drownded rat. Sorry, Daff.\u201d</p><p>Indio looked apologetically at the dog. Not that there was any need. Daffodil wasn\u2019t paying her master any mind. She sat nearly under Caliban\u2019s chair. Apparently her tiny little brain had decided that Caliban was the God of All Fallen Food.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Lily murmured. \u201cI trust that won\u2019t happen again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mama,\u201d Indio said, ducking his head.</p><p>\u201cIndio.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head, looking at her pleadingly from his beautiful eyes.</p><p>She hardened her heart. \u201cI mean it. I don\u2019t want you near that pond again\u2014with or without Daffodil.\u201d She inhaled and said more softly, \u201cThink what might\u2019ve happened had Caliban not been there to save Daff.\u201d</p><p>He looked again at the little dog\u2014who had one delicate paw on Caliban\u2019s solid thigh\u2014and swallowed. \u201cYes, Mama. I mean, I won\u2019t go there again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She blew out a breath. Hard to tell if he\u2019d remember his promise the next time the water sang its siren song to him, but she had to hope. Deliberately she lightened her tone. \u201cWhat else did you do today? I vow, I haven\u2019t seen you since luncheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe an\u2019 Daff comed back for tea. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d Indio had pulled his legs into the chair and was kneeling on it again\u2014a habit that she really ought to stop someday. \u201cYou was writing on your\u2014\u201d</p><p>He abruptly stopped speaking and cast a guilty glance at the behemoth beside him. Fortunately, Caliban was taking a bite of Maude\u2019s excellent dumplings and didn\u2019t seem to be paying any attention to their discussion.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Lily murmured, covering for him. \u201cAnd then what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went to the old musician\u2019s gallery but,\u201d he added hastily as her brows began to lower, \u201cwe didn\u2019t go in. An\u2019 then Daff found a toad.\u201d</p><p>Lily glanced at the little dog in alarm. Daffodil now had both paws on Caliban\u2019s thigh and was giving him a tragically pleading look. She really was terribly spoiled. \u201cShe didn\u2019t catch it, did she?\u201d</p><p>Daffodil routinely found the most disgusting things edible.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Indio said sadly, \u201cIt got away. But we did catch a cricket. I was going to keep it in a cage as a pet, but Daff swallowed it before I could. I don\u2019t know why. She didn\u2019t seem to think it tasted very good.\u201d</p><p>Maude snorted. \u201cThat might explain the spewing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot spewing,\u201d Lily murmured to her, sotto voce.</p><p>Maude rolled her eyes. \u201cYou prefer retch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer not discussing it at the dinner table, but nobody seems to be paying me much mind.\u201d Lily turned to Indio. \u201cNow then, I see you\u2019ve finished your supper. I think it\u2019s time for your bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaa-ma,\u201d he whined in the disappointed voice every boy used at the notion of cleanliness. \u201cBut Caliban isn\u2019t done eating.\u201d</p><p>She smiled tightly. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine with Maude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you aren\u2019t done eating, either,\u201d he pointed out earnestly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll finish the rest of my meal later.\u201d</p><p>She rose and walked to the small fireplace, where a kettle had been set long before supper. It was gently steaming now. She caught up a rag and reached for the handle, but another, much bigger, hand got there first.</p><p>Lily gave a tiny jump, watching wide-eyed as Caliban picked up the hot kettle as easily as lifting a twig. At least he\u2019d had enough sense to shield his palm from the heat with a rag.</p><p>He stood blank-faced until she pulled herself together.</p><p>\u201cIn here.\u201d She stepped gingerly around his bulk and led him into the little bedroom. A tin hip bath was waiting, laid beside the bed on some old cloths. It was already half full of cold water. \u201cYou can pour it in there.\u201d</p><p>He lifted the hem of his shirt to hold the bottom of the kettle and she caught an unsettling flash of his stomach.</p><p>Hastily she looked away, her cheeks heating.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d Indio stood in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she said briskly to her son, and then to the man: \u201cThank you for your help. You can go back to the table.\u201d</p><p>Without a word he turned and left the tiny room, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Indio stuck a finger in the bathwater and swirled it around. \u201cWhy d\u2019you talk to Caliban like that?\u201d</p><p>Daffodil trotted over and placed her front paws on the rim of the tub to peer in.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Lily asked absently. She rolled up her sleeves and tested the water with an elbow, making sure it was neither too hot nor too cold. The bath was barely more than a shallow basin. She could use it herself by standing or crouching in it, but she missed the bigger copper half-bath they\u2019d had to sell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLike he can\u2019t understand,\u201d Indio said.</p><p>\u201cStart undressing,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>Indio sighed heavily. \u201cHe can.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hands on her hips and raised an eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cCaliban\u2019s smart,\u201d Indio insisted, his voice only slightly muffled by the shirt over his head. He pulled it all the way off, making his hair stand on end, and looked at her.</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Indio shrugged and sat on the floor to push off his stockings. \u201cI just do.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, thinking. Caliban had presented himself as dull-witted the first time she\u2019d seen him. Was it a ruse? And if so, whyever would...?</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d her son said with all the exasperated patience of a seven-year-old. He\u2019d somehow taken off everything but his smalls while she was woolgathering.</p> <p>\u201cYes, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m old enough to bathe myself.\u201d</p><p>That was actually debatable, since though Indio could wash the more obvious parts of himself\u2014such as his feet\u2014he had the tendency to forget anything else, such as his neck, face, knees, and elbows.</p><p>But she sighed and gave him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll check back in a bit, then, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d he said, scrambling out of his smalls.</p><p>Daffodil immediately attacked them as Indio got in the bath.</p> <p>Lily opened the door. \u201cMaude, would you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut herself off. Maude was nowhere in sight, but Caliban was across the room, holding a page of her play to the light of the fire. His eyes were intent, his brow slightly creased\u2014and he was quite obviously reading the page.</p><p>Quietly she closed the door behind her and folded her arms on her chest as her heart began to beat faster.</p><p>She lifted one eyebrow. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Nine months later the queen was brought to bed with the king\u2019s firstborn. But the child was horribly deformed, with the head, shoulders, and tail of a bull, and the remainder of his body human, the skin overall as black as ebony. When the queen looked between her bloodied thighs at the monster she\u2019d birthed, she fell insensible, never to fully recover her wits thereafter...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>Apollo turned slowly and stared blankly at Miss Stump. He\u2019d been so enthralled by the wit of the play\u2014a play he suspected she\u2019d written\u2014that he hadn\u2019t heard the door open until it was too late. Perhaps if he made no reaction to her words...</p> <p>She huffed and crossed her arms. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, you know. If you\u2019re reading that\u201d\u2014she tilted her chin at the sheet of paper still in his hands\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re no half-wit. Who are you and why have you been pretending to be mute and a fool?\u201d</p><p>Well, it\u2019d been a last-ditch effort anyway\u2014and not a very good one. He let the paper drop to the small side table and crossed his own arms, looking back at her. Whatever she might think, he really couldn\u2019t talk.</p><p>She frowned\u2014rather ferociously for such a small thing. \u201cTell me. Are you in hiding from creditors or the like? What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>That was perilously close to the truth. Best to divert her before her imagination ran wild. He sighed and uncrossed his arms to draw out his notebook. He flipped to a blank page and wrote, I can\u2019t speak.</p><p>He handed the notebook to her.</p><p>She glanced at it and snorted. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once and held out his hand for the notebook.</p><p>She gave it to him. \u201cThen tell me your name at least.\u201d</p><p>He wrote again and showed her the notebook. Caliban will do.</p><p>She studied his writing, her brows knit. \u201cYou really can\u2019t speak?\u201d She looked up. Her voice was softer now, more curious. She handed him back the notebook.</p><p>He shook his head as he wrote. I mean you and yours no harm.</p><p>When he glanced up again, she was watching him intently, and for a moment he stilled. Her lichen-green eyes reflected the candlelight, the light flickering deep within their depths, and it struck him suddenly and without warning how beautiful she was. Not in the common way, with soft cheeks and rounded mouth, but with a sharp little chin and intelligence that fairly radiated out of those light-green eyes.</p><p>If only this were another life\u2014one in which he might impress her with his title or his own verbal wit.</p><p>He blinked and looked down at the notebook in his hand. The page had wrinkled beneath the clench of his fingers. He was in hiding, his title of no consequence under the circumstances, and he couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>She\u2019d tilted her head to read the notebook, seemingly unaware of his thoughts, and for a moment she was very close to him.</p><p>He inhaled the scent of her hair: orange and clove.</p><p>She glanced up and took a step back, suddenly wary. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t said why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. Indio was correct: I\u2019m a gardener.</p><p>She took the notebook to read his writing; then, before he thought to stop her, she was flipping back through the pages.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than a simple gardener, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She sank into the old settee, seemingly not noticing how the thing rocked unsteadily beneath her.</p><p>Apollo wasn\u2019t going to risk the fragile piece of furniture beneath his weight. He crossed to the round table and brought back one of the chairs. She was examining his sketch of the pond with the bridge in the background when he returned. He placed the chair across from her and sat.</p><p>She turned the page slowly, tracing her fingers over the next sketch: a study of an ornamental waterfall. \u201cThese are lovely. Will the garden really look like this when you\u2019ve finished with it?\u201d</p><p>He waited until she glanced at him, then nodded.</p><p>Her brows knit as she turned another page. The next one showed a wide, craggy oak at the foot of the bridge. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Where did Mr. Harte find you? I think I would\u2019ve known if there were a mute gardener of your talents in London.\u201d</p><p>There was no way to answer that without giving himself away. She waited a beat and then turned the page again. The drawing here caught her eye, and she pivoted the notebook, examining the sketch. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Parallel lines took up both pages across the open notebook, some intersecting, some leading nowhere. A few of the lines were wavy. Here and there a circle or square sat in spaces between the lines.</p><p>He leaned closer, inhaling orange and clove, and wrote along one side of the page, next to the sketch, A maze.</p><p>\u201cOh! Oh, I see.\u201d She cocked her head, examining the diagram. \u201cBut what are these?\u201d She pointed to a square and then a circle.</p><p>Follies\u2014places for lovers to sit or amusements like the waterfall. Things to gaze upon and amaze the viewer.</p><p>\u201cAnd these?\u201d She traced the wavy lines.</p><p>He inhaled quickly, excited that she was interested, frustrated that he couldn\u2019t just tell her.</p><p>Quickly he reached over and flipped through the pages of the notebook still in her hands. He found a blank one and ripped it out, then turned back to his diagram of the maze. He wrote swiftly on his knee, the pencil nearly poking through the paper in several places. The wavy lines are the parts of the hedge that I can salvage from the fire. The plants that are still living.</p><p>He showed her his words, waited while she read, her brows knit, and when she looked up, snatched the paper back before she could say anything.</p><p>The solid lines will be new plantings. The maze will be the centerpiece of the new garden. The pond on one side, the theater on another, so that from the theater one will look across the maze to the pond. There may be viewing places in the theater itself so that visitors may see the maze and those within it. It will be\u2014</p><p>The pencil finally broke through the paper at this point. He balled his fist, frustrated, the words bottled up inside him.</p><p>Slim fingers covered his fist, cool and comforting.</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be beautiful.\u201d</p><p>His breath seemed to stop in his lungs. Her eyes were so big, so earnest, so completely captivated by his trifling drawings, his esoteric work. So few were interested in what he did\u2014even Asa began to fidget after only minutes if Apollo tried to explain his plans for the garden.</p><p>Yet this gamine woman looked at him as if he were a sorcerer.</p><p>He wondered if she had any idea how seductive her very interest was.</p><p>She blinked and drew back as if conscious that she\u2019d let too much show. \u201cAnd amazing. And wonderful. I\u2019ll look forward to wandering your maze, though I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll never figure it out\u2014I\u2019m terrible at puzzles. I\u2019ll need to bring a guide, I think. Perhaps\u2014\u201d</p><p>The outer door opened at that point and Miss Stump jumped up from the settee. \u201cOh, Maude, wherever have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown to the dock to get those eels the wherryman promised me.\u201d Maude set a basket\u2014presumably containing the aforementioned eels\u2014on the table. \u201cMissed me, did you?\u201d Her brows rose as she glanced at the notebook Apollo had reclaimed. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Miss Stump sent him an ironic glance. \u201cCaliban isn\u2019t nearly as foolish as he was making us believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he can talk?\u201d</p><p>Both women looked at him and Apollo could feel the heat burn his neck.</p><p>\u201cNo, he can\u2019t.\u201d Miss Stump cleared her throat. \u201cIndio\u2019s in his bath. I\u2019d better see if he\u2019s remembered to wash his ears\u2014or if he\u2019s flooded the floor again.\u201d</p><p>She hurried into the back room.</p><p>Maude began unpacking her eels. \u201cBrought back some water from the river to wash the dishes. It\u2019s by the door, if\u2019n you want to bring it in.\u201d</p><p>Apollo pocketed his notebook and went to fetch the water. Had he known that they needed it, he\u2019d have offered to go down to the river.</p><p>He set the bucket of water by the fireplace to warm, conscious that the old woman was watching him.</p><p>When he turned she pinned him with a gimlet gaze. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a tongue and my Lily says as how you\u2019re not stupid, so you mind telling me why you can\u2019t speak?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth\u2014even after nine months it was an automatic reaction. After all, he\u2019d spent eight and twenty years opening his mouth and having speech emerge\u2014without thought or effort. Such a simple thing. A mundane, everyday thing, speech, the thing that set men apart from the animals.</p><p>Lost\u2014perhaps forever\u2014to him now.</p><p>So he opened his mouth and then didn\u2019t know what to do, for he\u2019d tried before, tried for days and weeks, and all that had occurred was a damnably sore throat. He thought of that day, of the boot shoved into his neck, of the Bedlam guard leering down at him as he threatened hell, and he could actually feel his throat closing, cutting off hope and humanity and the power of speech.</p><p>\u201cMaude!\u201d Miss Stump was there now and he had no idea what she saw on his face, but she was frowning fiercely\u2014at the maidservant. \u201cStop badgering him, please. He can\u2019t talk. Perhaps it doesn\u2019t really matter why.\u201d</p><p>It might make him a weakling, but he took her defense gratefully. A part of him railed against his own cowardliness. A man\u2014even a man without the power of speech\u2014shouldn\u2019t hide behind a woman\u2019s skirts. Apollo ducked his head, avoiding both women\u2019s gazes as he strode to the door. This had been a mistake\u2014he\u2019d known it from the first. He should never have given in to the temptation to come here. To try to associate with other folk as if he were a normal man still.</p><p>A small, damp hand caught Apollo as he made for the door, and such was his disquiet, he nearly pulled away.</p><p>But he remembered in time and stopped.</p><p>Indio looked up at him, his hair in wet spirals, dripping onto his nightshirt. The boy had his brows drawn together, but underneath his stern expression there was hurt. \u201cAre you leaving?</p><p>Apollo nodded.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Indio let go of Apollo\u2019s hand and chewed his bottom lip. \u201cAre you coming back? Daff wants you to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since Daffodil was presently asleep on the hearth, this seemed extremely unlikely.</p><p>Apollo frowned, not knowing how to reply. He shouldn\u2019t return. It was a danger to himself\u2014and not only in the sense that his identity might be discovered.</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d Miss Stump\u2019s voice was quiet, but when he glanced at her, her expression was firm.</p><p>He held her green gaze a moment more and then looked back at the boy and nodded.</p> <p>The reaction was immediate and overwhelming. Indio\u2019s face was taken over by his grin and the boy surged forward as if about to hug him. Only at the last minute did he pull himself back and hold out a hand instead.</p><p>Apollo\u2019s palm engulfed the boy\u2019s but he shook Indio\u2019s hand as if he were a duke in velvet instead of a seven-year-old in damp linen, with bare feet.</p><p>He wished he could say something, but in the end all he did was nod again and walk out the door.</p><p>Still, he heard the old maidservant as she spoke to Miss Stump: \u201cYou\u2019re a fool.\u201d</p><p>THE PROBLEM WITH writing witty dialogue, Lily thought bitterly the next afternoon, was that ideally one should actually be witty in order to write wittily.</p> <p>At the moment Lily felt about as witty as Daffodil\u2014who was chasing a fly. As Lily watched, the little dog jumped on the old settee and snapped at the fly, missed\u2014again\u2014and nearly toppled off the back.</p><p>Lily groaned and laid her head in her folded arms. It was a sad thing indeed when one felt as intelligent as Daffodil.</p><p>\u201cUncle Edwin!\u201d Indio had for once stayed close to the theater and his shout of ecstasy could be clearly heard through the door.</p><p>Lily hastily tidied her writing table, straightening the papers and picking up a quill that had fallen to the floor.</p><p>A second later the door to the theater burst open and Edwin Stump ducked inside, a wrapped parcel under his arm. He didn\u2019t duck because he was so very big\u2014he stood but a few inches taller than Lily herself\u2014but because he was carrying his nephew on his shoulders.</p><p>Maude trailed behind with the remains of their washing in a basket. The maidservant glared sourly at Edwin.</p> <p>\u201cOof!\u201d Edwin exclaimed as he tumbled Indio onto the settee and set his package by it. Daffodil immediately leaped on the boy, licking his giggling face. Edwin turned to Lily, his hand pressed dramatically to the small of his back. \u201cI think he\u2019s put on a stone or more since I last saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap you should visit more often,\u201d Lily said, rising. She crossed to hug her brother and then stood back to examine his face.</p><p>Edwin Stump was eight years her senior, and looked nothing like her. This was probably the result of their having different fathers. Mother had been in her heyday as a leading actress when she\u2019d started increasing with Edwin. He was the result of a happy liaison with the younger son of an earl. Eight years later, gin and happenstance had taken their toll on Lizzy Stump. By that time her beauty had been ravaged by drink and disappointment, the earl\u2019s younger son was long gone, and she no longer commanded the lead\u2014or even a secondary role\u2014in plays. As a result Lily had been conceived after a night of drinking with a common porter\u2014a fact her mother was apt to bring up in moments of high emotion.</p><p>Edwin had a long, thin face, dominated by black arching brows that stood out like signposts of his temperament in his fair complexion. His smile was a V of merriment with more than a dash of mischievousness, completely impossible to ignore. His black eyes could dance with joyous spirits or glower with ill intent\u2014and they were quick to change. Lily had more than once heard Maude muttering under her breath that Edwin was the Devil\u2019s bastard\u2014as much fey as mortal. Lily had to admit that if she believed in such nonsense she\u2019d think Edwin a magical creature herself.</p><p>He had, after all, saved her on more than one occasion from her mother\u2019s drunken neglect when she was a girl.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d Lily asked.</p><p>\u201cHave you anything stronger?\u201d Edwin threw himself on the settee beside Daffodil and Indio.</p><p>The settee wobbled ominously and Lily sent it a worried glance. \u201cWe have wine,\u201d she said reluctantly. Edwin\u2019s jaw was unshaven, his bristles in dark contrast to his snowy wig.</p> <p>\u201cThen pour me a glass, there\u2019s a lass.\u201d He smiled at her winsomely.</p><p>She went to where the bottle stood on the mantel, ignoring Maude\u2019s tutting.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Edwin said when he took the glass from her fingers. He swallowed a sip and winced. \u201cGood Lord, that tastes like\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lily widened her eyes and looked pointedly at Indio.</p><p>\u201cA mud puddle,\u201d Edwin finished smoothly.</p><p>\u201cIck,\u201d Indio said with interest. \u201cCan I taste it?\u201d</p><p>Edwin tapped him on the nose. \u201cNot for another year at the very least.\u201d</p><p>Lily cleared her throat.</p><p>Edwin rounded his eyes at Indio. \u201cMaybe even two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBollocks,\u201d her son said, making Lily choke in shock.</p><p>\u201cIndio!\u201d</p><p>But Edwin was laughing so hard he was spilling his wine, much to the delight of Daffodil, who was lapping it up off the settee.</p><p>\u201cHere now.\u201d Thankfully Maude intervened. \u201cBest come outside, Indio, you and Daffodil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to remember...\u201d Edwin looked theatrically about the room. \u201cAh!\u201d He picked up the parcel he\u2019d earlier left by the settee. \u201cThis might be for you, young nephew.\u201d</p><p>Indio eagerly took the parcel and unwrapped it, revealing a toy wooden boat, cloth sails and all.</p><p>Indio looked up, his mismatched eyes shining. \u201cThank you, Uncle Edwin!\u201d</p><p>Her brother waved a hand magnanimously. \u201cThink nothing of it, scamp. No doubt you\u2019ll want to try it out in that pond I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only with Maude nearby,\u201d Lily said hastily.</p><p>\u201cOr Caliban?\u201d Indio asked.</p><p>Lily hesitated for a moment, but the big man had been exceptionally gentle with her son last night. \u201cOr Caliban,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cHuzzah!\u201d Indio rushed from the theater, chased by a barking Daffodil.</p><p>Maude gave her a look that promised a talk later on and then followed her charge.</p><p>Lily sighed, taking a seat on one of the wooden chairs from the table. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have spent so much on him.\u201d</p><p>Her brother shrugged carelessly. \u201cIt was hardly a king\u2019s ransom.\u201d</p><p>And yet the money could\u2019ve been better spent on clothes or food. Lily pushed the thought aside. Edwin had never been frugal with his money and a boy needed a treat once in a while as much as clothes and food.</p><p>He grinned at her as if he could tell the path of her thoughts. \u201cWho is Caliban? An imaginary friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s quite real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Caliban is truly his name?\u201d Her brother\u2019s eyebrows were high arches of curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWell, no\u2014not that we know of, anyway. He\u2019s a gardener here. Indio has taken to following him about.\u201d</p><p>But Caliban was much more than that, Lily realized as she pleated her skirt between her fingertips. She remembered those huge hands, deftly holding his pencil as he impatiently wrote. Those beautifully airy sketches in his notebook. It was laughable, really, that she\u2019d at first taken him for an idiot. It was only the day after his confession and she couldn\u2019t think of him as anything but intelligent. Wonderfully intelligent.</p><p>And for some reason she didn\u2019t want to discuss the big, gentle gardener with her sometimes devious brother. She glanced up at him. \u201cWill you sup with us?\u201d</p><p>His own look was swift and calculating, but he took her abrupt change of subject meekly enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, no.\u201d Edwin got up to pour himself more wine. \u201cI have an appointment I must keep this evening.\u201d He took another swallow of the wine and then turned one of his most charming smiles on her. \u201cI came to see how the play is going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerribly.\u201d She groaned and slumped in her chair. \u201cI can\u2019t think how I ever wrote dialogue before\u2014it\u2019s so wooden, Edwin! Perhaps I should burn it and start over.\u201d</p><p>Usually this was the point at which her brother teased her out of her doubts, but he was oddly silent.</p><p>She straightened, looking at him.</p><p>He was grimacing into his wineglass. \u201cAs to that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing really, but I promised to have the play done by next week. I have a buyer who wants to use it for a house party theatrical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She gasped, feeling her chest tighten. For a moment she wondered if the house party the play was intended for was the same one she herself was to act at, but then sheer panic swamped the thought. However was she to finish in a week?</p><p>Edwin grimaced, his mobile mouth stretching into a comical shape. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve had a bit of bad luck at cards lately. I need my portion of the play proceeds and this is a quick sale. Apparently the buyer had originally engaged Mimsford to write the play, but the old sod has fled London and his creditors.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d made a bargain years ago, when Lily had started writing plays: Edwin would take the plays and sell the works under his name. He was both a man and a much better salesman than she. He knew how to float on the fringes of aristocratic society\u2014something Lily had never wanted to do\u2014and thus had myriad associates. Their arrangement had worked very well in the past. She and Edwin had made a tidy sum together. But now she was at the end of her resources and had begun to wonder if she should try selling her plays herself. Of course that wasn\u2019t very fair to Edwin...</p><p>She shook her head, trying to think. \u201cWhom do you owe, Edwin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take that tone with me.\u201d He stood suddenly and tossed back the rest of the wine in the glass. \u201cIt\u2019s insulting.\u201d He glanced slyly at her. \u201cAnd it reminds me of our dear mother.\u201d</p><p>That sent a guilty chill down her spine. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He darted over and knelt in front of her chair, taking her hands. \u201cDarling, it\u2019s nothing to worry about, truly. Just finish the play, hmm? Quick as you can.\u201d He squeezed her hands and bussed her cheek. \u201cYou know you\u2019re the best. Far better than that hack Mimsford, and he\u2019s had two smash hits in a row at the Royal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Edwin,\u201d she said helplessly, \u201cwhat if I can\u2019t write that fast?\u201d</p><p>She saw his eyes darken before he dropped his gaze. \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to find some other means of ready blunt. Perhaps Indio\u2019s father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was her turn to squeeze his hands. Her heart had begun to beat in terror against her rib cage. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll not approach him, Edwin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must allow he\u2019s very rich\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He made a discontented moue. \u201cBut I need to pay my creditors somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll finish the play,\u201d she said, dropping his hands.</p><p>He looked up at her through his eyelashes. They really were quite long, she thought absently. They almost gave him an innocent demeanor.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>\u201cBy next week.\u201d His voice was light, but no less hard for it.</p><p>\u201cBy next week,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cSplendid!\u201d He kissed her again, on both cheeks, and rose to dance across the room, his good humor restored. \u201cThank you, darling. That\u2019s a load off my mind. Now I really must dash. I\u2019ll be back next week to pick up the manuscript, shall I?\u201d</p><p>And he was out the door before she could say anything.</p><p>Lily stared stupidly at the door. However was she to finish her play in a week?</p><p>\u201cWHY,\u201d ASKED ARTEMIS Batten, the Duchess of Wakefield, \u201care we hiding in a ruined musician\u2019s gallery?\u201d</p><p>Apollo grinned fondly at his twin sister. A duchess only five months and she swanned about as if born to the role. She wore some type of dark-green costume with wide lace ruffles at the sleeves that even he could tell was outrageously expensive. Her brown hair was bound up neatly at her nape and her dark-gray eyes were calm and happy\u2014a wonderful improvement over the four years when she used to visit him in Bedlam. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then her eyes had been filled with sick despair.</p><p>He took out his notebook and wrote, Don\u2019t want you to be seen by the other gardeners and Indio.</p><p>She frowned over his words as he dug into the wicker basket she\u2019d brought with her: a new shirt\u2014thank God\u2014some socks and a hat and a smaller, cloth-wrapped parcel filled with lovely food.</p><p>After Bedlam, he\u2019d never take any sort of food for granted again.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Indio?\u201d Artemis asked, quite reasonably, as he bit into an apple.</p><p>He held the apple between his teeth\u2014ignoring his sister\u2019s wrinkled nose\u2014as he wrote: Small, very inquisitive boy with a dog, a nursemaid, and a curious mother.</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up as he crunched the apple. \u201cThey live here?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cIn the garden?\u201d She glanced around at the charred, crumbling walls of the musician\u2019s gallery. In front of the gallery was a row of marble pillars, which had once supported a roof over a covered walkway. The roof had caved in during the fire, leaving only the crumbling pillars. Apollo had plans for those pillars. With a little scouring, and a judicial blow from a mallet here and there, they would become very picturesque ruins. Right now, though, they were just gloomy, blackened fingers against the sky.</p> <p>He\u2019d commandeered one of the rooms behind the gallery, where once the musicians, dancers, and pantomime players had prepared for their performances. Here he\u2019d propped a big, oiled tarp over one corner to keep out the rain and wind, and brought in a straw mattress and two chairs. Spartan accommodations, certainly, but there were no fleas or bedbugs, which made this heaven compared to Bedlam.</p><p>Apollo took back his notebook and scrawled: They live in the theater. She\u2019s an actress\u2014Robin Goodfellow. Harte has given her his permission to stay here for the nonce.</p><p>\u201cYou know Robin Goodfellow?\u201d For a second Artemis\u2019s ducal dignity fled her and she looked as awed as a small lass given a halfpenny sweet.</p><p>Apollo decided he needed to find out more about Miss Stump\u2019s acting career. He nodded warily.</p><p>Artemis had already recovered her aplomb. \u201cAs I remember, Robin Goodfellow is quite young\u2014not more than thirty years, certainly.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged carelessly, but alas, his sister had known him for a very, very long time.</p> <p>Artemis leaned forward, her interest definitely engaged. \u201cShe must be witty, too, to play all those lovely breeches roles\u2014\u201d</p><p>Breeches roles? Those tended to be risqu\u00e9. Apollo frowned, but his sister was nattering on.</p><p>\u201cI saw her in something last spring, here at Harte\u2019s Folly with Cousin Penelope. What was it?\u201d She knit her brow, thinking, then shook her head. \u201cI suppose it doesn\u2019t matter. Have you talked to her?\u201d</p><p>Apollo glanced pointedly at his notebook.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He skirted the truth: My circumstances don\u2019t lend themselves to polite social calls.</p><p>Artemis\u2019s mouth crimped. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. You can\u2019t continue to hide forever\u2014\u201d</p><p>He widened his eyes incredulously at her.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t,\u201d she insisted. \u201cYou must find a way to live your life, Apollo. If that means leaving London, leaving England, then so be it. This\u201d\u2014she gestured to the tarp and chairs and straw mattress\u2014\u201cthis isn\u2019t living. Not truly.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the notebook and scribbled furiously. What would you have me do? I need the money I invested in the garden.</p><p>\u201cBorrow from Wakefield.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed, turning his head aside. The last thing he wanted was to be in debt to his brother-in-law.</p><p>Artemis raised her voice stubbornly. \u201cHe\u2019ll gladly lend you the money you need. Leave. Travel to the continent or the Colonies. The King\u2019s men won\u2019t pursue you so far, not if you take another name.\u201d</p><p>He looked back at her and wrote angrily, You would have me abandon the name I have?</p><p>\u201cIf needs be, yes.\u201d She was so brave, his sister, so determined. \u201cI hadn\u2019t wanted to mention this before, but I think I might\u2019ve been followed.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her in alarm. Followed here today?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut on other days I\u2019ve come to visit you. Once or twice I thought a man was following me.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cNever the same man, mind, so it may be I\u2019ve entirely made the thing up.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that look,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure\u2014I\u2019m still not sure\u2014but don\u2019t you see? If I was followed, if someone were to discover your hiding place... Apollo, you simply can\u2019t stay here. You must leave the garden. Leave England. For your own safety.\u201d</p><p>He blinked and stared down at his notebook, the paper smudged from his hand. He wrote carefully, I cannot. I didn\u2019t do it, Artemis.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know. But you don\u2019t have any way of proving it, do you?\u201d</p><p>He was silent\u2014which was answer enough, he supposed.</p><p>She placed a hand on his arm. \u201cThis stubborn refusal to leave England will be the death of you or worse.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cPlease. You\u2019re kind and smart and... and wonderful. You didn\u2019t deserve Bedlam and you don\u2019t deserve this awful half life. Please don\u2019t let\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned his shoulder to her, but that had never stopped his sister when she was on a tear.</p><p>\u201cApollo. Please don\u2019t let obsession or... or revenge consume you. A name is important, I know, but it\u2019s not nearly as important as you. Don\u2019t let me lose my brother.\u201d</p><p>At that he did look up to see\u2014oh, God, no\u2014that her eyes were glittering. That he simply could not stand. He reached out and took her hand in his, the feel of it familiar and calming.</p><p>She inhaled. \u201cJust promise me you\u2019ll not give up on life.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together, but nodded firmly.</p><p>She smiled tremulously. \u201cBesides, perhaps with this Robin Goodfellow about you\u2019ll find something else to find interest in. She\u2019s quite pretty, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Pretty wasn\u2019t the right word. Gamine, sly, seductive... his brain stuttered on the last and for a moment he thought he\u2019d give himself away. How fortuitous that he\u2019d been practicing a dumb face. Apollo used it now on his sister, who retaliated by laughing and flinging an apple at him.</p><p>He caught it deftly and wrote, How is His Grace the Ass?</p><p>She frowned over the notebook as he\u2019d known she would. \u201cYou really must stop calling him that. He did, after all, save you from Bedlam.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and wrote, And then chained me in his sinister cellar. I\u2019d be there still if you hadn\u2019t released me.</p><p>She sniffed. \u201c \u2019Tisn\u2019t sinister\u2014especially now that he\u2019s using most of it to store wine. Maximus is well, thank you for inquiring. He sends his regards.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look.</p><p>\u201cHe does!\u201d She tried to appear convincing, but he merely shook his head at her. Had it not been for Artemis\u2019s persuasion\u2014and Wakefield\u2019s regard for her\u2014Apollo would still be languishing in Bedlam. Wakefield had certainly not freed him because he thought Apollo sane\u2014or innocent.</p><p>Artemis heaved a sigh. \u201cHe\u2019s not nearly as awful as you make him out to be\u2014and I love him. For my sake, you ought to take a more charitable disposition toward my husband.\u201d</p><p>Apollo privately wondered how many times Wakefield had heard the inverse of this little speech, but he nodded at his sister anyway. There really was no point in arguing the matter with her.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed for a moment as if she found his capitulation too easy, then she nodded in return. \u201cGood. Someday I\u2019d like you two to be friends, or,\u201d she added hastily as he cocked an incredulous eyebrow, \u201cat least polite to one another.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother replying to that. Instead Apollo rummaged in the bundle of foodstuffs further. There was a big loaf of bread and he brought it out and set it on a piece of wood to slice.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s actually another matter I needed to talk to you about,\u201d his sister said, her voice unusually hesitant.</p><p>Apollo looked up.</p><p>She was turning an apple around and around in her fingers. \u201cMaximus heard it from someone\u2014I suspect Craven, because for a valet, he certainly seems to know everything about everyone. It\u2019s just a rumor, of course, but I thought I should tell you anyway.\u201d</p><p>He abandoned the bread and placed a fingertip under her chin to make her look at him.</p><p>He cocked his head in question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the earl,\u201d she said, meeting his eyes.</p><p>For a moment his mind went blank. What earl? Then, naturally, it came to him: the unsmiling old man in a black full-bottomed wig who\u2019d come to see him once\u2014only once\u2014to inform him that as the man\u2019s heir he was to be sent away to school. The old man had stunk of vinegar and lavender and he\u2019d had the same eyes as Apollo.</p><p>Apollo had loathed him on sight.</p><p>He stared into his sister\u2019s eyes\u2014thankfully the dark gray of their mother\u2019s\u2014and waited.</p><p>She took both his hands, giving him strength as she said, \u201cHe\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The king saw what his wife had birthed and drew back his arm to kill the monster, but his priest stayed his hand. \u201cIt is rumored that the people of this island once worshipped a god in the shape of a great black bull. Better, my liege, to let this thing live than risk offending such an ancient power.\u201d...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>Captain James Trevillion glanced at the small brass clock on the table next to his chair. Four fifteen. Time to return to his charge. Carefully he placed a lopsided cross-stitch bookmark between the pages of the book he was reading: The History of the Long Captivity and Adventures of Thomas Pellow. He picked up his two pistols and shoved them securely into the holsters of the wide leather bandoliers that crisscrossed his chest. Then he reached for the cane.</p><p>The damnable cane.</p><p>It was plain, made of hardwood, with a wide head. Trevillion leaned heavily on the cane, bracing his crippled right leg as he heaved himself to his feet. He paused a moment to adjust to standing, ignoring the ache that shot through the leg. The ache was bone-deep, which made sense, since it was a bone of that leg that\u2019d been broken\u2014not once, but twice, the second time catastrophically.</p><p>It was the second break that had cost him his army career in the dragoons. The Duke of Wakefield had offered him another job instead\u2014although Trevillion still wasn\u2019t entirely sure if he should be grateful for that offer or not.</p><p>He glanced out the window as he waited for the ache in his leg to die down. He could see several gardeners laboring over a crate in the back garden. As he watched, the top was pried off, revealing rows of what looked like sticks packed in straw.</p><p>Trevillion raised his brows.</p><p>He pivoted gingerly and limped out his door and into a hallway in Wakefield House\u2014the duke\u2019s London residence. His room was at the back of the house, at the end of one of the corridors. Not a servant\u2019s room, certainly, but not a guest\u2019s, either.</p><p>Trevillion\u2019s mouth quirked. He lived in a strange limbo between.</p><p>It took him five excruciating minutes to negotiate the stairs down to the floor below. Just as well that the duke had been so generous with his living situation.</p><p>The servants had the topmost fifth floor of Wakefield House.</p><p>He could hear feminine laughter now as he laboriously approached the Achilles Salon. Quietly he pushed open the tall, pink-painted doors. Inside, three ladies sat close together, the ruins of a full tea service on the low table before them.</p><p>As he began limping toward them, the youngest, a pretty, plump, brown-haired girl, turned in his direction a full second before the other ladies looked up as well.</p><p>He marveled at how Lady Phoebe Batten was always the first to be aware of his presence. She was blind, after all.</p><p>\u201cMy warder comes for me,\u201d she said lightly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPhoebe,\u201d Lady Hero Reading whispered, chiding. She was the middle Wakefield sibling\u2014younger sister of the duke, elder of Lady Phoebe\u2014but the two women looked nothing alike. Lady Hero was taller than her sister, with a willowy figure and flame-colored hair. No doubt she thought he couldn\u2019t hear her undertone, but alas, he could. Not that it mattered. He was fully aware of what his charge thought of him and his duties.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you have a seat?\u201d the third member of the tea party asked kindly. Her Grace the Duchess of Wakefield, Artemis Batten, was an ordinary-looking woman\u2014excepting her rather fine dark-gray eyes\u2014but she held herself with all the command of a duchess. If one were unaware of her history, one would never guess that she\u2019d served as an impoverished lady\u2019s companion to her distant cousin until her marriage to the duke.</p><p>A formidable lady indeed.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d Trevillion nodded and chose a chair a discreet distance from the trio. However much she hated it, it was his job to watch over and protect Lady Phoebe. Obviously he wasn\u2019t needed when she was with her sister and sister-in-law\u2014or indeed anywhere in Wakefield House\u2014but should she wish to go out after tea, he was bound to accompany her.</p> <p>Whether she liked it or not.</p><p>Lady Hero rose. \u201cI ought to get back to Sebastian anyway. No doubt he\u2019s woken from his afternoon nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d Lady Phoebe pouted, then immediately brightened. \u201cWe\u2019ll take tea next week at your house\u2014preferably in the nursery.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero laughed gently. \u201cI fear taking tea with an infant and a small child in leading strings is a messy business at best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessy or not, Phoebe and I look forward to seeing our nephews,\u201d the duchess said.</p> <p>\u201cThen please come.\u201d Lady Hero smiled ruefully. \u201cBut don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you when you leave with mashed peas in your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA small price to pay to spend time with Sweet William and baby Sebastian,\u201d Her Grace murmured. \u201cCome, I\u2019ll see you to the door. I\u2019ll be leaving shortly anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d Lady Phoebe\u2019s eyebrows drew together. \u201cBut you were gone this morning as well\u2014quite mysteriously, too. Where are you off to now?\u201d</p><p>It was small, but Trevillion caught it\u2014a slight waver in the duchess\u2019s gaze, swiftly corrected before she replied. \u201cJust to visit Mrs. Makepeace at the orphanage. I shan\u2019t be long\u2014I\u2019ll certainly return by supper, if Maximus ever emerges from his study and wonders where his wife has gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe spends entirely too much time in there. Truly Parliament won\u2019t fall apart if he takes one day away.\u201d Lady Hero bent to buss her sister on her cheek. \u201cNext week, then? Or shall I see you at the Ombridges\u2019 soiree?\u201d</p><p>Lady Phoebe sighed heavily. \u201cMaximus says I can\u2019t attend. Too crowded, it seems.\u201d</p> <p>Lady Hero darted a glance at the duchess, standing behind Lady Phoebe. The duchess\u2019s mouth flattened as she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sure to be a terrible bore,\u201d Lady Hero said cheerfully. \u201cA crush like that. You wouldn\u2019t like it anyway.\u201d</p><p>Trevillion felt his own mouth tighten as he looked away in irritation. Lady Hero was trying to soften the blow, he knew, but she was going about it in the wrong way. He\u2019d not been serving as Lady Phoebe\u2019s bodyguard for long\u2014only since just before Christmas\u2014but in that time he\u2019d come to realize that the girl loved social events. Musicales, balls, afternoon tea parties, anything with people. She lit up when she was at these gatherings. But her elder brother, Maximus Batten, Duke of Wakefield, had decreed that such outings were too dangerous for Lady Phoebe. Thus she went to very few social events outside her family\u2014and those were carefully vetted.</p><p>Trevillion shifted, scraping his stick against the floor. Lady Phoebe swiveled her head, looking in his direction.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI believe, my lady, that the rose canes you ordered have arrived. I noticed the gardeners unpacking them. I don\u2019t suppose they need your supervision, but if you have an opinion on where they\u2019re planted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so at once?\u201d Lady Phoebe was already moving, her fingertips trailing and tapping lightly along the backs of chairs as she walked. She halted at the door and half turned, not quite looking in his direction. \u201cWell? Do come on, Captain Trevillion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d He rose as briskly as he was able and limped toward her.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, dearest.\u201d Lady Hero touched her sister\u2019s shoulder as she passed by Lady Phoebe on the way out the door. \u201cTry not to be so impatient.\u201d</p> <p>Lady Phoebe merely rolled her eyes.</p><p>The duchess tucked her chin as if hiding a smile. \u201cEnjoy your roses.\u201d</p><p>Then both she and Lady Hero were gone and he was alone with his charge.</p><p>She tilted her head, listening as he drew near. \u201cThey\u2019re in the back garden? How did the canes look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw them from my window, my lady,\u201d he said as he drew abreast of her. \u201cI couldn\u2019t ascertain their condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She pivoted and began walking toward the stairs, her fingertips trailing along the wall.</p><p>He always felt a twinge of fear when she neared the staircase\u2014it was wide and curving, and made of highly polished marble. But he\u2019d learned after a few brief spats early in his employment that Lady Phoebe did not wish to be helped down the stairs. Indeed, despite his qualms, she\u2019d never so much as faltered on them in his presence.</p><p>Still, he watched intently as she began her descent, ready to grab her arm should she waver.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hovering,\u201d she said without turning.</p><p>\u201cHovering is my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s debatable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, it isn\u2019t,\u201d he said, flatly.</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d They\u2019d reached the ground floor now and she turned to walk toward the back of the house.</p><p>He grimaced as he took the last step overly hard on his bad leg.</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn, but he noticed that she slowed her pace for him.</p><p>He limped grimly after.</p><p>Outside, a wide, paved terrace ran along the entire back of the house. Beyond was a formal garden, the flower beds mostly dormant at this time of year. There were two gardeners plus the young boy who helped them. All three came to attention as Lady Phoebe appeared.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019lady,\u201d the eldest, a gnarled specimen of a man, called to give her their direction.</p><p>\u201cGivens,\u201d Lady Phoebe said. \u201cNever tell me you\u2019re planting without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, m\u2019lady,\u201d the other gardener replied. He could\u2019ve been Givens\u2019s twenty-years-younger twin, they looked that much alike. In fact, Trevillion suspected that they were in some way related. He made a mental note to find out how.</p><p>\u201cWe was jus\u2019 lookin\u2019 over the canes,\u201d Givens said.</p><p>\u201cAnd how are they?\u201d Lady Phoebe started forward. The canes had been laid out on the lawn between the flower beds.</p><p>Trevillion cursed under his breath and lengthened his stride, his stick thumping on the paving stones. He caught up to her just as she neared the shallow steps that led down to the garden.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, my lady.\u201d He took her arm without waiting for her reply.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I do?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>There was not much point in answering that question, so he merely said, \u201cThe grass begins here.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, keeping her head high as he led her toward the gardeners. \u201cA pity that Artemis couldn\u2019t stay to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d He glanced down at her, eyes narrowing. \u201cStrange that you were unaware of where she went this morning.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed the duchess often makes mysterious errands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re implying, Captain Trevillion, I don\u2019t think I like it.\u201d</p><p>He sighed silently as they made the gardeners and she pointedly turned her attention to them and the rose canes.</p><p>He watched, leaning heavily on his walking stick, and wondered if she really had no idea. Lady Phoebe was close to her sister-in-law\u2014very close. She must know that the duchess had a twin brother, Apollo Greaves, Lord Kilbourne, who had recently escaped from Bedlam\u2014and was still on the run from the King\u2019s men.</p><p>Did she know, however, why Lord Kilbourne had been committed to Bedlam? Did she know about the bloody triple murder that had been hushed up when the aristocrat was locked away? Perhaps she\u2019d never heard\u2014she was a sheltered lady, after all. Or perhaps she knew and had chosen to forget the four-year-old scandal.</p><p>Trevillion found it impossible to forget. Four years ago he\u2019d arrested Lord Kilbourne.</p><p>And Kilbourne had been drenched in the blood of his friends.</p><p>HE COULD NEVER claim the title if he was wanted for a murder he hadn\u2019t committed.</p><p>The next day Apollo hacked savagely at a small tree with his curved pruning knife, welcoming the stretch and burn of his muscles. Why should it matter? The title had never been important to him. If anything, it had meant separation from his sister\u2014his family\u2014when he was a schoolboy. Apollo snorted. The earl hadn\u2019t cared if his son\u2019s family ate or had proper clothes, but by damnation his son\u2019s heir\u2014and thus his own\u2014would be expensively educated.</p><p>He paused to wipe away the sweat on his brow. There was no logical reason for him to care about the title. Except...</p><p>Except that it was one more thing stolen from him because of the murders.</p><p>He grunted and had lifted his arm to attack the tree again when he heard it: a gruff voice mumbling.</p><p>Apollo raised his head, glancing around. He was on the far side of the pond, in quite a deserted area of the garden. The other gardeners had been set the task of clearing dead trees near the musician\u2019s gallery. He\u2019d been half expecting Indio and Daffodil to find him today, but so far they hadn\u2019t.</p><p>And the voice didn\u2019t sound at all like Indio\u2019s.</p><p>Curious, he stuck the pruning knife into the wide belt at his waist and crept around the tree he\u2019d been assaulting. He and the other gardeners had made some headway on the area of the garden between the pond and the theater, but here, on the far side of the pond, all was still wild chaos. Clumps of burned trees stood here and there, with the remains of hedges trailing throughout. The voice was growing louder as he neared, and appeared to be coming from behind one of the few hedges still growing.</p><p>Cautiously he ventured nearer, peering around the remains of a big tree.</p><p>\u201c \u2018... Or consider yourself a knave, my lord,\u2019 \u201d Miss Stump was muttering to herself in an artificially low voice. She paced before a fallen tree on which a flat board had been laid. On top of the board were paper, a small bottle of ink, and a quill\u2014obviously a makeshift desk.</p><p>\u201cBollocks,\u201d she muttered to herself in her own voice. \u201cKnave. Knave. Knave. Completely the wrong word. Oh, of course!\u201d</p><p>She bent to the paper and scribbled furiously for a few minutes, and then stood. All at once her demeanor changed. Her shoulders squared, she widened her stance, put her fists on her hips, and Lily Stump became a broad-shouldered man. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay your chits, if you\u2019re a gentleman at all, Wastrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I, my lord?\u201d Her voice was still low, but it had a sort of fey quality to it now, her head tipped coquettishly to the side. \u201cDo you judge a gentleman by his bits, my lord?\u201d</p><p>He realized suddenly that though she was playacting a man, she was doing it as a woman. No wonder she was known for her acting. She wore none of the trappings of the theater\u2014neither wig nor costume nor paint on her face, and yet as she strutted around her writing log he knew immediately which character she played.</p><p>Apollo must\u2019ve made some sound, for Miss Stump spun, staring in his direction with wide green eyes. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn. He hadn\u2019t meant to scare her. Apollo stepped from behind the tree.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She glanced around, her brows drawn together. \u201cIs this your place? I can move elsewhere. I didn\u2019t mean to disturb your work...\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d started shaking his head with her second sentence. She finally seemed to notice, winding down her protests until they trailed away into silence. For a moment they simply stood, staring at each other, alone in this ruined garden. A breeze rattled the thin branches of the bushes and blew a lock of her dark hair across her mouth to catch in the seam of her plush lips. She pushed it behind her ear, her gaze still tangled with his.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to leave, he knew it suddenly. He talked to Artemis, to Makepeace\u2014and to no one else. There was no one else\u2014save her, now. She\u2019d found his secret, knew he wasn\u2019t just a hulking mute, devoid of brain or soul. And more\u2014she stirred something deep within him, something he\u2019d thought had been beaten out of him in Bedlam.</p> <p>Carefully he took a step back, hoping she\u2019d understand that he was ceding the ground to her.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>They both started at her voice.</p><p>Miss Stump cleared her throat and said in a lower tone, \u201cThat is... I mean, if you\u2019d like to stay and continue your work, I... I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once and turned.</p> <p>\u201cWait!\u201d He heard her call from behind him, but there was no point in trying to explain when actions were simpler.</p><p>He jogged back to the tree he\u2019d been trying to take down earlier and picked up his shovel and his satchel before returning.</p><p>Miss Stump was bent over her papers again, but he made sure to make enough noise that he wouldn\u2019t startle her.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, straightening. \u201cYou\u2019ve come back.\u201d</p><p>Was that relief in her voice?</p><p>His mouth twisted wryly at himself. She was a lauded actress, vivacious, quick, and pretty. Even when he\u2019d been able to speak, most of his feminine company had been bought. He wasn\u2019t a comely man. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p> <p>Yet she seemed happy that he\u2019d returned, and that simple fact made his chest bloom with joy.</p><p>He dropped his satchel and took up the shovel, sticking it into the base of one of the dead bushes, striking at the root mass. The blade only went halfway into the soil, so he jumped with both feet on the shoulders of the blade, driving it the rest of the way down. He could feel as the blade sliced through the roots and he grunted with satisfaction. He\u2019d spent part of the previous night sharpening the shovel to do just that. Gingerly he began prying with the handle\u2014too hard a movement and he\u2019d snap it, or worse, the iron blade itself. He\u2019d already lost two shovels this spring.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I continue?\u201d he heard Miss Stump ask. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I need to finish writing this soon\u2014very soon.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up curiously at that, wondering at the worried line between her brows as she stared down at her manuscript. Makepeace had said she couldn\u2019t get acting work at the moment. Perhaps this was her only means of making money.</p><p>He shook his head in reply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only in the third act,\u201d she said absently. \u201cMy heroine has gambled away all her brother\u2019s money because, well, she\u2019s dressed as her brother.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up in time to catch his raised eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a comedy called A Wastrel Reform\u2019d.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cA complicated comedy because right now no one knows who anyone is. There\u2019s twins\u2014a brother and sister\u2014named Wastrel, and the brother has convinced his sister\u2014her Christian name is Cecily\u2014to pretend to be him so that he might seduce Lady Pamela\u2019s maid, and he\u2019s engaged to her\u2014Lady Pamela, not her maid.\u201d</p> <p>She took a breath and Apollo slowly smiled, because against all odds, he\u2019d understood everything she\u2019d just said.</p><p>Miss Stump grinned back. \u201cIt\u2019s silly, I know, but that\u2019s what comedy is, really\u2014a lot of silly things happening, one after another.\u201d She glanced down at her play, running her finger down the page. \u201cSo Cecily, dressed as Adam\u2014that\u2019s the brother\u2014has lost terribly at a hand of cards to Lord Pimberly. Oh! That\u2019s Fanny\u2014the maid\u2019s\u2014father, and Lady Pamela\u2019s scorned suitor. Although of course no one knows that Pimberly is Fanny\u2019s father, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be a lady\u2019s maid, now would she?\u201d</p><p>Apollo leaned on his shovel and cocked an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cKidnapped at birth, naturally,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut fortunately she has quite a distinctive birthmark. Right here.\u201d She tapped the upper slope of her right breast.</p><p>Apollo defied any man not to follow the direction of her finger. She had a lovely breast, gently swelling above the severe square neckline of her dress and modestly covered by a filmy fichu.</p><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d Her husky voice made him raise his gaze. Her cheeks had pinkened, but that might\u2019ve been the wind. \u201cIn any case, I\u2019m writing a scene between Cecily and Lord Pimberly in which Pimberly demands his money and Cecily doesn\u2019t have it. And naturally he\u2019s begun to realize he\u2019s attracted to her at the same time.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat.</p><p>He nodded, messing a bit with his shovel to look as if he were still working. Actually, he was beginning to fear that the blade was stuck in the roots.</p><p>Miss Stump glanced at her manuscript and slipped back into what he now knew was Cecily\u2014the sister dressed as her brother. \u201cDo you judge a gentleman by his bits, my lord?\u201d</p><p>She turned and placed her fists on her hips again, in the wide-legged stance. \u201cPardon me, but I said chits.\u201d</p><p>Turn. Her hands dropped. \u201cAnd yet, \u2019tis still your manly bits we discuss.\u201d She glanced at him out of the corner of her eye. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>He screwed his mouth to the side and reluctantly shook his head.</p><p>\u201cBlast!\u201d she exclaimed under her breath, bending to the paper. She scratched out something and then froze, obviously thinking.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t even pretending to work anymore.</p><p>She gasped and then hunched over her manuscript, scribbling furiously before straightening, a gleam of triumph in her eye.</p><p>She tossed her head as Cecily. \u201cIndeed, and would you know a chit should you see one?\u201d</p><p>Now she was a baffled Pimberly. \u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my lord?\u201d She turned her head and looked over her shoulder through lowered lashes at the imaginary Pimberly, all daring flirtation. \u201cAnd how is that, may I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does a gentleman of your unsurpassed perception differentiate a chit from a bit?\u201d</p><p>And she batted her eyelashes.</p><p>The juxtaposition between the ribaldry of her words and the innocence of her expression was so silly, so utterly enchanting, that Apollo couldn\u2019t help it: he threw back his head and laughed.</p><p>LILY STUMBLED AT the sound, entirely forgetting both Cecily and pompous Pimberly, forgetting her play and everything else, really, and simply stared.</p><p>Caliban was laughing.</p><p>Deep and full, a masculine laugh, his shaggy head thrown back, eyes closed in mirth and crinkling at the corners, straight white teeth flashing. He wore a white shirt topped by a brown waistcoat missing two buttons. The sleeves were rolled to just below his elbows, revealing strong brown forearms lightly sprinkled with dark hair. His breeches were grayed black and over his worn shoes he wore stained buff gaiters. A red kerchief was tied loosely at his neck and he\u2019d wrapped a wide leather belt around his waist to hold his pruning knife. She\u2019d seen innumerable laborers in her lifetime, but she\u2019d never really looked at them. Now she gazed her fill at Caliban and thought how terribly, awfully appealing he was: physically strong, yet able to critique her play, and with a sense of humor to boot. He was so much more than a simple laborer.</p><p>But that thought was followed quickly by another: if he could laugh, then why could he not speak? She felt rather stunned, watching the strong cords of his throat work as he laughed. It made no sense to her, for surely he was using his voice to laugh?</p><p>He opened his eyes, his laughter dying, as he met her gaze, and Lily realized that she\u2019d stepped closer to him in her fascination. She stood almost touching him, his heat, his masculinity like a magnet to her. He dipped his head, watching her, traces of his amusement lingering on his face. She couldn\u2019t help it: she reached out and touched his face, her fingertips running lightly down his lean cheek, feeling the catch of invisible stubble. He was so hot, so alive. She stood on tiptoe, her hand slipping to the back of his neck, beneath the wild tumble of his brown hair, to pull his homely face down to hers. She just wanted to see, to capture some of that vitality and find out if it tasted as sharp as it looked.</p><p>She was so absorbed, in fact, that the male voice, when it came from behind her, nearly startled her out of her skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to bring you back.\u201d</p><p>She jumped, whirling to see who had invaded their Eden, but she wasn\u2019t as fast as Caliban.</p><p>He shoved her to the side\u2014not gently\u2014and charged the stranger. Caliban\u2019s head was down, massive shoulders bunched like a bull\u2019s. He caught the other man about the middle, his momentum sending both men skidding to the ground, the stranger on the bottom. Caliban growled, slamming his fist at the stranger. But the other man was swift, pulling his head to the side and avoiding what surely might\u2019ve been a disabling blow.</p><p>The stranger was in his prime, dressed all in black, wearing his own dark hair pulled back into a braided queue. A tricorn hat had been knocked from his head and she saw that a walking stick had also fallen to the side.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she cried, but neither man paid her the least mind. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>The stranger wrapped one leg over Caliban\u2019s, heaving to displace him, but the mute must\u2019ve outweighed him by a couple stone or more. Caliban, meanwhile, hit the man repeatedly in the side, each blow earning him a grunt of pain from his adversary.</p><p>Metal flashed between them, and Caliban reared back, grabbing for something. Oh, dear God, the other man had a pistol! Both men had a hand on it. They strained in ghastly embrace, each trying to turn the barrel to the other\u2019s face. The stranger\u2019s fist shot out and struck Caliban square in the jaw. His head whipped to the side with the blow, but he didn\u2019t let go of the awful pistol. Lily wavered, afraid to venture nearer, afraid to leave the scene. She wanted to help, but couldn\u2019t think how. If she tried to strike the other man, she\u2019d merely interfere with Caliban\u2014and any distraction could prove fatal.</p><p>A flash and a horrific bang.</p><p>Lily screamed, half-crouching in reaction, her hands over her ears.</p><p>She started forward, afraid she\u2019d see blood\u2014afraid to see Caliban\u2019s dynamic face rendered slack by death\u2014but the men were still struggling. Somehow the shot had missed them both.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d</p><p>Indio\u2019s voice was high and scared, his eyes fixed on the men wrestling on the ground. Lily thought her heart would beat right out of her breast. She flew to her son, catching him up in her arms even though she hadn\u2019t carried Indio for years. She turned with him clutched to her chest, in time to see the stranger draw a second pistol. Caliban grabbed the other man\u2019s wrist and glanced up, as if searching for her.</p><p>Their eyes met, and she didn\u2019t know what he saw in hers, but his face was distorted in a scowl, his visage warlike and grim.</p><p>A man like this could kill, she thought, somewhere in the back of her mind where she was still sane. I should be afraid of a man like this.</p><p>Then he jerked his chin, sharply, and the message was clear: he wanted her and Indio gone.</p><p>A better woman might\u2019ve stayed, might\u2019ve argued or in some way helped him, but evidently she wasn\u2019t that better woman.</p><p>Lily turned and fled, stumbling, sobbing, clutching Indio.</p><p>And as she did she heard the second shot.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>So the king took the baby and walled him up in an impenetrable labyrinth at the center of the island. There the monster lived and grew, unseen by any human. But on certain nights there could be heard a mournful lowing such as a bull might make, and on those nights the people of the island shivered and shuttered their windows... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>Trevillion stared up into Kilbourne\u2019s bloodied face and knew he was about to die of hubris.</p><p>The first pistol shot had missed Kilbourne completely, the second had bloodied his thick skull but hadn\u2019t seemed to slow the man down at all. Maybe nothing would. Maybe Kilbourne was like some mindless beast, driven into a killing rage, unfeeling of any pain.</p><p>It was pure, stubborn hubris for a cripple to come after a fully capable man\u2014especially a man as large and muscled as Kilbourne. Hubris to announce his presence to his quarry instead of disabling him first.</p> <p>Hubris to think he was the man he\u2019d been before the accident.</p><p>Trevillion continued to struggle, even though he\u2019d discharged both pistols, his leg was screaming, and he had no hope of overpowering Kilbourne. He might be a prideful bastard, but he was a stubborn prideful bastard and if this was to be his last hour, then by damn, he\u2019d go down fighting.</p><p>Kilbourne\u2019s forearm was across his throat, pressing down, stealing the air from his lungs. In the giant\u2019s other fist was a hideously curved knife. Trevillion expected to feel the hooked blade sinking into his skull at any moment.</p><p>Black spots floated in Trevillion\u2019s vision and he wished viciously that he\u2019d drawn both his pistols before he\u2019d called to Kilbourne. He\u2019d\u2019ve at least had the chance to shoot when the big man charged. He\u2019d worried about the woman getting caught by a shot, though...</p><p>His leg stopped hurting. That was worrying.</p> <p>Blackness closed in, narrowing his vision.</p><p>Then suddenly light, air, and pain returned.</p><p>He rolled, coughing violently as his lungs drew air, his leg spasming torturously. Trevillion threw out his hand, grasping blindly for any sort of weapon. The pistols were already discharged, but if he could at least reach his walking stick, perhaps he could crack it over Kilbourne\u2019s head.</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>Kilbourne was squatting nearby like some hulking native, his hands hanging between his knees, the hooked knife dangling from one. The left side of his face was painted red with blood and he looked a veritable savage.</p><p>Except for his eyes. He was simply watching Trevillion struggle\u2014warily, to be sure, but in no way threateningly.</p> <p>Trevillion narrowed his own eyes, glancing around. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting someone to come to your aid.\u201d</p><p>Kilbourne blinked and at last an expression showed in his blank face\u2014sardonic humor. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d Trevillion had managed to prop himself on his elbows, but with his leg in such pain he wouldn\u2019t be standing anytime in the next half hour. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Was the man a sadist to draw out death so?</p><p>Kilbourne shrugged and pushed his knife into his belt, then reached to the side for something, making Trevillion tense.</p><p>The other man handed him his stick.</p><p>Trevillion glanced incredulously between his walking stick and the murderer before snatching it out of the other\u2019s hand. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you answer me? Can\u2019t you talk?\u201d</p><p>Again the sardonic half-smile and Kilbourne simply shook his head.</p> <p>Trevillion stared. He was on his back, unarmed except for a walking stick, and pathetically helpless, and Kilbourne had made no move against him.</p><p>Worse, he\u2019d helped him.</p><p>Trevillion cocked his head, the thought arising, simple, organic, and patently true. \u201cYou never killed those men, did you?\u201d</p><p>APOLLO STARED AT the man on the ground, ignoring the stinging of his scalp. He\u2019d recognized him at once. Captain James Trevillion. He knew the soldier\u2019s name now\u2014he\u2019d learned it years ago in Bedlam\u2014but on the morning he\u2019d been arrested, the other man had just been a dragoon in a red coat. The herald to his coming downfall.</p><p>Now Trevillion wore unrelieved black, wide belts crisscrossing his chest, the holsters empty. The other man\u2019s pistols lay in the dirt. A pity. They were rather fine, decorated with silver repouss\u00e9 caps on the grips.</p><p>This man had wanted to arrest him. To take him back to the hell that was Bedlam. He ought to kill the dragoon\u2014or at the very least render him unable to ever come after him again. He\u2019d known men who would do the same and never think on the matter after.</p><p>But Apollo was, for better or for worse, not one of those men. He\u2019d had more than enough violence crammed down his throat in Bedlam. On the whole he preferred more civilized methods of solving dilemmas.</p><p>He opened his satchel, took out his notebook, and wrote, I didn\u2019t kill them.</p><p>Trevillion, from his position prone on the ground, craned his neck to read and huffed out a breath. \u201cYou certainly looked like you\u2019d killed them that morning\u2014you were covered in blood, clutching the knife, and not in your right mind.\u201d</p><p>His words were accusatory, but his tone was curious.</p><p>Apollo began to feel a small, curling shoot of hope. He shrugged cautiously and wrote, Drunk.</p><p>Trevillion\u2019s right leg seemed to be bothering him, for he was kneading the calf muscle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen plenty of men after a night of drinking. Most have some kind of method to their madness. You didn\u2019t make any sense at all.\u201d</p><p>Apollo sighed. His scalp stung from the bullet crease, his head hurt, and the blood from the wound was beginning to soak into his shirt. But worse, he could still feel Miss Stump\u2019s cool, slim fingers on his cheek. So close, so intimate. The other man had ruined that fragile moment. She\u2019d looked absolutely terrified when Apollo had warned her away with the boy. He wanted to find her and assure himself that she was safe and unafraid.</p><p>That her look of terror had been caused by the situation, not him.</p><p>Apollo almost rose and left Trevillion lying there in the mud. But the soldier knew him and had discovered him\u2014somehow that must be dealt with.</p><p>And, too, Trevillion was the first in a very long time to actually listen to his side of events about that morning.</p><p>So instead of stomping off he picked up his notebook again and wrote carefully, I remember sitting down with my friends, remember drinking the first bottle of wine... and nothing after.</p><p>While Trevillion read that, Apollo removed both waistcoat and shirt and wrapped his shirt around his bleeding head like a Turk.</p><p>The soldier looked up. \u201cDrugged?\u201d</p><p>Apollo tilted his head and shrugged, hopefully conveying, Probably. He\u2019d had time to think the matter over in Bedlam\u2014long, long years of regret and speculation. The idea that the wine had been drugged seemed more than obvious after the fact.</p><p>He stood and held out his hand to the other man.</p><p>Trevillion looked at his hand so long, Apollo nearly withdrew it.</p><p>The other man grimaced at last. \u201cI suppose you could\u2019ve killed me by now anyway.\u201d</p><p>Apollo cocked an eyebrow at that, but heaved Trevillion up when he took his hand. The soldier\u2019s body was stiff. He didn\u2019t utter a sound, but it was quite apparent he was in pain.</p><p>Trevillion leaned on his cane, but Apollo kept his arm around the other\u2019s shoulder\u2014and since the soldier didn\u2019t complain, it was evident his help was needed. Apollo guided him the few steps to the fallen tree Miss Stump had used as a writing desk. The soldier gingerly lowered himself, wincing as he did so, his right leg held rigid and straight before him.</p><p>Trevillion eyed him as Apollo squatted before him. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you speak?\u201d</p><p>He wrote one word in the notebook. Bedlam.</p><p>The soldier frowned over that, his fingers tight on the notebook\u2019s edges. He looked up, his eyes sharp. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t kill those men, then someone else did\u2014someone who never paid for his murders. I arrested the wrong man. I condemned the wrong man.\u201d</p><p>Apollo simply looked at him, fighting to keep his lip from curling. Four years. Four years of starvation, beatings, and boredom, because some other man had killed his friends. Any regret seemed long past due.</p><p>All at once he opened the door and let them in from that black room at the back of his mind:</p><p>Hugh Maubry.</p><p>Joseph Tate.</p><p>William Smithers.</p><p>Maubry, with his intestines spilling on the tavern\u2019s sawdust floor. Tate entirely intact, save for a wound high on his chest and three missing fingers. Smithers, his boyish face surprised, eyes open, throat cut.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t known them particularly well. Maubry and Tate had been at school with him, Smithers had been some distant relation of Tate\u2019s. They\u2019d been jolly fellows, good for a night of drinking\u2014before he\u2019d woken to a nightmare.</p><p>Apollo blinked, pushing back the images, the terrible memories, and looked at Trevillion.</p><p>The soldier stared back, his spine straight, his expression grim and resolute. \u201cThis is an injustice that must be righted\u2014that I must right. I\u2019m going to help you find the real murderer.\u201d</p><p>Apollo grinned\u2014though not in mirth. He took up his pencil and wrote, his words so angry that the point gouged the paper in places: How? I was in Bedlam four years and in that time no one doubted my guilt. You yourself thought me guilty when you attacked me just now. Where will you find the man or men who actually did the crime?</p><p>Trevillion read that and said drily, \u201cIn point of fact, you attacked me.\u201d</p><p>Apollo snorted and waved aside the other\u2019s reply. Besides, won\u2019t your superiors resent your time spent away from the dragoons?</p><p>The other man\u2019s face went blank. \u201cI am no longer a dragoon.\u201d</p><p>Apollo stared at that. Even in his unrelieved black, Trevillion looked every inch the dragoon captain. He glanced at the leg and wondered when the injury had happened. In his hazy memory of that awful morning, he didn\u2019t recollect the other man\u2019s being so badly lamed. He had a feeling, though, that any questions would not be welcome.</p><p>Instead he wrote, My point remains: how do you expect to find the murderer after so long?</p><p>The former soldier looked at him. \u201cYou must have some idea, some suspicion, about who could\u2019ve killed your friends?\u201d</p><p>Apollo\u2019s eyes narrowed. He had, in fact, spent hours\u2014days\u2014meditating on this very subject. He wrote cautiously, Our purses were taken.</p><p>\u201cA large amount?\u201d</p><p>Apollo twisted his mouth. Not on my part\u2014I\u2019d already paid for the room and wine. I doubt the others had more than a guinea or two between them. Tate had a rather fine gold watch, though\u2014his late father\u2019s. That was stolen.</p><p>\u201cNot a large haul for three men dead,\u201d Trevillion said softly.</p><p>Men have been killed for less.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d the soldier replied, \u201cbut not usually so methodically.\u201d He stared for a moment at nothing, absently rubbing his calf. Then his gaze sharpened. \u201cWho were they, the men who were killed? I was told at the time, but I\u2019ve forgotten since.\u201d</p><p>Apollo listed the names.</p><p>Trevillion pursed his lips over the notebook. \u201cHow well did you know them?\u201d</p><p>They were men I liked, men I drank with, but I was not especially close to any of them. Smithers I had only met that night.</p><p>And yet his boyish face was now imprinted on Apollo\u2019s mind forever.</p><p>\u201cWere they rich? Had they enemies?\u201d</p><p>Apollo shrugged. Maubry was the third son of a baron and doomed to the church. Tate was his uncle\u2019s heir, I believe, and would\u2019ve come into a comfortable sum\u2014or so the rumors went at school. Whether they were correct or not, I cannot say. Smithers seemed to have no blunt at all, but he was dressed well enough, certainly. As to enemies, I do not know.</p><p>Trevillion read carefully before looking up, his eyes intent. \u201cHad you enemies?\u201d</p><p>He wrote with a wry twist to his mouth, Until that night I would have said no.</p><p>Trevillion glanced at his words and nodded sharply. \u201cVery well, then. I shall investigate the matter and return when I can to consult with you.\u201d</p><p>The man got laboriously to his feet. Apollo moved to help him once and was met with a furious scowl.</p><p>He didn\u2019t again.</p><p>When Trevillion was at last upright, his face was reddened and shone with sweat.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, my lord,\u201d the former soldier said, for the first time giving him the courtesy of his title. \u201cIf I could find you, others might do so as well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Apollo glared at him. How did you find me?</p><p>\u201cI followed your sister,\u201d Trevillion said drily. \u201cHer Grace is very discreet, very circumspect, but I noticed that she made regular errands. None at Wakefield House knew\u2014or at least would admit to knowing\u2014where she was going. I decided to follow her secretly, though it was some time before my employment would allow the opportunity. Today is my day off.\u201d</p><p>Apollo raised his eyebrows. The former dragoon knew an awful lot about Wakefield House and its inhabitants. He wrote hastily, How are you employed?</p><p>\u201cI guard Lady Phoebe,\u201d the other man said simply.</p> <p>He bent and, one at a time, picked up his pistols and placed them once more in the holsters on his chest. If his bearing weren\u2019t so military, he\u2019d look like a pirate, Apollo thought in some amusement.</p><p>\u201cGood day, my lord.\u201d Trevillion nodded his head. \u201cPlease do heed my warning. Should the King\u2019s men find you before I can prove your innocence, I think you know well what would happen.\u201d</p><p>He did: death. Or worse, Bedlam.</p><p>Apollo nodded stiffly in return.</p><p>He watched Trevillion make his way slowly down the path toward the Thames and then picked up his satchel, stowed his notebook, and turned in the opposite direction.</p> <p>He was feeling light-headed now with an unpleasant tinge of nausea, no doubt the result of his head wound, but he simply couldn\u2019t wait to discover if Miss Stump was all right.</p><p>Apollo picked up his pace, breaking into a jog along the path, trying to ignore how his movements worsened his headache. She\u2019d looked at him with such wonder before, as if he might be something special, almost lovely. No one had ever looked at him in such a way, especially no woman.</p><p>When he burst into the theater at last, the first thing he saw was Miss Stump and the maid, Maude, bent over Indio. The boy was eating a biscuit smeared liberally with jam and seemed quite all right.</p><p>The second thing he saw was Miss Stump\u2019s look as she straightened and turned to him.</p><p>Stark fear.</p><p>CALIBAN CAME CRASHING through the theater door and Lily thought, Thank God\u2014for he was at least alive\u2014followed very quickly by Dear God, for his face was streaked with gore and his head was wrapped in a bloody rag. Also, and this was of course not nearly as important as the fact that he was hurt, he\u2019d somehow lost his shirt again, and his bare, muscled chest was rather distracting.</p> <p>\u201cRemember Kitty,\u201d Maude hissed like some dolorous chorus at her shoulder, and Lily felt a very strong urge to slap her beloved nurse.</p><p>\u201cHeat some water,\u201d she snapped instead to the older woman.</p><p>Maude muttered to herself, but turned to the hearth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Indio said at the same time. \u201cWhy is Caliban all over blood? Did he kill that other man?\u201d</p><p>He sounded elated rather than frightened, and Lily could only stare in horror at her son.</p><p>Caliban came closer, bloodied head and distracting chest and all, and knelt at Indio\u2019s feet. He shook his head and took out his notebook from a battered cloth bag. It was a misunderstanding between friends.</p><p>Lily read the notebook aloud and stared at him incredulously. Not even Daffodil was na\u00efve enough to believe that explanation.</p><p>The mute swayed where he was squatting and she rushed forward to take his upper arm\u2014his very hard upper arm\u2014and help him into a chair. If he fainted on the floor, he\u2019d have to lie there, for there was no way she and Maude could lift him.</p> <p>\u201cIs he gone?\u201d she asked urgently. \u201cThat other man?\u201d</p><p>Caliban nodded wearily.</p><p>She leaned closer and whispered, \u201cIs he dead?\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted wryly at that, but he shook his head slowly. His eyes were beginning to droop and his skin, usually a lovely golden color, was going gray.</p><p>She hurried to the mantel and snatched down their one bottle of awful wine. In the state he was in, he was unlikely to notice the quality\u2014and in any case it was for medicinal purposes at the moment.</p><p>She poured him a glassful and pressed it into his hands. \u201cDrink this.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cMaude, the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis only God can make water boil faster,\u201d the maid muttered sourly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hurt, Maude,\u201d Lily chided and got to her feet. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d she said sternly to Caliban, for she wouldn\u2019t put it past him to try to stand.</p><p>She crossed swiftly to her room. She had an old chemise tucked away and she scooped it up and brought it back into the main room.</p><p>Indio was now off his chair and peering into Caliban\u2019s face while Daffodil licked the boy\u2019s sticky fingers.</p><p>\u201cIndio, don\u2019t crowd him,\u201d she said gently, and unwrapped the rag from Caliban\u2019s head.</p><p>She had to lean close to do so and she could feel the heat radiating off him, smell his male musk. Her arm accidentally brushed his shoulder and that little contact made her shiver.</p><p>He sat docilely, letting her do as she would. The rag turned out to be the remains of his shirt, now entirely ruined, and she wondered if he had another. Maybe he\u2019d have to go naked from the waist up, except for his waistcoat, as he labored about the garden. That would be a distracting sight: his huge arms flexing as he wielded a shovel or his savage hooked knife. She fancied she could charge ladies a shilling to come sit by the theater and sip tea as they watched him work\u2014and wasn\u2019t that a silly idea?</p><p>Frowning to bring her wayward thoughts under control, she carefully pried the last of the shirt from his head. The blood had begun to dry, sticking the material to his hair and scalp. She winced as fresh scarlet stained the tawny strands.</p><p>\u201cAn\u2019 here\u2019s the water,\u201d Maude said, bringing over the steaming kettle and setting it on a cloth on the floor. She bent to peer at Caliban\u2019s head as Lily began delicately washing the clotted blood from his hair. A seeping furrow appeared, about three inches long, running along the top of his head, slightly right of center.</p><p>Maude grunted and straightened. \u201cCreased from a bullet, he is.\u201d</p><p>She went to the corner where she kept her trunk.</p><p>\u201cCor!\u201d Indio exclaimed, and for once Lily didn\u2019t correct his common expression.</p><p>She frowned over the bleeding wound. \u201cShall we have to stitch it closed?\u201d she called to Maude.</p><p>\u201cNay, hinney. Not much point since it\u2019s so shallow.\u201d The maidservant returned with a rag. \u201cPour a bit of wine over this and press it to the wound.\u201d</p><p>Lily raised her eyebrows doubtfully, but did as she was told.</p><p>As soon as the cloth met his head, Caliban\u2019s eyes widened and he grunted in pain.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts him!\u201d Lily took away the rag.</p><p>\u201cAye, but the wine\u2019ll help it heal, too.\u201d Maude put her hand over Lily\u2019s and pressed the rag back. \u201cNow hold it there.\u201d She carefully poured a little more of the wine onto Caliban\u2019s scalp, ignoring his wince.</p><p>Indio, watching closely from the side, giggled. \u201cHe looks silly. Now his hair is red and brown and black.\u201d</p><p>Caliban\u2019s mouth lifted in a wan smile.</p><p>Lily frowned, concerned. \u201cHow do you know about such things, Maude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen around theater folk a long, long time,\u201d the maid replied. \u201cA right quarrelsome bunch, they are. Patched up more\u2019n my fair share of young men after an argument got out of hand.\u201d</p><p>Indio seemed deeply interested in this bit of information. \u201cHas Uncle Edwin ever been shot in the head?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Fraid not, lad. Your uncle is good at wriggling out of such things\u2014likes to keep his skin whole, he does.\u201d Maude tapped Lily\u2019s hand to get her to lift the cloth, and inspected the still-bleeding wound. She nodded her head. \u201cWe\u2019ll use your old chemise to wrap this, hinney.\u201d</p><p>They tore the chemise up and while Lily held a folded pad over the wound, Maude wrapped strips around Caliban\u2019s head to hold it in place. By the time they were done, he looked as if he\u2019d been shrouded for burial and Indio was in fits of laughter.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like an old man with a toothache!\u201d</p><p>Daffodil yipped and jumped up to nip at her giggling young master, and even Maude broke into a reluctant smile.</p><p>The maid hastily repressed it, though. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know, young Indio, that this here is the finest of nursing work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Maude,\u201d Indio said, more soberly. \u201cWill he be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019 course, lad,\u201d Maude said stoutly. \u201cBest your mother helps him to her bed, though, because he looks like he could do with a nice long sleep.\u201d Her voice softened just a fraction. \u201cPoor man probably hasn\u2019t a decent bed to sleep on, wherever he takes his rest. Come, you an\u2019 I will start the supper.\u201d</p><p>Indio leaped at that, always eager to be allowed to help in grown-up endeavors, and both maid and boy went to the fireplace, trailed by a curious Daffodil.</p><p>Lily looked into Caliban\u2019s face. He had his eyes closed and was listing slightly in his chair. \u201cCan you walk to the bed?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and opened his eyes. They were duller than she was used to now. It reminded her uncomfortably of the time when she\u2019d thought him mentally incompetent. How strange that idea seemed now.</p><p>\u201cCan you stand?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He answered by rising like a drunken behemoth and she hastily dipped a shoulder to bring it under his arm. It wasn\u2019t that she could physically hold him up\u2014he was much too big\u2014but she helped guide him as he stumbled unsteadily toward her little bedroom.</p><p>Inside was her bed\u2014a narrow, pathetic thing\u2014and she helped him climb in, drawing the coverlet over his chest. He looked as if he lay in a child\u2019s cot. His feet hung off the end and one arm dangled almost to the ground from the side.</p><p>Caliban seemed comfortable enough\u2014his eyes already shut. Was he asleep? She bent over him, whispering urgently, \u201cCaliban.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes, and though the color hadn\u2019t changed from ordinary brown, they were somehow more dear to her now.</p><p>\u201cWho was that man?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy did he attack you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and closed his eyes again. If he was feigning sleep, he was better than many actors Lily had known.</p><p>She blew out a frustrated breath and went around to the foot of the bed. His gaiters and shoes were quite muddy and she wrinkled her nose in disgust, but got gamely to work. She unlaced his gaiters and then unbuckled his shoes, marveling at their size before setting them neatly beneath the bed. Then she found another blanket and pulled it over his upper half, for the one on the bed didn\u2019t come close to his shoulders.</p><p>With a last look, Lily shut the bedroom door and went out into the main room.</p><p>Maude and Indio were by the hearth as Maude supervised the boy in stirring something in a bubbling pot.</p><p>She cast a look over her shoulder at Lily\u2019s entrance. \u201cThere\u2019s tea on the table, hinney. Take a seat and have a cup, but first you\u2019ll want to scrub your hands. Go on, then.\u201d</p><p>Lily nodded wearily and crossed to the outside door. It was oddly comforting to have Maude instructing her as the older woman had when she was a little girl. As Lily herself did now with Indio.</p><p>Outside, the sky had begun to gray and Lily blinked at the passage of time. She\u2019d been so fearful for Indio, then so concerned about tending to Caliban, that she hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><p>She went to the barrel of water they kept beside the door, removing the wooden cover and dipping out some water with which to scrub the blood and mud from her hands. She watched the pinkish water run into the dirt at her feet, making little runnels, and remembered another time she\u2019d scrubbed blood from her hands. Kitty\u2019s dear face had been so swollen she couldn\u2019t open her eyes, her mouth turned into an obscene, bloodied mass.</p><p>All because of a big, violent man.</p><p>Lily watched the last of the water run off and recalled Maude\u2019s words\u2014Remember Kitty\u2014and wondered if she was making a very foolish\u2014and perhaps fatal\u2014mistake.</p><p>Chapter Seven </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The king sat in his golden castle and brooded. He fathered no more children, and as he aged he grew bitter that others might have lovely offspring but he, the ruler of the island, had sired only a monster. So he made an awful commandment: every year the people must send into the labyrinth the most beautiful youth and the most beautiful maiden on the island as sacrifice to his terrible son...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>Apollo woke in the dark the next morning to two immediate realizations: one, he was in a bed\u2014a real bed\u2014for the first time since before Bedlam, and two, he hadn\u2019t written and set out the day\u2019s instructions for the gardeners. He groaned silently at the last thought. The fellows Asa had hired were a competent enough lot, but with no instruction they had a tendency to mill around without doing any useful work.</p><p>But the bed\u2014the lovely, lovely bed\u2014made it hard to feel put out by the matter. The bed wasn\u2019t big, but it was soft and clean with a proper mattress\u2014not stuffed with scratchy straw\u2014and it was comfortable. He was tempted to go back to sleep.</p> <p>Except the thought hit him of whose bed he must be in: Miss Stump\u2019s.</p><p>He sat up, jostling his head, which promptly began to complain about the matter. The room was dark\u2014it had no windows\u2014but he knew from the internal clock his body had kept since he was a boy that it was morning, probably six or seven of the clock.</p><p>Where was Miss Stump?</p><p>Cautiously he lowered his foot to the floor and only then realized he was missing both shoes and gaiters. His brows shot up. Had elegant Miss Stump removed them? It took a few minutes of feeling about, but he eventually discovered his shoes under the bed and donned them.</p><p>He felt his way to the door and cracked it.</p> <p>Immediately he was set upon by Daffodil, who appeared to be the only one of the household awake. She spun at his feet, yipping excitedly.</p><p>Apollo bent and picked up the little dog to keep her from waking everyone.</p><p>When he straightened he saw Indio, sitting up from a nest of blankets on the floor. He and his mother appeared to be bedded down together, while Maude was in the cot. Both women still slept.</p><p>Apollo had only a moment to sneak a glimpse of Miss Stump\u2019s mahogany hair, down and spread like a silken skein over her pillow, before the boy yawned and rose. \u201cDaff says she has to go out an\u2019 so do I.\u201d</p><p>Apollo looked with alarm at the wriggling dog in his arms.</p><p>The boy had worn his shirt to sleep in. He donned a pair of breeches and trotted over.</p> <p>Apollo opened the outer door.</p><p>Outside, the morning had dawned sunny and glorious. He set Daffodil on the ground and she immediately squatted.</p><p>Indio was making his way around the back of the theater and Apollo followed him. The boy stopped at one of the few trees still living\u2014a great gnarled oak\u2014and began fumbling with the fall of his breeches.</p><p>He glanced up, grinning, as Apollo halted beside him. \u201cI like to try an\u2019 hit that knot.\u201d He nodded at a knot in the tree, about three feet off the ground.</p><p>Apollo smirked back and unbuttoned his own breeches.</p><p>The two streams of urine hit the knot and steamed impressively against the morning cold of the tree trunk, Apollo\u2019s lasting a bit longer than the boy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cCor!\u201d Indio said as he shook off his little prick and began righting himself. \u201cYou\u2019re dead good at that. Took me days to hit it the first time.\u201d</p><p>Apollo tried not to let the compliment go to his head. Precision pissing was, after all, a sadly underrated skill among most of society.</p> <p>\u201cIndio!\u201d</p><p>Miss Stump\u2019s call echoed through the garden.</p><p>Indio\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThat\u2019s my mama. She\u2019ll be wanting us to come in for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Apollo followed the boy back around the theater to find Miss Stump standing in the doorway, her arms crossed over a wrap.</p><p>She raised a hand to her unbound hair when she caught sight of him. \u201cOh, Caliban. I didn\u2019t know you were up yet. Good morning.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, watching as she pushed her hair behind her ears. The sad female creatures of Bedlam had often had their hair down, but theirs had been dirty and tangled, the result of unsound minds no longer caring about their toilet.</p><p>Miss Stump\u2019s unbound hair was an intimate sight\u2014a sight such as a lover or husband might be privy to. It shone, waist-length, heavy, and straight, and he fought the urge to take it between his fingers to test its weight and feel the silky texture.</p><p>Perhaps some of his desire revealed itself on his face because she stepped back into the theater, glancing nervously at him from the corners of her eyes. \u201cHave you washed, Indio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo.\u201d Indio drew out the reluctant syllable.</p><p>Apollo tapped him on the shoulder and nodded at the water barrel. No doubt he could do with a bath as well.</p><p>Miss Stump disappeared for a moment and then returned with several cloths. The boy stripped off his shirt, shivering in the morning air, his arms wrapped over his skinny chest.</p><p>Apollo smiled and uncovered the water barrel to dip a cloth in. He handed it to the boy before wetting his own washcloth. Normally he\u2019d simply have sluiced himself with the water dipper, but he had a feeling Miss Stump would not appreciate his undoing all her hard work in dressing his wound.</p><p>So instead he washed his face and neck briskly, then poured fresh water over the cloth and wiped his arms, underarms, and chest. He pivoted as he did so and saw that Miss Stump stood in the doorway to the theater, watching him.</p><p>He met her eyes and became conscious for the first time that he was half naked and performing a private act before her. Bedlam had stripped him of modesty. There the cells had never been entirely shut off, never entirely private. The most basic of human activities had, at times, been done before an audience of other inmates or uncaring guards. He might as well have been a horse in a stable\u2014save that most horses were better treated than the patients at Bedlam.</p><p>But Miss Stump didn\u2019t look at him as if he were an animal. She looked at him as a woman does a man she finds attractive.</p><p>Perhaps even arousing.</p><p>Her eyelids were half lowered, her cheeks flushed, and as he watched, her pink tongue ran slowly over her bottom lip.</p><p>He was aware suddenly of his nipples, pulled exquisitely tight on his chest, of his cock, pumping full of hot blood.</p><p>\u201cAm I c-c-clean now, Mama?\u201d Indio\u2019s high voice chattered behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Miss Stump blinked. \u201cOh! Erm, yes, quite clean, Indio. Come inside before you catch your death of cold.\u201d</p><p>The boy darted past Apollo, his shirt clutched in his hand, and Daffodil, who had been milling about, sniffing at dead vegetation, barked and happily raced after.</p><p>Apollo followed more slowly, watching Miss Stump as he did. She was bustling about the room, settling her son at the table, instructing Maude, and then disappearing abruptly into the bedroom he\u2019d taken last night.</p><p>When she reappeared, her hair was dressed\u2014much to his regret\u2014and she bore a thin blanket. \u201cCaliban, would you like this until you can find another shirt?\u201d She held out the blanket and then her brows knit. \u201cYou do have another shirt, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sardonic glance that made her blush and then nodded.</p><p>\u201cI hope you like tea, because we don\u2019t run to coffee,\u201d Maude said, and banged a teapot down on the table.</p><p>That apparently was the signal to sit for breakfast, and so Apollo did.</p><p>The table held bread and butter and a plate of cold sliced meat. There wasn\u2019t a lot of anything, and he was reminded of Makepeace\u2019s words. Miss Stump was out of work.</p><p>Apollo was careful to take only one slice of bread and only a little meat. He knew what it was like to be without food. He\u2019d often been weak with hunger in Bedlam, despite Artemis\u2019s heroic attempts to keep him supplied with food. Hunger was an affliction worse than beatings. It made the mind narrow to only that one point: food and when one would next be able to eat. Damnable to reduce a man to the state of a starving dog.</p><p>Once he\u2019d been lower than a starving dog, mindless with want.</p><p>So he was careful now to eat in slow, moderate bites, as a gentleman should, for he was, beneath everything else, a gentleman.</p><p>The tea was weak but hot and he drank two cups of it, watching Miss Stump nibble at her own bread. She caught his eye once and bit her lip, as if hiding a secret smile. All the while Indio chattered about everything from the sparrows he\u2019d seen in the trees the day before to the dead snail Daffodil had attempted to eat the previous week.</p><p>But pleasant as the morning meal was, it wasn\u2019t long before Apollo recollected that he must be at work\u2014and to do that, he\u2019d have to fetch his only other shirt from the musician\u2019s gallery.</p><p>He pulled out his notebook and, turning to a new page, wrote, Thank you\u2014for the meal, the physicking, and the bed\u2014but I must be off to my labors.</p><p>Miss Stump blushed when she read it and gave it back. \u201cWe were glad to help.\u201d</p><p>Indio, who had been watching the exchange, slumped in his chair. \u201cAww! Must Caliban go? I wanted to show him my new boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a man grown, dearest, and must be about his job. But perhaps\u201d\u2014she cleared her throat, peeking at him beneath her lashes\u2014\u201cwe could take Caliban a picnic luncheon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Indio was so excited he knelt up on his chair as he turned to Apollo. \u201cSay yes, pleeeease?\u201d</p><p>Apollo\u2019s lips twitched as he inclined his head.</p><p>\u201cHuzzah!\u201d Indio cried, making Daffodil leap and twirl in excitement. \u201cHuzzah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down afore you spill your tea, lad,\u201d Maude said gruffly, but even she had a smile upon her face.</p><p>Apollo walked out into the garden feeling better than he had in months\u2014even with the headache. He could hear chopping coming from somewhere in the garden, so at least some work was being done\u2014whether it was the correct work might be another matter. He hurried to the musician\u2019s gallery.</p><p>It was as he was buttoning his waistcoat\u2014sadly he\u2019d only the one, and that was now stained and slightly damp from lying on the ground all night\u2014that he heard the distinctive sound of Makepeace\u2019s voice raised in ire.</p><p>Hastily he finished his crude toilet and jogged in the direction of the yelling, which became comprehensible as he got nearer.</p><p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019ll take on some wet-behind-the-ears, overeducated, dilettante architect to design and rebuild my bloody garden just because you met him at some aristocratic ball in Sweden\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwitzerland,\u201d drawled an obnoxious, familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cBloody Switzerland,\u201d Makepeace amended without even taking breath, \u201cthan you\u2019ve lost your blasted ducal mind. This garden is going to be the most wondrous pleasure garden in all of London, which might as well be the world, and to do that we need an experienced, working architect, not some silly aristocrat who\u2019s decided that he\u2019d play with blocks and see if he could build something that wouldn\u2019t fall down after three damned minutes.\u201d</p><p>By the time Makepeace had come to the end of his loud and foul objections, Apollo had rounded a corner and caught sight of him.</p><p>Makepeace was standing in the middle of the ruined path that led to the dock, hair on end, hands on hips, glowering thunderously at the Duke of Montgomery, who didn\u2019t seem to realize the mortal peril he was in.</p><p>Indeed, as Apollo came to a stop beside the two men, the duke flicked open a jeweled snuffbox and smiled slyly at him. \u201cWhy, Mr. Makepeace, I\u2019m surprised you have such objections to the blood of my architect, considering you\u2019re such good friends with Viscount Kilbourne.\u201d</p><p>Apollo froze. They\u2019d never made mention of his real name or rank in front of Montgomery. The man was supposed to have been out of the country for years until last summer. How in hell had he figured out who Apollo was?</p><p>His gaze met Makepeace\u2019s and he saw equal baffled fury there.</p><p>Montgomery sneezed into an enormous lace-edged handkerchief. \u201cNow then, gentlemen,\u201d he said after he\u2019d stowed both the snuffbox and the handkerchief in his pocket. \u201cLet us begin this discussion again on a more congenial note, shall we?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you want, Montgomery?\u201d Makepeace all but growled.</p><p>The duke shrugged delicately. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said: to employ an architect of my own selection to design and build the theater and musician\u2019s gallery and various other follies I might like in the garden. I shall, naturally, be paying him from my own pocket. Come now, it\u2019s not as if you have a choice.\u201d</p><p>At that, Makepeace did growl.</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d Montgomery drawled, cocking his head as he watched Makepeace simmer. Apollo wondered if the man had any sense of self-preservation. \u201cBut I shall take that as agreement.\u201d</p> <p>He turned and strolled leisurely away.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t trust him, \u2019Pollo,\u201d Makepeace said, abruptly and low. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t trust him before, but now he knows your name.\u201d</p><p>And Apollo couldn\u2019t help but agree.</p><p>\u201cHE\u2019S JUST A gardener,\u201d Maude muttered later that day as she watched Lily dither over the picnic luncheon she was packing. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what he told you, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019d like roast chicken or boiled eggs better?\u201d Lily had spent the morning frantically writing so that she might take a few hours\u2019 break in the afternoon, which meant she had only minutes to pack the picnic luncheon. \u201cAnd he isn\u2019t just a gardener, he\u2019s the head gardener\u2014he\u2019s designing the entire pleasure garden, as far as I can tell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHinney, a man as big as that, working hard all day, will eat anything and everything you set in front of him,\u201d Maude opined. \u201cIf he\u2019s the head gardener and such an important man as all that, why is he livin\u2019 rough in the garden and wearing such common clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Maude.\u201d Lily put both the eggs and the leftover roast chicken securely in the basket. It was normally used for Maude\u2019s knitting and she\u2019d been none too pleased to have her work dumped out on the table so Lily could commandeer the basket. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s down on his luck. Or maybe he likes to stay at the garden he\u2019s working on. Or...\u201d But her imagination had run out. There really wasn\u2019t an explanation for Caliban\u2019s many strange habits.</p><p>\u201cAnd the fact he won\u2019t tell you his real name or that he let you think he was stupid when you first met, can you explain that, my girl?\u201d</p><p>Lily couldn\u2019t, so she just kept her head down and wrapped a half loaf of bread securely.</p><p>\u201cYou can get any man you want,\u201d Maude said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them look at you when you\u2019re prancing about the stage\u2014and off\u2014from footmen to bejeweled lords, they all fancy you. Why not let one of them take you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in lords, bejeweled or otherwise,\u201d Lily said lightly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you that,\u201d Maude said, \u201cbut there\u2019s plenty o\u2019 other men. Why bring a picnic lunch to a great brute you know nothing about?\u201d</p><p>Why indeed? Lily\u2019s hands stilled as she tried to explain, both to herself and to Maude. \u201cHe\u2019s big, but he\u2019s gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was fighting some stranger just yesterday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Lily took a breath and said more quietly, \u201cI know.\u201d She met her old nursemaid\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Caliban fought that man, but I know he felt he had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHinney...\u201d Maude\u2019s old face seemed to have grown lines.</p><p>Lily caught her hands, squeezing gently. \u201cHe looks at me in admiration, but not like those other men\u2014as if I\u2019m an object he wants to have, for other men to admire. When he looks at me I think he sees a woman he likes, a woman he wants to talk to. And I want to talk to him, Maude. I want to learn what he thinks about when his lips turn up, and what he sees when he looks at his garden, and what he\u2019ll be doing tomorrow and the next day.\u201d She stopped because she knew she\u2019d lost any hope of eloquence. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it. I only know I want to spend time with him. When I\u2019m with him, the minutes, the hours, fly by so fast and I hardly notice.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and stared helplessly at Maude.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you hurt, hinney.\u201d Maude\u2019s voice softened, turned pleading. \u201cI can\u2019t get Kitty\u2019s face out of my dreams, I can\u2019t. She haunts me at night and I think it\u2019s a warning, I do. Remember she was so taken with that man, so sure he would be kind to her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was different,\u201d Lily muttered. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t nearly as nice as Kitty thought and we all knew it, even from the first. We told her not to go with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019m telling you not to go with this Caliban fellow,\u201d Maude said. \u201cThink, dear one, what do you know of him? What has he told you of his family, his life outside this here garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Lily said. She didn\u2019t want to face it, but it was true: Caliban was hiding who he was. \u201cBut Maude, he isn\u2019t violent\u2014not to us. You\u2019ve seen how gentle he\u2019s been with Indio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if that\u2019s just a false face?\u201d Maude\u2019s voice quavered. \u201cHe was sweet at first, too. I couldn\u2019t bear to lose you, hinney, I just couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lily finally looked up to see to her horror that Maude\u2019s eyes were misted. Impulsively she hugged the older woman tight and whispered in her ear, \u201cYou\u2019ll never lose me, Maude, not even if you try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, get on with you,\u201d Maude said, pulling away as if embarrassed at her own show of emotion. She swiped at her eyes with the corner of her apron. \u201cJust be careful. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Lily said solemnly as she picked up the basket and left before Maude could make any more arguments.</p><p>She found Indio outside kicking at a charred stick, breaking it to bits, while Daffodil nosed at a clump of violets. Indio held his precious boat in his arms.</p><p>He looked up eagerly as she came out the theater door. \u201cDid you bring the boiled eggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lily fell into step with him.</p><p>\u201cAnd the jammy tarts Maude made?\u201d Indio asked, skipping beside her.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuzzah!\u201d</p><p>She smiled down at him and then nodded as they passed a group of gardeners. Two of the three men stopped and doffed their hats, making her feel quite fine. They hadn\u2019t seen many of the gardeners beside Caliban, as most of the work seemed to have been away from the theater thus far. It was inevitable, she supposed, that their restoration would eventually reach the theater, though she was not looking forward to the loss of their privacy. Stepping outside to find strange men would be a bit disconcerting. Lily wondered if she ought to ask Mr. Harte for some sort of lock for the theater door.</p><p>Abruptly she realized that she didn\u2019t know where Caliban was working today. She looked down at her son, happily skipping with his boat cradled in his arms. \u201cDo you know where Caliban has gotten to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s by the pond, digging a hole in the ground,\u201d Indio said promptly.</p><p>Lily raised her eyebrows. \u201cIs he? Whatever for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno,\u201d Indio said, unconcerned. \u201cBut it\u2019s a big \u2019un\u2014bigger than any I\u2019ve ever dug before.\u201d</p><p>He sounded admiring. Of course to a little boy the adventure of digging the hole was probably reason enough for the labor.</p><p>They came to the pond and began walking along it as best they could given there wasn\u2019t a path. Several times they had to dodge away from the pond to go around debris, but at last they found Caliban.</p><p>He was a terrifically dirty mess, shoulder-deep in a hole that was indeed quite big. Daffodil ran to the edge and barked at him until he placed his hands on the side and levered himself out. He wore a bandage on his head to cover his wound, but it was much smaller than the one she\u2019d dressed it with the night before.</p><p>He grinned at the small dog and Indio, who showed him the boat, and then looked at Lily. Even with his face and hair dusted with dirt, his shirt near brown from the silt, her heart gave a little jump. Like Indio when he was excited.</p><p>She shook her head at herself and called, \u201cYou need to wash before luncheon.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his muddy hands and nodded. Then he simply took off his shirt and knelt by the pond to scoop water over his shoulders and face. The man had no modesty at all, it seemed.</p><p>Lily busied herself spreading a blanket on a dry patch of ground and unpacked their picnic. Daffodil immediately galloped up at the sight of food and attempted to steal a tart.</p><p>\u201cNo, Daff!\u201d Indio cried. The tarts were rather dear to his heart. \u201cHave this instead.\u201d And he handed her the fatty chicken tail they\u2019d saved for her.</p><p>Daffodil scurried off with her prize. Lily hoped fervently that the little dog wouldn\u2019t decide to bury the chicken tail, for she\u2019d done so in the past with what she considered delicacies and the results had been rather messy when disinterred for later leisurely enjoyment.</p><p>Caliban sat down, his shirt pulled over his head, but left loosely unlaced.</p><p>Lily looked away primly, her heart beating fast. He\u2019d slicked back his wet hair and he was, if not handsome, certainly compelling.</p><p>Hastily she took one of the plates from the basket. \u201cWould you like a chicken leg? Oh, and a hardboiled egg?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his broad mouth slightly curved as if he was amused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like an egg,\u201d Indio reminded her.</p><p>\u201cGuests first, Indio,\u201d she said gently, and put a generous helping of everything she\u2019d packed on a plate for Caliban before handing it over to him.</p><p>He lounged on his side, like a Roman aristocrat, carefully picking up a small piece of meat to eat.</p><p>She watched him out of the corner of her eye as she served Indio and then selected an egg and some bread for herself. She sat back, her legs curled to the side under her dress, and tilted her face to the sun\u2014it was quite welcome after the dreary weather they\u2019d had lately.</p><p>Daff came back, proudly bearing her chicken tail, and Caliban smiled at the little dog.</p><p>Which reminded her.</p><p>Lily cleared her throat as she tore off a bit of her bread. \u201cI noticed yesterday that you laughed.\u201d</p><p>He looked up, his head cocked in obvious inquiry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...\u201d She gestured with the bit of bread before realizing and placing it carefully on her plate. \u201cWell, it was out loud. I wondered, well, if you can laugh...\u201d</p><p>He was still staring at her, his expression hard to decipher.</p><p>She inhaled and just blurted it out. \u201cWhen was the last time you tried to speak?\u201d</p><p>He reached over and picked up his cloth bag, opening the flap and taking out the notebook. He bent to write and then showed her the notebook. Months ago. I assure you nothing happened.</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cHow long ago did you lose your voice?\u201d</p><p>He frowned and wrote. Nine or so months ago.</p><p>\u201cSo recently!\u201d She looked up in excitement. \u201cThat\u2019s less than a year. Don\u2019t you see? Your infirmity might not be permanent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d Indio asked, scrambling to his knees. \u201cWhat\u2019s a \u2019firmity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like an illness or a sickness.\u201d Lily glanced at Caliban and saw that his face had closed. His eyes flicked to her and then to Indio and she took the hint, though she was determined to continue the discussion later. \u201cWhat are you digging the hole for?\u201d</p><p>Caliban sat up at that, and Indio edged closer to look at his notebook as he wrote. I intend to plant an oak tree here.</p><p>She looked between his writing and the huge hole. \u201cThat\u2019s a big hole.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirked as he wrote and she knew even before she read his words that he\u2019d had a quick rejoinder.</p><p>She was correct: It\u2019s a big tree.</p><p>\u201cBut how can you plant a big tree?\u201d she asked as she cracked her egg. \u201cWon\u2019t it die when it\u2019s dug up from where it originally grew?\u201d</p><p>He began to write furiously at her question. She ate her egg as she watched him, marveling at how deeply involved he was in his profession. Indio lost interest in the discussion and delved in the basket for a jammy tart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At last Caliban showed her the notebook and she saw a full page of writing. He came to sit beside her as she read: It\u2019s a very difficult job to move a large tree, for the roots mirror the tree above. Thus, as tall as the tree might be, so far below the ground do the roots reach. Of course one cannot move such a mass of earth, for there is no machine to dig so far nor one to move it could it be dug up. But...</p><p>She marked her place with her finger and looked up. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t dig up the roots, how\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes and leaned forward, tapping the page below her finger.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She bent over the notebook, continuing to read, aware that he was looking over her shoulder now, reading his explanation along with her.</p> <p>But as a tree\u2019s branches might be cut\u2014quite sharply sometimes\u2014and the tree still live, indeed thrive, it is believed that the roots as well might be cut. In this way a tree can be moved with its roots in a ball of dirt that, in comparison to the tree\u2019s height, is quite small indeed.</p><p>Lily turned her head\u2014to find that his face was quite close to hers. She blinked, for a moment forgetting what her question was. Then it came to her. \u201cYou say here in comparison to the tree\u2019s height. But the earth and roots might still be quite big, mightn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly, as if particularly pleased with her question, and she couldn\u2019t help smiling in return.</p><p>He reached around her, his arms nearly embracing her, and wrote in the notebook on her lap, Very good. Yes, the root ball should be quite big, even so.</p><p>\u201cShould be?\u201d</p> <p>His breath was warm against her ear. I confess. I\u2019ve never attempted to transplant a fully grown tree. I shall do so, however, this afternoon. Would you like to watch?</p><p>If someone had asked her a fortnight ago if she\u2019d like to watch a tree being planted, she would\u2019ve looked at the questioner quite pityingly. But right now, this moment, she was rather excited at the prospect.</p><p>Perhaps too many viewings of Caliban\u2019s nude chest had addled her brain.</p><p>In any case she gazed into his thickly lashed brown eyes and smiled brilliantly. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>His grin was quick and all-encompassing and, she couldn\u2019t help but think, solely for her. As she watched, it faded a bit and his gaze dropped to her mouth. Her lips parted almost unconsciously, and she leaned a little forward, her own eyes on that wide, masculine smile.</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d Indio interrupted, his cheeks smeared with the remains of a jammy tart. \u201cCan I show Caliban my boat now?\u201d</p> <p>Lily jerked back from Caliban, feeling her cheeks heat, and caught the amused glance he gave her as he turned more leisurely to the boy.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she replied, repressing the urge to stick her tongue out at the maddening man. He\u2019d started it\u2014whatever it might\u2019ve been\u2014after all.</p><p>She watched as Indio eagerly crawled over with the boat. Caliban held it carefully, seeming to understand how important the toy was to her son, as Indio pointed out its best features and Daffodil poked her nose eagerly into the matter.</p><p>When at last they rose by some unspoken male accord, she noticed with a pang that Indio came only to Caliban\u2019s waist. The man towered over the boy, so much taller and broader that his gentleness was all the more moving as a result. They walked to the pond\u2019s bank and Indio launched his boat. Caliban restrained Daffodil from jumping in after.</p><p>This man was not at all like Kitty\u2019s husband. Not at all.</p><p>APOLLO WATCHED THAT afternoon as the machine containing his oak tree was hauled into the garden. Elegant in its simplicity, it was a sort of modified cart, and indeed two dray horses labored to pull the contraption in from the dock. Two wheels were at one end with a flat bed where the tree\u2019s huge roots lay. The bed narrowed into a long tongue that held the tree\u2019s trunk and was supported by a smaller single wheel. The horses were harnessed to the root end, where the bulk of the weight rested.</p><p>The entire thing had been brought down the Thames on a barge. Tree and machine had been especially ordered from a fellow garden architect whom Apollo had been corresponding with under the pseudonym Mr. Smith. He\u2019d been quite specific in his order, including both diagrams and copious notes, and was pleased with the result before him: his oak lay like a colossus fallen, the roots spidering out from the earth-encased base.</p><p>Now all they had to do was get the tree in the ground without mishap.</p> <p>Lily stood to one side with Indio and Daffodil capering at her feet. The gardeners had apparently become used to their presence in the garden, for there had been no questions when they\u2019d stayed to watch.</p><p>Apollo almost literally twitched with the desire to direct the operation himself. Herring, the head gardener, was a good Yorkshireman, able to read and follow Apollo\u2019s written instructions, but he was plodding and not much of a thinker. He had a hard time compensating when something didn\u2019t go as planned.</p><p>And many things might not go as planned with the oak tree.</p><p>Two of the gardeners\u2014dark-haired brothers from Ireland\u2014steadied the cart while a third man\u2014a short, wiry Londoner, new to Harte\u2019s Folly just this week\u2014led the horses. Herring shouted orders while Apollo, ignominiously demoted to dullard while in the company of the other gardeners, stood by with a shovel.</p><p>\u201cHold it there!\u201d Herring called, and studied the notes Apollo had left him the week before. \u201cSays here that the master wants the cart pulled to near the hole, then the horses to be unhitched there.\u201d He nodded to himself. \u201cMakes sense, that.\u201d</p><p>The horses were dutifully unhitched and Apollo, along with the Irish brothers, put his back into hauling the tree the remaining few feet over the hole. If he\u2019d measured the hole correctly and his correspondent had followed his measurements, the wheels should be just wide enough to straddle it.</p><p>He watched as the cart trundled into place and felt a surge of satisfaction in a job well done.</p><p>\u201cPretty as a lamb at its ma\u2019s tit, that,\u201d Herring said admiringly, then seemed to remember Miss Stump. \u201cIf\u2019n you\u2019ll pardon an old countryman\u2019s expression, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She waved cheerily. \u201cNot at all, Mr. Herring.\u201d</p><p>She exchanged an amused glance with Apollo and then he turned back to the work. The root ball now lay over the hole with the tree trunk extending to one side, parallel to the ground. Daffodil was nosing about the hole, as curious as usual, and Apollo gently toed her aside. Awful if the little dog should be stepped on as the men labored. All that was needed now was to haul the tree upright, cut its ropes and drop it\u2014gently\u2014into the waiting hole.</p><p>\u201cStand back, you,\u201d Herring ordered Apollo. \u201cLet the ones with some wits attach the ropes or we\u2019ll have it all down around our ears and I don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do then.\u201d</p><p>Apollo feigned patience, standing by as the other men tied the ropes. He winced as one of the Irish brothers drew a rope over-tight about the oak\u2019s trunk and hoped the man hadn\u2019t damaged the bark.</p><p>He took one of the ropes as one of the Irishmen and the small Londoner took the other.</p><p>\u201cAll together now,\u201d Herring called. \u201cAnd don\u2019t be hasty. Slow and steady\u2019ll get us there faster.\u201d</p><p>At Herring\u2019s signal, Apollo and the other two men pulled on their ropes, hand over hand, hauling the tree upright. The tongue and the bed of the cart pivoted as one on the two big wheels as the smaller wheel left the ground. Two ropes were needed for stability and to keep the tree from falling to one side or the other. Now that Apollo was actually pulling the oak tree upright he was beginning to think that three or even four ropes might have been better. Well, he\u2019d experiment with the next tree they transplanted into the garden.</p><p>Sweat stung as it dripped into his eyes. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed that Daffodil was back, peering interestedly into the hole, but he couldn\u2019t move to shoo her away. His muscles strained and he could hear the loud grunts of the other men. Slowly the tree rose, majestic and tall. It would be lovely at the side of the pond and in a hundred years, when it had spread its branches over the water, it would be magnificent.</p><p>He felt the sudden, sickening slackening of the rope first, followed closely by a hoarse shout from one of the gardeners on the other rope. That rope was whipping through the air, free of the men\u2019s hands. Apollo looked up and saw the great oak shudder and then begin falling toward him.</p><p>At the same time, Indio darted between him and the cart as Daffodil slipped and slid helplessly into the tree hole.</p><p>The sound ripped from him, like a thing outside himself, a beast that\u2019d been bound inside his gut and would no longer stand to be caged.</p><p>The shout burned as it roared through his throat.</p><p>\u201cINDIO!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Now it fell one year that the maiden chosen as sacrifice was named Ariadne. She was the only child of a poor wise woman, and her mother wept bitter tears at the news. Then the wise woman dried her cheeks and said to her daughter, \u201cRemember this: when you are presented to the court, curtsy not only to the king, but to the mad queen as well, and ask her if there is anything you may take to her son.\u201d...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>Lily heard Indio\u2019s name shouted and then all was drowned in the roar of the oak crashing down.</p><p>Down where Caliban had stood.</p><p>Down where Indio had darted.</p><p>The men were yelling. The horses bolted, dragging their harness behind, and where Apollo\u2019s planting hole had been was only wreckage and a cloud of sooty dust.</p><p>She ran forward, pushing against smashed tree branches, fighting the man who tried to restrain her. He had to be in there somewhere, perhaps with only a broken limb or a bloodied back. Her lips were moving, muttering, as she bargained with whatever deity would listen. The tree was big, the branches lying shattered and sticking up everywhere and in her way.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d she screamed at the arms holding her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see them. Even in the mess of demolished branches, there should be some sign\u2014Indio\u2019s red coat or Caliban\u2019s white shirt.</p><p>Then in the shouting she heard it: a yip.</p><p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d she called, and wonder of wonders, the men actually listened.</p><p>In the sudden silence Daffodil\u2019s high, hysterical barking was quite clear\u2014and coming from inside the hole.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be,\u201d Mr. Herring said, amazement in his voice.</p><p>She turned and looked. At first she saw only the mess of roots. There wasn\u2019t space in there, surely, for a small dog, let alone a man and boy. But as she watched, a huge hand slapped down on the edge. She started for the hole even as Caliban emerged, head and broad shoulders blackened, clutching Indio to his chest like Hephaestus rising from his underworld forge.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen such a wonderful sight.</p><p>He tossed a very dirty Daffodil over the edge of the hole. The little dog tumbled, righted herself, and shook vigorously, and then she ran to Lily, tail wagging as if nothing especially remarkable had happened.</p><p>Lily ignored the greyhound in favor of her son. Caliban had set him on the edge of the hole before heaving himself over.</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d Indio said, and then burst into tears.</p><p>She knelt in front of him, feeling his body with trembling hands. He had a bloody nose and a scrape on his chin. His hair was quite filthy with dirt, but otherwise he was sound.</p><p>She clutched him to her chest and looked over his little shoulder at Caliban. \u201cThank you. I don\u2019t know how you did it, but thank you for saving my son.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to bring Indio out of his shocked tears. \u201cHe caught me, Mama!\u201d he said, looking at her with his mud-and-salt-streaked face. \u201cCaliban caught me and pushed me an\u2019 him in the hole and the oak tree comed down on us, but it didn\u2019t really because the machine was on the outside, see?\u201d And he pointed to where the tree had landed on top of the hole instead of in it.</p><p>Lily shuddered at the sight, for if one of the wheels of the machine had slid, the entire root ball would\u2019ve fallen on them instead of merely tilting half in the hole. But she smiled for Indio. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I see, but there mustn\u2019t have been very much room down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there wasn\u2019t,\u201d Indio assured her earnestly. \u201cAnd Caliban lay on top of me an\u2019 Daff.\u201d He leaned close to whisper in her ear. \u201cHe\u2019s very heavy. Daff squeaked. I think she was nearly squashed.\u201d</p><p>Lily laughed through her tears at this bit of information, for she understood as her son seemed not to that Caliban had covered Indio to protect him from the tree roots.</p><p>She glanced again at Caliban as she said, \u201cYou and Daffodil were very brave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the best part, Mama,\u201d Indio said, tugging her hand to get her attention, \u201cthe best part is Caliban spoke.

That shout right before the accident\u2014had that been him?</p><p>Caliban looked away from her, his face pale, and she immediately wanted to get him alone so that she might find out if he could truly speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad your boy\u2019s safe, ma\u2019am.\u201d Mr. Herring\u2019s words were kind but he was looking worriedly at the wreckage of the tree and machine.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be taking him back to the theater for a bath and to patch up his scratches. And I\u2019ll do the same for... erm...\u201d Good Lord, what did the other gardeners call Caliban? She gestured vaguely at him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mr. Herring glanced at her in alarm. \u201cBut I\u2019ve already lost the new man\u2014ran off who knows where. I\u2019ll be needing Smith.\u201d</p><p>Smith? Lily drew herself up. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I must insist, Mr. Herring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, very well.\u201d The head gardener waved her off wearily. \u201cProbably won\u2019t get much work done the rest of the day anyway. Don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll be tellin\u2019 the master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling that won\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Lily muttered under her breath, ignoring Caliban\u2019s warning glare. She turned to Indio. \u201cCan you walk to the theater, love?\u201d</p><p>The question seemed to prick her son\u2019s male pride\u2014a fickle, easily provoked thing\u2014and he snapped back, \u201cOf course, Mama.\u201d</p><p>His hauteur was rather ruined, though, by the drooping of his shoulders. Now that the excitement was past it was evident that the accident had taken its toll upon Indio\u2019s stamina. He yawned widely even as he stumbled down the path. In another few steps Caliban scooped him up without a word.</p> <p>The thought made Lily eye the big man carrying her son on his shoulder. He could talk\u2014or at least he had spoken. One word, true, but surely where there was one there were more? Lily spent the rest of the walk to the theater with myriad questions swarming her brain.</p><p>Maude was away shopping for the afternoon, so the theater was empty when they arrived.</p><p>She waited until they were safely inside before turning to Caliban and demanding, \u201cCan you talk?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth and for a terrible moment nothing happened, but then sound emerged, creaking and halting. \u201cI think... yes.\u201d He swallowed and winced, as if the words physically hurt.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lily whispered, pressing her fingertips to her trembling mouth. \u201cOh, I am glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d Indio said sleepily from Caliban\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSo you did,\u201d Lily replied, wiping at her eyes with her fingers. She was turning into a veritable watering pot. She inhaled to steady herself. \u201cI think you need a nap, little man.\u201d</p><p>It was a measure of how exhausted Indio was that he didn\u2019t even protest that he was now much too old for naps. Lily relaxed her cleanliness standards far enough to simply insist she wash his face for him before laying him down, already mostly asleep, in her own bed.</p> <p>She gently shut the door to her bedroom and looked up to find Caliban reading her play in the outer room.</p><p>He set down the sheet he\u2019d been holding and cleared his throat. \u201cIt... is... good.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cVery... good.\u201d</p><p>His voice was naturally deep, but there was a strained, hoarse quality about it that suggested damage.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She\u2019d had compliments on her plays, but they\u2019d always been filtered through Edwin. No one had told her in person that they liked her writing. \u201cIt\u2019s not done, of course, and I need to work quite hard on it if I\u2019m to get it finished in time\u2014I\u2019ve only a week\u2014but I think it might well be one of my better ones. That is, if I can do something about Pimberly. He\u2019s rather priggish at the moment. But\u201d\u2014she reeled in her wandering words with a deep breath\u2014\u201cyou don\u2019t want to hear about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said, interrupting her.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She stared and then had to look down shyly\u2014she was never shy! \u201cThat\u2019s good. I mean... I\u2019m glad, but you\u2019ll be wanting to wash your face and see to your wounds right now, surely?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, perhaps saving his voice, but he kept his gaze on her, watching her as she fetched water and cloths. She came to where he sat at the table and placed the basin there.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d she asked, surprised at how husky her voice was.</p><p>He nodded again, tilting his face up.</p><p>First she peeked beneath the bandage on his head. The wound was scabbing over and didn\u2019t look damaged, so she replaced the bandage and left it as it was. In the silence she dipped a cloth in the water and wrung it out, then gently patted at his face. Up close she could see it was badly scraped in several places, and she thought of his bearing the brunt of that tree for her son.</p><p>She rewetted the cloth. \u201cHow is your back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... fine.\u201d</p><p>She smoothed over his right cheekbone where the bloody cut was. \u201cI\u2019ll check it after I\u2019ve washed your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no... need.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, sweet but insistent. His back would\u2019ve been the hardest hit when he\u2019d covered Indio and Daffodil. \u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>He made no reply to that, so she continued, gently wiping around his nose, over the broad brow, and up the craggy cheekbones. Not a handsome face. Not pretty or comely. But it was a good face, she thought. Certainly masculine.</p><p>Certainly one she was attracted to.</p><p>She paused, swallowing at the thought. She did not know this man. She knew of him\u2014knew that he would without hesitation fling himself into a filthy hole to save her son, knew he was kind to silly dogs and quarrelsome old women, knew he could, with a single, certain look, make her insides heat and melt\u2014but she did not know him.</p><p>She straightened, concentrating as she wetted the cloth again, watching her fingers wring brown water out. \u201cHow did you lose your voice, Caliban?\u201d</p><p>When she turned back to him, his face was closed, his eyes shuttered.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. She had to find out something\u2014some small thing about him.</p><p>Maybe he understood her plea. Or perhaps he was so tired he could no longer fight her.</p><p>\u201cIt was a... beating,\u201d he said, his voice croaking. He cleared his throat, but it sounded the same when next he spoke. \u201cHe... a man stood... on my neck.\u201d He touched his hand to his Adam\u2019s apple.</p><p>She stared. He was big and brave and she knew he could move swiftly. How could he have been bested in a fight? Unless...</p><p>\u201cHow many were there?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His eyes flicked to hers, sardonic acknowledgement in them. \u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>Even so... \u201cWere you drunk or asleep?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI was...\u201d</p><p>He looked away from her as if ashamed. Her eyes narrowed. What had happened to put that look on Caliban\u2019s face?</p><p>He cleared his throat and tried again. \u201cI... was... chained.\u201d</p><p>Chained. She blinked. The only persons she knew who might be chained were prisoners.</p><p>Suddenly she felt much better. A man might be imprisoned for many things\u2014debt chief among them. Edwin had spent an uncomfortable month in Fleet Prison several years back.</p><p>She bent to wipe his chin, the cloth catching at stubble. \u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t speak after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He frowned. \u201cI could... not...\u201d He inhaled sharply as if in frustration. \u201cI... was knocked out... they... the three of them...\u201d He swallowed, grimacing, and she realized with sudden comprehension that there might be more to the story.</p><p>A big, powerful man chained, made helpless. She\u2019d seen boys poke at a chained bear\u2014a beast they\u2019d run screaming from were it free to do as it would. Little boys\u2014and weak men\u2014fancied themselves brave in the face of such helplessness. It made them giddy with false power. And they were apt to wield that power in terrible and cruel ways.</p><p>Had such a thing been done to her Caliban?</p><p>The thought made her light-headed with rage. No one had the right to bolster his own feeble manhood by tearing down Caliban\u2019s.</p><p>She took a deep breath, knowing that pity was the last thing he\u2019d want. \u201cI see,\u201d she said, her voice level.</p><p>He shook his head, his mouth twisting. \u201cIt was... months... ago.\u201d</p><p>And his simple bravery, his quiet pride, finally broke her. She let the cloth slip from her fingers and bent down to kiss him.</p><p>His reaction was immediate and decided. He wrapped his strong arms around her waist and pulled her into his lap, forcing her to straddle his legs. He cradled the back of her head in the spread of his fingers, angled his head for a better fit, and opened his mouth over hers.</p><p>And, oh, the man knew how to kiss.</p><p>His tongue licked into her mouth, tasting of wine and want, sure and in no hurry. He explored her thoroughly, sliding against her own tongue, taunting before withdrawing. He caught her bottom lip between his teeth, worrying gently, and chuckled low in his throat when she moaned and arched into him. Her skirts were caught between their bodies and naturally he still wore his breeches, but she could feel a hardness there\u2014big and powerful. Her breasts ached against her bodice and she suddenly wished all their clothes vanished\u2014that she could discover him for who he was.</p><p>She must\u2019ve gone a little mad then, for she found her fingers threaded in his still dusty hair, tugging at it, demanding something that she couldn\u2019t articulate.</p><p>It was he who had to break from her, and only then, as she was glaring at him for the interruption, did she hear Maude humph behind her.</p><p>\u201cFar be it from me to interrupt, hinney, when you\u2019re a-wallowin\u2019 in the mud with a man, but I\u2019ve supper to put on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBUT WHY ARE we going to Harte\u2019s Folly?\u201d Lady Phoebe asked late the next morning, wrinkling her nose, presumably at the stink of the Thames, although for all Trevillion knew it was at his continued presence in her life. \u201cI understand the theater and garden are quite burned to the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are, my lady.\u201d Trevillion glared at the wherryman who\u2019d been unashamedly listening in. The wherryman hurriedly bent to his oars. \u201cBut the garden is in a state of renovation and I thought you\u2019d be interested. Also,\u201d he added very drily, \u201cI have business there, and since my job is to guard you and you insisted on going out today, I couldn\u2019t very well make the journey without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, her voice small, as she let her fingers trail in the water.</p><p>The wherryman scowled at him.</p><p>Trevillion sighed and turned to watch the Harte\u2019s Folly dock draw near. The pleasure garden had been a very popular attraction before the fire, and the dock had once been wide and well maintained. Now it was half fallen into the Thames, only a narrow part shored up and rebuilt with new wood. Behind the dock the burnt and ruined vegetation looked positively grim\u2014not at all like a frivolous pleasure garden. \u2019Twas said that Harte intended to rebuild the garden entirely, but Trevillion thought it an almost impossible goal, attainable only with a tremendous outlay of money, and then the end result still uncertain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But that was hardly his concern.</p><p>The wherryman caught at the dock, pulling the small boat close enough to fling a rope over one of the wooden posts on the side.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here, my lady,\u201d Trevillion said to Lady Phoebe, although she probably knew from the lurch of the boat. \u201cThere\u2019s a ladder to your right, just past the gunwale of the boat.\u201d</p><p>He watched as she felt for the rough wooden ladder with her fingertips.</p> <p>\u201cNow take my hand, my lady.\u201d He lightly pressed against her forearm so she\u2019d know where his hand was.</p><p>\u201cI have it,\u201d she said impatiently, taking his hand nevertheless as she gingerly climbed out.</p><p>He made sure to hold her firmly until she was standing on the dock. He followed as swiftly as possible, despite being hampered by both lame leg and cane.</p><p>\u201cWait for us,\u201d he ordered the wherryman, tossing him a coin.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d the wherryman muttered, pulling his broad-brimmed hat over his face as he lounged back in his boat. No doubt he meant to fill the time with a nap.</p> <p>\u201cThis way, my lady,\u201d Trevillion said to Lady Phoebe, giving her his left arm. He leaned heavily on his cane with his right hand. A crude path had been cleared, leading from the dock into the garden, but debris still littered the ground. \u201cMind your step. The ground is uneven.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head from side to side as they walked, sniffing the air. \u201cIt still smells quite strongly of the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d he replied, guiding her around a charred lump\u2014perhaps a fallen tree, though it was hard to tell. \u201cThe ground is blackened and what trees remain are scorched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sad,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI did so love this place.\u201d</p><p>Her brows were knit, her plump lips drooping.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cThere are a few signs of rebirth,\u201d he remarked, feeling a fool even as he said it.</p> <p>She perked up. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome green blades of grass. And the sun is shining,\u201d he said lamely. He caught sight of something. \u201cAh. There\u2019s a sort of small purple flower off to the left as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there?\u201d She brightened. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand and carefully pulled it down to the pathetic little flower.</p><p>She felt it so gently the petals weren\u2019t even bruised.</p><p>\u201cA violet, I think,\u201d she said at last, straightening. \u201cI\u2019d pick it to smell, but with so few survivors I don\u2019t want to steal it away.\u201d</p><p>He forbore to say that one violet hardly made a garden.</p><p>She sighed as they continued. \u201cVery few signs of rebirth indeed. I wonder how Mr. Harte will ever rebuild it?\u201d</p> <p>Privately he thought the matter a lost cause, but he decided not to share that thought with her.</p><p>They were nearing the theater and Trevillion frowned. He\u2019d not thought this out well enough. He hadn\u2019t made specific plans with Lord Kilbourne about where or when to meet. The man might be anywhere.</p><p>When they came within sight of the theater, however, his problem was solved. Lord Kilbourne was digging a hole some yards from the theater while a small dark-haired boy sat nearby, apparently chatting with him.</p><p>Trevillion felt his brows lift. Where had the boy come from? There were no residences for a half mile at the least in any direction.</p><p>The boy had a small, thin dog lying curled at his side, and the creature raised its head at their approach. In a blur it was up and racing over, yapping wildly.</p><p>Trevillion scowled at the beast. It was jumping excitedly at Lady Phoebe\u2019s skirts. \u201cDown, you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Captain, I don\u2019t think I need be protected from a lapdog,\u201d Lady Phoebe said, and before he could ascertain if the animal was friendly or not, knelt before the thing.</p><p>Immediately it began pawing at her and licking her face.</p><p>Lady Phoebe laughed, hands outstretched, but the dog was too excited to hold still so she might pet it. Her round face was positively lit with joy. \u201cWhat kind is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied, looking away from her. \u201cSomething small, thin, and hysterical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaffodil\u2019s an Italian greyhound,\u201d the boy said, having trotted after his dog. \u201cYou can pet her if you like. She doesn\u2019t bite, although,\u201d he added, entirely unnecessarily, \u201cshe does lick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can feel that,\u201d Lady Phoebe replied, smiling. Her face was tilted toward the sky. \u201cI once had a friend who had an Italian greyhound. What color is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed,\u201d the boy said, adding with the frankness of the young, \u201ccan\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Phoebe is blind, boy,\u201d Trevillion said sharply.</p><p>His charge winced and turned a glare on him, which was quite effective, unseeing or not.</p><p>The child shrank back at his tone, and Trevillion noticed his eyes were mismatched: one blue, one green. \u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be,\u201d Lady Phoebe said gently. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Indio,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s Caliban, my friend\u201d\u2014he pointed to Lord Kilbourne, which made Trevillion\u2019s eyebrows rise farther\u2014\u201cand my mama is in the theater.\u201d</p><p>Lady Phoebe turned her head at that as if she could look about. \u201cWe\u2019re near the theater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought the theater burned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it did, mostly,\u201d Indio replied. \u201cBut part of it\u2019s good. That\u2019s where we live.\u201d</p><p>Her brows knit. \u201cYou live here?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, apparently having already forgotten that she couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cMy mama is a famous actress. She\u2019s Robin Goodfellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she?\u201d Lady Phoebe breathed, evidently delighted. \u201cMight I meet her? I\u2019m a great admirer.\u201d</p><p>And within minutes Lady Phoebe had somehow become fast friends with Miss Goodfellow and was taking tea with her at a table brought out to the garden.</p><p>\u201cDid... they already... know each other?\u201d Lord Kilbourne asked.</p><p>He and Trevillion had taken themselves far enough from the theater that they couldn\u2019t be heard by the ladies, but were close enough for Trevillion to keep an eye on his charge. Kilbourne had glanced once at his cane and suggested a fallen log to sit on. Trevillion had been too grateful for the respite for his leg to worry about his pride.</p><p>Somehow, in the days since Trevillion had seen him, the viscount had miraculously regained the power of speech, though his words were slow and his voice quite rough. There was a story there, Trevillion knew, but it didn\u2019t concern him at the moment.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Trevillion said, watching as Lady Phoebe laughed at something Miss Goodfellow told her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimply... marvelous,\u201d Kilbourne muttered, sounding nonetheless confused. His gaze, Trevillion noticed, lingered a fraction too long on the actress.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The other looked at him at that and Trevillion noticed that the viscount was sporting a series of new scratches across his face.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Kilbourne replied coolly. \u201cI collect... you have some... information for me?\u201d</p><p>Trevillion straightened. \u201cYes, my lord. I\u2019ve made some inquiries into the histories and situations of your friends who died that night. Maubry, as you said, was destined to become a churchman. According to his remaining friends he had no enemies and wasn\u2019t in debt, nor had he offended anyone in the months before his death. I think we may consider him a blameless victim.\u201d</p><p>Kilbourne nodded, looking grim. He was watching the ladies again.</p><p>Trevillion turned to look as well, observing as Lady Phoebe discreetly felt the tartlet on her plate with her fingertips before taking a bite. She was very deft at living with her infirmity, he mused.</p><p>\u201cMr. Tate was indeed his uncle\u2019s heir,\u201d he continued. \u201cAt Tate\u2019s death, a very distant cousin became heir and eventually inherited the uncle\u2019s estate of some two thousand pounds per annum\u2014not a fortune, but by no means an insignificant sum. However, the cousin in question lived in the American Colonies until only a year ago. While he might certainly have sent agents to murder his cousin, it seems, on the surface at least, unlikely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Kilbourne replied, sounding a little absentminded.</p><p>Miss Goodfellow was at that moment licking her lips of some tartlet crumbs.</p><p>Trevillion cleared his throat. \u201cAs for Smithers, the last man, there I did find something of interest.\u201d</p><p>Kilbourne looked at him sharply. \u201cHow... so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike the rest of you,\u201d Trevillion said, \u201che was in debt\u2014and for quite a large amount, to a rather nasty sort\u2014men running a gambling den in the stews of Whitechapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that was... it?\u201d Kilbourne\u2019s face was stoically blank.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trevillion said reluctantly. \u201cHis creditors didn\u2019t recoup their money on his death, nor was it widely known that he owed them.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMurdering Smithers along with two other gentlemen would\u2019ve been a poor business decision, and these villains are, if nothing else, quite sharp men of business.\u201d</p><p>A muscle in Kilbourne\u2019s jaw flexed and he glanced away\u2014for the first time not at Miss Goodfellow. \u201cThen... you have nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite, my lord,\u201d Trevillion replied softly.</p><p>Kilbourne merely stared at him stonily, as if he\u2019d let hope seize his emotions too many times in the past to permit it free rein again.</p><p>Trevillion met his gaze and said bluntly, \u201cYour uncle is in debt, my lord, to your grandfather, the earl\u2019s, estate\u2014and has been for at least a decade. If you inherit the title, I suspect he would find himself in a very awkward position, for he doesn\u2019t have the monies to repay the estate. Had you died that night, he would\u2019ve inherited the title\u2014and the money that goes with it upon your grandfather\u2019s death. He would never have to repay the debt and wouldn\u2019t fear the courts or debtor\u2019s prison.\u201d</p><p>Kilbourne\u2019s expression didn\u2019t even flicker\u2014proving that he was as intelligent as Trevillion had suspected. \u201cBut I... didn\u2019t die. Instead... apparently I... was drugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink,\u201d Kilbourne murmured low, for if what he suspected was true, they had a powerful man as an enemy. \u201cHad you been murdered then, had not a common thief or some such been apprehended, your uncle, as the next heir to the earldom, would\u2019ve been the natural suspect. But if you were drugged and your friends killed instead, you are made the murderer, and must perforce be brought to justice\u2014and the hangman. A scandal, surely, but in no way your uncle\u2019s fault\u2014and with the same result as if he\u2019d murdered you himself: your death. It was,\u201d he added thoughtfully, \u201ca rather elegant scheme, you must admit, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll... forgive me if... I don\u2019t,\u201d Kilbourne replied drily. \u201cI would\u2019ve... been dead these four years... had not my distant... cousin, the Earl of... Brightmore not been so horrified... at the thought of a relation... of his being tried for... murder that he bundled... me away in Bedlam instead.\u201d He paused, swallowing, after such a long speech. \u201cScant... comfort though... that was at the time. I think... I might\u2019ve preferred... the noose.\u201d</p><p>Trevillion reflected sardonically that he must be grateful, then, to Brightmore, for he\u2019d saved Trevillion from indirectly sending an innocent man to his death.</p><p>\u201cWhy...\u201d Kilbourne started, and then had to cough and clear his throat. \u201cIf your... theory is true, why... wouldn\u2019t my... uncle have had me killed in Bedlam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he thought you would die there, my lord.\u201d Trevillion shrugged. \u201cMany do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kilbourne nodded, contemplating that for a moment, or perhaps letting his throat rest. He said abruptly, \u201cMy grandfather... is dying... or so my sister informs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen your uncle will want you dead as well,\u201d Trevillion replied. \u201cHe made some very unwise investments in the last year and his debt has doubled just in the last five months.\u201d</p><p>Kilbourne stared at him, frowning.</p><p>\u201cHis need has become acute, I think.\u201d Trevillion met his gaze and once again noticed the scratches on the other man\u2019s cheek. \u201cWhere did you get those scratches, my lord? You\u2019re looking much the worse for wear since I saw you last.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYesterday...\u201d Kilbourne coughed, raising a hand to finger the scratches. \u201cI nearly died... from a falling tree... that was to... be planted.

If I could follow your sister, so, too, could your uncle\u2019s men.\u201d</p><p>Kilbourne shook his head violently, coughing. \u201cAccident,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think that yourself or you wouldn\u2019t have told me,\u201d Trevillion said impatiently.</p><p>At the same time a voice called, \u201cHullo! Hullo! I say, can anyone tell me where Mr. Smith is?\u201d</p> <p>They both pivoted to see a red-haired young man, not more than five and twenty, blinking in the sunlight far too close to the ladies, and already being assaulted by the little dog.</p><p>\u201cDamnation,\u201d Trevillion muttered. It seemed their t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate was over. \u201cListen to me, my lord. You must leave the garden. Find some other place of hiding until we can devise a plan to find evidence against your uncle.\u201d</p><p>Kilbourne was still shaking his head, though more slowly now, his eyes fixed toward the theater. \u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Trevillion followed the direction of his gaze\u2014naturally to where Miss Goodfellow was rising to meet the newcomer. \u201cCan\u2019t\u2014or won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Kilbourne never took his eyes from her, but his face hardened with determination. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p> <p>The next morning Ariadne journeyed to the golden castle. There the king sat on a jewel-encrusted throne with, beside him, his mad queen, spinning red wool with a wooden distaff and spindle. The youth chosen with Ariadne made a low bow to the king and then turned aside. But Ariadne, remembering her mother\u2019s warning, curtsied to the king and then the queen and inquired politely of her if there was aught she might bring her son. Without a word the queen handed her spindle to the girl...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>Lily met Caliban\u2019s gaze across the clearing and felt heat climb her cheeks. His eyes were hot and intent.</p><p>He looked at her as if with a single kiss he\u2019d already claimed her.</p><p>She glanced away, inhaling. It had only been one kiss and they hadn\u2019t had a chance to speak properly since. Last night there\u2019d been Maude, sharp and sarcastic and disapproving, and this morning Indio had been excited and scampering about. And that had been before Lady Phoebe and Captain Trevillion showed up.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d that lady asked, facing in the direction of the young man advancing toward them. Daffodil had finished welcoming him and was now dashing off to her master. Indio had previously wandered away from their tea party and was playing by the corner of the theater in what looked suspiciously like a mud puddle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea,\u201d Lily replied, hoping she didn\u2019t sound as irritable as she felt. Good Lord, Harte\u2019s Folly had become like a county fair\u2014a veritable crossroads of visitors. Belatedly she remembered her manners and tacked on, \u201cMy lady.\u201d</p><p>Lady Phoebe smiled and asked softly, \u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d</p> <p>Of course Lady Phoebe had no idea of the aspect or even the age of the man approaching them.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a young man with bright red hair and a comely face,\u201d Lily answered quietly and quickly. \u201cWearing a black tricorn and an acorn-brown suit. The waistcoat is a lighter shade, more tan than brown, and trimmed in a fine scarlet ribbon. Not expensive, but well cut.\u201d She cocked her head, considering. \u201cHe\u2019s quite handsome, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Lady Phoebe said with some satisfaction, sitting back.</p><p>Lily only had time for a glance of amusement at the other woman\u2014she really was quite delightful\u2014before the gentleman was upon them.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he called in a faint Scottish accent. He came to a stop, swept his hat from his head, and gave a lovely bow. \u201cI am Mr. Malcolm MacLeish. Whom might I have the honor of addressing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Miss Robin Goodfellow,\u201d Lily said as she curtsied, \u201cand this is Lady Phoebe Batten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord!\u201d Mr. MacLeish exclaimed, his bright-blue eyes opening wide as he staggered dramatically back. \u201cAn honor indeed, ladies! I had the privilege of attending a production of As You Like It a year or two ago, Miss Goodfellow, in which you were a most magnificent Rosalind.\u201d</p><p>She curtsied again, amused at his profusion. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my Lady Phoebe,\u201d Mr. MacLeish said, turning to her, \u201cI am in awe of your presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, sir,\u201d Lady Phoebe replied, cocking her head, with a trace of a smile playing about her mouth. She didn\u2019t look quite in his direction. \u201cAt my mere presence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes, my lady,\u201d he replied, obviously uncertain if she teased or not. He darted a quick glance at Lily, but she decided to leave him to his own devices since he\u2019d dug the hole for himself with his enthusiasm. \u201cYour beauty alone is enough to put wonder in my gaze.\u201d</p><p>Lady Phoebe burst into laughter. From any other lady it might\u2019ve been taken as an insult or at the very least a gentle belittlement\u2014but from her it was simply a sign of joyous amusement.</p><p>Lily couldn\u2019t help grinning in sympathy\u2014the other woman\u2019s laughter was that infectious.</p><p>\u201cBut Mr. MacLeish,\u201d Lady Phoebe said, bringing her mirth under control, \u201cI\u2019ve been told that you are yourself quite an ugly specimen of manhood.\u201d</p><p>The young man\u2019s eyes widened as sudden realization washed over his features, but to his credit he recovered quickly\u2014and without insulting Lady Phoebe\u2019s intelligence. \u201cBut my lady, I do protest. I am accorded one of the finest-looking gentlemen in England, with milk-white skin, straight teeth, blue eyes... and shining golden hair.\u201d</p><p>Lady Phoebe shook her head. \u201cLying to a blind woman, Mr. MacLeish? I\u2019ve already heard you have bright-red hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady, you wound me,\u201d the young man exclaimed, hand to heart, though Lady Phoebe couldn\u2019t see the gesture. \u201cI vow I\u2019ve had many a lady at my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd elsewhere?\u201d she asked, her eyelashes lowered.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t tease the boy, my lady,\u201d Captain Trevillion said as he limped to the table. Caliban was by his side, his eyes alert, Lily noticed. He gave her one blazing glance and then focused on the newcomer.</p><p>The captain\u2019s words fell awkwardly on their light flirtation, breaking the effervescent mood.</p><p>Lady Phoebe stiffened.</p><p>Mr. MacLeish sobered immediately, eyeing the pistols strapped across Captain Trevillion\u2019s chest. \u201cAnd who might you be, sir?\u201d</p><p>Before the man could reply, Lady Phoebe said, \u201cThis is Captain James Trevillion, who has been set to guard me by my brother, like a dog chained before a tasty pork pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think of you, my lady, as more of an apple tart,\u201d Captain Trevillion murmured. He turned to the younger man. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Malcolm MacLeish,\u201d the Scotsman replied, and Lily was glad to see that he didn\u2019t look at all cowed by the former dragoon\u2019s stern manner. Caliban had explained that Captain Trevillion was some sort of business acquaintance, but she had seen the soldier try to kill him, and only recently, so she thought she might be forgiven a bit of prejudice. \u201cI\u2019ve been commissioned as architect for the rebuilding of Harte\u2019s Folly by His Grace the Duke of Montgomery. He informed me that the garden designer, a Mr. Smith, was to be found here.\u201d</p><p>Caliban had stilled during this little speech and at the end of it he nodded. \u201cI am... he.\u201d</p><p>Mr. MacLeish brightened. \u201cVery good to meet you, sir.\u201d He held out his hand and for a moment Caliban looked at it as if it were a strange and foreign thing before he seemed to recollect himself and shook hands with younger man. \u201cIf you\u2019ll show me the grounds and what you yourself have planned, I would be most grateful.\u201d</p><p>Captain Trevillion\u2019s eyes narrowed and he exchanged some type of significant glance with Caliban.</p><p>Lily sighed. She really was getting quite tired of not knowing what was going on.</p><p>And apparently she wasn\u2019t the only one.</p><p>\u201cYour pardon,\u201d Lady Phoebe said, suddenly sounding every inch the daughter of a duke, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think you introduced me to Mr. Smith, Captain. I confess myself curious to meet the man you were so eager to see today.\u201d</p><p>Lily could tell by the stiffening of Captain Trevillion\u2019s back that he did not care for Lady Phoebe\u2019s interruption, but for the life of her, she couldn\u2019t understand why.</p><p>Yet he said politely enough, \u201cMy lady, may I present Mr....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d Caliban supplied. \u201cJust Sam Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Sam Smith?\u201d Captain Trevillion continued smoothly. \u201cMr. Smith, Lady Phoebe Batten, the Duke of Wakefield\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Lady Phoebe held out her hand imperiously and Caliban was forced to take it, bowing over it as he said in his broken voice, \u201cMy lady... I am most... pleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head at his voice. \u201cHave you a cold, Mr. Smith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo... my lady,\u201d he said so gently that Lily felt an unfamiliar pang of jealousy. \u201cI recently... injured my throat and... as a result... my voice.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>He tried to extricate his hand from hers, but she seemed to hold him fast. \u201cTell me, Mr. Smith, and know that it is a mortal sin to lie to a blind woman: have we met before?\u201d</p><p>The strangest expression crossed Caliban\u2019s face. Lily wasn\u2019t entirely sure, but it seemed to be sadness. \u201cNo... my lady. We\u2019ve... never met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said, finally letting go of his hand. \u201cMy mistake, then.\u201d</p><p>Caliban turned to Mr. MacLeish. \u201cI shall be... happy to show... you about the garden... such as it is... sir.\u201d He hesitated and glanced at Lily. \u201cI believe... you were... interested in the... garden as well... ma\u2019am? Would... you like a... tour sometime... after luncheon? Say... three of the clock?\u201d</p><p>Lily felt suddenly breathless, but she managed to say calmly enough, \u201cI shall look forward to it, Mr. Smith.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThen... if you\u2019ll all... excuse us?\u201d He gestured with one arm, rather gracefully. \u201cThis way... if you please... Mr. MacLeish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d said that gentleman. \u201cLady Phoebe, Miss Goodfellow, a positive delight to meet you both. I do hope our paths will cross again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do I,\u201d Lady Phoebe replied, smiling.</p><p>Lily dipped another curtsy and murmured her farewells.</p><p>Mr. MacLeish sobered as he touched his hand to his hat. \u201cCaptain Trevillion. A pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll mine, I assure you,\u201d the soldier drawled, so drily he might as well have been exhaling dust.</p><p>They watched the two men stride off, Caliban already explaining his plan for the garden.</p><p>Captain Trevillion pivoted back to the ladies. \u201cIf you\u2019re ready, my lady, I do seem to recall you had some \u2018important\u2019 shopping to accomplish this afternoon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShopping is always quite important, Captain,\u201d Lady Phoebe replied in a very serious tone. \u201cBut Miss Goodfellow has been so kind as to consent to give me the secret to her jam tartlets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she.\u201d The soldier\u2019s tone was flat, with only a very small hint of disbelief.</p><p>Lady Phoebe smiled cheerily. \u201cShe has. Please be so kind as to wander a ways off so that we may consult on the matter. I\u2019m sure the place you chose to speak with Mr. Smith was far enough away that you might not be overheard. Perhaps you can wait there.\u201d</p><p>Captain Trevillion bowed woodenly. \u201cMy lady.\u201d</p> <p>He limped away and for a moment Lily felt almost sorry for the man. He was so very proud and it was obvious that Lady Phoebe used him a trifle hard sometimes.</p><p>But then the lady herself leaned close to her and whispered, \u201cIs he far enough away?\u201d</p><p>Lily glanced to the soldier\u2019s back, now a distance away. \u201cI think so, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo be sure,\u201d Lady Phoebe muttered. \u201cI swear the man has the hearing of a dog.\u201d She crinkled her nose. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound quite right. Anyway, the hearing of some animal that has very good hearing. Terribly annoying.\u201d</p><p>Lily felt her lips twitch. \u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow tell me quickly before he comes back and sticks his long nose in: what does Mr. Smith look like?\u201d</p><p>Lily blinked in surprise, her own voice lowering instinctively. \u201cHe\u2019s very big\u2014over six feet, with wide shoulders and large hands. He has brown eyes and brown hair worn long. He\u2019s not handsome.\u201d</p><p>Lady Phoebe frowned thoughtfully. \u201cDoes he have any mark about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, unless you consider an especially large nose a mark?\u201d Lily shrugged helplessly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of him? His family? His friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Lily whispered quite truthfully, dread filling her heart. \u201cNothing at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlast,\u201d said Lady Phoebe.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lily asked, afraid of the answer. \u201cWho do you think he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no one.\u201d Lady Phoebe waved an impatient hand. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the captain is so mysterious. I vow he does it simply to vex me. Is he still watching?\u201d</p><p>Lily glanced up to see that the captain was indeed staring at them. \u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is,\u201d Lady Phoebe muttered. \u201cWell, might as well wave him over. I thank you, Miss Goodfellow, for a most enjoyable morning. I hope I may call on you again someday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be honored,\u201d Lily replied as Captain Trevillion again joined them.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re quite ready, my lady,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right,\u201d Lady Phoebe replied, getting to her feet.</p> <p>Captain Trevillion moved adroitly to place his arm just where her hand would land when she rose. \u201cI, too, shall bid you farewell, Miss Goodfellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir. My lady,\u201d Lily murmured.</p><p>The captain tipped his hat and she watched as they left.</p><p>But the feeling of dread stayed with her. Who had Lady Phoebe thought Caliban was? For despite her disavowal, Lily couldn\u2019t help but think the other woman had had someone particular in mind when she\u2019d asked her questions.</p><p>Lily glanced down at the remains of their tea. The question was this: how dangerous was it for her to become involved with Caliban when she didn\u2019t know who he was?</p><p>DESPITE MAKEPEACE\u2019S IRE, MacLeish wasn\u2019t a bad sort, Apollo thought late that afternoon\u2014although he was very young to be designing and building independently. But he did seem to at least understand the concepts of architecture. The proof, Apollo supposed, would come when the architect showed them his designs for the theater and opera house and whatever else the duke wanted and was willing to pay to have built in the garden. Until then Apollo decided to give the lad the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>Now, though, he found his steps quickening as he walked to the theater. He wanted to see Lily again\u2014without inquisitive strangers or odd architects turning up and, if at all possible, even without her scamp of a son and her disapproving maidservant. He\u2019d forgotten, in those long years in Bedlam, through fear and grief and pain, what it was like to simply be with a pretty woman. To tease and flirt and yes, perhaps steal a kiss.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how she felt about that kiss\u2014or if she\u2019d let him kiss her again, but he was certainly going to try. He had lost time to make up\u2014much of life itself to live. He\u2019d spent four years in limbo, simply existing, while others found lovers and friends, even started families.</p><p>He wanted to live again.</p><p>But as he neared the theater he heard first the sound of voices raised\u2014and then a male voice shouting.</p><p>Apollo broke into a run.</p><p>He burst from the trees to find a slight man in a purple suit and a white wig standing intimidatingly close to Lily. She wore a shawl over her red dress as if she\u2019d been prepared for their stroll. The two stood in the clearing outside the theater.</p><p>\u201c\u2014told you I needed it,\u201d he was saying, his face thrust into hers. Apollo could see spittle flying from his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ll never sell it on your own, so don\u2019t even try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my work, Edwin,\u201d she replied to the lout, bravely enough, but there was a waver in her voice that made Apollo see red.</p><p>\u201cWho are... you?\u201d he demanded, advancing on the two of them, hands clenching and unclenching.</p><p>The man swung around and blinked at the sight of Apollo as if he hadn\u2019t heard him draw near.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019m I? Who... who... are you, you great ox?\u201d he asked, mocking Apollo\u2019s halting speech.</p><p>He didn\u2019t much mind that\u2014he\u2019d had far worse than verbal jeers in Bedlam\u2014but he didn\u2019t like the way Lily\u2019s face had grown pale at the sight of him. \u201cCaliban, please.\u201d She gripped her hands together as if to keep from wringing them. \u201cCan you come back in a bit? Perhaps half an hour or so?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was too low, too controlled, as if she was afraid of setting the man off. As if she\u2019d set him off before and hadn\u2019t liked the consequences.</p><p>\u201cYou know this... oaf?\u201d The man spat the word at her, then threw back his head in cruel laughter. \u201cI vow, Lil, your taste in bedmates has come down. \u2019Fore long you\u2019ll be lifting your skirts for common porters, if this is the sort\u2014\u201d</p><p>The end of his vicious rant ended in a satisfying squawk as Apollo backhanded him. The other man staggered and fell on his arse.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t hurt him!\u201d Lily cried, and Apollo hated to think she cared for this man.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he assured her in a level tone. He stared at the sputtering rogue for a moment and made up his mind. \u201cBut neither will I... stand by while he... abuses you.\u201d So saying, he picked up the man and tossed him over his shoulder. \u201cWait here.\u201d</p><p>The man made a sort of moan and Apollo hoped he wouldn\u2019t toss his accounts down his back. He\u2019d bathed and changed into a fairly clean shirt before coming to see Lily.</p><p>Pivoting, he marched toward the dock, the man still over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCaliban!\u201d</p><p>He ignored her calls. He didn\u2019t really care who this ass was\u2014as long as he was nowhere near Lily or Indio.</p><p>\u201cPut\u2014\u201d The knave had to gasp for breath as Apollo leaped a fallen log, jostling the man\u2019s stomach against his shoulder. When he could draw breath again he swore foully. \u201cDo you have any idea who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have your head.\u201d The other man gulped and tried to kick.</p><p>So Apollo let the man roll off his shoulder and onto the ground. They were far enough away from the theater anyway by this point.</p><p>The villain stared up at him, pale with rage, his wig fallen to the side. His own hair was nearly black and cropped short. \u201cI know people\u2014people who can and will cut off your blasted cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no... doubt.\u201d Threats were two a penny. Apollo straddled the prone dandy and leaned down into his face, intimidating him as he\u2019d dared to do to Lily. \u201cDon\u2019t come... back until... you can talk... to her with a civil tongue.\u201d</p><p>He nimbly avoided the kick aimed at his groin and left the knave there on the ground. Lily, after all, hadn\u2019t sounded too pleased when he\u2019d left.</p><p>Nor was she looking very happy when he got back. She was still in the clearing, pacing.</p><p>She whirled on him as soon as he appeared. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, watching her. \u201cDumped him... on the ground... like the rubbish... he is.\u201d His throat ached, but he ignored it.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She seemed to deflate a bit at that, only to puff back up a second later. \u201cWell, you shouldn\u2019t have interfered. It wasn\u2019t any of your business.\u201d</p><p>This was not how he\u2019d hoped to spend the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps... I wanted it to... be my business.\u201d He approached her cautiously as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...\u201d She waved one hand, obviously frustrated. \u201cYou just can\u2019t. He\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>Apollo cocked his head. \u201cIndio\u2019s father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She turned and stared. \u201cNo! Whatever made you think that? Edwin\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The knot that had been pulled tight in his chest ever since she\u2019d started defending the dandy loosened. Family was another matter. One couldn\u2019t choose family. \u201cThen he... should speak... to his sister more carefully.\u201d</p><p>She screwed up her face rather adorably. \u201cHe\u2019s not himself. He lost quite a bit of money and he\u2019s anxious about it.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand and tugged gently as he turned down a path into the garden\u2014away from where he\u2019d left Edwin. \u201cI see. And this is... your fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d She frowned, but let herself be led, so he counted that as a contest won. \u201cIt\u2019s just that he makes money from my plays.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re published under his name, you see,\u201d she said, peering down at her steps. She didn\u2019t seem to notice that he still had hold of her hand, and he felt no need to bring it to her attention. Her slender fingers were cool in his. \u201cHe\u2019s... well, he\u2019s better able to sell the plays than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She kicked a stone in the path. \u201cHe has better acquaintances. Better friends.\u201d She blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cHe just is better at it, is all.\u201d</p><p>He was silent, but felt confused. How did \u201cbetter friends\u201d make it easier to publish a play?</p><p>\u201cMy father was a porter,\u201d she finally muttered, sounding faintly ashamed. \u201cA common porter. Apparently he often fetched things for the actors in the theater where my mother was appearing. Costumes and props and a cooked hen for dinner and whatever else needed moving or fetching from one place to another. Oh, you know what a porter is.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand gently instead of replying.</p><p>She broke off a twig from a tree as they passed. \u201cEdwin\u2019s father was a lord\u2014well, a lord\u2019s son, which, compared to a porter, is much the same thing. Mama said my father couldn\u2019t even read his own name. But he was handsome, so there\u2019s that, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...\u201d His damnable throat tried to close, but he forced the words out. \u201cYou did not... know... your father?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, glancing at him apologetically. \u201cMama had a great many lovers, I\u2019m afraid, and none ever stayed long.\u201d She inhaled and shook herself. \u201cAnyway, Edwin\u2019s been very helpful, taking my plays and finding where to sell them. He keeps some of the money and gives all the rest to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou write... the plays\u2014very good plays, I\u2019ll... warrant\u2014and he trots off... and sells them. How... much does he... pocket for such... hard work?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened and attempted to pull her fingers from his.</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her.</p><p>She glared, her lichen-green eyes sparking. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s any of your business.\u201d</p> <p>He stopped and faced her. They were nearly at the pond, at the site where his oak had toppled. He\u2019d found the lead branch broken from the fall and ordered a new tree, but it had not yet arrived. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>She held his gaze defiantly for a moment more and he couldn\u2019t help but admire the way the late-afternoon sun\u2019s rays made a nimbus around her face of the fine hairs escaping her coiffure.</p><p>Her eyes dropped. \u201cTwenty-five percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five percent.\u201d His voice was flat, but inside he was horrified. \u201cDoes he know... you don\u2019t have... acting work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he knows, that was partly what we argued about.\u201d She\u2019d raised their joined hands to her chest level and was examining his fingers, probably appalled at the ingrained dirt. \u201cI told him that I wanted him to take only twenty percent. But Edwin isn\u2019t always very practical when it comes to money, you see.\u201d</p> <p>Apollo would bet his right hand that Edwin could be entirely practical when it came to his own money. \u201cHow do you... even know he\u2019s... giving you the proper... amount?\u201d</p><p>She looked up, startled, from his hand. \u201cEdwin wouldn\u2019t lie to me. You must understand.\u201d Now she was holding his hand between her own two. \u201cHe... well, Mama drank gin, you see, and by the time I was born she was no longer very much in demand, either in the theater or with men, and it was hard for her.\u201d She ducked her head, studying his fingers, spreading them against her own, comparing their lengths. His hand dwarfed hers. \u201cVery hard. And later there was Maude, but when I was very small, all I had was Mama and Edwin. He made sure I had a place to sleep\u2014for often we moved, from theater to theater or even from one rental room to another. He made sure I had food and clothes and taught me to read and write.\u201d She curled her fingers into the spaces between his, tightening them as if she wouldn\u2019t ever let go. \u201cI owe him... everything, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you... do,\u201d he said softly, for he knew what it was to be beholden to someone who is unable to fully reciprocate one\u2019s devotion. \u201cBut do you... owe him Indio\u2019s life... as well?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, her brows knit. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndio needs... food and clothes and... a place to sleep, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cNaturally... he does,\u201d Apollo said. \u201cAnd how... is he to have... all those things and... more if you let... your brother leech... from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt him. I know Edwin is fickle and cruel at times, but he\u2019s my brother. I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you not?\u201d he replied, and brought their twined hands to his lips, kissing each of her fingertips one by one.</p><p>When he raised his head she was watching him in wonder. \u201cI don\u2019t know you at all. First I thought you a simpleton. Then you couldn\u2019t speak. And now you can, but you won\u2019t.\u201d She stood on tiptoe and brushed her lips along his jaw, her touch soft and searching, more intimate than any kiss on the lips. \u201cI don\u2019t know you, but I want to. Can you let me in a little?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. This was playing with fire. \u201cWhat do you wish to know?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>The youth\u2019s name was Theseus. He and Ariadne were escorted to the labyrinth and pushed inside. Then Theseus turned to Ariadne. He was tall and fair but when he saw that she had brought the spindle into the labyrinth, he laughed in scorn. \u201cYou\u2019ll have no use of that here. Better you follow behind me and let me kill the beast.\u201d So saying, he took out a short sword he\u2019d concealed in his robes and, turning right, disappeared into the labyrinth...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p> <p>What did she wish to know? That was easy: Lily wanted to know who Caliban truly was\u2014a name, an identity, something to place him in the world in relation to her.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t answer that, she knew, so she started with a simpler inquiry.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to know about family.\u201d The sun was beginning to set and even with the smell of burnt wood, the garden was a magical place. Birds had begun their evening song around them in the golden rays. \u201cDo you have family?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI have... a sister.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him, into his muddy-brown eyes surrounded by such beautiful, lush lashes. She was relieved that he\u2019d answered that much\u2014hadn\u2019t rejected her question out of hand. \u201cOlder or younger?\u201d</p><p>A corner of his wide mouth cocked up. \u201cThe exact same... age as I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA twin!\u201d She grinned in delight. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head gently.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t so easily disappointed now that he\u2019d let her in a little. \u201cVery well. Do you like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much.\u201d He paused as if searching for words. \u201cShe is... the dearest thing... to me... in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said softly. \u201cOh, how sweet.\u201d</p><p>He quirked an eyebrow at her. \u201cYou make me... sound a little boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cI think one\u2019s family, the people one keeps close to oneself, are very important. I don\u2019t think I could like a man who didn\u2019t value others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd... do you like me?\u201d</p><p>She wagged her finger at him. \u201cI\u2019m not so easily lured as all that. Now. Were you born in London?\u201d She turned, swinging their hands as she meandered down one of the paths.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She pouted. \u201cIn a city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in exasperation. \u201cIn England?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am... an Englishman,\u201d he said, and then relented. \u201cI was... born in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorth or south?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the coast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He slid an amused glance her way. \u201cThere were... farmlands. And a pond... quite nearby. My... sister and I learned to... swim in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you had a mother and a father.\u201d She looked down at the charred path because most people did have both a mother and a father growing up\u2014just not she, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered gently, \u201cthough... they\u2019re both dead now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWere you close?\u201d she asked too fast, her words running together. \u201cDid you have a happy childhood with a father who worked and brought home money and a mother who mended your socks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot... precisely,\u201d he replied. \u201cMy childhood was happy... enough, but my mother... was often sickly and... my father...\u201d He took a deep breath and let it out in a gusty sigh. \u201cMy father was... mad.\u201d</p><p>She stopped short\u2014or tried to.</p><p>He tugged her hand to keep her strolling beside him. \u201cIt\u2019s not... as terrible as it... sounds. He wasn\u2019t violent... or awful to my sister... and me, or... even our mother. He was excitable. Sometimes... he would stay awake... for days on end, frantically planning... various schemes\u2014though they all came... to naught. He\u2019d hie away... from the house for a week... or more and we... were never sure where... he went. Just that when... he came home his pockets... would be empty and he\u2019d... be exhausted. Then he would sleep... for a full day and perhaps spend... a fortnight abed... taking his meals there. And... then he\u2019d... arise one day and... be off again.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI thought... when I was very small... that all boys had fathers like... mine.\u201d</p><p>She was silent then, because there didn\u2019t seem much to say. They walked in companionable silence as the sun began to paint the sky in shades of scarlet and bright yellow and orange.</p><p>\u201cIs she alive still, your sister?\u201d she at last asked, almost lazily.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you see her?\u201d She darted a sideways glance, but he merely shook his head and smiled.</p><p>Damn. \u201cDo you have other family, then? Aunts and uncles and, oh, cousins, I suppose? Is it a big family you\u2019re from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot big... but I have some... relations,\u201d he replied. \u201cThough... I know none of them well. My... father\u2019s madness drove... him apart from his own... father and the rest of the... family followed... suit, I suppose.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI really... don\u2019t know. I certainly... never saw them as a child.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd now that you\u2019re a man? Have you tried to talk to them?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand and then relaxed, so swiftly she couldn\u2019t tell if the motion was in reaction to her question or not. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She heaved a great sigh and tried another tack. \u201cHow did you come to know Mr. Harte?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. \u201cI met May\u2014Harte... in a tavern... when we were both barely... of age.\u201d</p><p>She did stop then, and made him turn to face her. \u201cWhat was that word you almost said? May? Is that his first name?\u201d</p><p>He actually looked guilty at that. \u201cHe\u2019ll... kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a... great secret,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>She thought he wouldn\u2019t answer her. But he pulled her close and folded her hands on her breast, over her heart. \u201cDo you promise... never, ever to tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He bent, putting his mouth to her ear, so close she could feel the brush of his lips. \u201cHarte... isn\u2019t his name. It\u2019s... Asa Makepeace.\u201d</p><p>She jerked back, mouth agape in shock. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, looking amused. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut whyever did he change his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the same... reason, I expect, that you\u201d\u2014he tapped a finger on her nose\u2014\u201cchanged yours.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her forehead. \u201cBecause Stump sounded like a dead tree and he needed a witty name for the stage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps not... entirely the same reason,\u201d he allowed. \u201cI understand his family... doesn\u2019t approve of the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, that makes sense,\u201d she said, because it did. \u201cFamilies are very odd things, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they indeed,\u201d he breathed, and then he kissed her.</p><p>His mouth moved on hers with exquisite slowness, teasing her lips apart, sliding his tongue along the inside of her bottom lip. He caught her chin in the V between his thumb and fingers, holding her steady for his pleasure.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d he breathed as he nipped at her mouth. \u201cLily.\u201d</p><p>And her name, spoken in his broken voice\u2014so sure, so tender, nonetheless\u2014had never sounded so beautiful before.</p><p>She stood on tiptoe and twined her arms about his broad shoulders, trying to get closer, and felt a moment\u2019s frustration that she couldn\u2019t. A whimper escaped her and then he bent and simply grasped her around the waist. He lifted her easily, as if she were no more than Indio\u2019s little wooden boat, and set her high against his chest so that she might tilt her head down to continue their kiss. Such casual strength should\u2019ve frightened her. Should\u2019ve made her pause and think. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But all it did was arouse her further.</p><p>Her bodice was crushed against his great chest, the slopes of her upper breasts pressed with each inhalation against the coarse cloth of his waistcoat, and she wanted... wanted something.</p><p>It\u2019d been such a very long time since she\u2019d been with a man. The emotions, the heat between them, made her breathless, and it was her own lack of control that finally sobered her.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she gasped, breaking away, pressing one palm to his chest. \u201cI...\u201d</p> <p>He licked lazily at the corner of her mouth, not demanding, but seducing, which was, in this case, far more dangerous. She moaned a little and then got herself under control and pulled back.</p><p>\u201cPut me down,\u201d she said in her most haughty voice. Had she not been so very breathless, it would\u2019ve come off rather well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he drawled. There was a slash of color high on each of his craggy cheekbones and his eyes were lidded with sensuality.</p><p>Was she? \u201cQuite,\u201d she said, much more firmly than she actually felt.</p><p>He sighed heavily and let her slide\u2014slowly\u2014down his chest.</p> <p>\u201cErm... thank you,\u201d she said, trying and probably failing to regain some of her dignity. She brushed down her skirts, looking anywhere but at him. \u201cWe should return to the theater. I sent Maude and Indio out for meat pies for our supper and they should be back soon. You\u2019re invited, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honored... to accept,\u201d he said as formally as if she were the Queen.</p><p>She nodded and began to set off before she realized that they were in a part of the garden she\u2019d never seen before. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heart,\u201d he said, his voice low and rasping. \u201cThe very... heart of my future garden... the center of the maze.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at his words. This place didn\u2019t look any different from anywhere else in the garden, but garden hearts, she supposed, like human hearts, could be disguised.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He took a step toward her and turned her to face the same way as he, her back against his chest. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, wrapping his arms over her shoulders to hold her hands. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a folly... of some sort right here... beneath our feet. A fountain or... waterfall or statue. Benches for lovers to sit and... kiss. The entrance will be over here\u201d\u2014he pointed to a space to the right\u2014\u201cand the maze... will wind all around us... like an embrace.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he turned with her, tracing with his outstretched hand his imaginary maze.</p><p>\u201cYou have so much faith,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She felt him shrug behind her. \u201cIt\u2019s there already... just waiting for the right person... to find it and bring it alive,\u201d he said softly in her ear. \u201cA maze... is eternal, you know, once discovered.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at that and pulled away, turning to give him a bright smile. \u201cIndio will be waiting impatiently for his supper.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but didn\u2019t return her smile. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can see so much in what is only destruction and debris now,\u201d she commented as they turned back toward the theater. She was very careful to keep from brushing against him as they walked, for she was afraid that if they touched a spark might be lit. She felt as if a fine tension ran along her skin, making her nervously aware of his every movement.</p><p>He shrugged beside her. \u201cI see it in my mind\u2019s eye, complete... and wonderful. It\u2019s only a matter of... planting and moving... to reveal what\u2019s already there.\u201d He glanced at her fondly. \u201cReally, \u2019tisn\u2019t such a mysterious thing.\u201d</p> <p>She had a certain suspicion that he was talking about something else as well.</p><p>He coughed rather harshly, and she looked at him quickly. \u201cHow is your throat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSore,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut... that is to be expected... after so long unused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very glad you can speak again.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her finally and then they were at the theater.</p><p>Daffodil scampered to greet them, closely followed by Indio with the news that he and Maude had brought back two large pies and they must wash at once to have them while they were still hot.</p><p>Thus instructed, Lily and Caliban washed by the old water barrel.</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d Indio said as they sat, \u201cthe wherryman had only two teeth and he could spit ever so far.\u201d</p><p>And he proceeded to tell them all about the wherryman\u2019s unusual and rather disgusting skill.</p><p>Caliban expressed suitable interest in this dining conversation and Lily was content to watch the play between the two males. Even Maude unbent enough to give her opinion on long-distance spitting and the number of teeth one usually found in the average wherryman.</p><p>Lily almost forgot her nervous tension until after supper, when Maude was clearing the dishes with Indio\u2019s help.</p><p>Caliban drew Lily out the theater door, quietly closing it behind them.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d he said, pointing to the North Star. \u201cIn another year... or two, you\u2019ll no longer... be able to glimpse... the stars from the garden. The lights... and fireworks will obscure them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I should treasure the wildness now?\u201d she asked whimsically.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said, drawing her close. \u201cOr... just be glad that you... have this time, hard though... it seems at the moment. After all, most of London has not this... grand view... of the night sky. Only we two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if we have a world of our own.\u201d</p><p>He smiled right before he kissed her, and she knew somehow he felt the same. They were a universe apart, Adam and Eve, in a garden that wasn\u2019t quite Eden.</p><p>And then she thought no more for many long minutes as he leisurely kissed her, mouth opened wide over hers as if he would consume her, meld with her and make them one being under the starlit night sky.</p><p>When at last he drew back she felt a little dazed, almost off-balance, as if the world had tilted a bit on its axis.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said, walking backward into the dark. \u201cShall I... show you the secret island... in the pond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you must,\u201d she said, the tremble in her voice betraying her discomposure.</p><p>The last thing she heard before he disappeared into the garden was the sound of his laughter.</p><p>IT WASN\u2019T EVEN dawn when Apollo woke the next morning, but he knew it was already too late.</p><p>He could hear people in the garden.</p><p>\u201cIn th\u2019 gallery, \u2019e said,\u201d a male voice called.</p><p>A disturbed bird shrilled as it flew away.</p><p>Another man swore softly.</p><p>They were close\u2014very close.</p><p>Apollo rolled from his pallet, glad that he\u2019d slept in his clothes, and grabbed his shoes and his pruning knife. There was no door to the alcove in the musician\u2019s gallery where he slept, only the tarp he\u2019d hung over the corner. He slipped, barefoot, to the side, down the gallery.</p><p>Just as men appeared in the pink-gray light of morning in his garden. They were closing in on him.</p><p>Soldiers. They were soldiers. Red-coated, with bayonets fixed on their guns.</p><p>The breath caught in his throat. His right heel skidded on grit-strewn marble, and he beat back a sudden, cowardly wave of panic.</p><p>He whirled to his right only to find a soldier within arm\u2019s distance, just a young boy beneath his tall cap, blue, blue eyes wide and frightened.</p><p>The soldier brought up his bayonet and Apollo swung his pruning knife in a vicious feint.</p><p>The boy soldier screamed, flailing as he scrambled away from the knife, his breath pluming white in the cold morning air.</p><p>\u201cOi!\u201d someone shouted.</p><p>\u201cWatch it!\u201d cried another. \u201c \u2019E\u2019s a murderer thrice over!\u201d</p><p>No. No. No.</p><p>Not again. Never again. He\u2019d slit his own throat before returning to Bedlam.</p><p>Apollo ran.</p><p>Through the beautiful morning light, through the blackened garden he\u2019d hoped to redeem, with demons on his heels.</p><p>Not all were corporal.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Ariadne stared thoughtfully after Theseus and then, unwinding the red thread from the queen\u2019s spindle as she walked, turned left into the labyrinth.</p><p>It was a cold, silent place. The walls of the labyrinth were of ancient, worn stone, for \u2019twas said that it had stood since before men had discovered the island. No birds sang, nor wind blew there, as if all had been put to sleep under a spell...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>A pounding at the theater door startled Lily awake that morning. She sat up in bed, groggily looking around as Daff barked hysterically.</p><p>Shaking her head, she found her wrap and stumbled out of the bedroom, calling, \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>She expected perhaps Edwin\u2019s voice\u2014although normally he never arose before noon\u2014but it was another voice entirely that shouted back.</p><p>\u201cOpen in the name of the King!\u201d</p><p>That made her halt abruptly, her eyes widening as she stared at her door.</p><p>The pounding came again, provoking Daffodil into a frenzy of yapping.</p><p>Lily threw a glance at Maude, who had risen as well and stood with her hand on Indio\u2019s shoulder. Indio looked excited and a little frightened.</p><p>\u201cCatch her and hold her,\u201d Lily told Maude. \u201cThe last thing we need is Daffodil attacking soldiers.\u201d</p><p>She went to the door and opened it, putting on her most charming smile. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>The man without was an officer. He wore a red-coated uniform with smart white facing, breeches, and waistcoat, but his face was unshaven and lined. His eyes widened at the sight of her.</p><p>\u201c \u2019As a man taken refuge \u2019ere? A big man?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Dear God, they were after Caliban. Lily prayed that Indio wouldn\u2019t volunteer information.</p><p>\u201cWhy no,\u201d she answered, puzzled, but sweet. \u201cWe were asleep until you came a-knocking, Major.\u201d</p><p>The man actually flushed. \u201cIt\u2019s Sergeant, ma\u2019am. Sergeant Green. We\u2019re searching for this man and we\u2019ll \u2019ave a look around your... uh...\u2019ouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a theater, Sergeant Green,\u201d she said, pulling the door wide, \u201cand naturally the King\u2019s men have my permission to look to their heart\u2019s content.\u201d</p><p>He nodded curtly and three uniformed soldiers tromped in, tracking mud onto Maude\u2019s clean floor.</p><p>The maidservant\u2019s mouth\u2019s tightened, but she made no comment.</p><p>\u201cMay I offer you some tea, Sergeant?\u201d Lily asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right kind of you, ma\u2019am, but I\u2019m afeard we \u2019aven\u2019t the time,\u201d Sergeant Green replied. His men were already in her bedroom doing Lord knew what with her bed linen. \u201cIs there anyone else in the, er, theater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust myself and my maid and son.\u201d She gestured to Maude and Indio. Daffodil took the opportunity to growl at the sergeant and attempt to wriggle free from Maude\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d The sergeant had narrowed his eyes at the little greyhound. \u201cAnd you are...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Miss Robin Goodfellow,\u201d she said with what she knew was becoming modesty.</p><p>One of the soldiers tripped.</p><p>The sergeant looked impressed. \u201cThe actress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of me, Sergeant?\u201d she asked, all wide-eyed amazement, her hand pressed modestly to her chest. \u201cHow flattering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw you in that play\u2014the one in which you wore\u201d\u2014the sergeant blushed a deep russet and lowered his voice\u2014\u201cbreeches. Awful grand, you were, ma\u2019am. Awful grand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d she said, feigning flustered confusion. \u201cCan you tell me whom your men are looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wanted man,\u201d Sergeant Green said darkly. \u201cRight dangerous character. Are there more rooms in the theater, ma\u2019am?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she said. \u201cSome parts of the backstage are still standing, but they\u2019ve been boarded up because it\u2019s unsafe.\u201d</p><p>Naturally the sergeant ordered the door leading to the area unbarred. Two of the men went through and there was a silence as the third poked through Maude\u2019s chest. Why, Lily wasn\u2019t sure, since the chest was far too small for anyone of normal size to hide in, let alone Caliban.</p><p>Lily tried to remain calm as she fretted. Were there more soldiers searching the garden even as these messed about in the theater\u2014or were there only these four men? Could she somehow send word to warn him?</p><p>But he must\u2019ve heard the noise the soldiers were making by now, surely?</p> <p>After a few minutes there was a crash and a good deal of cursing from the soldiers who had gone into the unsafe area of the theater. They returned, quite sooty, looking sheepish, and with one of them limping.</p><p>Lily smiled, trying to appear at ease and not as if she wanted to rid herself of the soldiers. \u201cIf that\u2019s all, Sergeant, I must be getting my son\u2019s breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for your time, Miss Goodfellow,\u201d he replied, \u201cand if you should see a big fellow sneaking about the garden, you must notify the authorities at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you can be assured I will,\u201d she said, putting a tremor of fright into her voice. \u201cBut can you tell me what he\u2019s wanted for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, murder, ma\u2019am,\u201d Sergeant Green replied with grim relish. \u201cThe Viscount Kilbourne escaped nine months ago from Bedlam, where he was committed for savagely and insanely murdering three of his friends for no reason at all.\u201d</p> <p>Lily stared at him, shocked into silence. She couldn\u2019t seem to even make her brain work.</p><p>Sergeant Green seemed satisfied with her reaction. \u201cBe careful, Miss Goodfellow, you and your boy and your maid. Kilbourne is no more than a beast. He\u2019d as soon kill you as look at you.\u201d</p><p>With that he bowed and with his men tramped out of the theater.</p><p>In the sudden silence Lily turned mutely to stare at Maude. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBUT \u2019TIS ONLY nine of the clock,\u201d the sleepy blond wench mumbled as Asa Makepeace bundled her out his door. A blue ribbon trailed forlornly from her half-done hair. \u201cThought we could at least \u2019ave a bit of a cuddle this morn afore I \u2019ad to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we will, love\u2014next time,\u201d Makepeace said, and then bent to whisper something no doubt salacious in her ear.</p> <p>Apollo made sure to turn his back, staring at a box of marzipan sweets carelessly left open on a pile of papers. They were shaped into oranges and lemons. He wanted not only to keep from hearing whatever it was Makepeace was whispering to his paramour, but also to prevent her from seeing his face.</p><p>It\u2019d taken him hours to get to Makepeace\u2019s door. He\u2019d had to first escape the soldiers and then make sure he wasn\u2019t followed. After that he\u2019d spent some time outside Makepeace\u2019s building, watching and waiting to see if the soldiers would come there next. They hadn\u2019t turned up, which could mean either that they simply hadn\u2019t arrived yet or that they didn\u2019t know his connection to Makepeace.</p><p>In either case, he couldn\u2019t stay here long.</p><p>The door closed behind the girl and Makepeace turned to him, looking unusually serious. \u201cDamn it, when the hell did you regain your voice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a few days ago,\u201d Apollo said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cNo one ever tells me anything,\u201d Makepeace muttered, crossing to the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cMy voice... isn\u2019t why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least a dozen... soldiers in the garden.\u201d Apollo paced as well as he could in the overcrowded room. \u201cThey knew who I was... and they knew where I slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone betrayed you.\u201d Makepeace stoked the fire and filled his kettle with water before hanging it from a hook he swung over the blaze. \u201cWell, you can stay here until\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it... I can\u2019t.\u201d Apollo noted absently that a mechanical hen had joined Makepeace\u2019s collection. It had a key in its side to wind it. No doubt it would lay eggs or even little chicks when wound. God only knew where Makepeace had found it. \u201cIf they know... so much about me it\u2019s only... a matter of time before they discover... my friendship with you and come here. I must flee the city.\u201d</p><p>And leave Lily behind. He stared blindly at the mechanical hen\u2019s glass eye. Would he ever see her again? Her inquisitive lichen-green eyes, her lush pink mouth? Damn it, would she even want to see him when she found out why the soldiers were after him? He ran his hands through his hair in frustrated despair.</p><p>\u201cBut the garden.\u201d Makepeace sat heavily on a chair, unmindful of the books that slid to the floor as a result. \u201cDamn it, \u2019Pollo, no one can design that garden the way you can. It\u2019s you that has the vision. It\u2019ll just be another boring line of box hedges in geometric patterns without you.\u201d</p><p>Apollo winced. \u201cI can make you notes to... give to whomever you... hire to take over.\u201d He slumped as well\u2014on the only other available surface, which was the bed. The garden had been his delight. A place to make beautiful in his own design after four years of stagnation in Bedlam. This, too, he would have to abandon. And then another realization hit him. \u201cI left my notebook. I only... had time to... take my shoes... and my knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it!\u201d</p><p>Apollo shrugged. \u201cI have most of it... memorized anyway.\u201d He sighed, letting his head drop back. He could recreate the plans, but that notebook held all the conversations and musings he\u2019d had since he\u2019d been freed. He felt its loss like a tangible wound.</p><p>He closed his eyes in near-despair at another thought. \u201cLily\u2019s in the garden. D\u2019you think they\u2019ll... harass her? The soldiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily, is it?\u201d The other man perked up like the idiot he was.</p><p>\u201cMakepeace,\u201d Apollo growled.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Makepeace sighed. \u201cThey have no reason to think that she even knows you\u2014do they?\u201d</p><p>Apollo shrugged, feeling weary. \u201cHer brother... was there yesterday. He was... quite foul to her and I... tossed him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Tossed,\u2019 \u201d Makepeace repeated carefully.</p><p>\u201cNot literally,\u201d Apollo snapped, then had to concede, remembering Edwin landing on his rump in the dirt. \u201cWell, in a way. But I didn\u2019t hurt him... though he did make... several threats to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd seems to\u2019ve carried them out,\u201d Makepeace replied drily. He jumped up as the kettle began to steam. \u201cNo one else knew you were in the garden, did they?\u201d</p><p>Apollo ticked them off on his fingers. \u201cMy sister... and thus His Grace the Ass... you, Montgomery, and James Trevillion.\u201d</p><p>Makepeace paused with the kettle in one hand and then swore and had to set it down when the hot handle apparently burned his fingers. \u201cWho\u2019s this Trevillion?\u201d</p><p>Apollo looked at him. \u201cThe man who... arrested me the morning of the... murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think to mention him until now?\u201d Makepeace\u2019s eyes widened in outrage. \u201cGood God, man, that\u2019s your betrayer right there.\u201d</p><p>Apollo was already shaking his head. \u201cNo... he\u2019d realized he made a... mistake in arresting me. He vowed to help... discover the real murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he told you.\u201d Makepeace furiously shook tea into a teapot from a tin without bothering to measure it. \u201cHow can you be such a fool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fool,\u201d Apollo growled.</p><p>\u201cHe was merely placating you until he could inform the King\u2019s men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him just yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes my point!\u201d Makepeace filled the teapot and banged down the kettle on the hob. A few drops of water splashed out and hit the hearth, sizzling as they evaporated. \u201cHe betrayed you, \u2019Pollo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was a knock on the door and they both fell silent. Apollo exchanged glances with Makepeace, and then took his hooked pruning knife from the belt at his waist.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going back.</p><p>He slid behind the door as Makepeace opened it.</p><p>\u201cMr. Harte?\u201d said a familiar voice, and Apollo peered around the door. Trevillion stood in the outer hall, alone and leaning on his cane.</p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d Apollo muttered, gesturing him in.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d Makepeace hissed as Trevillion limped in. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevillion, the man... I was telling you about.\u201d</p><p>Makepeace looked outraged. \u201cThis man betrayed you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Trevillion replied with stiff dignity.</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Makepeace thrust out his face, a sarcastic smile twisting his lips. \u201cThen why, pray tell, are you here, only hours after \u2019Pollo had to flee for his life from Harte\u2019s Folly? How do you even know where I live when I\u2019d never heard your name before this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tisn\u2019t my fault you\u2019re not well informed,\u201d Trevillion replied, his upper lip curling.</p><p>Apollo nearly banged his head against the wall. Naturally Trevillion would rather antagonize than explain. But with Trevillion\u2019s next breath he was proven wrong.</p><p>\u201cAs for your first question,\u201d Trevillion continued, \u201cI\u2019m here because a man who was under my command four years ago, when I arrested Lord Kilbourne, came to me. He informed me that he\u2019d heard there\u2019d been a raid on Harte\u2019s Folly this morning, but that Lord Kilbourne had escaped. I arrived at your door, hoping you would know of Lord Kilbourne\u2019s whereabouts, and,\u201d he said, casting a significant glance Apollo\u2019s way, \u201cas it turned out, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could arrest him anew!\u201d Makepeace shouted.</p><p>\u201cHad I wanted him arrested, he\u2019d be languishing behind bars now,\u201d Trevillion replied, hard.</p><p>Apollo stiffened at how easily Trevillion talked about putting him behind bars.</p><p>The door to Makepeace\u2019s rooms opened and the Duke of Montgomery strolled in as casually as if he were entering an afternoon musicale.</p><p>\u201cI say,\u201d the duke drawled, \u201cam I interrupting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you\u2019re barging in uninvited to my rooms,\u201d Makepeace snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so tedious,\u201d Montgomery sighed, \u201cto have to wait for invitations and, I find, they often don\u2019t come when you most want them to. Much easier to simply disregard formal invitations altogether. Good Lord, man,\u201d he continued in the same bored tone, \u201chaven\u2019t you anywhere for guests to sit in this pigsty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvited guests are welcome to sit on the bed.\u201d Makepeace pointed. \u201cUninvited guests are welcome to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you... doing here, Your Grace?\u201d Apollo asked hastily before Makepeace could finish his sentence\u2014perhaps disastrously.</p><p>Montgomery slowly pivoted to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve regained the use of your voice, Lord Kilbourne.\u201d</p><p>Apollo impatiently inclined his head.</p><p>\u201cHow very fascinating,\u201d Montgomery said as if Apollo were an exotic animal he\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve not answered... my question.\u201d</p><p>Montgomery spread his elegant hands wide. \u201cI heard you were in trouble and naturally I came to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to... help me,\u201d Apollo said, flat.</p><p>\u201cYou are, after all, the gardener with the grand scheme for my pleasure garden.\u201d Montgomery cocked his head whimsically.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure garden,\u201d Makepeace interjected.</p><p>Montgomery cast him an amused glance, but addressed Apollo. \u201cHelping you, I admit, helps me as well, but I see no problem with that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Apollo muttered.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know about Lord Kilbourne\u2019s difficulties, may I inquire, Your Grace?\u201d Trevillion asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Montgomery murmured, bending to peer at the mechanical hen, \u201cone hears these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually only if one has paid informants,\u201d Trevillion said, very dry.</p> <p>\u201cThey do help.\u201d Montgomery straightened and smiled sweetly. \u201cNow, if we\u2019re done with the pleasantries, I suggest we discuss how we\u2019re going to prove Lord Kilbourne\u2019s innocence so he can get back to work on Harte\u2019s Folly. I really must insist my garden be open for business by next spring, and this... hiccup... threatens to put the whole thing back months.\u201d He made a moue of discontent. \u201cI really shan\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy garden,\u201d Makepeace muttered, but his heart was obviously no longer in it. He fetched the steaming teapot. \u201cRight. Trevillion sit there\u201d\u2014he indicated his vacated chair\u2014\u201cyou\u201d\u2014he pointed at the duke\u2014\u201ccan sit on the bed or not at all. Now, who\u2019s for tea?\u201d</p><p>And a few minutes later they all had steaming\u2014if mismatched\u2014cups of tea in what had to be the oddest tea party Apollo had ever attended.</p><p>\u201cNow then.\u201d Makepeace slurped noisily at his teacup merely, Apollo suspected, to annoy the duke. He\u2019d dumped half the contents of a rather fine gilded sugar bowl into his tea and it must have been like drinking treacle. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it. What\u2019s your grand plan?\u201d</p><p>Montgomery sniffed cautiously at his tea and took a very small, very delicate sip. Immediately his eyebrows shot up and he hastily set the teacup down on a pile of books. \u201cObviously we must find and expose the real murderer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Makepeace drawled back.</p><p>The duke ignored that. \u201cAm I to assume from Captain Trevillion\u2019s presence that you\u2019ve already made some inquiries?\u201d</p><p>Apollo exchanged a glance with Trevillion and Apollo nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace, I have done some investigation into the matter.\u201d The captain cleared his throat. \u201cIt seems Lord Kilbourne\u2019s uncle, William Greaves, is in some debt to his grandfather\u2019s, the earl\u2019s, estate.\u201d</p><p>Montgomery, who had been poking at his teacup, looked up at that. \u201cSplendid! We have a viable candidate for a substitute murderer. Now to simply alert the authorities with a well-placed hint\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hint about what, exactly?\u201d Makepeace exploded. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a scrap of real evidence that \u2019Pollo\u2019s uncle did anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, evidence is easily manufactured, I find,\u201d the duke said carelessly as he dropped a marzipan orange into his tea. He watched it sink with interest.</p><p>There was a short, appalled silence.</p><p>The duke seemed to realize something was amiss. He glanced up, his blue eyes wide and innocent. \u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>Fortunately it was Trevillion who replied. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t simply manufacture evidence, Your Grace,\u201d he said calmly but firmly. \u201cWe must discover the evidence naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow tedious!\u201d The duke actually pouted before assuming a rather alarmingly crafty expression. \u201cIt\u2019ll take much less time my way, you comprehend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Makepeace burst out and for a moment Apollo was afraid he\u2019d have to physically restrain him. \u201cYou\u2019re discussing falsifying evidence to hang a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a hypocrite, Mr. Harte,\u201d the duke snapped. \u201cYou believe him just as guilty as I. You just want to salve your conscience by working for the evidence. The end result is the same, I assure you: an arrested man and Lord Kilbourne saved from Bedlam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless,\u201d Trevillion said. He didn\u2019t raise his voice, but such was its command, the other two men looked to him. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it our way. Your Grace.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment the soldier and the aristocrat glared at each other.</p><p>Then the duke suddenly knocked over his teacup, spilling the mess on a stack of papers. \u201cOh, very well,\u201d he said, petulant, over the squawks of Makepeace. Apparently the papers were broadsheets he\u2019d been meaning to read. \u201cI suppose there\u2019s no help for it. We\u2019ll have to go to William Greaves\u2019s country house outside Bath and hunt around like farmers\u2019 wives after chicken eggs.\u201d</p><p>They all stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>Trevillion cleared his throat, but Makepeace, perhaps because of his sodden broadsheets, beat him to it. \u201cHow do you propose we get into Greaves\u2019s country house? Surely he\u2019ll notice four men tramping through his rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Montgomery purred, \u201csince he\u2019ll be holding a country party in a little over a fortnight\u2019s time with an especial play as the centerpiece of the event. Naturally, I have been invited. I\u2019ll simply arrive with my very good friend, Mr. Smith\u201d\u2014he sent a significant glance at Apollo\u2014\u201cand there you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere we won\u2019t be, because the first thing Greaves will do will be to have \u2019Pollo arrested,\u201d Makepeace objected.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Apollo interjected thoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019ve never met... the man.\u201d</p><p>Makepeace swung on him, looking betrayed. \u201cWhat, never?\u201d</p><p>Apollo shrugged. \u201cPerhaps... as a baby? I certainly have no... memory of him or the rest of his family. He probably\u2019s never... seen me.\u201d He looked over at Trevillion calmly sipping his tea. \u201cCan Lady Phoebe find... a way to get an invitation to... the house party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the captain said with certainty. \u201cHer brother does not want her to attend social events except those held by a family member. There are very few exceptions. However\u201d\u2014he looked considering\u2014\u201cI believe Wakefield has a house in Bath. It shouldn\u2019t be too hard to suggest Lady Phoebe take the waters. And, since she enjoys the theater very much, she might be able to attend a private theatrical performance for one night. I shall look into the matter.\u201d</p><p>Montgomery clapped his hands. \u201cThen it\u2019s settled. As I see it, there\u2019s but one thing to do in the intervening two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d Makepeace grated.</p><p>The duke turned his bright-blue eyes on Apollo, making him exceptionally nervous. \u201cWhy, outfit Lord Kilbourne as the aristocrat he is.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Ariadne followed the winding corridors of the labyrinth for days and nights. She ate the cheese and bread her mother had hidden in the folds of her robe and drank the dew that collected in the crevices of the stone at night. Sometimes she would hear an animal\u2019s roar or what sounded like a man\u2019s shout, but often she heard nothing at all except the scrape of her slippers on the hard earth of the labyrinth. And then, on the third day, she found the first skeleton...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>Two weeks later Lily looked up at the gray stone facade of William Greaves\u2019s country house and thought she should be excited.</p><p>It was the first opportunity in months and months for her to perform\u2014and it would be in one of her own plays. By dint of nearly killing herself, she\u2019d finished A Wastrel Reform\u2019d on time and sent the manuscript by porter to Edwin, despite her misgivings. He\u2019d already had a buyer, after all, and they both needed the money rather badly.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been terribly surprised when the Duke of Montgomery had introduced her to the other players and she\u2019d found out she was performing in the play she\u2019d only just finished. William Greaves was the duke\u2019s friend who\u2019d commissioned A Wastrel Reform\u2019d, and she had the lead as Cecily Wastrel. A plum breeches role\u2014and she should know.</p><p>All in all a lovely turn of events. Usually she\u2019d be happy and looking forward to both the party and the work.</p><p>Instead she felt a persistent melancholy. Caliban\u2014Lord Kilbourne\u2014had to all appearances escaped the soldiers, but she had no idea where he was. Indio had spent the week she\u2019d been frantically writing moping about the garden, bemoaning his loss and driving her half mad. Even Maude, who should\u2019ve been glad all her dire warnings about the man had proven correct, was silent on the subject. The afternoon after the soldiers finally left the garden, Lily had crept into the musician\u2019s gallery and found his meager nest. He\u2019d left a few clothes, an end of bread, and his notebook. This last she\u2019d pocketed as some pathetic token\u2014of what, she wasn\u2019t exactly sure.</p><p>So it was with false cheer that she entered the Greaves House hallway. It was an older manse with narrow, dark rooms. She glanced around, already worried about where they could put on the play.</p><p>\u201cAh, our players,\u201d Mr. William Greaves said rather pompously. He was a man in his sixties who\u2019d probably been handsome as a youth. Now, however, he had a uniform dreary grayness about him, with a lined, sagging jawline and a puffiness around the eyes that bespoke too much drink or rich food. \u201cI collect you must be Miss Goodfellow?\u201d</p><p>She curtsied. \u201cYour discernment is quite amazing, sir.\u201d She swept wide her arm to indicate the other players behind her. \u201cMay I introduce Mr. Stanford Hume.\u201d An older, florid-faced actor bowed stiffly. Poor Stanford suffered from lumbago. \u201cMiss Moll Bennet.\u201d Moll curtsied low, drawing Mr. Greaves\u2019s eye to her lush bosom. \u201cAnd Mr. John Hampstead?\u201d John grinned and swept a lavish bow. He was tall and thin and wasn\u2019t particular as to the sex of his paramours.</p><p>They four were the principal players, though of course there were other actors to fill the remaining parts of the play.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, welcome to Greaves House,\u201d Mr. Greaves said expansively, and then rather ruined the effect by becoming practical. \u201cI believe my butler has your rooms ready. I do hope you\u2019ll be joining us for dinner. A most jolly company, I think. Ah, here\u2019s my son and his wife arrived. You\u2019ll excuse me?\u201d</p><p>And they were left to the direction of the butler.</p><p>Who, naturally, looked faintly contemptuous. \u201cLake.\u201d He snapped his fingers and one of the footmen came forward. \u201cShow these persons to their rooms, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTa, love,\u201d John said cheekily to the butler.</p><p>And they tramped after Lake the footman.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least they have us inside,\u201d Moll said philosophically as they mounted the stairs. \u201cLast house play I did would you believe they wanted us to bunk in the stables like gypsies? No, indeed, I said. Inside in a room at least as nice as the downstairs maids or back to London I go on the next stage. They grumbled, but I had my way in the end. That was Richard II in Cambridgeshire, d\u2019you remember, Stanford?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do indeed,\u201d Stanford intoned in his plummy voice. \u201cMost depressing production I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what they were thinking,\u201d agreed Moll. \u201cA history play for a house party. Can you imagine?\u201d</p><p>The footman, who, unlike the butler, seemed rather in awe of them, showed them to two rooms. After hearing Moll\u2019s story about being housed in the stables, Lily was a bit afraid of what they\u2019d be given. But other than being quite at the end of the hall, their rooms seemed to be nice.</p><p>\u201cBetter\u2019n the stables anyway,\u201d Moll said cheerfully as she poked her head in the wardrobe. \u201cWe\u2019ll be sharing the bed, looks like\u201d\u2014she nodded at the canopied bed\u2014\u201cbut I don\u2019t snore, so it should be fine. Best tidy ourselves and go on downstairs. I\u2019ve a feeling we\u2019re the entertainment for the night.\u201d</p><p>That was often the case, Lily reflected as they took turns at the washbasin and changed out of their dusty traveling clothes. The actors hired for a private performance were also considered professional guests by their host\u2014there to enliven the party.</p><p>They were ready to appear in a little less than an hour. Moll was in dark brown and mauve, while Lily had on one of her favorite dresses, a scarlet affair with a deep, square neckline and white ruffles on the bodice and sleeves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Moll teased and they stepped out into the hall to find John and Stanford waiting.</p><p>\u201cLadies!\u201d John swept them a ridiculously elaborate bow.</p><p>\u201cAss,\u201d Stanford muttered, offering Moll his arm.</p><p>That left Lily to take John\u2019s arm as they descended. She\u2019d worked with both Moll and John before and was finding Stanford to be quietly witty beneath his role as the elder actor. In normal circumstances she\u2019d be enjoying herself immensely: a country house, a party, genial colleagues, and the prospect of a week\u2019s worth of good food.</p> <p>Tonight, though, she simply saw the party as something to endure.</p><p>On the first floor was a large salon and Lily glanced around it, mentally trying it on for size for their play. The lighting wasn\u2019t very good\u2014it was an interior room with only two windows at the far end\u2014but the play would be at night anyway and with several dozen candles, it might well do.</p><p>She caught Stanford\u2019s eye and when he winked, she knew he was thinking the same thing.</p><p>Then their host entered and with him the rest of the house party guests.</p><p>The first were Mr. and Mrs. George Greaves, their host\u2019s son and his wife, though, since the older man was a widower, Lily suspected his daughter-in-law had had a hand in planning the party. She was a plain woman in her thirties, quiet, but with an intelligence in her eyes when they were introduced to her. Her husband, in contrast, had a carrying voice that would\u2019ve done him well had he taken to the stage. George Greaves was a big, burly man and still had the good looks age had faded from his father.</p> <p>Behind them was another, somewhat younger couple. Mr. and Mrs. Phillip Warner were still newlyweds and obviously in love. They made a striking couple, as both had beautiful butter-yellow hair, and Lily couldn\u2019t help thinking they were destined to have a gorgeous brood of children.</p><p>Miss Hippolyta Royle was accompanied by her father, Sir George Royle, who had made his fortune in India and been knighted for his efforts. She was a dark beauty who obviously doted on her aging parent.</p><p>Besides Miss Royle, there were two other single ladies at the party: Mrs. Jellett, a society widow with a gossiping gleam in her eye, and Lady Herrick, the wealthy\u2014and quite beautiful\u2014widow of a baronet.</p><p>Lily was just thinking that the house party was weighted heavily in favor of the ladies when their host cried, \u201cAh, Your Grace, you\u2019ve arrived!\u201d</p><p>She turned to see the Duke of Montgomery, Malcolm MacLeish...</p><p>And Caliban.</p> <p>Only he wasn\u2019t Caliban. Not anymore. He was Viscount Kilbourne, his hair tied severely back, wearing a dusky-blue suit heavily embroidered in gold and crimson, and a cream waistcoat, and looking every inch the aristocrat.</p><p>LILY WORE A crimson gown that exposed the upper slopes of her lovely breasts, white and inviting.</p><p>Apollo felt a bit as if he\u2019d been hit square between the eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou did not tell me Miss Goodfellow would be here,\u201d he hissed in Montgomery\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d replied the duke. \u201cWhy? Was the information of import to you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, the other man knew well enough that the information that Lily would be attending this same house party had been \u201cof import.\u201d In the weeks he\u2019d spent preparing for the house party, Apollo had endured quite a bit of time with the duke. He was frighteningly intelligent, mercurial, and selfish to the point of mania, and had the sort of impish sense of humor that found the predicaments of others funny. Rather like a little boy who enjoyed pitching battles between beetles and worms. Except the duke was much, much more powerful than a little boy.</p><p>So it was hard to tell if the duke hadn\u2019t told Apollo about Lily because he was amusing himself\u2014or for some other more nefarious reason.</p><p>Not that Apollo gave a damn at the moment.</p> <p>Over two weeks it\u2019d been since he\u2019d last seen her\u2014two weeks in which he\u2019d gone to bed every night wondering how she was and what she was doing, and waked with the image of her face behind his eyes.</p><p>Her lichen-green eyes had widened fractionally when she\u2019d turned to see him, but she\u2019d controlled herself all too soon, plastering on a bright social face that he was beginning to hate already.</p><p>His uncle, William Greaves, was making the introductions, but Apollo had eyes only for her.</p><p>She curtsied to him, murmuring huskily, \u201cMr. Smith,\u201d as she did so, for they\u2019d settled on the silly pseudonym for the party.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help himself. It\u2019d been too long and he didn\u2019t know how she felt about him anymore. If she hated him or even\u2014God forbid\u2014believed him to be a bloody murderer.</p><p>He caught her fingers and bent over them in a bow he\u2019d learned as a boy and relearned again just in the past weeks. \u201cMiss Goodfellow.\u201d</p><p>One was supposed to kiss the air above a lady\u2019s hand, but he brushed his lips over her knuckles, soft, but insistent. He wouldn\u2019t let her forget what they\u2019d had between them.</p><p>As he rose he caught the faint glimmer of irritation crossing her face and he was glad. Better he engender vexation or even outright hatred than indifference. Then they were moving past each other and away as other guests were introduced.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d Montgomery chirped as he accepted a glass of wine from a footman.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s going to murder you in your sleep one of these days,\u201d Apollo returned, waving away the same footman. He wanted to keep a clear head for the coming evening.</p><p>\u201cOh, but only if they can get past my man-traps,\u201d the duke said absently.</p><p>He was probably jesting, but it was entirely possible Montgomery slept with an array of traps scattered about his bedroom. The man was like an Oriental potentate.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring me?\u201d Malcolm MacLeish asked, suddenly and irritably.</p><p>The Scotsman\u2019s color was high and his pleasant face was twisted into a sulky scowl. For the first time Apollo realized that he might not be the only insect Montgomery was playing with tonight.</p><p>\u201cOh, I suppose to remind you of your obligations,\u201d Montgomery replied carelessly. \u201cAnd to have fun, of course.\u201d</p><p>The question was, whose \u201cfun\u201d was he counting on? Apollo had an uneasy feeling it was the duke\u2019s own.</p><p>He glanced away from his sponsor and over to William Greaves, the reason he was here in the first place. His uncle was an ordinary-looking man, a bit pompous, a bit weak about the mouth, but was he capable of ordering the senseless murder of three men merely to entrap his nephew? It didn\u2019t seem possible, but if it hadn\u2019t been he, then who?</p><p>Apollo could detect no hint of a family resemblance in his uncle, but his cousin, George, had been a revelation. Like Apollo, he was a big man, well over six feet, with broad shoulders and brown hair. His facial features were rather better formed than Apollo\u2019s own, but there was enough similarity that it made seeing the man like catching his own reflection in a mirror out of the corner of his eye. It puzzled him at first, this sense of familiarity, until he realized what it was: they moved alike, he and his cousin.</p><p>Apollo frowned, thinking, only to be interrupted by Montgomery. \u201cTry not to look too much like the tragic hero of a melodrama, if you please. We\u2019re at a party.\u201d And with that he sauntered over to Lady Herrick, who was not only quite a beauty but apparently wealthy as well.</p><p>Just Montgomery\u2019s type, Apollo thought sourly. Poor woman.</p><p>\u201cHe collects people, you know,\u201d the architect said. \u201cLike a spider collects flies. Traps them, ties them up in silken threads, and keeps them until he has use of them.\u201d MacLeish turned to Apollo, his blue eyes very cynical for one so young. \u201cHas he collected you, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Apollo was watching Lily again, as she threw back her head in laughter at something Mr. Phillip Warner had said. Her throat was long and white and he wanted, rather violently, to lick it until she stopped laughing at other men\u2019s jests. \u201cHe may think he has me, but he\u2019ll find he\u2019s very much mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, too,\u201d MacLeish murmured, following his gaze, \u201cbut \u2019twas I who was mistaken in the end.\u201d</p><p>Apollo spared a glance at the other man and then moved away without comment. Whatever was going on between Montgomery and his architect, he hadn\u2019t the time for it.</p><p>His eyes were fixed on Lily.</p><p>CALIBAN\u2014NO, LORD KILBOURNE\u2014was coming toward her and Lily wasn\u2019t entirely certain what to do. She\u2019d been aware of him this entire time, for his eyes seemed to burn into her back no matter where she moved in the room. It really wasn\u2019t fair: it was he who had disappeared into thin air without so much as an explanation or word to her whether he was all right or not. And now he\u2019d turned up at a house party of all things, still using that ridiculous name, Mr. Smith. Had he even invented an appropriate Christian name to go with Smith? A thought struck her, low and terrible. Dear God, she didn\u2019t even know his proper Christian name! She\u2019d let him kiss her and yet didn\u2019t know the first thing about him. The realization made her bitter and a little unwise.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your real name?\u201d she demanded as he made her side, and if she had to blink back wetness from her eyes, she told herself it was tears of anger.</p><p>He glanced around, presumably making sure no one could overhear him. Fortunately, Mr. Phillip Warner had moved away to flirt with his own wife and no one was within earshot.</p><p>He replied in a very low voice, \u201cApollo Greaves, Viscount Kilbourne.\u201d</p><p>Apollo? Apollo? She nearly goggled.</p><p>Well, he certainly couldn\u2019t use Apollo with Smith\u2014what an entirely inane name. Almost as bad as Caliban when one considered it. What mother looked down at an infant son and thought, god of light? No one could live up to a name like that. Especially since he had a twin sister...</p><p>Lily\u2019s brain stuttered to a stop and she realized simultaneously both who Apollo-the-god\u2019s twin sister was and who Apollo-the-man\u2019s twin sister must be.</p><p>\u201cYour sister is Artemis Batten, the Duchess of Wakefield,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYour sister\u2019s a bloody duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He looked at her oddly, as if everyone had a duchess as a sister.</p><p>\u201cWhich means the duke is your brother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s rather an ass, if that makes any difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said decisively. \u201cIt truly doesn\u2019t. Why are you even talking to me? I\u2019m the blasted help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not and you know it,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cI need to talk to you. To explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paid to be here,\u201d she said with as much dignity as possible under the circumstances. \u201cAnd you\u2019re born to all this\u201d\u2014she waved her hand at the room, which, ill-lit though it was, still had a gold ceiling\u2014\u201cand more. You and I have nothing\u2014absolutely nothing in common. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here, but I\u2019ll thank you to stay away from me.\u201d</p><p>She pasted a smile on her face and moved away from him as gracefully as she could. There was no need to cause a scene, just because her heart was breaking. Ridiculous, really. When he\u2019d been a penniless workman in a garden, shabby and mute, he\u2019d been well within her reach. Now that he was cleaned up and dazzling in his expensive clothes\u2014that waistcoat alone must have cost more than she\u2019d make in half a year\u2014he was as high above her as the sun itself.</p><p>Apollo, indeed. Perhaps his name really did fit him.</p><p>If he was the god Apollo then she was merely a shepherdess or suchlike. Someone quite lowly and of the earth, not the sky. Shepherdesses might mate with gods in mythology but it always ended rather badly for the poor mortal.</p><p>And she had good cause to know that such was the case in this world as well.</p><p>The butler entered at that moment and announced supper and they went in to another dark room, this one long and narrow so as to fit an endless mahogany table. Lily found herself seated with the Duke of Montgomery on one side and the delightful Mr. Warner on the other. Directly across from her was Mr. George Greaves with Mrs. Jellett on one side and Mrs. Warner on the other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019d hardly begun on a rather watery beef broth when Mrs. Jellett, a lady of mature years in a frock of a startling yellow-green shade, leaned forward and said loudly, \u201cHave you heard aught of your mad cousin, Mr. Greaves? I understand that he barely escaped capture by soldiers in the destroyed Harte\u2019s Folly pleasure garden.\u201d</p><p>Mr. William Greaves\u2019s mouth thinned into nonexistence and anyone could see that he did not like the subject\u2014which of course hardly dissuaded his guests.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis said he killed three men with an enormous knife.\u201d Mrs. Warner shivered dramatically. \u201cThe very thought that a murderous madman is on the loose is enough to make one want to hide under the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr in the bed?\u201d the duke murmured over his glass of wine.</p> <p>\u201cAre you offering bedchamber protection, Your Grace?\u201d Lady Herrick asked lazily.</p><p>The duke bowed from the waist. \u201cFor you, madam, I would make the sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch bravery,\u201d cried Moll from the other side of the duke. \u201cI vow \u2019tis enough to send a lady into a paroxysm.\u201d</p><p>That comment prompted a round of titters from the ladies.</p><p>Lily stared at her plate, trying not to feel any sympathy for Caliban\u2014Apollo\u2014but it was hard. The others talked about him as if he were a maddened beast to be shot on sight. Would she have felt that way if she\u2019d only heard the stories and not known the man beforehand? Would she have condemned a stranger at once without benefit of trial?</p> <p>Probably. Fear had a tendency to drive away the courtesy of civilization.</p><p>Mrs. Jellett was still curious about the original topic of conversation. She addressed George Greaves. \u201cTell me, Mr. Greaves, was your cousin always mad? Did he do anything bizarre or cruel as a boy?\u201d</p><p>Mr. William Greaves spoke up from the head of the table, his voice grim. \u201cI fear, madam, that that side of the family has always had strange turns. My brother, alas, was prone to overexcitement followed by melancholies from which he could hardly rouse himself. A pity\u201d\u2014he took a sip of his wine\u2014\u201cthat as eldest the title naturally falls to his side.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Twould be better,\u201d his son joined in, \u201cif our English great families could set aside the titles from those members who, because of some disease or defect of the brain, are rendered feeble or otherwise weaken the lineages of the aristocracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that were done,\u201d drawled the Duke of Montgomery, \u201chalf the titles of England would go obsolete due to brain weakness. I know my own grandfather fancied himself a cowherd at times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Your Grace?\u201d John leaned forward to see down the table. \u201cNot a shepherd or goatherd?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m told he was quite specific in his mania and only cows would do,\u201d His Grace replied. \u201cOf course there were those who said his affliction was the direct result of a certain type of disease, which I won\u2019t mention in the present company as it is of an indelicate nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you already have,\u201d Miss Royle observed in her husky voice. \u201cMentioned it, that is, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9, ma\u2019am,\u201d the duke replied, a thread of irritation in his voice. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought to encounter such pedantry amongst a lighthearted gathering.\u201d</p><p>Miss Royle shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t find madness amusing\u2014whether caused by disease or birth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin doesn\u2019t even have the excuse of disease, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Mr. George Greaves said, abrupt and hard. \u201cHe was born with whatever ails him\u2014and because of it, three good men are dead\u2014his own friends, mind. I\u2019m sorry that he was ever sent to Bedlam instead of being tried before the magistrates as he should\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut a titled gentleman, sir!\u201d his father objected. \u201cSurely such a thing would tear apart the very fabric of our great nation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen before the House of Lords, if it came to that,\u201d his son replied. \u201cBetter a lord tried and found guilty of murder, than a madman loosed upon the countryside with the whispers that the only reason he is free is because of his rank. It sets the common people to thinking\u2014and that is something none of us want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you are correct,\u201d his father said slowly, obviously troubled by the argument.</p> <p>\u201cI know I am,\u201d Mr. George Greaves returned. \u201cThink what ignominy he has already brought our family. What more will he bring if he murders more innocents?\u201d</p><p>For a moment the mood at the table turned somber at this image, but then the duke spoke up. \u201cSurely no more ignominy than my own great-uncle brought upon my own house when he attempted to have, er, marital relations with a horse.\u201d</p><p>That comment certainly lightened the conversation.</p><p>Lily glanced covertly at Apollo. He was eating his meal, his expression blank. How did he feel, hearing his father discussed so dismissively? His own history laid bare for others to titter over? This was his family, the one he\u2019d said he was estranged from, and it was obvious not only that they believed him guilty of the crimes he\u2019d been charged with, but that they would make every effort to have him imprisoned or hanged should they discover his ruse.</p><p>What in God\u2019s name was he doing here?</p><p>She turned and found the duke eyeing her, and she remembered that she had a role to play tonight\u2014and the duke, for once, might not be the most dangerous person at the table.</p><p>So she threw herself into the conversation, making sure never to glance in Apollo\u2019s direction again. Whatever he was about, it was certainly no business of hers. How could it be, after all, when he was an aristocrat and she a mere actress?</p><p>When, hours later, she finally climbed the stairs to the room she shared with Moll, she was weary to the bone with trying to appear carefree and witty. Witty! There was a word she never wanted to hear again, she thought darkly as she made her way down the hallway. Wittiness was terribly exhausting.</p><p>It would be nice to let down her guard, alone with Moll.</p><p>But when she opened the door to their room she found herself very much mistaken. Moll was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>And Viscount Kilbourne lounged upon the bed.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>The skeleton was small and sad, lying in a heap of frayed blue robes. Pink beads lay scattered over the remains. The girl driven into the labyrinth the year before had worn a necklace of pink beads. Ariadne knelt by the skeleton\u2019s side and, saying an old prayer her mother had taught her, sprinkled dust on the remains. Then, rising, she continued deeper into the labyrinth...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>Lily stopped dead in the doorway to her room and then took a step back.</p><p>Apollo cocked his head. It\u2019d been a very long day full of trepidation mixed with tediousness and he\u2019d used up all his patience. \u201cIf you leave, I\u2019ll follow you out and we\u2019ll have this discussion in the hallway where everyone can hear.\u201d</p><p>She scowled ferociously at him, but came all the way in the room and shut the door. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said patiently, \u201cthere is.\u201d</p><p>She looked away and down for a second and then back at him. \u201cYour voice is better.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fortnight.\u201d His voice was still rusty and his throat ached on occasion, but he no longer had to take so long to speak. \u201cWhere is Indio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left him with Maude.\u201d She wrapped her arms around her waist.</p><p>\u201cIn the garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re visiting Maude\u2019s niece outside London while I\u2019m here.\u201d She looked at him pointedly. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>He stretched and folded his arms beneath his head. \u201cYou walked away when I tried to talk to you during the party. I thought since you wouldn\u2019t come to me...\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cMoll will be back soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I gave her enough coin to stay away for the night.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in outrage. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that! Where will she stay? She\u2019s been looking forward all day to a nice bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did offer her mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d She pursed her lips, still not mollified. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019ll not be staying the night in any case. Besides,\u201d she hurried on before he could object, \u201cyou misunderstood my original question: why are you here at the house party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo find the real murderer,\u201d he said wearily. Frankly, after two weeks of the subject, he\u2019d grown a little tired of it. He gestured to a chair. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it would be quite improper,\u201d she said, and he wondered if she actually thought that or was simply making up etiquette rules out of thin air. \u201cHow are you going to find a murderer at a house party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think it\u2019s my uncle.\u201d He looked at her appraisingly. \u201cYou must be tired.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontgomery, Trevillion, and Harte\u2014Makepeace, that is.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in horror, letting her arms drop. \u201cYou\u2019ve trusted the Duke of Montgomery with your secret? Have you gone completely mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just very desperate. Besides, I never told it to him\u2014he somehow figured it out on his own.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cLily, I don\u2019t want to talk of this right now. I want to...\u201d He sat up and pushed his hands through his hair. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m charged with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t before this night, I would after that dinner,\u201d she said tartly.</p><p>He stared at her, licking his lips. \u201cYou must know that I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>She gave him her profile. \u201cMust I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left us without word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were watching the garden,\u201d he replied, his voice steady. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get you a message without the soldiers realizing you knew me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d she said, and her face was harder than he\u2019d ever seen it. \u201cIf you\u2019d truly wanted to, you could have smuggled a message to Maude as she shopped or given it to one of the gardeners, or found a thousand other ways.\u201d</p><p>He simply looked at her. Perhaps she was right. Perhaps he could\u2019ve gotten her word if he\u2019d only tried hard enough. But he\u2019d been busy with the plan, with the knowledge that until he could come to her a free man, he had nothing at all to offer her.</p><p>His very silence seemed to be some sort of answer to her. She lifted her chin proudly. \u201cIf we meant anything to you, you\u2019d have gotten us word that you were alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a great deal to me,\u201d he said, low.</p><p>\u201cDo we?\u201d she asked, her mouth tight. \u201cTruly? And yet you left us\u2014me\u2014without word or warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were friends.\u201d</p><p>He rose in one movement. \u201cI thought we were more than friends.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and she backed up a step, seemingly without conscious thought, as he advanced on her, until her bottom hit the door.</p><p>He should be gentler, should approach her with caution. Even now she might be afraid of what had been said about him. But he was weary\u2014so very, very weary\u2014of things being taken from him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to lose her as well. Not if he could help it.</p><p>He halted inches from her. \u201cWeren\u2019t we, Lily? More than friends?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted as her breath quickened, but she showed no fear of him. \u201cYou know we were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, incredulous. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hide behind quips.\u201d She shook her head impatiently. \u201cEverything has changed. You... you\u2019re an aristocrat. A viscount\u2014someday a bloody earl. I\u2019m the bastard daughter of a drunken actress and an illiterate porter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took her shoulders, barely refraining from shaking her. \u201cI\u2019m the same man I was when I labored in the garden. The same man you were so kind to when I was mute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not!\u201d Her breasts were heaving now with the force of her ire. \u201cThat man was of my world. He was simple and... and kind and he wasn\u2019t a bloody aristocrat!\u201d</p><p>She balled her fist and hit his chest with the last word.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d he choked. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me!\u201d</p><p>He stared into her eyes\u2014those beautiful green eyes\u2014and something seemed to break inside him.</p><p>Four years of torment and loss.</p><p>Four years of being told what he was and what he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Four years of limbo. Of life suspended, lost, abandoned as he lay half dead in a stinking cell.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t dead and he wasn\u2019t going to lose any more of life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m everything you thought me,\u201d he whispered, his voice broken. \u201cThe gardener and the aristocrat and the madman. I endured Bedlam and it was a crucible to my soul, burning what I was before and reshaping me. I wouldn\u2019t have survived it had I not let myself be remolded.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her helplessly and she stared back, her eyes wet, her lips parted.</p><p>He laid his forehead against hers. \u201cIn truth I don\u2019t know what sort of man I am anymore, newly smelted, newly poured into some strange and original mold. I was still too hot to the touch for discovery. But I know this: whatever strange creature I have become, I am yours. Help me, Lily. Unmold me and take what form I am in your hands and blow the breath of life into me. Make me a living being again.\u201d</p><p>He had no more words to convince her, so he did what he\u2019d wanted to do since he\u2019d first seen her this evening: he slid his lips down to her mouth.</p><p>THE KISS WAS so sweet, so tender, that for a moment Lily couldn\u2019t think at all. All she could do was feel\u2014the heat of his mouth, the puffs of his breaths on her cheek, the gentle touch of his palms on her face. He pushed his tongue into her mouth and she suckled it, wanting more.</p><p>She stood on tiptoe and thrust her fingers into his hair, pulling off the wretched tie and freeing his wild locks\u2014freeing Caliban from Lord Kilbourne.</p><p>And then she remembered: no matter what he might call himself, she was still mad at him.</p><p>She pulled back and murmured, \u201cI\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d His wounded voice had descended into Stygian depths. He pressed open-mouthed kisses to her jaw.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She yanked at his hair in emphasis.</p><p>He grunted, but her grip didn\u2019t prevent him from lowering his mouth to hers again. He nipped at her lips and then licked at them, softening the sting. \u201cI\u2019ll have to see what I can do to regain your good graces.\u201d</p><p>His hands left her arms and seized her waist instead, and before she could think, he was lifting her bodily, walking with her as if she were as light as a kitten. He pivoted and then she was falling onto the bed, with him right on top of her.</p><p>He caught himself on his elbows before his entire weight could crush her, but she was still trapped, his legs and lower body pinning her to the soft mattress.</p> <p>\u201cAnd how,\u201d she asked with awful dignity, \u201cdo you suppose this will help your case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing,\u201d he replied, trailing his fingertips over her temples, \u201cyou can\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>She arched her brows.</p><p>His lips curved as he plucked a pin from her coiffure. \u201cIt gives me time to argue, if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>She let her hands fall beside her head in mock surrender. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you agree that we found an uncommon accord in the garden?\u201d She felt the loosening of her hair as he removed another pin.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know who you were,\u201d she objected.</p><p>\u201cNot what I asked.\u201d He eyed her sternly. \u201cDo you agree or not?\u201d</p><p>She blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cI agree that I had an uncommon accord with the man I thought you were, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Ah.\u201d He stretched over her head to set the pins on a side table, then resumed his position atop her. \u201cWe both are in agreement that we shared an uncommon accord. The problem, as I see it, is that you are under the delusion that I am somehow not the same man as I was then. I may not know exactly what I have become since Bedlam, but I know this: whatever I was in the garden I am now, new clothes or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t!\u201d She parted her legs to give him more room, thinking she really oughtn\u2019t to feel as comfortable as she did.</p><p>\u201cAm I not?\u201d He thrust his fingertips into her hair, massaging her scalp. \u201cIn what way am I different?\u201d</p><p>Lily had to fight to keep her eyes open. The feel of his hands on her scalp after a day with her hair pulled tight was simply heaven. \u201cYour name, for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s in a name, truly?\u201d he murmured, dipping his head to trail his lips over the sensitive skin below her ear. \u201cYou called me Caliban, but had you called me Romeo, wouldn\u2019t I still be the same man? My mother named me for a god renowned for male beauty, but does it make me any more handsome? My mirror tells me daily, no.\u201d</p><p>There was definitely something wrong with his reasoning and if she could only draw breath to think, she might figure it out.</p><p>\u201cCheat,\u201d she growled, her voice weaker than she liked.</p><p>He pulled back enough for her to see the amused quirk of his lips. \u201cTemptress.\u201d</p><p>He bent to lay his mouth on hers, thrusting his tongue lazily past her lips until she sucked on the thick length.</p><p>\u201cAre they any different?\u201d he whispered against her mouth, \u201cmy kisses? Have they changed so much with my name?\u201d</p><p>She cracked her eyelids to look at him and murmur into the humid heat between them, \u201cI can\u2019t tell. Perhaps you should demonstrate again.\u201d</p><p>He licked at the corner of her mouth. \u201cA scientific study, you mean?\u201d His mouth trailed up her cheek, soft as a moth.</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her eyelids, a mere brush of lips, before seizing her mouth again, swallowing her moan. His hands moved until he\u2019d intertwined his fingers with hers, still at either side of her head. She opened helplessly beneath the surge of his intent, accepting his tongue, his heavy desire. His chest crushed her breasts and she wanted all the material between them gone so that she could feel his skin against hers. She arched under him, attempting to get closer, wanting to rub her naked nipples against him, but the stiff fabric of her stays prevented even the illusion of touch.</p><p>She sank back, whimpering.</p><p>He rose to his knees at the same time, eyeing her with an obnoxious twist of his lips that she\u2019d have slapped away if she didn\u2019t want him back so much.</p><p>\u201cThe same?\u201d he asked, and at least his voice shook just the tiniest bit. He wasn\u2019t unaffected, either.</p><p>She tilted her head against the coverlet, trying to catch her breath. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d tried to sound nonchalant, but by his sudden grin she knew she\u2019d not been entirely successful.</p><p>\u201cI am the same man I was in the garden,\u201d he said into the silence of the bedroom, his grin fading to something solemn, almost severe. \u201cMy limbs move as they did then, my lungs fill with air exactly the same, and my heart...\u201d He paused as if to swallow, continuing lower, \u201cMy heart beats constant and true, and if you believe nothing else, Lily Stump, believe this: my heart has changed not at all since the garden.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him. His words were beautiful, but she\u2019d had nearly a lifetime\u2019s distrust of the upper classes. Such a thing wasn\u2019t vanquished in moments.</p><p>He nodded at her silence as if she\u2019d made a rebuttal\u2014and then he shrugged off his coat. \u201cDid you fear Caliban?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slowly.</p><p>He flipped open the buttons on his beautiful waistcoat. \u201cCaliban and Apollo are the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she husked. \u201cCaliban is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you truly believe that?\u201d he asked nearly indulgently. \u201cI am Caliban and I am Apollo. We are the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stripped off his waistcoat.</p><p>\u201cThere never was a Caliban to begin with.\u201d She felt sad, as if she truly mourned for that gentle giant, that enigmatic mute man she\u2019d apparently made up from whole cloth.</p><p>He actually laughed, the cad. \u201cDo you think I pretended to dig holes and hack down trees? I am Caliban and I am Apollo and I am Smith.\u201d He pulled his shirt over his head, laying his chest bare. \u201cIs this not the same body you saw emerge from the pond?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it. She did now what she hadn\u2019t been able to do then\u2014she touched his chest, running her fingertips lightly over his shoulders, down into the wedge of short hairs between his nipples.</p><p>He took her hand and moved it so her palm lay over his left nipple. \u201cMy heart beats here,\u201d he said, pressing until she could feel the steady thump. \u201cThe same heart, the same beat as in the garden.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand, but she kept her palm there, feeling the pulse beneath his warm skin. Slowly she curled her fingers until she could trace lightly around his nipple. It puckered beneath her touch, a tiny brown bead, and she felt a sudden urge to feel it beneath her tongue. Instead she raised her other hand and circled the corresponding nipple as well, fascinated by how his flesh responded. It wasn\u2019t until she heard the sharp inhalation that she looked up and realized what she was doing to him.</p><p>His head was thrown back, his throat rippling as he swallowed again and again, and his mighty shoulders, so strong, so broad, actually trembled at her simple touch.</p><p>Her being lit with awe that she\u2019d moved such a powerful man. That he literally shuddered beneath her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cCaliban,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCan I call you that?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head down to look at her, his brown eyes half-lidded. \u201cCaliban, Apollo, Smith, even Romeo, it matters not. I am the man that I am and always will be.\u201d</p><p>She nodded at that, for with this she could at least agree: what she called him had never been the problem.</p><p>He arched away from her suddenly, and she was forced to let her hands fall. \u201cLet me show you.\u201d He stood and stripped out of shoes, stockings, breeches, and smallclothes, until he was entirely nude. He spread wide his arms, and turned before her. \u201cI am as God made me, no more, no less. Take me as I am.\u201d</p><p>He completed his turn, standing proud before her, and she couldn\u2019t help but like what she saw. He was tall and well-made, with a narrow waist and muscular thighs. The hair on his chest was repeated in a knot around his navel and traveled down in a thin line into the tangle about his groin where his cock had half-risen, thick and straight and bold.</p><p>He was masculine, not beautiful. Compelling. But more importantly, with the stripping of his clothes he\u2019d discarded all that she disliked and become merely the man she\u2019d met in the garden.</p><p>She held out her hand. \u201cCaliban, Apollo, Smith, Romeo, you. Come to me, you that you are.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand, but instead of climbing back on the bed, he drew her up instead. \u201cI have an urge,\u201d he murmured in her ear as he drew her against his nude body, \u201cto make you as I am. Then, truly, shall we be equals.\u201d</p><p>So he patiently unlaced, untied, and unclothed her, his fingers working deftly on delicate material and tight cords. Reverently he drew off her bodice, her skirt, her petticoats, her stays, her chemise, her slippers, and laid them neatly aside until he knelt at her feet to unroll her stockings. She placed her palm on his shoulder as he set her foot on his knee and untied her garter. Her stockings were her best, but even so they\u2019d a mended hole at the heel. He unrolled them as carefully as if they\u2019d been lace, pausing to kiss her instep as he pulled them off. Then he set that foot down and picked up her other, drawing her so close that his bent head nearly brushed her bare mons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She swallowed, watching as those wild locks came perilously close to her maiden hair. She felt his fingertips trailing behind her knee and then he bent and pressed an open-mouthed kiss to the same place.</p><p>Her hand moved from his shoulder to his head, threading through his hair, clutching as he moved up her thigh, licking, sucking, the stocking entirely abandoned, until she felt the whisper of his breath against her damp flesh.</p><p>She nearly toppled, her knees going weak. He grasped her hips and turned with her until she could rest against the bed, and then he took her leg and flung it over his shoulder and kissed her.</p><p>There. Open-mouthed, licking across delicate flesh.</p> <p>She gasped and could not breathe out again. He\u2019d seized her lungs, made her forget everything but that place between her legs as he lapped at her, thoroughly debauching her.</p><p>Helplessly she grasped at his head, holding on for dear life as he found her nub and fitted his lips around it, licking delicately, relentlessly until she suddenly felt the gentle scrape of his teeth and that was it.</p><p>She shoved her fist into her mouth and only just in time as she arched into him, her leg tightening on his broad shoulders convulsively. She shook, wailing behind her fist, black spots in her vision as warmth flooded her. And all the while he licked and licked and licked until she had to weakly push against his shoulders to make him stop.</p><p>He raised his head and wiped his chin and mouth with his hand before prowling up her body, stopping to lave her navel. He pulled her all the way on top of the bed and then pushed her thighs farther apart. He settled between them, his belly at her center and his head just on a level with her breasts.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d he crooned, and for an amused moment she wondered if he was talking directly to her breasts.</p> <p>Then he dipped his head and licked around one nipple.</p><p>She whimpered and he opened his mouth over her nipple, suckling gently but urgently. With his fingers he tapped the other nipple, making it peak. She ached with want, almost painful so soon after her orgasm. Surely he was hard by now? Surely he was ready to join with her?</p><p>But he seemed in no hurry, lifting his head only to move to the nipple he\u2019d fingered. When he pinched the one he\u2019d left she nearly screamed at the feel against her wet flesh.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she moaned, grasping his head, trying to pull him up. \u201cPlease, please, please.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her, lazily licking her breast. \u201cWho am I now?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, restless, on edge, and so very, very wet for him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>He smirked then and rose over her.</p><p>She looked down, watching as he grasped his penis, fully engorged now, an angry red pillar rising from his pubic hair. He brought it between her legs, rubbing it up and down, wetting the head with her moisture.</p><p>She lifted her legs, wrapping them over his hips loosely. \u201cNow, now, now.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at her and his smile had left his face. He bit down on his bottom lip as he notched himself, the skin white beneath his teeth. He flexed his hips and nudged inside.</p><p>Big. He was a big man.</p><p>She gasped, holding her legs wider, higher, trying to give him more room.</p><p>His eyes were closed, his upper lip hitched in a snarl, almost as if he were in pain.</p><p>Or great pleasure.</p> <p>He thrust again, hard, and the entire length of his erection filled her.</p><p>She made a sound, restless, wanting.</p><p>He opened his eyes, looking down at her with concern. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She was stretched and so delightfully full of him. She twined her arms over his shoulders, digging her nails into his back. \u201cYes. Move.\u201d</p><p>And he did.</p><p>He pulled nearly out and then pressed in again, over and over, each time a little faster, a little harder, until he was pounding into her.</p><p>His back was slick with sweat and her hands slid against him as her fingers moved restlessly over him. She trailed her nails down, scoring him, probably hurting him, and she no longer cared. She reached his buttocks, muscled and rounded, and grasped him, pulling him tightly into her.</p><p>He propped himself on his elbows and screwed his hips into hers, his cock deep in her. And as he did so, he watched her, a bead of sweat slipping down the side of his dear face. He pushed a lock of her hair off her face and brought his mouth crashing down on hers, open and wet and not entirely in control.</p><p>But his hips kept moving, plundering her, owning her, making her climb those heights again.</p><p>She groaned into his mouth, animal and wild, and felt the slip of his hard chest against her nipples.</p><p>This man.</p><p>Whatever his name.</p><p>This man.</p><p>She broke, shuddering nearly violently, throwing back her head, wailing her release as he slammed into her one more time and withdrew, suddenly and awfully.</p><p>She stared up at him, shocked, as cold air caressed her entrance and hot semen spilled on her belly.</p><p>He shook with his release, moaning as if in pain, and another splash hit her thigh. He slumped against her, a heavy weight, but she couldn\u2019t push him away.</p><p>Instead she stroked his cooling back, staring at the ceiling and wondering what she\u2019d just done.</p><p>APOLLO WOKE TO the feel of soft flesh under his palm. He stroked upward, cupping a silky breast in his hand, and smiled without opening his eyes.</p><p>This, this must be paradise.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured, and he realized for the first time that she was awake as well.</p><p>He opened his eyes. It was a small room that she and the other actress had been given, with only one bed that apparently they had been expected to share. A candle still guttered on the bedside table, throwing a flickering yellow light across her face.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t read it. \u201cI think it\u2019s I who should be thanking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for that.\u201d She turned her face to his suddenly, her mouth curled wryly. \u201cThank you for not spilling inside of me.\u201d</p><p>A delicate tint colored her cheekbones.</p><p>He remembered Indio. Obviously some man had once not bothered to pull out at the crucial moment.</p><p>Apollo bent to kiss her shoulder and then took a corner of the sheet to tenderly wipe his seed off her belly and thighs. \u201cMay I stay?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYes, unless Moll returns before morning. I\u2019d\u201d\u2014she licked her lips\u2014\u201cI\u2019d like for you to stay.\u201d</p><p>He smiled against her shoulder, ridiculously pleased.</p><p>Her hand reached up and he felt her fingers in his hair. \u201cSo they\u2019re your family?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to delve into the matter now\u2014his blue blood seemed to dismay her. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She moved as if she were looking at him. \u201cAre they all you have left?\u201d</p><p>His head was on her shoulder and he concentrated on tracing around one rose-tinted nipple. \u201cBesides my sister, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew you were in the garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArtemis?\u201d He finally cocked his head back so he could see her expression. She had a tiny frown between her brows. \u201cYes. She brought me food and clothes and other things when she could. It\u2019s how Trevillion found me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound you?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, abandoning the nipple with regret. \u201cTrevillion was looking for me. He knew Artemis was my sister and he followed her until she led him to me one day. The day you saw us fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d The frown had grown deeper. \u201cWhy was he looking for you in the first place?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched as a sudden shiver shook his frame. The fire had died down in the grate and the room was drafty. He got up, padding to the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cApollo?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. She\u2019d stopped calling him Caliban and he didn\u2019t want that. Didn\u2019t want his past to rise up between them again.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder to see that she\u2019d sat up and pulled the coverlet over her breasts like a barrier between them. There was no help for it, then\u2014it always came back to that wretched night. The night his life had been destroyed.</p><p>\u201cTrevillion was the soldier who arrested me for the murders.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>From that day forth Ariadne found more and more skeletons, and for each one she stopped and respectfully prayed and scattered dust. As she neared the center of the labyrinth, she wondered what horrors awaited her there. But when, on the seventh day, the tall stone walls revealed their heart, she discovered something entirely unexpected...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>Lily watched Apollo. He squatted unselfconsciously nude at the hearth, stirring the fire. He was silhouetted in the firelight, powerful shoulders black and almost monstrous, narrowing to muscled hips and thighs. No wonder they\u2019d thought him a murderer. No wonder they\u2019d taken one look at such a big man and been afraid.</p><p>But was that entirely what had happened? He\u2019d told her little, and what else she\u2019d heard was from snippets of gossip and newssheets. Trevillion was the soldier who had arrested him, but now that same man was working to prove him innocent. There were gaps in her knowledge and she was tired of secondhand information.</p><p>She cleared her throat, the sound loud in the silence. \u201cCan you tell me what happened that night?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been about to lay a scoop of coal on the fire, and at her words, he paused for a fraction of a second before continuing. He rose, dusting his hands, broad back hunched, the flames reflecting off the sheen of his skin. He turned his head so that she could see his profile, large nose, prominent forehead, craggy lips and chin.</p><p>\u201cYou have to understand,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI was young. Four and twenty. That might not seem so very young to you, but I\u2019d spent most of my life in schooling. First at Harrow, where my grandfather paid for my education, and then Oxford. When I came to London I had a very small stipend from the earl, delivered through his lawyers. I spent it drinking and wenching, mostly.\u201d</p><p>He turned at last, though she still couldn\u2019t see his features.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what men of my rank do. They spend money and drink. They don\u2019t labor\u2014even if their family might be starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas your family starving?\u201d she asked sharply.</p><p>He shook his head immediately. \u201cNo. But neither did they have very much to live on. My father had gone through nearly all the money he\u2019d had and the earl refused to give him more. My sister and mother lived very simply in the country because of it. Artemis never had a season, nor a dowry.\u201d He began walking toward the bed. \u201cBut I grew weary of the aimless days, the expectation of nothing. I was supposed to live my life waiting for the old earl to die.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine him\u2014so physically and mentally active\u2014consigned to waiting on another\u2019s death.</p><p>He\u2019d reached the bed now and he climbed in, sitting up against the headboard and pulling her back to lie on his chest.</p><p>She laid her head on his shoulder, listening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d met some fellows at Oxford who had new theories on gardening. Grand schemes that broke from the medieval idea of straight little lines and ordered plantings. They were thinking in terms of vistas. Of beautiful sights that would last for generations. Of natural lines and shapes\u2014made better. I began corresponding with them while I was in London, exchanging ideas and plans. Then I was hired to help on an estate outside Oxford itself.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her, and she leaned forward to kiss his hand, silently urging him on.</p><p>\u201cIt was a great opportunity,\u201d he said, but his voice was sorrowful. \u201cIt was practical work when before all I\u2019d done was dabble in theory. That garden took a season to build and after that I was recommended to another estate. And then my grandfather found out what I was about.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy would that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he whispered, leaning his cheek against her temple, \u201cremember what I already said? Aristocrats don\u2019t labor. When my grandfather found out, he cut me off. He considered my desire to learn the art of garden planning on a grand scale to be an early sign of the same disease that had driven my father mad. He thought our entire line tainted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Apollo.\u201d She hadn\u2019t much family herself, but to be so harshly judged simply because one had found an interest in life? It seemed ridiculous.</p><p>He nuzzled her hair. \u201cThat day I was in London. I met up with three friends. We resolved to spend the night together\u2014two were from school and I\u2019d not seen them in some years. We reserved the back room of a tavern in Whitechapel and ordered wine and food.\u201d</p><p>She stirred. \u201cWhy such an awful part of London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hadn\u2019t much money, I\u2019m afraid. The tavern was cheap.\u201d</p> <p>He stopped speaking, but she could feel his uneven breaths.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He inhaled. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We shared a bottle\u2014and after that all is blackness. I woke the next morning with my head pounding as if it would split. As soon as I moved I vomited. And then I saw my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApollo?\u201d She tried to twist her face to see him, but he tightened his hold on her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d been drunk before,\u201d he rasped. \u201cBut this was nothing like that. It was as if I were dreaming and couldn\u2019t wake. My hands were covered in blood, I held a knife in my right hand, and there was screaming. I couldn\u2019t stand\u2014when I tried, I fell. And my friends...\u201d</p> <p>She squeezed his hands. She already knew what had happened to his friends. The scene of the murder had been recounted in countless newssheets\u2014and whether the details had been correct hardly mattered at this moment. They\u2019d been murdered.</p><p>Horribly slaughtered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, \u201cso sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe soldiers came,\u201d he murmured, his voice flat now. Had he even heard her? \u201cThey took me away in chains\u2014on my ankles, wrists, and neck, for they were afraid of me. I was taken to Newgate to await trial. I vomited again and again and was half out of my mind for several days. I don\u2019t remember much of Newgate. But I remember Bedlam.\u201d</p><p>She raised his hand, pressing her lips to his palm to keep from blurting that he didn\u2019t have to tell her. For she was very much afraid that he did have to tell her\u2014not for her, but for himself.</p><p>\u201cIt...\u201d He panted for a second, then burst. \u201cThe smell. Like a stable, only the manure is from humans, not horses. They chained me there as well, for I raged, in fear and desperation, for the first days. Until I was too weakened by lack of food and water.\u201d</p> <p>She sobbed, turning swiftly. She could not bear to hear of this\u2014such a strong, good man brought low. Chained like a beast by petty people who didn\u2019t understand him. She knelt on the bed, wrapping her arms around his head, bringing it to her breast, and only then did she feel the wet trails of tears on his face.</p><p>He kissed her between her breasts, a sweet brush of his mouth. \u201cArtemis came when she could. She brought me food and gave all her coin to my attendants\u2014more jailers, in truth\u2014to make sure they wouldn\u2019t beat me to death while she wasn\u2019t there. My father died a year before the murders and our mother passed away in the first month I was in Bedlam. No doubt my incarceration hastened her death. My sister, my brave, proud sister, was forced to become a companion to our cousin.\u201d</p><p>His voice broke.</p><p>She smoothed her palms over his great head, running her fingers through his hair, trying to comfort though she knew she must be failing.</p><p>He turned his face, laying his cheek against her chest. \u201cAt least Artemis had a roof over her head and food aplenty. I lay awake for nights after I received word of our mother\u2019s death, fearful that Artemis would be tossed into the streets. I could do nothing. Nothing. She was\u2014is\u2014my sister. I should\u2019ve been able to protect her, to care for her and make sure she never had to worry, and yet I was helpless. Hardly a man at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Lily murmured, pressing kisses against his hair. She could taste her own tears on her lips now. It wasn\u2019t fair. It wasn\u2019t fair that Apollo\u2014her Apollo\u2014should\u2019ve had to endure such inhumanity.</p><p>\u201cThe things they did there...\u201d His voice was hoarse, broken. \u201cThere was a woman,\u201d he whispered. \u201cA poor mad thing, but she sang in such a lovely voice. One night the keepers came to do her harm and I called to them, mocking them, and they came to me instead.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, her throat clenching in fear. Oh, her brave Apollo! How noble and how foolish to draw the ire of his jailers.</p> <p>\u201cThey beat me until I passed out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was when I lost my voice. Afterwards\u2014after I was rescued by the Duke of Wakefield, after, when I lay abed, regaining my strength, though not my voice, I thought of her. I went back one night, but she was already gone. Some fever had taken her. Perhaps it was for the best.\u201d</p><p>She looked down and saw that he\u2019d closed his eyes, though his brow was knit fiercely.</p><p>\u201cBut I made sure that guard\u2014the one who\u2019d meant to harm her, the one who\u2019d led my beating\u2014could harm no one ever again. I dragged him from that place and gave him to a press-gang. Wherever he is now, he\u2019s not around women. I never would\u2019ve done that before. Bedlam changed me.\u201d</p><p>They had taken away something very important from him when he\u2019d been made helpless. It should\u2019ve broken him, being forced into chains. Yet it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Even in her grief she was amazed.</p><p>She framed his face with her hands, tilting it up so she could look in his eyes. \u201cYou survived. You endured and survived.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved bitterly. \u201cI had no choice.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s always a choice. You could\u2019ve given up, let them take your soul and mind, but you didn\u2019t. You persevered. I think you are the bravest man I have ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think, then, that you\u2019ve not met many men,\u201d he whispered. His voice was light, but his face still held the years of tragedy.</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him, not as a lover, but almost platonically, to acknowledge all that he was. Her lips brushed his forehead, both cheeks, and finally his mouth. Softly. A benediction.</p><p>\u201cLet us sleep,\u201d she said, and helped him to lie down on the bed.</p><p>She arranged the covers over both of them and then laid her head upon his chest, listening to the beat of his heart: ba-thump ba-thump ba-thump.</p><p>And that was how she fell asleep.</p><p>APOLLO WOKE TO the realization that he\u2019d overslept. When he\u2019d worked in the garden, he\u2019d awoken as the birds had heralded the rising sun. But here inside, in a soft bed with a softer, warm woman against his side, he found it harder to brush away the tendrils of sleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lily mumbled as he gently removed her arm from his belly.</p><p>He\u2019d like to linger longer. To kiss her awake and make love to her again, but it was only a matter of time before the servants descended on the room. Besides, the sooner he left, the less likely that he\u2019d run into other guests.</p><p>So he dressed quickly as she sighed and rolled to burrow into the warm spot he\u2019d left.</p><p>Apollo gathered his coat and gave a last glance around the room before bending to kiss her again on the lips.</p><p>Her brow wrinkled ferociously and she cracked her eyelids to mutter, \u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Evidently she wasn\u2019t an alert waker. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>Her only reply was an unfeminine grunt as she pulled a pillow over her head.</p><p>The smile still lingered as he crept into the hall and gently shut the door behind him.</p><p>He caught a movement out of the corner of his eye and turned to look to his right. Had someone just disappeared around the corner at the end of the corridor? Or had the movement been imagined?</p><p>Apollo narrowed his eyes, thinking, but in the end decided that even if he\u2019d seen someone, most likely it had been a servant at this time of the morning.</p><p>He turned in the other direction\u2014only to find the Duke of Montgomery watching him.</p><p>He prevented himself from starting only by sheer willpower. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought you an early riser, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Montgomery cocked his head. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ve slept?\u201d</p><p>Apollo examined the other man. He was perfectly groomed in a bloodred suit, pumps, and clocked hose. His golden hair had been swept back into an elegant tail, the ends curled. Or perhaps his hair curled naturally. In any case, Apollo felt like a rat next to a sleek greyhound.</p><p>Not that he cared in particular.</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d he asked curiously, approaching the other man. \u201cSlept?\u201d</p><p>A secret smile curled the duke\u2019s lips. \u201cI find sleep a bore\u2014especially when I might spend the nocturnal hours in more... pleasurable pursuits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Apollo fell into step with the other man. He had no idea where the duke was headed, but he himself was bent on the breakfast room in search of strong coffee.</p><p>God, he hoped his uncle provided coffee for his guests.</p><p>\u201cMorning is the best time to discover the inhabitants of a house sneaking out of bedrooms not their own.\u201d The duke gave him an entirely too-innocent look. \u201cAs you were doing just now from Miss Goodfellow\u2019s room. I now understand your ire yesterday at the unexpected sight of her.\u201d</p><p>Apollo glared. \u201cI\u2019ll thank you not to spread my connection to her about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d Montgomery looked honestly puzzled and Apollo repressed an urge to punch the man in the nose. \u201cWhat good is knowledge if one shares it with everyone?\u201d</p><p>Anything he answered would only provide fuel for Montgomery\u2019s scheming, so Apollo changed the subject. \u201cHave you discovered anything of interest in your sneaking about, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSneaking sounds so very... bad.\u201d Montgomery sniffed as they descended the stairs.</p><p>Apollo looked at him.</p><p>\u201cVery well!\u201d The duke threw up his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t lose your temper, I don\u2019t know if I could withstand your hamlike fists. I\u2019ve discovered that Mrs. Jellett has a rather handsome, rather young footman she brings everywhere, that Mr. William Greaves has a valet who spent most of his youth in Newgate, that Mr. and Mrs. Warner, despite their newly wedded bliss, keep separate bedrooms\u2014although I\u2019d suspected that already\u201d\u2014the smile he gave was rather nasty\u2014\u201cand that Lady Herrick has a birthmark in the shape of a butterfly on her left buttock. Oh, and that said birthmark turns an interesting shade of lavender when slapped.\u201d</p><p>Apollo stopped in the hallway outside the breakfast room and simply stared at his companion.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Montgomery looked irritated. \u201cI defy any man to not take the opportunity when presented to slap a lovely arse.\u201d</p><p>Apollo sighed and continued walking. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>The duke frowned for a moment before supplying, \u201cMiss Royle dislikes me exceedingly.\u201d</p><p>Apollo arched an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019d think any number of young ladies dislike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they do,\u201d the duke replied carelessly. \u201cThat\u2019s not the interesting part. The interesting part is that I seem to care one way or the other. It\u2019s rather fascinating, truth be told.\u201d</p><p>Apollo rolled his eyes at the man\u2019s vanity. \u201cYou\u2019ve collected a quantity of knowledge, Your Grace, and none of it is in any way helpful to my case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but one never knows,\u201d the duke replied. \u201cKnowledge has a strange way of becoming applicable at the oddest moments. It\u2019s why I take care to gather any and all information, no matter how trivial it may seem at first. But never fear: we\u2019ve only been at the house party for less than a day and I anticipate more discoveries today.\u201d</p><p>Apollo\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you know?\u201d Montgomery had that look of amusement that Apollo was beginning to loathe. \u201cAdditional guests arrived late last night.\u201d</p><p>And he threw open the door to the breakfast room, revealing Edwin Stump, his mouth full of toast.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Edwin that Apollo stared at. There were two other people in the room\u2014a rather plain but gentle-faced lady and, beside her, a big man with an olive complexion, a scowl twisting his features. He had one green eye and one blue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beside him Montgomery went very still before whispering, in a tone of delight, like a little boy offered a huge bag of sweets, \u201cOh, how utterly wonderful!\u201d</p><p>LILY WATCHED FROM a chair later that morning as Stanford struck a pose and declaimed, \u201c \u2018An\u2019 if ever I see my daughter in such a position again, mark me well, gentlemen, I shall\u2019... er...\u201d</p><p>He sneaked a glance at Lily, who didn\u2019t have to refer to the pages in her hand. After all, she\u2019d written A Wastrel Reform\u2019d. \u201c \u2018Disembowel the deceiver,\u2019 \u201d she said, supplying the rest of the line.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Disembowel the deceiver.\u2019 \u2018Disembowel the deceiver,\u2019 \u201d Stanford muttered to himself before nodding and resuming his pose. \u201c \u2018I shall disembowel the deceiver so that ne\u2019er again may he so deceive again.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>Lily winced. It wasn\u2019t exactly her best line, but then she\u2019d written the second half of the play in only one week. Her first play had taken a year to write.</p><p>Of course, she\u2019d burned it after that.</p><p>\u201cDarlings!\u201d</p><p>She turned at the voice and stared, hardly believing her eyes. Edwin stood in the doorway, arms thrown wide, in a new sky-blue satin suit, apparently expecting his usual welcome.</p><p>Well, and she supposed he had cause to. Moll and the other actresses rushed to him, Moll cooing over him. Stanford and John approached more slowly, but they were equally admiring in their own way.</p> <p>Ridiculous to pout. No one but her and her brother knew that she was the real playwright.</p><p>\u201cRobin, sweetheart,\u201d Edwin called, strutting toward her.</p><p>Lily repressed the urge to roll her eyes at him. He was always careful to call her by her stage name in the company of others, even when all the other actors knew quite well what her real name was.</p><p>She submitted to a buss on her cheek and then smiled sweetly at him. \u201cMight I have a moment of your time, brother dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d He glanced about to let the other actors know what a doting older brother he was.</p><p>\u201cAlone.\u201d</p> <p>The first inkling that something might not be right seemed to seep into his eyes. \u201cErm... certainly.\u201d</p><p>She rose, set down the pages, and led him into the small antechamber, closing the door quite firmly behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d he began, but she cut him off quite satisfyingly with a slap across his face.</p><p>\u201cLily!\u201d His eyes were wide and hurt, his hand to the side of his face.</p><p>She set her hands on her hips. \u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018Lily\u2019 me, Edwin Stump!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he tried.</p><p>So she slapped him again. \u201cYou set the soldiers on Apollo. They might\u2019ve taken him to Bedlam\u2014or hanged him. All because you were miffed that he\u2019d thrown you out of the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t miffed,\u201d he said, drawing himself up and straightening his white wig, which had become rather askew. \u201cI was worried about your safety.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy safety?\u201d She knew her mouth was agape, but she just couldn\u2019t help it. Edwin could be such a prize ass sometimes\u2014and what was worse, he seemed to be under the delusion that she was a simpleton. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he is.\u201d Edwin backed up a step. \u201cA deranged killer! Everyone has heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not a deranged killer,\u201d she said very, very softly as she crowded Edwin into a corner of the room. \u201cAnd you know it quite well. You\u2019re being spiteful\u2014and you\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already opened his mouth for a retort, but his eyebrows drew together at that. \u201cWhat? Hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, hurting me, Edwin,\u201d she said patiently. \u201cI like Lord Kilbourne, and I find your cruelty toward him\u2014and me\u2014quite unforgivable. He\u2019s here, at this house party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed him just now in the breakfast room,\u201d Edwin said sulkily. \u201cHe\u2019s taken the ridiculous name Mr. Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here to look for the real murderer. I don\u2019t want you to even think about turning him in again, do you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d He gulped. \u201cBut Lily...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even accidentally, Edwin.\u201d</p><p>He dipped his chin, looking a bit shocked. \u201cYes, very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She turned to go because anything else she said at this point would not be conducive to a good future relationship with her brother, but Edwin caught her arm.</p><p>\u201cLily...\u201d He cleared his throat nervously. \u201cI think I ought to warn you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and saw his forehead was shining with sweat. A feeling of sick dread settled low in her belly. Had he already told someone about Apollo? \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cRichard Perry, Baron Ross is here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>For at the heart of the labyrinth was a wild and beautiful garden. Vines climbed over tumbled stones, so worn they might\u2019ve fallen millennia ago. Gnarled trees twisted between the stones, branches thrust upward and covered in emerald leaves. At the center of the clearing lay a still, blue pool with small white and yellow flowers scattered along its mossy bank. But the monster lay there as well, sprawled half in the pool, his blood dyeing the waters red...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>Apollo strode into the drawing room where the actors had decided to put on their play. They were gathered there, Moll Bennet at one end with her arms raised as she spoke her lines. She glanced at him as he entered, winked, and jerked her head in the direction of a small door to the side of the room.</p><p>He nodded as he changed his course for the door. He and Moll had become friends the night before when he\u2019d talked her into abandoning the room she shared with Lily.</p><p>He could hear voices as he drew near. Lily saying, \u201c... Indio...\u201d and Edwin hissing in reply.</p><p>Apollo pulled the door open sharply and Edwin Stump nearly fell into his arms. He pushed the man back inside, stepped in, and shut the door behind him.</p><p>Lily was in the corner, looking rather pale, but he kept his gaze on Edwin. \u201cSay one word about me or my past and you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Edwin held up his hands defensively. \u201cNo need, my sister has already made all the threats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she?\u201d Apollo stepped closer because he didn\u2019t like how Lily looked. What had her weasel of a brother said to her? \u201cI\u2019m sure she was most thorough, but I still wish to make myself clear. Whatever she might\u2019ve threatened you with, know this: I don\u2019t like you. Hurt her or me and you\u2019ll regret it to the end of your days.\u201d</p><p>Edwin\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbled in his throat. \u201cQuite. Yes... erm... that\u2019s very clear, I think.\u201d He darted a glance at Lily and for the first time Apollo saw a trace of regret in the man\u2019s face. \u201cBut you must know I\u2019d never do anything to hurt my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>Edwin glanced down. \u201cPerhaps... there\u2019s something you should know.\u201d</p><p>Apollo narrowed his eyes, not trusting the other man a whit.</p><p>\u201cLily told me that you\u2019re looking for the man who might\u2019ve murdered your friends. That is, I suppose, if you didn\u2019t do it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Apollo bit out.</p><p>Edwin blinked rapidly, backing into the wall. \u201cYes, of course, we all know that, don\u2019t we, Lily?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, speaking for the first time. \u201cHe didn\u2019t, Edwin.\u201d</p><p>His brows knit as if her calm assurance confused him. \u201cAll right, all right. It\u2019s just that I saw you come into the breakfast room with the Duke of Montgomery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Apollo said. \u201cHis Grace is helping me.\u201d</p><p>Edwin shrugged, looking shifty. \u201cBut is he, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lily frowned. \u201cDo speak plainly, Edwin, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to!\u201d Oddly he looked wounded by his sister\u2019s words. \u201cThe duke likes to collect information\u2014things other people would rather keep hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying he\u2019s a blackmailer,\u201d Apollo said.</p><p>Edwin grimaced. \u201cNothing that unrefined. More of a manipulator, perhaps. But it doesn\u2019t do to let one\u2019s secrets fall into his hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d Apollo replied drily.</p><p>\u201cI think you haven\u2019t realized you\u2019re already in his hands,\u201d Edwin shot back. \u201cHe knows you\u2019re an escaped murderer\u2014\u201d He held up his hands as Lily sputtered a protest. \u201cYes, all right, an accused escaped murderer. What reason does he have to help you when he has such a hold over you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no money,\u201d Apollo replied. \u201cHe had nothing to gain from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that you have only monetary things to lose,\u201d Edwin said. \u201cSome things of value have no price.\u201d</p><p>Apollo felt a bead of sweat run down his spine. Without taking his eyes from the other man, he instinctively held out his hand to Lily.</p><p>Lily clasped his fingers and stared at her brother, her face shuttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to warn you,\u201d Edwin huffed and actually turned to Apollo for help.</p><p>Apollo raised one eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Edwin drew himself up with martyred pride. \u201cIf you\u2019re quite done with me?\u201d</p><p>Apollo waved at the door, but made no move to step aside, making Edwin brush nervously against him as he went for it.</p><p>Edwin turned with his hand on the doorknob. \u201cLily, I...\u201d</p><p>She waited, but when he said no more, she simply sighed. \u201cJust go, Edwin.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and opened the door.</p><p>The moment it was shut again, with only the two of them inside the little room, Apollo turned to Lily and looked at her with concern. \u201cWho,\u201d he asked softly, \u201cis Lord Ross?\u201d</p><p>THE THING WAS, Lily had never had to make this choice before. Indio had always\u2014naturally\u2014come first. Before Edwin, even before Maude, it was Indio she looked after, Indio she cared for. Because he was a child\u2014her child\u2014and therefore the most vulnerable.</p><p>But was that true anymore?</p><p>She tilted her head back, staring at Apollo. He wore the same suit as yesterday, but at some point this morning, he\u2019d taken time to club his hair back.</p><p>Frankly, she preferred it the way it\u2019d been last night\u2014wild and about his shoulders.</p><p>He meant something to her. She couldn\u2019t hide from that fact. She\u2019d slept with Apollo\u2014the first man she\u2019d taken as a lover since before she\u2019d become Indio\u2019s mother. Even now, as he challenged her with soft words and sympathetic eyes, she was aware of his body. Of the breadth of his shoulders, the scent of his skin, so close in the little room. It wasn\u2019t fair. She\u2019d been so careful, so very wary, and he\u2019d broken through her barriers without even trying\u2014or so it seemed.</p><p>She folded her arms in front of her breasts, trying to keep some space between them. If she didn\u2019t take care, he\u2019d surround and overtake her, make her forget what mattered most and what was at stake.</p><p>Indio.</p><p>Indio was vulnerable. She must protect him.</p><p>And like that the decision was made.</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cRichard Perry, Lord Ross is a wealthy gentleman\u2014an aristocrat like you.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth as if he wanted to refute the comparison, but he couldn\u2019t, really, could he?</p><p>Apollo was an aristocrat. Richard was an aristocrat. These two things were facts, simple and true.</p><p>She drew strength from that. \u201cHe\u2019s married with children, I believe. Two sons? I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen him in years.\u201d And for that she was very glad.</p><p>He took a step closer and despite her folded arms, she could no longer keep herself entirely apart from him. His body heat invaded her skin\u2014her very bones. He said, \u201cHe has one green eye and one blue one. Like Indio.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took a careful breath. \u201cYes. He\u2019s Indio\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows drew together\u2014not in condemnation but in puzzlement. \u201cLily, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoss doesn\u2019t know,\u201d she said bluntly.</p><p>He looked at her in question.</p> <p>\u201cI never told him.\u201d She stared at him, trying to convey this one truth. \u201cIt\u2019s important, very important, that he not know about Indio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold herself together anymore. The danger was too close. She grabbed his arm with both hands. \u201cApollo, please, please promise me you\u2019ll not mention Indio, or... or any suggestion that I have a child, to Richard.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cOf course.\u201d He frowned down at her hands and slowly took them in his own. \u201cDid he hurt you? Because if he hurt you, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She almost laughed\u2014though not in amusement. \u201cYou have no need to play my protector. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be happy if you said anything at all to Richard about me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was your lover.\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull her hands away, but he wouldn\u2019t let her. \u201cIs that what all this is about? Jealousy? God, I can\u2019t believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>He did an odd thing then, something that startled her into silence: he laughed, a bitter, tormented sound.</p><p>\u201cJealousy,\u201d he grated, pulling her close, pulling her into his arms, though she struggled to get away. \u201cI would that it were something as easy, as simple, as mere jealousy.\u201d He bent and murmured against her mouth, his lips caressing her with each word. \u201cThis is far more awful than jealousy.\u201d</p><p>And then he was devouring her mouth, his breath hot and tasting of the coffee he must\u2019ve drunk when he\u2019d broken his fast. She wished, suddenly, that she might\u2019ve been there when he had. That she could\u2019ve watched those strong, unlovely lips sip at a cup, that she could\u2019ve seen his throat move as he swallowed toast or eggs or gammon or whatever he\u2019d consumed at that meal. She wanted to be there with him whenever he ate, whenever he rose, whenever he went to bed. She wanted to watch as he let himself go, as he succumbed to slumber and dreams. She wanted to see him shave. To find out if he raised his chin and stroked upward with the razor as she\u2019d once seen Edwin do when she was very little.</p><p>She wanted... oh, dear God! She wanted everything. She wanted him.</p> <p>And in that moment she forgot resolve and carefully plotted plans and all else. Her vision, her mouth, her very being were filled, simply and completely, with Apollo Greaves.</p><p>She opened her lips, desperate for him as if she hadn\u2019t seen him for years, when he\u2019d risen from her bed only hours before. She bit at him, whimpering.</p><p>He caressed her face, murmuring, \u201cShhh.\u201d</p><p>There were others nearby, she knew that somewhere in a part of her brain that still worked, but it really didn\u2019t matter to her. She clutched at his shoulders, his hair, wanting him naked with her. Wanting him to be Caliban, not Apollo.</p><p>He lifted her suddenly, setting her on a table nearby, which wobbled under her weight.</p><p>He cursed softly and tossed her skirts up, thrusting his hand underneath. He gave her no warning, no gentle persuasion. His fingers were at her mound, blunt and unhesitating. He traced through her folds, spreading and exploring, as if he had every right. Claiming her sex as he\u2019d claimed her mouth.</p><p>She groaned and he broke away to admonish, \u201cHush!\u201d against her cheek.</p><p>Then his thumb found her clitoris and he was pressing against her, moving in small, devastating circles.</p> <p>She bit into his shoulder.</p><p>He bent and licked her throat.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he breathed. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>And then he took away his hand and she growled at him.</p><p>He laughed, low and sensuously, and flipped open his falls. He shoved between her thighs, making the table shake, spreading her thighs even wider to give himself room.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she hissed. \u201cThe table will break.\u201d</p><p>He simply looked at her, grinned, and thrust.</p><p>She grabbed his upper arms as he entered her, rough, sudden, searingly hot\u2014and so good she had to bite his shoulder again.</p><p>\u201cSomeday,\u201d he panted as he thrust again, his cock stretching her, filling her, \u201cI\u2019m going to take you in a place where you don\u2019t have to be quiet. Where I can hear all your moans and little squeaks. Where I can make you scream.\u201d</p><p>And he seated himself fully, his pelvis pressed to hers, her skirts in a wadded mess between them.</p><p>He started to withdraw slowly and she pounded on his back with both fists. \u201cMove!\u201d</p><p>He braced one hand on her hip and one on the wall and thrust in again, making the table knock against the wall.</p><p>Her eyes widened, and she gasped. He was hitting her just there, and it was marvelous, but at the same time the table\u2019s knocking would bring someone soon. She groaned. She didn\u2019t want to end this but there was no lock on the door.</p><p>\u201cPut your legs around me,\u201d he huffed in her ear, humid and hot.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll hear us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d he groaned, \u201cplease do it, love.\u201d</p><p>The endearment jolted through her, going straight to where he still shoved into her.</p><p>She wrapped her legs around him, as high as she could, and as she did, he grasped her bottom in both his hands and lifted her. She clung to him, impaled on his penis, the position so obscene she should\u2019ve fainted from just the thought.</p><p>Instead she nearly came.</p><p>He leaned his shoulders back against the wall and moved his big hands to her waist. She watched as his eyes shuttered, his face going slack with sensuous want as he lifted and lowered her on his cock, using her as a tool to pleasure himself.</p><p>Each pull upward was a draw against her most sensitive flesh. Each jolt down a powerful slam of pleasure.</p><p>He was driving her insane, driving her with need, and she wasn\u2019t sure she could keep from screaming.</p><p>He must\u2019ve known her peril, for his eyes opened, his pupils large and black, and he looked at her. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t do it himself, she realized. He was using all his strength to keep them both upright against the wall.</p><p>She leaned forward, feeling like a doll in his strong arms, and placed her closed lips against his, a chaste, gentle kiss, even as his flesh plundered hers below. She was swollen and wet, so heated with want that she wasn\u2019t sure it could ever end. Maybe she didn\u2019t want it to end. Maybe she wanted him to fill her forever, to just keep ramming her with that long, thick, perfect cock until she became insensible. He could thrust into her all night long and when she woke he\u2019d still be screwing her, his body hard and everlasting, hers wet and wanting.</p><p>But it couldn\u2019t last forever, that was a fevered fantasy born of heat and his smell, and when he began losing his rhythm, she reached between them, pinching her clitoris with two fingers.</p><p>He watched her, his lips curled. \u201cYou... you\u2019re...\u201d</p><p>She leaned close and whispered against his sweaty neck. \u201cI\u2019m touching myself. Pleasuring myself as you fuck me.\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth and the tendon in his neck stood out in stark relief.</p><p>She felt his come flooding her, seeping out around his penis.</p><p>And when she climaxed herself, she bit down on that tendon, tasting salt. Tasting life.</p><p>GREAVES HOUSE WAS a dreary mansion.</p><p>Trevillion looked up at the darkened edifice as he helped Lady Phoebe and her elderly cousin, Miss Bathilda Picklewood, from their carriage. Only one lantern was lit at the door\u2014either from miserliness or because their host wasn\u2019t particularly welcoming.</p><p>\u201cOof,\u201d Miss Picklewood muttered as she made the gravel drive. \u201cWell, \u2019tisn\u2019t a lovely place, but I expect the play shall be quite good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was very nice of Mr. Greaves to invite us,\u201d Lady Phoebe chided. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know us and I\u2019m sure it was merely a courtesy to Hippolyta. Actually, it\u2019s a lovely coincidence that he even found out we were staying in Bath.\u201d</p><p>Miss Picklewood darted an arch glance at Trevillion as she took Lady Phoebe\u2019s arm. \u201cYes, quite a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother replying as he followed the ladies. Miss Picklewood was a disconcertingly perceptive lady for her age and he\u2019d had the feeling for quite some time now that she\u2019d be formidable should the need arise.</p><p>The door was opened by a fawning butler who took the ladies\u2019 wraps before showing them into a first-floor drawing room. This room at least was brightly lit\u2014dozens of candles fluttered at their entrance, mounted on chandeliers, and candelabra were set here and there on tables. One end of the room had been cleared to serve as a stage, with a trio of musicians in the corner. Several rows of chairs faced the area. A dozen or so guests were already seated in the chairs, chattering as they waited for the play to begin.</p><p>A man some sixty years of age approached them. \u201cAh, Lady Phoebe, I presume?\u201d</p><p>His voice was very loud and he was looking at Miss Picklewood.</p><p>Lady Phoebe\u2019s smile was a bit strained. \u201cYes, I am she. Mr. William Greaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, my lady,\u201d he replied, still loud.</p><p>\u201cMay I present my dear cousin, Miss Bathilda Picklewood? And this is Captain Trevillion.\u201d</p><p>Trevillion noted with amusement that Lady Phoebe didn\u2019t bother explaining his presence. Their host bowed to Miss Picklewood and turned to him, his eyes widening when he saw the pistols Trevillion wore upon his chest. \u201cOh... er... most welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Trevillion replied.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be a ball after the play\u2014a sort of midnight festivity. I hope you\u2019ll be able to attend, Lady Phoebe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Phoebe will be returning to her home after the play,\u201d Trevillion replied for her, earning himself a glare from his charge. It couldn\u2019t be helped, however. A seated performance was one thing. A dance at a stranger\u2019s house was another. Wakefield wouldn\u2019t like it\u2014and Wakefield paid his wages.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, let me show you to your seats,\u201d Greaves said, indicating two empty chairs at the front row. \u201cMiss Royle said that she was friends with you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed.\u201d Lady Phoebe smiled.</p><p>A dark-haired lady next to the empty chairs turned and waved at their approach.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware, however... that is, I\u2019ll have a footman fetch another chair,\u201d Greaves mumbled.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Trevillion said briskly. \u201cLet the ladies sit amongst friends. I\u2019m quite happy to find my own seat.\u201d</p><p>Greaves nodded gratefully and led the ladies to their places.</p><p>Which left Trevillion free to slip into place in the empty chair beside Kilbourne at the back.</p><p>\u201cI see you found a way to attend,\u201d Kilbourne said, low.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Trevillion watched as Greaves fussed over Lady Phoebe\u2019s seat. \u201cLady Phoebe enjoys the theater in whatever form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd had she not?\u201d</p><p>Trevillion glanced at the viscount. \u201cHad she not, I would\u2019ve found another way to meet with you. I wouldn\u2019t force her to attend an event she didn\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant no offense,\u201d Kilbourne said.</p><p>Trevillion inclined his head, his mouth thinned. \u201cHave you discovered anything yet?\u201d</p><p>Kilbourne hesitated, but shook his head. \u201cNot as of yet. I\u2019d hoped to search my uncle\u2019s rooms, but haven\u2019t found the right moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore guests mean more servants about,\u201d Trevillion replied. \u201cYet you hesitated before you spoke, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Kilbourne grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. The duke mentioned this morning that my uncle has a valet who spent time in Newgate\u2014an odd origin for a manservant, you must admit.\u201d</p><p>Trevillion shrugged. That was the thing about London: a man could completely remake himself.</p><p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d Kilbourne continued, \u201cMiss Goodfellow\u2019s brother took care to warn me that we couldn\u2019t trust Montgomery.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trevillion snorted softly. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing new, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, yet now I wonder if the man is actively working against us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d</p><p>Kilbourne gave him a sardonic glance. \u201cFor what purpose does he work for us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said so that you may finish his garden,\u201d Trevillion replied, \u201cbut I take your point.\u201d</p><p>Kilbourne glanced at him. \u201cHave you found out anything about my cousin? Could he be the one behind the murders, not my uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Trevillion stated. \u201cHe lives rather frugally, in fact. It\u2019s only his father who is in debt.\u201d</p><p>Kilbourne shook his head. \u201cShould I trust Miss Goodfellow\u2019s brother? Or Montgomery? Or neither?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Point the brother out to me.\u201d</p> <p>Kilbourne looked around. \u201cThere. He\u2019s just come in the door with Montgomery.\u201d</p><p>Trevillion turned discreetly and saw a wiry man in a white wig a step behind the duke. On the other side was the Scots architect they\u2019d met in the garden\u2014MacLeish. \u201cStrange that he should warn you against the duke and then keep his company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Kilbourne murmured in assent. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to think what Montgomery gets out of all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that he wants you for his garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d Kilbourne shrugged. \u201cBut I\u2019m hardly the only gardener he could hire. There has to be another reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably doesn\u2019t do anything but for a minimum of at least two things to his advantage.\u201d Trevillion stiffened as he watched Montgomery approach Lady Phoebe. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten the obvious: rank. Lady Phoebe, as the daughter and sister of a duke, was most likely the highest-ranking lady in the room. And since Montgomery was a duke and thus the highest-ranking gentleman, naturally he\u2019d be seated next to her.</p><p>Trevillion nearly growled. \u201cI don\u2019t like him near my charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll hardly do anything in a crowded room,\u201d Kilbourne said. \u201cBesides, she has her chaperone. That one looks a Tartar.\u201d</p><p>Trevillion grunted, not liking having to leave Lady Phoebe\u2019s protection to an old woman, no matter how sharp.</p><p>The musicians began a tune, prompting the audience to quiet. After a moment an actor strode in with Miss Goodfellow and began an argument\u2014something about a maid he wanted to woo. The male actor was apparently her twin brother.</p><p>A farce. Not to his taste\u2014theater seldom was. Trevillion fixed his eyes on his charge instead, surprised to see that Montgomery had switched chairs with his architect friend. The younger man now sat next to Lady Phoebe, his red head close to hers.</p><p>Trevillion frowned and turned to Kilbourne, but one look showed that was a lost cause.</p> <p>The viscount\u2019s gaze was riveted on Miss Goodfellow.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Ariadne thought at first to flee, but the monster made neither move nor sound. At last, gathering her courage, she ventured near. He lay facedown and nude, his massive arms outstretched among the innocent flowers, his lower limbs in the water. Blood flowed from numerous cuts to his legs and torso. His bull\u2019s head was turned to the side, and as she stared, he opened his eye...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>He\u2019d made love to her, but he\u2019d never truly seen her, Apollo realized as he watched Lily on stage. She\u2019d changed the dress she\u2019d initially appeared in to breeches and a coat, her dark hair hidden under a man\u2019s white wig. Anyone with half a brain could see she was a woman disguised as a man, but the point wasn\u2019t to fool the audience, but rather to entice it.</p><p>And entice she did.</p><p>Lily was... he stared in wonder. He didn\u2019t have the words to describe the spell she cast over the room. It was as if she\u2019d caught and channeled light, a prism of delight. She was quick and bright and he found himself leaning forward, to catch a little of her illumination. He wanted her to speak to him, only him. To hold her attention as she held his.</p><p>The damnable thing was, he knew he wasn\u2019t the only one. Everyone in the audience wanted a small part of Robin Goodfellow for their very own. As a friend to confide in. As a lover to shower with affection. He was half hard simply watching her swirl about the stage, flinging quips at the male actor who was supposed to be her rival. How was it possible that he\u2019d been inside her only that morning and now he felt as if he knew her not at all?</p><p>He watched as she leaned a little closer to the actor, flirting with her mischievous green eyes, and he was half admiring, half outraged that she would look at any other man that way.</p><p>Every man in the room must have an erection.</p><p>Apollo swallowed, trying to lean back, trying to break from her spell, only to find that he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one.</p><p>He watched as his elderly uncle blushed when she bit her lip and glanced over her shoulder at the audience.</p><p>Dear God, but she was dangerous.</p><p>He was a great ugly lump, he knew this. He\u2019d always been, ever since the day when he\u2019d been but fifteen and he\u2019d topped his own father\u2019s height. How could such a mercurial fairylike creature want anything to do with him? And yet she had. She\u2019d let him touch her intimately. Had let him claim her.</p><p>In that moment Apollo resolved that no matter how ridiculous their mating might be, he wasn\u2019t going to let her change her mind. She was his now\u2014and if he had any say in the matter, she\u2019d be his always.</p><p>THE PLAY HAD gone well, Lily thought later as she sat before a looking glass and washed the paint from her face. True, Stanford had managed to forget an entire speech in the third act, and the boy playing the overly handsome valet was much too prone to trying to upstage the other actors playing with him, but Moll had delivered her lines with graceful humor touched with ribaldry and John had been so handsome and chivalrous she\u2019d nearly fallen in love with him herself. Yes, overall a great success.</p><p>\u201cAbout done, dear?\u201d Moll called, turning in front of her own little looking glass to try to see her hair from behind. \u201cI\u2019ve a mind to dance with that pretty duke tonight\u2014and have a glass or two of Mr. Greaves\u2019s wine. I hope it\u2019s good.\u201d She winked at Lily. \u201cNot that it\u2019ll stop me if it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Lily laughed. \u201cGo ahead. I still have to re-pin my hair.\u201d</p><p>Moll twirled one last time and left.</p><p>Lily smiled into her mirror. It made no sense, but she wanted to look her best for Apollo. He\u2019d never seen her perform before and she was a bit nervous about his reaction. Had he liked the play? Had he recognized the lines that she\u2019d written in the garden with his help?</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at herself. Silly. If she didn\u2019t hurry, she\u2019d miss the ball and then her primping would have been for naught.</p><p>In the silence of the little chamber off the drawing room she heard footsteps approaching. Hurriedly she pushed a last pin into her coiffure and stood, smiling as the door opened.</p><p>Her smile froze on her face when she saw who entered.</p><p>Lord Ross hadn\u2019t changed much in seven and a half years. He still had a stiff, nearly military bearing. He still wore a properly curled and powdered white wig. He still had a flat stomach and big shoulders. And he still had one blue eye and one green.</p><p>But the lines around his mouth and eyes had deepened and multiplied and his mouth seemed permanently turned down now.</p><p>Perhaps cruelty could stamp itself upon a man\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cLily Stump,\u201d he drawled, his voice smooth and light. Apollo\u2019s voice would never sound like that, she knew. His voice would always grate, no matter how much his throat healed.</p><p>And she was glad.</p><p>\u201cRichard,\u201d she replied evenly.</p><p>\u201cLord Ross, if you please,\u201d he snapped, and although his voice didn\u2019t rise, her gaze darted to his hands.</p><p>They had half-fisted.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMy lord, then. How may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said, prowling into the room, \u201ccan help me by staying out of my way and remaining quiet.\u201d</p><p>She pivoted so that he wouldn\u2019t back her into the corner. The little room held only two tiny tables and a single chair, her box of paints, and the costumes. But there was the looking glass. If she had to, she could break it. The edges would be sharp.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cSwear it,\u201d he said, advancing.</p><p>She ducked and darted around him. There was a pull and a tearing sound and then she was out of his grasp and out the door, running with her skirts bunched in her fists.</p><p>\u201cLily Stump!\u201d he roared behind her, but she\u2019d be a fool to stop.</p><p>And she was no fool.</p><p>She skidded around a corner, nearly barreling into a wide-eyed footman.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d he asked, clearly surprised.</p><p>\u201cI do beg your pardon,\u201d she gasped, smoothing her skirts. One wasn\u2019t supposed to apologize to servants, she knew, but to hell with that. She smiled at the man\u2014really just a very tall boy. \u201cWhere is the ball being held?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the stairs. \u201cGround floor, ma\u2019am. Shall I show you?\u201d</p><p>She beamed at him. \u201cThat would be lovely.\u201d</p><p>Lily followed the strapping footman down the staircase, never looking back, and now that she was no longer running with her heart beating in her ears, she could hear the music playing.</p><p>He bowed at the entrance of the ballroom and she gave him a quick grin in thanks before entering.</p><p>The room was lit with dozens of beeswax candles. They, together with the vases of hothouse roses placed around the room, perfumed the air with a sweet stink that was nearly unbearable. It was terribly hot and she wished she had a fan. A glance around showed that Mr. Greaves must have invited quite a few of his neighbors as well as the house party guests, for the ballroom was crowded. She\u2019d hardly taken a step before Mr. Warner appeared before her, asking for a dance.</p><p>She was put out\u2014she\u2019d hoped to find Apollo\u2014but she made sure not to let that show on her face. This was part of her job, after all, to entertain the guests.</p><p>So she danced a country dance with Mr. Warner, and then another with Mr. MacLeish. By that time she had caught a glimpse of Richard, glowering by the ballroom doors, and decided to head in the opposite direction\u2014toward the wall of French doors that led out to the garden. She was glancing over her shoulder to make sure Richard wasn\u2019t following her when she felt a hand on her wrist.</p><p>She was hauled rather unceremoniously onto the slate steps that ran along the back of the house and led into the darkened garden itself.</p><p>Lily squeaked and looked up.</p><p>Into Apollo\u2019s shadowed face.</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d was, unfortunately, all she could think of to say.</p><p>\u201cYou look frightened,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She smoothed her skirts. \u201cYou did just yank me out of the ballroom. Practically a kidnap.\u201d</p><p>In the light from the ballroom she thought she saw his lips twitch. \u201cIf I\u2019d wanted to kidnap you, I\u2019d\u2019ve thrown you over my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>She drew herself up. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019d let you?\u201d</p><p>He moved his fingers to her hand and clasped it. \u201cOh, you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite sure of yourself.\u201d She sniffed.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He pulled gently, leading her down the steps. \u201cI liked your play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She could feel herself blushing like a green girl. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She caught the flash of his teeth as he grinned back at her.</p><p>Although the French doors had been open, the party wasn\u2019t meant to spill into the garden, so there were no lanterns. There was a moment beyond the light coming from the windows of the house, in the dark of the garden itself, when she felt quite blind.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI discovered something this afternoon.\u201d His voice floated back to her on the night breeze. \u201cI wanted to show you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was rather cool and if she hadn\u2019t just been running and then dancing, it might\u2019ve been too cold, but as it was, the night chill was rather nice on her overheated skin.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he whispered as her slippered feet trod on grass. \u201cWe\u2019ve left the pavement behind.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes a moment and when she opened them again, she looked up. \u201cOh, the stars.\u201d</p><p>She could see him now\u2014or at least his silhouette.</p> <p>He tilted his head back. \u201cThey\u2019re rather nice tonight.\u201d</p><p>They walked in silence for a bit, the music wafting behind them, and then a sort of wall seemed to loom ahead.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He paused for a moment and she knew\u2014she wasn\u2019t sure how, but she knew\u2014he was smiling. \u201cA maze.\u201d</p><p>PERHAPS APOLLO WAS mad to bring a girl to see a maze at night, but somehow it\u2019d seemed exactly the right thing to do.</p> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said to her, pulling her hand.</p><p>Lily followed easily enough, but her voice was uncertain as they made the first turn. \u201cWe\u2019ll get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said easily. \u201cI found it this afternoon and explored it then. It\u2019s simple enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven in the dark,\u201d he assured her. \u201cBut it\u2019s not quite dark, is it?\u201d He pointed up at the stars and the crescent moon.</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound entirely reassured, but she followed him nonetheless, and that made him glad.</p> <p>The maze was an old one with a fully matured hedge over eight feet tall. In places the hedge threatened to grow into the path and he had to lead her single file, but she never protested. He could hear the rustle of her skirts, the sound of her breathing right behind him, and once in a while her scent came to him, orange and clove, tantalizing and sweet.</p><p>He tightened his grip on her hand.</p><p>By the time he turned the final corner he was heavy and hard.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she whispered, as if she knew the import of this place. Of where he\u2019d brought her and why.</p><p>Before them was a shallow stone pool, rimmed with stone benches, a statue standing at the center. It had probably once been a fountain, but time and neglect had stopped it running, and now it was dry save for a few rotting leaves blown against the edges.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at the heart,\u201d he replied, his throat thick.</p><p>She tugged his hand as she stepped closer to the stone pool. She stared at the statue and then back at him. \u201cThe heart of the maze?\u201d</p><p>He looked into her eyes, reflecting the starlight, the entire universe, really, and nodded. \u201cThe heart.\u201d</p> <p>She stood still a moment, watching him, and he had no idea at all what she was thinking.</p><p>Finally she laughed quietly, gesturing with her free hand at the marble figure. \u201cIt\u2019s a minotaur. I suppose that\u2019s appropriate.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the figure, all horns and massive shoulders. \u201cThe monster in the maze?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She turned in the dark to face him, and all he could see was the limned starlight on her cheek, the glimmer of the reflected moon in her eyes. \u201cIndio thought you were a monster at first. Did I ever tell you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly. \u201cAm I still a monster to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She reached up to trace his eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re not... that. You never were, really.\u201d</p><p>And she pulled his head down to meet her mouth. She kissed him with a woman\u2019s passion, a woman\u2019s want, frank and sweet. He fought to keep from grasping, from holding too tight, lest the very harshness of his grip drive her from him.</p><p>He let her lead, opening his mouth when her tender tongue ran across his lips. Let her explore and seek. She thrust her hands into his hair, pulling the tie out, framing his face with his coarse locks.</p><p>\u201cApollo,\u201d she breathed against him, her hands restless on his waistcoat. \u201cApollo, make love to me.\u201d</p><p>It was all he was waiting for. He pressed her against him, angling his head to deepen the kiss. He placed his palm over her upper chest, feeling the delicate collarbone beneath his fingers, the gentle swell of her breast. Even this little amount of flesh was like wine in the desert. He traced the edge of her bodice, dipping his little finger into the hot, shadowed recess between her breasts. It was moist there and suddenly he had to taste. He bent her back, ducking his head to slide his tongue between her sweet breasts and taste her salt.</p><p>\u201cApollo,\u201d she moaned, grasping his hair. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He licked up over her breasts, finding the rise of her shoulder and biting there.</p><p>Her fingers moved in a shaking flurry between them and he realized she was scrabbling at his falls, but before he could help her, she had them open.</p><p>Had them open and had him in her hand.</p><p>He froze, groaning, trembling at her touch. Her cool fingers circled him confidently, stroking up once before caressing his head, exploring where he wept liquid tears.</p><p>She pulled one hand away and he saw, in the moonlight, as she drew a single wet finger to her lips and sucked.</p><p>That was too much.</p><p>He had her turned before she could make another move. He ripped off his coat and threw it down before one of the benches edging the pool.</p><p>\u201cKneel,\u201d he said, and his voice was a guttural rasp that made him wince.</p><p>She obeyed, though, as if sacrificing herself to some ancient monster. \u201cLike this?\u201d And the look she gave him over her shoulder was enough to make him swallow hard.</p><p>\u201cExactly like that,\u201d he said, kneeling behind her. He pulled up her skirts reverently, as though he unveiled a work of art, seeing first the gleam of her white stockings in the moonlight, then the silver of her thighs.</p><p>Then the rounded mounds of her arse. Her delightfully carnal arse, curved and sweet, that secret darkness between. If he died right now, he\u2019d dream for all eternity of Lily\u2019s arse and be happy.</p><p>He laid her skirts over her back and ran his fingertips over her buttocks, watching as she shivered.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs for me,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She shifted, revealing more of herself, though the darkness kept her tantalizingly modest.</p><p>He ran his finger down the dip between her cheeks, slowly, until he encountered her moisture.</p><p>\u201cApollo,\u201d she whispered, wiggling just a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d His words were nearly slurred as if he were drunk on her feminine scent.</p><p>\u201cYou know I do,\u201d she said, bending farther. She put her head in her arms on the stone bench, jutting out her hips farther, as if she were presenting herself, a mare to be mounted.</p><p>God, he wanted her.</p><p>He took his cock in hand and crawled closer, close enough that he could run his cockhead through her weeping slit.</p><p>She moaned and arched her back, forcing herself against him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think. Could only feel\u2014and want. He shoved his prick into position, placing his palm on the small of her back to hold her still. He didn\u2019t want to hurt her\u2014and if he moved too fast he was liable to spill.</p><p>He eased into her tight, hot passage, throwing his head back, staring blindly at the starlit cosmos. She was so wet for him, so slick and beautiful, that tears gathered at the corners of his eyes even as he thrust and thrust again. He pushed into that sweet tunnel, uniting them, making them one, until his flesh and her flesh merged.</p><p>And then he separated them again, drawing entirely out, just so he could feel again the wonderful pleasure of joining.</p><p>She whimpered, her face against her arms, and he bent over her, his woman, his Lily, surrounding, protecting, claiming her as his. \u201cWhat do you want, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTh... that.\u201d</p><p>He licked the bared nape of her neck. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI want your cock in me. I want you to fill me and stuff me full until I can\u2019t talk or remember my own name.\u201d</p><p>He lost all control at her words. He reared, withdrawing and slamming back into her, the man entirely subsumed in the animal. All he was, all he could feel was his cock conquering her pussy, making her his mate for now, forever.</p><p>He bowed over her and bit into the back of her neck, holding her hips still so that he could plow into her over and over again until he felt her shudder under him, contracting around him. She moaned, low and lost, as she came, and he knelt up then, never stopping, never slowing, pounding as she trembled beneath him until he threw back his head and roared his own release into the night.</p><p>The stars whirled above them as he slowly sank back over her, panting, wondering if he\u2019d ever again regain his humanity.</p><p>Or if he\u2019d lost it forever to this woman.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Now, though a bull\u2019s visage may be wild and beastly, its eyes are quite beautiful. Ariadne saw a soft brown eye, large and liquid, surrounded by thick lashes and filled with pain. In that moment she forgot fear of the monster and felt only pity. Instead of fleeing, she knelt by his side and began to bind his wounds, and as she did, she wondered what had become of Theseus, for surely it was he who had hurt the monster...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>Lily woke late the next morning with a feeling of both elation and dread. Elation because she would see Apollo again. She knew now that their liaison would by necessity be short. Soon she\u2019d have to go back to her own life and he to his\u2014wherever that was. Aristocrats and average persons could not permanently join\u2014at least not happily. Their worlds were too different, the imbalance of power between highborn and low simply too great. Even if he cared for her in some way, Apollo would have to wed a lady of his own rank one day. Lily hadn\u2019t the heart to be a mistress. But knowing that their time together was finite made it all the sweeter. She vowed to enjoy every minute left to her.</p><p>But her anticipation at seeing Apollo again was tempered by a feeling of dread. At a house party there was no way she could avoid Richard forever.</p><p>She pushed the second thought aside, however, and made sure to walk down to luncheon with Moll.</p><p>All the guests were gathered there, it seemed, for it was quite late\u2014nearly one of the clock\u2014and well past the time a working person might break his fast. Of course working people didn\u2019t stay awake dancing past dawn, either.</p><p>Three large tables had been set up to accommodate so many at once and footmen were moving swiftly, bringing coffeepots and plates of cold meats, coddled eggs, and rolls. Lily saw Apollo almost at once and shared a secret smile with him. Then she glanced around and found Richard, sitting next to a pleasant-looking woman who had to be his wife.</p><p>Lily felt nothing but pity for her.</p><p>She ducked her head and marched determinedly with Moll toward a table holding John, the Warners, and, unfortunately, her brother. But it was on the opposite side of the room from Richard and that, at least, made it the best choice. When she glanced up again, Apollo was frowning thoughtfully at him.</p><p>Damn. The man was much too perceptive.</p><p>\u201cMiss Bennet,\u201d lovely Mr. Warner exclaimed as they approached. He rose at once, followed more slowly by Edwin and John. \u201cAnd Miss Goodfellow. What a splendid accomplishment your production was last night. Mrs. Warner and I enjoyed ourselves enormously. And you must be very proud of your brother, for I understand he is the playwright.\u201d He turned and beamed at Edwin, who, for once, seemed a bit taken aback by the approbation.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d John said. \u201cMr. Stump is well known in the theater community for the intelligence and wit of his plays. I\u2019ve acted in two myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow wonderful,\u201d exclaimed little Mrs. Warner. \u201cYou are very talented, Mr. Stump. I vow I would not be able to write a single line, let alone five entire acts.\u201d</p><p>Lily met her brother\u2019s eyes and saw a shadow of guilt there. She really ought to be used to seeing him lauded for her own work. Still, it hurt, just the tiniest bit, like a pinched heart.</p><p>An odd look came over Edwin\u2019s narrow face and suddenly he threw wide his arms. \u201cGentlepeople! Might I have your ears!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The other guests turned, faces startled or expectant according to their personalities.</p><p>Edwin was in his element with an audience. He bowed and strutted to the middle of the room. \u201cI have received many accolades for the play you enjoyed last night, but now I must reveal to you the real talent, the real playwright of A Wastrel Reform\u2019d.\u201d Edwin paused for a pregnant second and then turned and bowed to Lily. \u201cMy own sister, Miss Robin Goodfellow!\u201d</p><p>Even knowing what he might say, Lily was caught by surprise. For a moment she simply stared, wide-eyed, at her brother. Then, grinning, he took her hand and drew her to the center of the room.</p><p>The guests rose, clapping, and she could do nothing but curtsy and curtsy again. In the back of the room a footman tapped on Mr. William Greaves\u2019s shoulder and leaned close to whisper something in his ear before Mr. Greaves turned and left the room.</p> <p>Amid the uproar, Lily looked at her brother. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, his look rueful. She wondered if he\u2019d already begun to regret his decision to reveal the authorship of her plays. \u201cIt was time,\u201d he murmured, close to her ear because the applause was continuing. \u201cAnd, no matter my own self-interest and pettiness, I do love you, Sister.\u201d</p><p>Tears sparkled in her eyes and she threw her arms around her brother. Over his shoulder she could see Apollo, standing and clapping with the other guests, his eyes full of pride.</p><p>APOLLO WATCHED LILY blush and smile as she was finally acknowledged for the words she\u2019d written. He wanted to go to her and take her in his arms, to congratulate her himself, but they hadn\u2019t progressed to a point where he could claim her in public\u2014yet. So instead he used the distraction to slip from the room.</p><p>Outside the breakfast room, footmen scurried back and forth, paying him no mind. He strode down the hall and ducked around the corner. His uncle\u2019s study was at the back of the house on this floor, in an area normally reserved for the family.</p> <p>He was nearly at the door when he was hailed from behind.</p><p>\u201cMr. Smith.\u201d</p><p>He turned to find his uncle staring at him in puzzlement. \u201cMight I help you, Mr. Smith? I fear there is nothing of interest down this way, merely my own study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d Apollo said easily. \u201cI must\u2019ve gotten turned around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d The older man\u2019s gaze sharpened on him and he cocked his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to ask you, Mr. Smith. Have we perchance met before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, sir,\u201d Apollo replied, holding his uncle\u2019s gaze. It was the truth, after all: he had no memory of his father\u2019s family\u2019s ever visiting when he was young, save for the one time his grandfather had come to announce Apollo\u2019s enrollment in Harrow.</p> <p>\u201cStrange,\u201d the older man murmured as they turned back toward the front of the house and the rest of the party. \u201cBut I find that something about you is reminiscent of...\u201d He trailed away, shaking his head. \u201cI feel that I\u2019ve seen you before.\u201d</p><p>He slowed as they came to the end of the corridor, and although Apollo wanted to rush away, he made himself slow as well.</p><p>\u201cMy father,\u201d the older man said suddenly, \u201cthe earl, is a big man. I used to be quite afeard of him as boy. Broad shoulders like a bull, huge hands.\u201d He seemed lost in a not entirely happy memory. \u201cMy brother and I did not inherit his frame\u2014much to my father\u2019s chagrin\u2014but I\u2019m told my nephew is at least as large as my father. And, of course, my son George bears him some resemblance.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Apollo and there was a sort of frightened question in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMr. Greaves.\u201d</p><p>Both men looked up at the low voice. A servant stood at the other end of the hall, backlit by the window there.</p><p>\u201cAh, Vance,\u201d the older man said. \u201cThere you are.\u201d He turned back to Apollo. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, Mr. Smith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Apollo murmured. He watched as his uncle walked to the manservant.</p> <p>\u201cI hope you have the matter well in hand?\u201d William Greaves asked.</p><p>\u201cJust as you ordered, sir, but if I may...\u201d Vance leaned toward his master, murmuring something in his ear. As he did so, he turned his head just enough for his face to be revealed. Vance had a port-wine stain over much of his left cheek and chin.</p><p>Apollo stepped back, merging into the shadows of the corridor, his heart beating fast. He\u2019d seen that face.</p><p>Four years ago in a tavern in Whitechapel.</p><p>He waited as the two men disappeared into Greaves\u2019s study before slipping back to the breakfast room. It was simply too much of a coincidence for his uncle to have in his employ a man who\u2019d been in the tavern that night. Was he an assassin? Had his uncle sent Vance that night to do such ugly work?</p><p>When he reentered the breakfast room, the guests were still dining. Quietly he slipped back into his seat beside the Duke of Montgomery.</p><p>\u201cDid you learn anything?\u201d His Grace asked casually as he buttered a piece of toast.</p><p>\u201cIn the necessary?\u201d Apollo knit his brows as if confused.</p><p>\u201cCome now,\u201d the duke said. \u201cDon\u2019t prevaricate with a master like myself.\u201d</p><p>He crunched into his toast.</p><p>Apollo sighed. He didn\u2019t trust Montgomery, but at the moment the man was his only ally. \u201cWilliam Greaves\u2019s valet was there at the tavern\u2014the night before the murders.\u201d</p><p>Montgomery paused mid-crunch. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>Apollo gave him a look. \u201cThe man has a conspicuous port-wine stain on his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The duke swallowed. \u201cThen it seems to me that we ought to find out how long the man has been in William Greaves\u2019s employ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014?\u201d</p><p>But before Apollo could finish his question the duke had leaned forward over the table. \u201cI say, George, how long has your father had that valet of his?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years,\u201d George Greaves replied slowly, looking between the duke and Apollo.</p><p>Apollo swore to himself and hunched over his plate of eggs.</p><p>The duke, naturally, wasn\u2019t perturbed at all. \u201cStrange. Saw a man with a birthmark just like his in Cyprus two years ago.\u201d</p><p>Cyprus? Apollo glanced up casually to see if George Greaves had bought this ridiculous story.</p><p>Judging by his suspicious look, he had not.</p><p>Apollo sighed as the other guests chattered around them. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d he hissed at Montgomery.</p><p>\u201cA question.\u201d The duke reached for another piece of toast.</p><p>\u201cDid you mean to alert him to our investigation on purpose?\u201d Apollo growled.</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\u201d Montgomery shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m bored. Nothing\u2019s happening. Sometimes it\u2019s best to send the fox into the chicken house to see if a snake slithers out.\u201d</p><p>Apollo glared. \u201cYou know nothing at all about chickens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d Montgomery smiled winsomely as he slathered butter on his new piece of toast. \u201cIf you think that, then perhaps you really ought not to be taking my advice on poultry, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Well, and that was the question, wasn\u2019t it? Apollo thought as he took a bitter sip of coffee. Should he be trusting the duke with anything at all?</p><p>He glanced again at his cousin, blithely drinking his tea. George had said that Vance hadn\u2019t been in William\u2019s employ four years ago. But that didn\u2019t mean William couldn\u2019t have known Vance at the time of the murders. And, of course, George might\u2019ve simply lied. Perhaps father and son had acted together. After all, it was to George\u2019s benefit as well should Apollo be hanged.</p><p>Apollo shook his head, taking a bite of coddled eggs. If only he had concrete evidence against his uncle.</p><p>That decided him.</p><p>He had to take another chance at his uncle\u2019s study\u2014tonight.</p><p>APOLLO WAS IN her rooms again when Lily returned that night. She should have been outraged at his presumption, but all she felt was happiness tinged with sadness.</p><p>She doubted that they\u2019d last much beyond this house party. He\u2019d find the murderer and justice and return to his life, she was sure of it. Apollo had a sort of calm resolve that she\u2019d seen before in men who got what they wanted. He was born to be an earl and he would be someday.</p><p>An actress had no place in such a life.</p><p>As the days of the party passed, so too did their time together.</p><p>\u201cYou look pensive,\u201d he said quietly, holding his hand out from where he lay on the bed. He wore only his shirt and breeches.</p><p>She went to him without protest. Why pretend when they really had so little time left together?</p><p>He gathered her against him, her back to his front, and began plucking the pins from her coiffure. \u201cHave I told you how much I admire your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just plain brown,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cPlain, lovely brown,\u201d he replied, raising a lock he\u2019d freed to his face.</p><p>\u201cAre you smelling my hair?\u201d she asked in amusement.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly man,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>\u201cSmitten man,\u201d he corrected, spreading her hair over her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn between escorting Miss Royle about the garden?\u201d she asked, glancing over her shoulder at him.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019d rather it\u2019d been you, but that wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve been prudent.\u201d He frowned down at the strands of her hair caught between his fingers. \u201cOr, perhaps, safe.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy uncle commented that I looked like my grandfather today, and then later Montgomery said some rather unwise words to my cousin.\u201d</p><p>She turned all the way so she could see his face clearly. There was a small dent between his brows. \u201cThey\u2019ve discovered who you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMaybe not. My uncle suspects, I think, but only that. As for my cousin...\u201d He trailed away, shaking his head. \u201cThat I simply don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to be careful,\u201d she said, placing her hand on his chest. \u201cYour uncle killed before to prevent you gaining your title. There\u2019s nothing to stop him doing so again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself,\u201d he said, smiling indulgently down at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d she whispered urgently. \u201cNo man can withstand a bullet.\u201d</p><p>His smile slipped from his face. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cNow tell me why Ross is troubling you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the sudden assault. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily.\u201d He trailed his fingers along her hairline. \u201cI care for you. I would protect you if I can. Please tell me.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth and then shut it again. In a little while they would part and probably never see each other again. Did she really owe him anything when such was the situation?</p><p>But in this time\u2014this stolen time before all that would come next\u2014they were close. If things had been otherwise, she might\u2019ve made this man her husband. Might\u2019ve borne his children, kept his home, slept beside him night after night until they both had white hair.</p><p>Perhaps in this in-between time she did owe him the truth.</p><p>So she laid her head on his chest and listened to his reassuring heartbeat as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was little, living in various theaters with my mother, there was another girl my age. Her name was Kitty and she was my friend. Both her mother and her father were actors and I suppose we grew up together. Kitty had flaming red hair and blue eyes and when she laughed, her nose scrunched up so adorably. Once she was old enough she always played the heroine. She was funny and kind and I loved her. She was very fond of seedcake, I remember. Maude would sometimes smuggle a small cake in for us especial and we would have a tea party behind the stage as my mother and her parents worked in whatever play they were in at the time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Apollo stroked her hair, not commenting. She wondered if he had any idea what it was like to have a friend when one was as alone in the midst of many people as she\u2019d been growing up. How very attached one could become to that person.</p><p>\u201cWhen we were both seventeen,\u201d Lily continued, \u201cKitty met a man\u2014a man outside the theater and far from our world. An aristocrat.\u201d She fingered one of the buttons on Apollo\u2019s shirt, remembering. \u201cHe was handsome and rich, but most importantly, it seemed to us, was that he was so terribly taken with her. We were girls, of course, and even though we\u2019d grown up in the theater, we knew very little of life. It never even occurred to me to be worried. I remember Maude making a comment once\u2014that blue blood and common red blood don\u2019t easily mix\u2014but we disregarded her. It was so romantic, you understand. He would come and stand by the backstage door, once even in the rain. He said he loved her and we believed him. How could we not? Isn\u2019t love standing in the rain and showering a girl with flowers and jewels?\u201d</p><p>His arms came up to wrap around her as if she were a small child.</p><p>\u201cOnce...\u201d She swallowed, steadying her voice. \u201cOnce I saw a greenish bruise upon her cheek before she covered it with paint and I thought it rather odd\u2014it was such a strange place to be bruised. But Kitty said she bumped into the corner of a door in the dark and I believed her. Believed her without question. I never even thought to question that silly lie.\u201d</p> <p>Her voice had risen and he brushed her hair back from her face, laying his lips on her temple, still saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cShe married him, after more than a year of courting, for he was that much infatuated\u2014he actually married an actress despite his family\u2019s opposition and his own lineage.\u201d</p><p>Apollo stirred at her words as if to make comment, but she continued before he could.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see her then for nearly a year. She sent letters, writing about how happy she was and how her new husband didn\u2019t like to share her, even with old friends, and I missed her dreadfully, but I was glad that she\u2019d found her true love. She visited after many months and though she walked with a limp I thought nothing of it when she said she\u2019d fallen in the street and twisted her ankle. But her accidents became more common as her visits grew less and less. When I met her, in the second year of her marriage, at a tea shop and saw, despite the paint she\u2019d used, that her eye had actually been blackened...\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, high on her temple, and whispered, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI pleaded with her to leave him, of course. She had friends, many friends, in the theater. I told her we could hide her if need be, find work for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She wouldn\u2019t hear of leaving him. The maddening thing was despite his monstrous treatment of her, she still loved him. Kitty felt that he\u2019d made a sacrifice for her by marrying her against his family\u2019s wishes, and if he had a horrendous temper, then that was the price she must pay.\u201d</p><p>His hand stilled on her hair and he said, very carefully and calmly, \u201cThere is never any excuse for a man to hit a woman\u2014any woman\u2014let alone one he professes to love.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet a moment, just basking in his gentle strength.</p><p>Then she took a breath and continued. \u201cThe next time I saw her, she was expecting a child and she was so happy, Apollo. I began to think I\u2019d been wrong. That her husband had realized how sweet Kitty was and had vowed to never hurt her again. That was what she told me, at least, and I wanted\u2014truly\u2014to believe her.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d stiffened when she\u2019d spoken of Kitty\u2019s pregnancy and he made a sound like an exclamation hastily cut off.</p><p>\u201cI was so na\u00efve,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou...\u201d He stopped, his voice shaking. \u201cYou weren\u2019t to blame, no matter what happened.\u201d</p><p>She just shook her head. If she\u2019d argued more strongly, appealed to Kitty\u2019s instinctive motherly feelings... but she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Lily took his hand, squeezing it. \u201cKitty came to us one night, very late. She woke us\u2014Edwin, Maude, and me\u2014by pounding at the door. Mother had passed by this point, and Edwin was only staying with us in rather cramped rooms because he\u2019d lost all his money at cards. Maude was the one who opened the door. When I heard her scream, I leaped from my bed. Kitty...\u201d She bit her lip, breathing harshly, trying to fight down sobs.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me,\u201d he said, low. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head violently and gasped, \u201cYou won\u2019t understand completely otherwise. She... she was all over blood. I don\u2019t know how she\u2019d managed to come to us, but she loved her baby very much.\u201d She inhaled, choking on a sob. \u201cVery much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod,\u201d he groaned, holding her, rocking her now. \u201cOh, my darling girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d beaten her quite badly. One eye was closed completely, the other swollen so much...\u201d She caught her breath. \u201cEven had she lived it would\u2019ve scarred her. I\u2019m not sure she ever would\u2019ve been able to see again from the closed eye. Something was wrong with her cheek and her nose was flattened into her face. She had to breathe through her mouth, and Apollo, oh, Apollo, some of the blood came from inside her. She was bleeding. Her baby was coming.\u201d</p><p>He pressed her face to his cheek and she realized it was damp. He was weeping for a woman he\u2019d never known. Weeping for her pain.</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to call a midwife. Maude... Maude was a wonder. She got Kitty on my bed and put clothes beneath her and she scolded Edwin until he pulled himself together enough to help. He shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve been there, of course, but I don\u2019t think Kitty knew at the last. She fainted and Maude said... said...\u201d</p><p>She covered her face with her hands then, the old, old grief and shock overcoming her. Kitty, poor Kitty. She\u2019d been so pretty, so vivacious, and now all Lily could remember of her was a bloody, beaten face. It wasn\u2019t fair. It simply wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>\u201cHush, my love, my love, hush,\u201d Apollo murmured into her hair, rocking her like a babe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, wiping her face with the heels of her hands. Her nose was running and her eyes were red, she knew. This wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d come for tonight, an ugly, weeping woman.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said sharply and she jerked and looked at him for the first time in minutes. His eyes were bloodshot. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said more gently. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize for what that monster did and how it hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, catching her breath. \u201cHe was born only an hour or so after she arrived, just before dawn. So wrinkled and red and Kitty never saw him, she wasn\u2019t breathing by the time he came into the world. I thought he wouldn\u2019t last either, he was so small, but Maude knew what to do. She sent Edwin to find a wet nurse and bundled the baby with a hot brick on either side of him to warm him.\u201d She smiled then, despite the painful memories, because he\u2019d been her baby boy right from the first. \u201cHe never cried, do you know? He simply blinked and looked around with big dark-blue eyes. Of course later one eye changed to green, but when he was first born, they were both blue like the night sky, nearly black, and he had a little tuft of black curls on the top of his head, so adorable. Edwin said we should call him George, but I told him that was too common. I named him Indio.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him.</p><p>He stared back, steady and true. \u201cWho was Kitty\u2019s husband, Lily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Ross,\u201d she replied, as easily as telling him the time of day, though she\u2019d never told another soul the truth. \u201cWe knew at once that if he thought the baby had lived he would hurt it, for he\u2019d told Kitty as he\u2019d beaten her to death that he wanted a new wife. One who would give him heirs of a proper pedigree. So I left the city for a little while, playing in smaller towns, traveling about the country with Maude and the baby and a very young wet nurse. When I came back to London I simply said Indio was my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoss doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Lily agreed. \u201cAnd he must never know. He has a new wife, two small boys, one of them his heir. I shudder to think what he\u2019d do if he knew he already had an heir\u2014one born of an actress with no family.\u201d</p><p>Apollo slowly clenched his fists. \u201cBut for him to\u2019ve beaten a woman to death\u2014his wife\u2014and face no punishment at all...\u201d His face twisted. \u201cIt\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>She scrambled to her knees to face him, for she had to make him understand. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t go after him, Apollo, and you mustn\u2019t tell anyone. As long as he thinks the baby died with Kitty, he\u2019s no real danger.\u201d</p><p>His eyes snapped to hers, darkening. \u201cThen why has he been watching you this entire party?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI saw Kitty at the last. He must realize whom she went to. I know what he did to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he sees you as a threat to his freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an actress\u2014no one of consequence in his circles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you not see the entire room stand to applaud you this morning?\u201d He caught her hands, bringing them to his chest. \u201cYou might not think yourself important\u2014and perhaps in strictly titled circles you are not\u2014but in society as a whole? Before we knew you were a great playwright, you were lauded as a fine actress. Lily, he has good reason to fear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if you\u2019re right, I don\u2019t...\u201d She closed her eyes, trying to gather the words. \u201cI don\u2019t want you telling anyone, Apollo. Indio has to be kept safe. He has to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he murmured, framing her face with his big hands. \u201cI\u2019ll not put you or Indio in any more danger, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She leaned forward to kiss him on the jaw, feeling the rasp of stubble beneath her lips. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it ever happened to you,\u201d he whispered, catching her chin and lifting her face to his. \u201cNo one should have to bear witness to the worst that men can do, and especially not you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved in amusement. \u201cEspecially me? Why should I be sheltered in particular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, pulling her into his lap, \u201cyou are my light and my laughter, and if you would let me, I would spend the rest of my life protecting you from everything that is ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be done,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTo live is to see both the beauty and the ugliness of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d he said stubbornly, \u201cbut that wouldn\u2019t stop me from trying. Every day I want to see your eyes alight with happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, oddly touched by something that would never\u2014could never\u2014happen.</p><p>She kissed the corner of his mouth, and when he moved to more fully engage hers, she opened her lips beneath his, accepting his tongue in a long, languorous kiss.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she whispered, rising on her knees above him. She unhooked her bodice as he untied the tapes of her skirt, then together they unlaced her stays until he could draw them up over her head.</p><p>Another tug and her chemise followed.</p><p>She knelt, straddling his thighs, in only her stockings, gartered just above her knees. She placed her palms on his shoulders, looking down at him as he ran his rough fingertips up her legs to her hips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lovely,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse. \u201cI thought that the first time I ever saw you in the garden, when you were clothed, but here, naked...\u201d He swallowed, his eyes darkening as he watched his thumb trace a circle near her maiden hair. \u201cYou\u2019re everything I never dared to dream of when I was in Bedlam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApollo,\u201d she breathed, oddly touched. She stroked his hair, unable to keep from pulling the tie from it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled as if it were an old habit\u2014a gesture between lovers who had known each other years instead of days.</p><p>Tears pricked at her eyes and she bent forward to hide them from him, cradling his face to her breasts.</p><p>He turned his head, mouthing at her nipple, and she arched her head back, trying to quell her sudden melancholy. Not now, not here. She didn\u2019t want to ruin this by bringing the future in too soon.</p><p>But he must\u2019ve sensed her mood. He lifted his head, trying to see her. \u201cLily?\u201d</p><p>She scooted back, pushing him firmly against the pillows so that she might have access to his lap.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be dissuaded, though, stubborn man. \u201cLily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she muttered, working at the buttons on his falls. \u201cI... I just want to forget.\u201d She flicked her eyes to him, letting him see the mess she must\u2019ve made of her face earlier. \u201cCan you help me forget?\u201d</p><p>She should\u2019ve felt guilt for her prevarication, but she didn\u2019t. She had the right to this little bit of joy, even if it only lasted hours.</p><p>So she pulled apart his breeches and reached in to untie his smallclothes. His penis rose, ruddy and proud, from a thatch of coarse hair. She stroked both hands through that hair, scratching, watching smugly as his cock bobbed in reaction.</p><p>\u201cTake it off,\u201d she ordered him imperiously, tapping at his shirt.</p><p>He lifted to do so, pulling the shirt over his head, and then he lay sprawled against the mound of pillows, all naked chest. She sat back on his legs to look her fill, and if she did so to store the image in a corner of her mind, she tried not to think about it too much. His head was cocked back, his shaggy brown hair falling in tangled waves to his shoulders and, oh, his shoulders! If she had the money, she\u2019d commission a sculpture of him nude and never regret the expenditure. His shoulders were mounded with muscle, wide and strong, with upper arms she doubted she could span with both hands. His dark nipples were peaked in a chest the color of sunlight, the dark hairs between making a lovely masculine contrast. Why painters never showed male hair she could not fathom. Wasn\u2019t that part of what made a man? Hair upon the body? In any case she loved his.</p><p>She stroked a single finger through his chest hairs and when he made to move shook her head firmly. \u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019m not finished.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, but he only said, \u201cAs you will.\u201d</p><p>She bit her bottom lip to keep from smiling and traced through the divided muscles of his belly to his navel. She circled that lightly, watching as his belly contracted in reaction. Farther down she followed the trail of dark hair that led to his groin. His penis lay slightly to the side, pulsing. His foreskin had pulled back, revealing his glistening head. She stared frankly, for if he found her lovely, she found him devastating.</p><p>She ducked and took him into her mouth, warm and bitter, without waiting to think or ask if it was permissible. She wanted him\u2014all of him.</p><p>He jackknifed at her sudden movement, and she saw, out of the corners of her eyes, his hands hovering, fingers spread, on either side of her head, as if he didn\u2019t know quite what to do.</p><p>Well, neither did she\u2014she\u2019d never done this before\u2014but she wasn\u2019t going to let inexperience keep her from this moment.</p><p>She sucked lightly at the head, tasting bitter salt, holding him to her mouth with both hands. She ran her tongue slowly around the silky head and then along the edge of his taut foreskin.</p><p>He moaned above, though she doubted this was helping him much. After all, it was nothing like the motion he made inside her.</p><p>That led to another thought and she gave him an open-mouthed kiss before looking up. \u201cWhat do you do when you\u2019re alone?\u201d</p><p>He blinked sleepily, eyes widening. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He must know exactly what she meant. A corner of her mouth kicked up. Had she shocked him? \u201cShow me, please.\u201d</p><p>She sat back, releasing her hold on him. She watched as he grasped himself with his right hand, pausing.</p> <p>She bent and kissed him again, the moisture at the tip slipping over her lips. She looked up into his eyes from her position and whispered, \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared and he nodded, stroking his closed fist up, and then palming the head to spread the seeping moisture around. He stroked down, much faster and stronger than she would\u2019ve done herself, and she watched in absolute fascination. How often did he do this? And what did he think about when he did?</p><p>She looked up to see that he\u2019d flung his arm across his eyes like a debauched faun, the muscle of his upper arm bunched, the tufts of underarm hair strangely erotic. She leaned forward, licking his chest as his fist bumped against her belly and he started.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she husked, scooting closer, and closer still until his hand was rubbing against her with every stroke, his knuckles brushing through her lips. She ground her pelvis down on his hand as she drew aside the arm covering his eyes and took his face in her hands, kissing him deeply.</p><p>He placed his hand on her bottom, urging her closer as he aimed himself, and with one thrust entered her. She leaned forward so that the angle pressed the apex of her slit against his pelvic bone. Then she began to ride him, fast and hard, grinding against him with every downstroke, using him to pleasure herself. She was trembling, her body melting with the heat and desire they made between them, and she watched him as she rode his cock. He swallowed, his eyes on her, his upper lip curled.</p><p>Until she saw stars and she had to close her own eyes. She swiveled against him, finding that spot\u2014that perfect spot of friction and heat\u2014and sobbed aloud as she came, her body liquid with melting desire.</p><p>He took her hips and thrust forcefully up into her as she curled down into him, holding on as he slammed repeatedly into her, finding his own release. Finding his own point of desire.</p><p>And afterward, as she lay exhausted against him, tracing a finger through his sweat-dampened hair, she wondered if there was a way back to her old life after this.</p><p>Or if he\u2019d led her into a maze in which she\u2019d be lost forever.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The monster watched Ariadne with his beautiful eyes as she tended to him. When she was finished he made to stand, but stumbled, swaying. Impulsively she wrapped her arms about his muscled waist to steady him. He looked down at her curiously, then led her to a bower, where he offered her berries and clean water. And although he did not speak, she thought there was intelligence in his soft brown gaze...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>Apollo crept down the corridor toward his uncle\u2019s study.</p><p>Well. As much as a man his size could creep.</p><p>It was past midnight and as far as he could tell all the guests were asleep, including Lily. He\u2019d had to leave her sweet warmth to go investigating, and he hoped it wouldn\u2019t take long.</p><p>He wanted to return to her.</p><p>The door to his uncle\u2019s study was unlocked, thank God, and he ducked inside as quietly as he could. It wasn\u2019t a very big room. A single bookshelf appeared to hold ledgers, with a table and chair in front of it, while a desk and chair stood at one end near a fireplace.</p><p>Apollo crossed to the desk and set the candle he\u2019d brought on a corner. The top of the desk held only a jar of quills and an inkpot on a blotter. He went around the desk and sat in the chair to try the middle of the three drawers that ran across the front of the desk. It was unlocked and he drew it easily open to find a thin pile of papers, a pencil, and a penknife. Nothing else.</p><p>Frowning, he tried the left-hand drawer and found it entirely empty. Obviously his uncle wasn\u2019t much of a man of business\u2014which might be the reason he was so deeply in debt. The right-hand drawer, unlike the other two, was locked.</p><p>Apollo had his head bent, examining the lock as well as he could in the dim light, when a voice interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing at my desk, sirrah?\u201d</p><p>Apollo nearly hit his head on the desk. He looked up and found his uncle frowning at him. He opened his mouth to lie... and found he was simply too tired to do so.</p><p>He sat back in his uncle\u2019s chair, making it squeak with his weight. \u201cI\u2019m looking for evidence that you murdered three men in order to steal my inheritance and title.\u201d</p><p>The older man\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou... what?\u201d</p><p>Apollo sighed. \u201cI\u2019m your nephew, Apollo Greaves, Viscount Kilbourne.\u201d He bowed mockingly. \u201cAt your service, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilbourne...\u201d William Greaves backed up, nearly dropping his candle. \u201cYou\u2019re mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Apollo said patiently, if a little grimly, \u201cI\u2019m really not, and you of all people should know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you here?\u201d William asked, apparently not following the conversation at all.</p><p>Apollo started to rise, but the other man gave a little shriek and held out both hands. \u201cStay where you are! Don\u2019t come near!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle,\u201d Apollo said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The other man dashed from the room, moving quite swiftly considering his age.</p><p>Apollo\u2019s brows rose.</p><p>\u201cHelp! Help! Murder!\u201d screamed his uncle, his voice diminishing as he ran away.</p><p>Well, that settled that.</p><p>Apollo picked up the candle and strode out of the room. He met a single footman as he made his way to Lily\u2019s room, but he simply nodded and kept walking. Below, he could hear the household rousing as his uncle called the alarm.</p><p>Miraculously, she was still sleeping when he entered her bedroom.</p><p>He sighed, taking one last look at her peacefully slumbering form, and then reached down and shook her shoulder hard. \u201cLily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked sleepily. She sat up as she heard the commotion. \u201cApollo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He sat on the side of the bed. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide. \u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t time,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cMy uncle has discovered me and will come with all his footmen to detain me soon. I have to flee.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and took a deep breath. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me tomorrow night,\u201d he said, looking into her eyes to make sure she didn\u2019t mistake him. \u201cIn the garden by the pond where you saw me bathing. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... yes.\u201d Even now he was charmed by the blush that pinkened her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAbout six of the clock, I think. If there\u2019s any trouble, send word to Makepeace,\u201d he said, rising. There were footsteps approaching. He turned and kissed her fast and hard. \u201cI love you. Never forget that.\u201d</p><p>Then he rushed the door.</p><p>There were two footmen plus the middle-aged butler. Apollo shoved the butler out of his way, and would\u2019ve done the same to the footmen had not one swung at him. Apollo knocked aside the man\u2019s blow and drove the point of his elbow into the man\u2019s belly, doubling him over. The remaining footman backed up a step, obviously torn between duty and the desire to keep his ribs intact. Apollo feinted with his right and when the man flinched back, gave him an additional push to make him fall. Then he was running down the hall past half-dressed ladies and gentlemen who didn\u2019t do very much to stop him.</p><p>Wheeling around the corner, he half slid down the main staircase, past a startled Mr. Warner, obviously returning from a room not his own\u2014most interesting\u2014and then he was out the front doors and running.</p><p>Running into the black night.</p><p>He could hear the shouts behind him, and then hoofbeats gaining on him fast. He whirled at the last minute, hands up, ready to dodge the horse.</p><p>Only to find the Duke of Montgomery pulling a great black beast to a half-rearing halt.</p><p>\u201cWell, what are you waiting for?\u201d the duke snapped, for once discomposed. He thrust out a hand. \u201cGet on!\u201d</p><p>HE\u2019D SAID THAT he loved her.</p><p>Lily stared at the doorway, not sure she should believe what had just happened.</p><p>He loved her.</p><p>What did that mean to him? Was he going to offer to keep her? Or was it something he said to every woman he bedded? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But no. As soon as the thought crossed her mind, she disregarded it. Apollo was a good man. If he said he loved her\u2014loved her\u2014then he did.</p><p>She sat in the bed, entirely nude, the coverlet pulled over her breasts, and felt a strange, tenuous feeling: happiness. Ridiculous. She didn\u2019t even know if he\u2019d escaped\u2014and she had more than enough proof from Richard and Kitty\u2019s marriage that aristocracy and actresses couldn\u2019t mix. But...</p><p>He would escape. He was strong and determined and he was Apollo. He\u2019d battled past the footmen and butler and the other gentlemen guests were certainly no match for him. He\u2019d escape and she\u2019d meet him in the garden tomorrow, and...</p><p>And what?</p> <p>Perhaps they could find a way. He wasn\u2019t the usual aristocrat, after all, and... and she loved him.</p><p>She shivered, thinking about it, such a risk, not only for herself, but also for Indio and Maude. Could she risk their happiness as well?</p><p>\u201cHe has good taste at least.\u201d</p><p>She started at the strange voice and saw George Greaves stroll into the room as if he were entering an afternoon tea party.</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs well you should, you little whore,\u201d he said without any heat at all. He closed the door behind him.</p><p>Lily fisted her hands, prepared to jump out of the bed and run\u2014nude, if she had to. \u201cGet out of my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy room, actually\u2014or my father\u2019s, which amounts to the same thing,\u201d George said, taking a chair and placing it so he faced the bed. \u201cYou, Miss Goodfellow, have abused my father\u2019s hospitality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his legs and she noticed that he was completely dressed in breeches, waistcoat, coat, and immaculately tied neckcloth. What had he been doing as his guests slept? \u201cYou\u2019ve been conspiring with my cousin, it seems, against my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot conspiring,\u201d she said, hoping against hope that this might be explained away. \u201cHe didn\u2019t murder those men. He just wants to prove it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you really expect me to believe that?\u201d he asked with clear contempt. \u201cAs I said, conspiring with my cousin, Lord Kilbourne, perhaps to kill us all in our beds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She stared at the man. Did George Greaves truly believe that Apollo had come here to murder everyone in their beds? He must realize how ridiculous that sounded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a madman\u2014everyone knows it and I\u2019m tired of him dragging down the family name.\u201d He looked at her with a reddened face, his eyes bulging.</p><p>Oh, dear. Perhaps George was the real madman in the family. Lily put on her most fluffy-headed female face. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand all these matters and it\u2019s not quite nice for you to be in here when I haven\u2019t even my chemise on. If you\u2019ll just go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father should\u2019ve been the viscount, not my mad uncle or his bloodthirsty son,\u201d George said, and Lily wondered if he\u2019d even heard her. \u201cRidiculous that the family line has sunk into the mire of insanity and mental disease. I\u2019m going to put a stop to this outrage once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Lily blinked and then shook her head, taking a deep breath. Fluffy-headedness hadn\u2019t worked. Perhaps bluntness would. \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d George said precisely, \u201cyour connection to my cousin has provided me with an opportunity to end all this. You\u2019re going to help me right the wrong. Kilbourne has escaped into the night, I have no idea where, but I\u2019m sure you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said immediately. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t. He\u2019s probably decided to flee England.\u201d</p> <p>His smile wasn\u2019t amused at all. \u201cNo, I doubt that very much. And it would be a very great pity if you don\u2019t know where he\u2019s headed, because if you don\u2019t then I have no further use for you\u2014or your supposed son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...\u201d She swallowed, her throat thickening. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you call him Indio? A boy of about seven with one blue eye and one green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about Indio?\u201d she breathed, bewildered.</p><p>For a moment George\u2019s eyes flickered to the side before he glared at her. \u201cEyes just like my good friend Lord Ross.\u201d</p><p>She simply stared at him. She ought to get up, dress, and leave the room. Walk out of here and forget everything he\u2019d insinuated. But there was Indio.</p><p>Indio.</p><p>\u201cHave you met his wife?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cDaughter of a rather wealthy marquis. Ross was ecstatic to\u2019ve caught such a wife. Mind, a large portion of her dowry is tied to her eldest son\u2019s inheriting his name. He won\u2019t be very pleased to find that his perfect little lordling has been displaced by a child got on an actress. God only knows what Ross would do if he found that his eldest son still lives. Really, I wouldn\u2019t give tuppence for the boy\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>She sat in silence, her world crashing down around her ears, because there wasn\u2019t any choice, any hope for her and Apollo. Probably there never had been any hope. It\u2019d been the dream of a silly girl, easily burned away with the rising of the sun.</p><p>He\u2019d said he loved her. Something in her clenched, sharp and painful, as if she\u2019d been cut deep inside and the blood were slowly leaking out where no one could see.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t matter anymore.</p><p>She was a mother and Indio was her son.</p><p>She lifted her chin and looked George Greaves dead in the eye, and she was oddly proud that there was no tremor in her voice when she said, \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Ariadne stayed by the monster\u2019s side for days as he recovered from his injuries, and despite his fearsome aspect she found him gentle and kind. Around them the garden was lovely, but terribly silent. One day Theseus burst from the maze, dirtied and smeared with dried blood. \u201cGet thee away from the beast!\u201d he cried to Ariadne, brandishing his sword. \u201cFor I shall not be routed this time. I shall not rest until I have severed this terrible monster\u2019s head from its body.\u201d...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>It was near six of the clock the next evening when Lily cautiously approached the pond in Harte\u2019s Folly. The sky was just beginning to take on a mauve cast as the sun floated low in the sky, and the birds had started their evening chorus. It was almost lovely, and for the first time she saw how the garden would look one day. Most of the dead trees and hedges had been cleared and in the few days she\u2019d been away the remaining plants had burst into the light green of spring.</p><p>Of life.</p><p>Except she wasn\u2019t walking to life. She marched to death with a gun at her back.</p><p>Behind her, George Greaves\u2019s tread was heavy and ominous. He was probably stamping on the new grass she took care to avoid.</p><p>In the last day and a half he\u2019d not left her side except when she\u2019d had to relieve herself, and even then he\u2019d stood close outside the shut door. If she\u2019d disliked him before\u2014and she had\u2014she\u2019d grown to loathe him in the last thirty-six hours. He was a truly disgusting man without, as far as she could see, any redeeming quality. He\u2019d even refused to pay the wherryman a fair price when they\u2019d made the garden docks.</p><p>A nasty, petty, small-minded man, but sadly a dangerous one as well.</p><p>She was going to betray her love to this man.</p><p>\u201cMake no sound, now,\u201d he murmured in a voice she\u2019d come to despise. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for your lover and then you\u2019ll be free to go.\u201d</p><p>She doubted that, but she didn\u2019t have much choice, either, so she kept walking until she saw the glint of blue water.</p><p>Lily stopped. \u201cHere. This is where I agreed to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d George glanced around, his lips twisted in a sneer. \u201cWell, I suppose mud must seem romantic to the insane\u2014and their common lovers.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, not bothering anymore to protest Apollo\u2019s innocence. She\u2019d begun to suspect that George knew full well that Apollo hadn\u2019t killed his friends.</p><p>\u201cJust stand where you are,\u201d he instructed, backing behind some obscuring bushes. \u201cAnd don\u2019t turn to look at me. You give any hint that I\u2019m here and I\u2019ll shoot first him and then you, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms. \u201cQuite.\u201d</p><p>There was a small silence in which she thought she heard the call of seagulls by the Thames.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your son?\u201d he asked with horrible casualness. \u201cYou left him with a nursemaid, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother replying. All this would be for naught if she simply gave away Indio\u2019s location.</p><p>He chuckled softly at her silence. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it later, you and I, never fear.\u201d</p><p>Something seemed to move behind them and she turned her head to look.</p><p>All was quiet.</p><p>\u201cA dog or some such,\u201d George said, which was ridiculous. She would\u2019ve known had a stray dog been living in the garden.</p><p>Then came the sure tread of a man who knew his way about the garden.</p><p>Lily straightened.</p><p>He was nearing.</p><p>Damn it, he was early.</p><p>George cocked his gun.</p><p>She swallowed, though she didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cI thought you meant to arrest him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a dangerous murderer,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cBetter to be safe than sorry. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m a good shot. You won\u2019t be hurt.\u201d</p><p>Not externally, anyway, she thought, and took a step backward, toward him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he hissed. \u201cStay where you are.\u201d</p><p>She took another step closer to George, just as Apollo came into sight. He wore a plain brown suit and black tricorn and he looked like a man of middling means, perhaps a doctor or the owner of a shop or a head gardener. Someone from her own station in life.</p><p>Someone she could love and live with until she and he grew old.</p><p>He looked up and smiled at her in that moment and she whirled and caught George\u2019s pistol, pulling it down, away from her lover, her love, her life.</p><p>Pulling it toward her own breast.</p><p>The shot, when it came, was deafening.</p><p>APOLLO SAW LILY turn and wrestle with George Greaves.</p><p>Saw the spark and the plume of black smoke.</p><p>Saw her stagger back and fall, dead.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>Strangely, he didn\u2019t hear a thing.</p><p>George turned and saw him and raised the pistol, but he\u2019d already used the one shot to kill Lily, his beloved Lily, so Apollo batted it aside. The pistol went spinning into the underbrush as Apollo raised his hand and plowed it into George\u2019s face.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear that, either. Or feel it.</p><p>Just as well.</p><p>George went down and Apollo followed, beating into that face, because it was the last thing Lily had seen\u2014the face of her killer\u2014and he meant to destroy it.</p><p>Blood spattered and George opened his mouth, his teeth scarlet-stained. He might\u2019ve been saying something, might\u2019ve been begging, but since Apollo couldn\u2019t hear, it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Something crunched beneath his knuckles, and Apollo realized he was grinning, his lips pulled back from his bared teeth, turned into the monster Lily had first thought him.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Nothing mattered anymore.</p><p>George spat blood and a bit of broken white that might\u2019ve been a tooth and Apollo split his ear.</p><p>But the eyes were still there\u2014the eyes that had looked on Lily\u2019s death\u2014and he aimed his fist toward them.</p><p>\u201cApollo.\u201d The voice was Lily\u2019s, but that couldn\u2019t be, because... because...</p><p>Her hands, white and soft, wrapped about his bloodied knuckles and gently stopped him.</p><p>Sound suddenly rushed back in.</p><p>George was breathing with a harsh rasp, Apollo was making a noise like a sob, and Lily...</p><p>Dear God, Lily was saying his name.</p><p>He looked up and saw her face, blackened on one side with flecks of blood high on one cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He let the front of George\u2019s shirt go and his head thudded against the ground.</p><p>Apollo turned on his knees and cupped her sweet face with his unclean hands. \u201cHow?\u201d he choked. \u201cI saw you die. I saw you fall dead to the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pistol fired over my shoulder,\u201d she whispered. \u201cApollo, what have you done to your poor hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod!\u201d he cried, pulling her face down to his, kissing her nose and cheeks and eyelids, making sure she still lived and breathed. \u201cDear God, Lily, never do that to me again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t, love.\u201d Tears were making muddy streaks through the gunpowder on her cheek. \u201cOw, that stings.\u201d</p><p>Richard Perry, Baron Ross stepped out from the bushes. \u201cGet away from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSod off,\u201d Apollo retorted, possibly because he was too tired to be surprised.</p><p>\u201cGet away from her or I\u2019ll shoot her.\u201d Ross, of course, had not one but two pistols.</p><p>Reluctantly Apollo stood and took a step away from Lily. \u201cWe really must talk, darling, about the sort of riffraff you bring to secret meetings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was there,\u201d Lily said grumpily.</p><p>\u201cDid you really think my good friend George wouldn\u2019t tell me about my son?\u201d Ross said. \u201cJesus, he said this would be easy\u2014capture you, Kilbourne, and get my son. Look at this mess now. Have you killed George?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, no,\u201d Apollo replied without glancing at the man on the ground. He could hear his cousin\u2019s harsh breathing. \u201cPut the damned gun down.\u201d He was becoming tired of people pointing guns at his Lily.</p><p>Ross ignored him, his gaze worryingly focused on Lily. \u201cWhere is he? Where is Indio?\u201d</p><p>And before Apollo could think of what to do, Lily opened her mouth.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p> <p>Then the monster rose, his massive shoulders bunched, his hands fisted, his bull\u2019s head lowered, the two curved horns pointed menacingly at Theseus. The lad didn\u2019t hesitate. With a warlike cry he ran at the monster, his sword raised. The monster did not move until the last moment, and then with a brutally swift toss of his head he impaled the youth upon his horns...</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d Lily asked Ross pleasantly. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019d tell you where he is after you beat his mother, my dearest friend, to death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me or I\u2019ll shoot you,\u201d he replied, not very originally, but it still put a thrill of fear into Apollo\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d Apollo said gently.</p><p>Lily crossed her arms. \u201cGo ahead, then. I\u2019ll not give my son up to a rat like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean my son?\u201d he snapped back, stupid and irate.</p><p>Apollo lost what little patience he still had. \u201cDamn it, Montgomery, aren\u2019t you ever going to act?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, fine,\u201d the duke replied sulkily from behind him and shot Richard in the leg.</p><p>Richard fell to the ground, moaning.</p><p>Lily blinked. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>The duke glanced at his pistol and frowned. \u201cPulls a bit to the right. I was aiming for his groin.\u201d He toed Ross\u2019s pistols away from the writhing man and turned to Apollo. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know this entire business has been a loss to me\u2014a dead loss.\u201d</p><p>Lily blinked again and looked uncertainly at Apollo. \u201cHow\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Apollo pulled her into his arms. He was still quite shaken from having nearly lost her, and the warmth of her body was a balm. \u201cShh. There\u2019s no point in trying to get him to make sense. Best to just let him ramble. I learned that on the carriage ride to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was such a lovely pigeon,\u201d Montgomery said mournfully, watching Richard writhe on the ground. \u201cA secret marriage, a hidden heir. I could\u2019ve milked him for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were going to blackmail him for money?\u201d Lily asked.</p><p>\u201cMoney?\u201d The duke looked affronted. \u201cNothing so crass. Information, knowledge, leverage. That\u2019s the sort of stuff I adore. But\u201d\u2014Montgomery sighed gustily, folding his arms with his pistol dangling from one hand\u2014\u201cmy sentimental heart got the better of me. That, and I really do want this garden finished. Kilbourne is the most imaginative gardener I\u2019ve ever encountered.\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s eyes widened and she turned to Apollo as if only just now realizing something. \u201cYou brought him with you to meet me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt seemed like a good precaution. After all, I intended to flee with you from England and I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d be followed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you didn\u2019t trust him,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, mostly.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cBut he did help me get away from my uncle\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I shot Ross just now, too,\u201d the duke said brightly. \u201cShall I shoot Greaves as well? No doubt he deserves it and I\u2019ve another pistol in my pocket.\u201d</p><p>At which point Edwin Stump burst from the shrubbery, followed closely by the Duke of Wakefield and Captain Trevillion. All three were holding pistols and breathing rather hard.</p><p>Apollo blinked.</p><p>\u201cAre we late?\u201d Edwin asked, panting.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lily replied from Apollo\u2019s arms. She sounded rather querulous.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, His Grace the Ass hiding in the bushes,\u201d Apollo muttered. \u201cWhatever are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Kilbourne, you\u2019ve regained your voice,\u201d Wakefield drawled. \u201cPity, but I presume my wife is thrilled. And you are?\u201d He looked pointedly at Montgomery.</p><p>Montgomery bowed mockingly, still holding his pistol. \u201cMontgomery. And you\u2019re Wakefield, yes?\u201d</p><p>One of Wakefield\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cQuite.\u201d He turned to Apollo. \u201cI was told that we were here to save you. I see that I\u2019ve been sadly misinformed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would\u2019ve saved him had my brother been on time,\u201d Lily said, glaring at Edwin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been shot,\u201d Ross moaned from the ground.</p><p>George merely groaned.</p><p>Wakefield turned very slowly to Ross and said gently, \u201cLord Ross, I believe? Your son from your first marriage is playing with my wife at the moment. She seems to have grown quite fond of him in a very short time. Felicitations on finding him alive and well. It\u2019s not every day that one discovers one\u2019s heir.\u201d</p><p>Ross\u2019s lip curled and Apollo wished that Montgomery\u2019s aim had been better. \u201cThen I\u2019ll take him. He\u2019s my son, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think not,\u201d Wakefield murmured. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a rather distressing tale from two upstanding citizens regarding his mother\u2019s death. If you would rather I not investigate the matter further\u2014and I really think you would\u2014I suggest you never attempt to see your heir again.\u201d</p><p>For a moment it looked as if Ross would cry, and Apollo really couldn\u2019t find it in himself to care.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Edwin Stump said, and sat abruptly on a charred log. \u201cThat\u2019s over, then. I don\u2019t mind telling you, Lily, that I near had an apoplexy when I got that message from you.\u201d</p><p>Apollo frowned. \u201cWhat message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe message I had to slip to one of the footmen as I left Greaves House with George. I just hoped that Edwin would know what to do.\u201d Lily looked at him in wonder. \u201cAnd he did\u2014even if he was a bit late.\u201d</p><p>Edwin Stump actually looked bashful.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Apollo frowned. \u201cGeorge caught you at the house party after I left?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd kept a pistol on me practically all the way to London.\u201d</p><p>He felt his heart stop. Fool. He should\u2019ve realized he would put her in a position of danger when he fled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, love. I should\u2019ve never left you there.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou weren\u2019t to know he would do that\u2014and had you stayed you\u2019d be in Bedlam right now. You had to run, Apollo.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced, still not ready to absolve himself of blame. Things could\u2019ve turned out far, far worse. \u201cSo you slipped your brother a message to go to Trevillion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to go to your sister,\u201d Lily said. \u201cAfter all, she\u2019s a duchess. I thought that might help.\u201d</p><p>Trevillion cleared his throat. \u201cI decided His Grace might, in this case, be more useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why in God\u2019s name did you grab for George\u2019s pistol when you knew help was coming?\u201d Apollo asked.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t here yet and he was going to shoot you,\u201d she said, placing her palms on his chest. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let him.\u201d</p><p>His throat closed and he couldn\u2019t reply. All he could do was pull her into his arms and hold her close.</p><p>Someone cleared their voice.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care in the slightest.</p><p>Edwin toed George Greaves, who was still moaning very quietly. \u201cWhat are we going to do with him?\u201d He glanced at Ross and winced. \u201cThem?\u201d</p><p>Wakefield drew himself up. \u201cAs it\u2019s quite clear that Montgomery shot Ross to save Miss Goodfellow\u2019s life, I shall make a full report to the courts and deal with the matter myself. Sadly, as he\u2019s titled, he\u2019ll probably serve no time in prison. However, the scandal of trying to murder one of London\u2019s most famous actresses might make a sojourn abroad seem quite a nice prospect. As for Greaves...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe murdered those men,\u201d Lily said from Apollo\u2019s arms. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure of it. I just have no way of proving it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t!\u201d George gasped rather unconvincingly from the ground.</p><p>\u201cAs to that.\u201d Trevillion cleared his throat. \u201cI took the liberty of having the valet, Vance, detained after you left the house party. Montgomery told me that you recognized him, Lord Kilbourne. It seems Vance was in George Greaves\u2019s service before he went to William Greaves\u2019s employ. When I informed Vance that he\u2019d been seen on the night of the murders at the tavern he became quite talkative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d George screamed.</p><p>\u201cYou really ought to employ more intelligent assassins, Mr. Greaves.\u201d Trevillion smiled coldly. \u201cHe seemed to think I had all the evidence needed to hang him and confessed embarrassingly fast. And since you apparently never paid him well, he\u2019s quite vindictive. He told me in front of witnesses that you hired him to kill Lord Kilbourne\u2019s friends in an attempt to paint Kilbourne a murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d George whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid your father heard the confession and was stricken with the shock,\u201d Trevillion said softly.</p><p>\u201cMy uncle never knew?\u201d Apollo asked.</p><p>Trevillion shook his head. \u201cI think not. When I left Greaves House he\u2019d taken to his bed and a doctor had been sent for. They\u2019re not sure he\u2019ll recover.\u201d</p><p>George swore foully, red-tinged spittle flecking his lips. He glared at Apollo. \u201cYou should never have been the heir\u2014your line is tainted. Had Brightmore not intervened you would\u2019ve hanged for sure instead of being sent to Bedlam. Everyone knows you\u2019re insane\u2014everyone! I should\u2019ve killed you myself instead of sending Vance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we have your confession,\u201d Trevillion murmured gently. \u201cAnd in the presence of two dukes.\u201d</p><p>Trevillion bent to haul George to his feet, which put an end to his cursing. The captain looked quietly satisfied.</p><p>Wakefield nodded grimly. \u201cExcellent.\u201d He turned to Apollo. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to clear your name within days. Artemis will be very pleased\u2014and I won\u2019t have to worry anymore about her sneaking off with baskets of provisions for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo glad to put your mind at rest,\u201d Apollo said drily. He looked at Lily. \u201cShall we go see how Indio and Daff are faring with my sister\u2019s dogs?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and he took her hand, leading her from his garden. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>IT WAS VERY late\u2014well past midnight\u2014before Lily retired to bed. There had been the reunion with Indio, made even more chaotic by the duke\u2019s four dogs\u2014two greyhounds, a silly spaniel, and an elderly white lapdog\u2014all of whom Daffodil seemed to regard as very large play toys. There had been the rather nerve-racking introduction to Apollo\u2019s sister, who, no matter how nice she seemed, was after all a duchess. There had been a positively decadent bath followed by a very good late-night supper of roast duck and baby carrots.</p><p>So it was understandable that Lily didn\u2019t at first notice the very large man in her bed when she entered the room assigned to her.</p><p>When she did, she stopped dead and hissed, \u201cYou can\u2019t be in here!\u201d</p><p>The covers were pulled to his waist, but he appeared to be quite naked underneath.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Apollo asked, apparently having forgotten all the social niceties that someone must\u2019ve taught him as a small child.</p><p>\u201cBecause this is your sister\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. \u201cActually it\u2019s His Grace the Ass\u2019s house, but I do see your meaning. You know she\u2019s a floor above us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you even call him that?\u201d she asked as she began removing her bodice. \u201cHe seems a perfectly nice man, if a bit stiff, and as I understand it, he actually rescued you from Bedlam.\u201d</p><p>Apollo frowned ferociously. \u201cHe seduced my sister before they were married.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at him, eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s an ass. But mostly it\u2019s my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if Edwin chose to call you out over your very thorough debauchment of me...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d be well within his rights,\u201d he assured her. \u201cIn fact, he really ought to.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell if he was joking or not, and honestly she rather thought he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen have very odd minds,\u201d she commented as she slipped out of her skirt.</p> <p>\u201cWe do,\u201d he replied lazily. \u201cFor instance, I\u2019d rather like you to become my wife.\u201d</p><p>She was silent, frowning as she unlaced her stays.</p><p>After a moment he cleared his throat. \u201cThis is where many a gentleman might think that it\u2019s ladies who have odd minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do me the insult of comparing me to that worm,\u201d he said, quietly and seriously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said at once, because she was. Apollo was nothing like Richard and she more than anyone else knew that. \u201cBut you must understand: even without his violence, I don\u2019t think their marriage would\u2019ve been a happy one.\u201d</p><p>He rolled to his side and propped himself up on his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re still comparing,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn about bloodlines. I think today\u2019s events more than prove that only madmen do, really.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, pulling off her stays gingerly. \u201cYour family won\u2019t like an actress for your wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy family consists of Artemis and, I suppose by default, His Grace the Ass. Did you find either of them unwelcoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they won\u2019t be.\u201d He rose, gloriously nude, and walked to her, taking her hands. \u201cLily, my light, my love. What are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d she began and then couldn\u2019t answer because she didn\u2019t know what it was she feared. She looked up at him helplessly.</p><p>He smiled his gentle smile and brought her hand to his lips, tenderly kissing each fingertip. \u201cI love you and you love me. I might\u2019ve been in a little doubt before this afternoon, but when you flung yourself in front of a pistol, it did rather clarify things. And, since you love me and I love you, it is right and meet and wonderful that you and I become man and wife and spend the rest of our lives sleeping together and rising together and having masses of children together and living joyfully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMasses?\u201d she muttered a bit doubtfully, but fortunately he ignored her.</p><p>Apollo sank onto one knee there before her, with her only in her chemise and him in... nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cLily Stump,\u201d he said, his voice rasping a little as it always would, \u201cwill you take me as husband and be my wife? Will you be my sun and light all the days of my life and never make me regret bathing in a muddy pond?\u201d</p><p>And she laughed as she drew him up to kiss.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said against his lips. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>A cry broke from Ariadne\u2019s lips at the gruesome sight. The monster shook his head and Theseus\u2019s body fell to the ground, bloodied. She ran to kneel by the man, but saw at once that the wound was too deep and too terrible. Theseus looked up at her, his eyes wide in surprise, and gasped with his last breath, \u201cI am the hero. It is the monster who should die, not me.\u201d</p><p>And then his spirit left his body.</p><p>Ariadne bowed her head and said a prayer. When she raised it she saw the monster wading in the pool, washing the gore from his chest and head. She stood, but he did not look at her. In fact, he turned his back.</p><p>\u201cMonster!\u201d she called, but the moment the word left her lips, she knew it was wrong. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, softer. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a monster, no matter what others say.\u201d</p><p>At that he raised his bull head and finally turned to look at her.</p><p>There were tears in his beautiful brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cI do not know your name,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve never had one\u2014not a proper one, at least. So I\u2019ll call you Asterion\u2014ruler of the stars\u2014if that meets with your approval?\u201d</p><p>Gravely, Asterion bowed his head.</p><p>Ariadne held out her hand. \u201cWill you come with me out of the labyrinth? It is beautiful here in your garden, but no birds sing and I think it rather lonely.\u201d</p><p>So Asterion took Ariadne\u2019s hand and she, following the red thread from the spindle the queen had given her, retraced her steps out of the labyrinth. Of course it took many days, for even with the thread to follow, the labyrinth\u2019s corridors were long and winding. But Ariadne passed the time telling Asterion about the island outside the labyrinth, and the people who lived there.</p><p>When at last they reached the entrance of the labyrinth and Ariadne heard birds singing in the trees, she turned to Asterion with a joyful smile upon her face.</p><p>But what a surprise met her when she gazed upon her companion! For while Asterion still retained his coal-black hue, his massive shoulders, the horns of a bull, and the tail as well, his visage had changed to that of a man.</p><p>And with a man\u2019s lips and tongue came the power of speech. Asterion fell to his knees before Ariadne. \u201cGentle maiden, I owe you my life,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse and halting. \u201cFor years others have entered into my labyrinth bent on killing me. Only you saw me as a thinking being. A man with a soul. In this way you have broken my curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am glad of it,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ariadne and Asterion went to the golden castle. But how it had changed since she\u2019d last seen it! The great halls were empty, the courtiers and soldiers disappeared. Together Ariadne and Asterion wandered for many hours before they at last found the mad queen.</p><p>What tears the queen wept when she saw her son! For the first time in years she put down her spinning, and she opened wide her arms to receive him. As for the king? Why, he was quite dead. One morning he\u2019d grown irritated at the singing of sparrows on his balcony, and when in a fit of ire he\u2019d chased them, the balcony wall had given way, and the king had fallen to his death.</p><p>But the island was in chaos with no one to rule. The people crowded the streets, confused and fearful. So Asterion went to the king\u2019s balcony and raised his hands.</p><p>\u201cMy people,\u201d he shouted, and immediately all turned their heads to stare in wonder. \u201cMy people, I was born a beast, but by the kindness of Ariadne, I have become a man. I know violence, but I prefer peace. If you will accept me as your leader, I will try to rule more justly than my father and I will keep Ariadne by my side as my wife so that I never forget the importance of kindness.\u201d</p><p>And as the people cheered, Asterion turned to Ariadne and smiled with his new-formed human lips. \u201cWill you, my sweet maid? Will you be my wife and queen and tutor me in gentleness? Will you be my love forevermore?\u201d</p><p>Ariadne placed her palms on his dark cheeks and smiled up at him. \u201cI think you have no need of my tutoring, my lord, but if you will have me as wife, I will gladly wed you and be your love forevermore.\u201d</p><p>And so she did.</p><p>\u2014From The Minotaur</p><p>THREE MONTHS LATER...</p><p>Apollo stood with his adopted son and looked with pride at the newly planted oak. The tree stood beside the pond, gently waving dark-green leaves reflected in the clear water\u2019s surface. A sublime sight indeed.</p><p>Indio had slightly more down-to-earth thoughts about the new planting. \u201cCan I climb it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Apollo said firmly, for he\u2019d found that simple, blunt statements were least likely to be wriggled out of by a crafty seven-year-old boy. \u201cAnd Daff can\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>The little dog barked and spun in a circle at her name, nearly landing in the pond.</p><p>\u201cAwww!\u201d Indio moaned in disappointment and then almost immediately perked up at another thought. \u201cCan I start our picnic now?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd eat the leftover wedding cake first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can get Maude\u2019s permission,\u201d Apollo replied, because he was certainly no fool.</p><p>\u201cHuzzah!\u201d Indio whooped. \u201cCome on, Daff!\u201d</p><p>And he and the dog raced off in the direction of the ruined theater. Apollo followed more slowly, inspecting the progress of his garden as he went. He and his gardeners had successfully planted more than a score of trees as well as flowering shrubs. Many of the trees and shrubs would take years to mature, so to fill in he\u2019d planted faster-growing vegetation such as evergreens, both to provide background and to give shelter to the tender hardwoods. Along the paths he\u2019d also planted annual flowers, which made bright pools of color.</p><p>\u201cThere you are.\u201d</p><p>He turned at the sound of his wife\u2019s voice. Lily was wearing scarlet, his favorite color on her, and she stood out like a bright poppy in his garden.</p><p>He smiled into her green eyes and held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Indio has rushed off to ravage the rest of the wedding cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, someone has to eat it,\u201d she replied, taking his hand. \u201cMaude baked far too much. There\u2019s plenty more at home.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d married only three days ago, in a small private ceremony marked mostly by the abundance of Maude\u2019s seed cake. They\u2019d been eating it ever since, often on the picnics Lily, Indio, and Maude brought for his luncheon at the garden.</p><p>\u201cAnd how have you spent your morning?\u201d he teased Lily, for he knew very well what she\u2019d been doing.</p><p>Artemis had given them a small town house not far from the garden. She had insisted it was a wedding present, but Apollo expected to repay her the cost of the house when he came into his inheritance. From the reports, it wouldn\u2019t be too long.</p><p>\u201cHave you any idea how hard it is to paint a room?\u201d Lily asked. \u201cI thought peach for my writing room, but then it turned the most ghastly shade of orange on the wall. The painters are going over it now in yellow, although with my luck it\u2019ll turn some terrible shade of brown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, listening more to the sound of her voice than to her words.</p><p>\u201cNext I\u2019m considering painting your study lavender,\u201d she continued, \u201cperhaps with pink stripes.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cI am paying attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She took a deep breath, suddenly serious. \u201cI\u2019ve something for you.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, turning to face her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She fumbled in the pocket of her dress. \u201cI found it this morning while I was unpacking the chest I had at the theater, and I thought...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>She held out his notebook.</p><p>He took it wonderingly as she continued to talk, her words coming more and more rapidly.</p><p>\u201cI found it after the soldiers came and I kept it. I don\u2019t know why because at that point I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever see you again. But then when I uncovered it this morning, I knew... that is...\u201d</p><p>She reached out and flipped the pages of the notebook until the last page lay open in his hands. She\u2019d written something there. He bent and read.</p> <p>I love you, Beast.</p><p>I love you, Caliban.</p><p>I love you, Apollo.</p><p>I love you, Romeo.</p><p>I love you, Smith.</p> <p>I love you, Gardener.</p><p>I love you, Aristocrat.</p><p>I love you, Lover.</p><p>I love you, Husband.</p><p>I love you, Friend.</p><p>I love you, You.</p> <p>He inhaled and looked up.</p><p>She was twisting her hands together. \u201cFor a writer, I\u2019m awfully ineloquent. I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>He dropped the notebook and pulled her into his arms, kissing her passionately. He held her sweet face between his palms and caressed her temples with his thumbs as he opened his mouth over hers, inhaling her gasp.</p><p>When at last he drew back, he whispered against her lips, \u201cDo you know where we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured, her eyes closed. \u201cAt the heart of the maze.\u201d And when she opened her lichen-green eyes he saw all the love he\u2019d ever hoped for shining in her eyes just for him. \u201cAt your heart\u2014and mine.\u201d </p>  </body></html>"]
