But now that he was staring into its jaws, he realized what she had meant.</p> <p>A Synestryn demon crouched behind a run-down three-story building, its eyes glowing a bright, feral green. It was huge, making the Dumpster beside it look like a milk crate. Heavy muscles bulged in its limbs, quivering in anticipation of the kill. Its breath billowed from all four of its nostrils, creating pale plumes of steam in the cold night air. Bright moonlight gleamed across its skin, reflected off the viscous, poisonous fluid that leaked from its pores.</p><p>Logan had never seen anything like it before, but the human, Steve, groaning in pain on the pockmarked asphalt near the demon\u2019s feet, was testament to the power of its poison.</p><p>The man\u2019s wife, Pam, stood pressed against the cold brick, staring in horror at her husband. Her pregnant belly protruded from her slim body, promising the hope of a new generation.</p><p>Logan could not let anything happen to that child.</p><p>Steve was still moving, but if Logan didn\u2019t do something soon, he wasn\u2019t going to survive. Not that there was much Logan could do. After days without feeding he was weak, his powers now dwindled to the point he barely had the ability to walk upright.</p> <p>Hunger churned inside him, demanding that he seek out the blood he needed, but there was no time to feed. No time to gather his strength. No time to call for help.</p><p>If this couple and their child\u2014a child he\u2019d worked so hard to see created\u2014were killed, many of his people would starve. Logan could not allow that to happen.</p><p>The nameless creature lunged for Logan, bounding up from the pavement in a powerful leap so fast it made the thing look like a streak of moonlight.</p><p>Logan pitched his body to the left, hoping to avoid the attack. His shoulder slammed into a brick wall. Pain lanced across his back and down his spine. He slid to the dirty ground before he could catch himself.</p><p>The demon careened into a loading dock door, busting through it like tissue paper. The metal screamed as it gave way. Corrugated strips flew into the darkness of the run-down building, leaving behind a giant gaping hole.</p><p>A blow like that had to have stunned the demon, or even knocked it out.</p> <p>Logan needed to carry Steve away from this place, and he knew the man\u2019s wife would follow. He\u2019d made it only a few yards when he saw the feral green glow of two large eyes within the gaping hole in the doorway.</p><p>A sickening sense of defeat churned in his empty belly. Not only was the Synestryn still on its feet, but Logan now knew he was completely outclassed. If barreling through that metal door didn\u2019t slow the thing down, there was nothing Logan, as weak as he was, could do to stop it.</p><p>The demon lumbered through the opening, angling itself for another attack.</p><p>Steve pushed himself to his knees. He wavered there, next to a frozen mud puddle, between a discarded mattress and a rotting wooden pallet. His skin was roughened by goose bumps. With every passing second, poison went deeper into his system.</p><p>Time to grab the couple and run. Leave the Synestryn for someone else. It wasn\u2019t his place to destroy the demon. That was best left to those who were stronger than he.</p><p>Which currently included ninety percent of the planet\u2019s occupants, no doubt.</p><p>Logan shoved himself to his feet and sprinted across the slick pavement toward Steve. The tread of his boots slipped over the remnants of dirty snow left from the last storm, but he managed to stay upright and close the distance.</p><p>Behind him, the demon snorted out a heavy breath.</p> <p>Logan spun around to face the thing, putting his body squarely between it and the pregnant woman.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d whispered the woman in a voice trembling with fear. \u201cSave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d ordered Logan. \u201cRun. I\u2019ll protect him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of your child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. He needs his father.\u201d</p><p>There was no more time to argue. The demon charged.</p><p>The woman let out a frightened whimper. The heartbeat of the baby boy inside her sped up, as if sensing the danger it could not see.</p><p>That child deserved to live. If this demon got hold of the mother, both she and the baby would die because of the blood flowing through their veins.</p><p>The injustice made outrage unfurl in Logan\u2019s body, spreading dark wings of anger. That demon was not going to take the child\u2014not while Logan still drew breath.</p><p>Claws extended from Logan\u2019s fingertips and his fangs lengthened. His natural weapons were nothing compared to the wicked blades the Theronai usually carried, but he refused to go down without a fight.</p><p>In the back of his mind, a hysterical part of him giggled at the notion of defeating such a creature. At his full strength he\u2019d have a chance, but he was far from that\u2014so far he couldn\u2019t even remember what it felt like not to be weak and hungry and cold.</p><p>But he had anger on his side, and it fueled him now, giving strength to his wasted limbs.</p><p>With a burst of speed, Logan charged the oncoming monster. He leaped to the top of a trash can and propelled himself over the thing\u2019s shoulder. His claws dug deep into the demon\u2019s slippery flesh, making it howl. Slick, mucuslike poison collected under his fingernails.</p><p>Logan straddled the demon\u2019s back, trying to choke it with his legs. One wide paw batted at him, its talons raking across his forearm.</p><p>Pain sliced up Logan\u2019s arm. Poison entered his system.</p><p>His first instinct was to shove the last of his dwindling reserves of power into creating an antidote, but there was no time for that. He had to kill the Synestryn before the poison incapacitated him, or being poisoned would be the least of his problems. And Steve\u2019s.</p><p>The creature headed for the cavelike shelter of the building, carrying Logan along for the ride. As they shoved through the opening, jagged metal sliced his skin, tearing a cry of pain from his lungs.</p><p>Logan fished beneath his coat for the dagger he kept hidden there. He stabbed it into the top of the creature\u2019s head, hoping to skewer its brain. Its skull was too thick and the blade slid to the side.</p><p>The cut to its scalp was deep, making the beast roar in pain. It reached back, grabbed Logan by the head, and whipped him off.</p><p>Logan was slammed against the concrete floor. Or maybe it was a wall. His vision was full of bright lights, so it was hard to tell. All he knew was pain and a foggy weakness that kept him pinned to the ground.</p><p>A deep vibration beneath him told him that the demon wasn\u2019t finished yet. It was still on its feet and it was getting closer.</p><p>Steve was growing weaker by the second. He pushed himself to his feet, and the effort left him panting.</p><p>Pam was by his side in an instant, her precious face staring up at him in worry. \u201cWe need to get you to a hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that won\u2019t help,\u201d he told her. As one of the Gerai, he knew enough about the Synestryn to realize that there was nothing a human doctor could do for him. \u201cI need Logan.\u201d</p><p>His wife\u2019s face paled as she realized what he meant to do. \u201cYou can\u2019t. You can\u2019t go in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice. I\u2019ll die without his help. And he\u2019ll die without mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d whispered Pam. Tears flowed down her cheeks. \u201cYou can\u2019t go in there. Please.\u201d</p><p>A wave of weakness shook Steve, telling him he was running out of time. \u201cGo. Someplace public. Well lit. I need to know you and the baby are safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time to argue. You\u2019re going. But I won\u2019t be long. Promise.\u201d The vow settled over him, comforting him. He kissed her mouth, praying it wouldn\u2019t be the last time. \u201cGo, love. For our baby. Go.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Sniffed.</p><p>Steve gently pushed Pam away. She stared at him, her expression a mix of fear and love. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare die.\u201d</p><p>Steve hid his weakness the best that he could as he bent down and picked up a discarded section of two-by-four. It wasn\u2019t much of a weapon, but he\u2019d find a way to make it work.</p><p>He\u2019d promised to be quick, and he\u2019d never once broken a promise to his sweet Pam.</p><p>The color of suffering was a dark, sickly yellow, and Hope Serrien knew she\u2019d see it on a night like tonight.</p><p>A cold front had swept down over the city, slaying any hope that spring was coming soon. Power lines glistened with a layer of ice, and icicles dripped from street signs. The sidewalk under her feet was slick, but even that couldn\u2019t keep her indoors tonight. A night like this brought death to those who had no place to escape the cold.</p><p>And cold wasn\u2019t the only enemy on the streets. There were things out here. Dark, evil things. People were going missing, and Hope feared they hadn\u2019t simply moved on to warmer climes.</p><p>Sister Olive was a middle-aged woman who ran the homeless shelter where Hope volunteered. She\u2019d insisted that Hope stay indoors tonight, but the nun had never truly felt the frigid desperation of having no place to go. She\u2019d always had a warm, safe place where she knew she belonged.</p><p>Not everyone was so lucky.</p><p>Hope shifted the canvas bag on her shoulder and walked faster. She always carried sandwiches and blankets in case she ran into those in need\u2014those who refused to come to the shelter. With any luck, they\u2019d all have better sense than to be stubborn on a night like this.</p><p>She scanned the street, paying close attention to the dark crevices between buildings and inside recessed doorways. That glowing, yellow aura of suffering was not hard to miss.</p><p>Or maybe Hope had just had a lot of practice at spotting it.</p><p>If Sister Olive knew how Hope found people in need\u2014if she knew Hope could see auras\u2014the nun would probably have her committed. Good thing that wasn\u2019t something that came up in normal conversation. Hope wasn\u2019t sure she could lie to a nun.</p><p>A flicker of unease made Hope pull her coat closed more tightly around her neck. She\u2019d seen things at night\u2014things she knew couldn\u2019t be real. Dark, monstrous things that slinked between shadows, hiding from sight. Their auras were black. Silent. She couldn\u2019t read them, which made her question whether the monsters even truly existed outside her imagination.</p><p>She probably should have brought one of the men along with her to ward off any problems. But how would she explain to her escort how she knew where to go? It was better to do this alone and keep her secrets. Fitting in among normal people was hard enough when she didn\u2019t draw attention to her ability.</p><p>Hope forced herself to head toward the one place she hadn\u2019t yet searched for those missing souls. She hated getting near the run-down Tyler building\u2014it brought up too much pain and confusion, too many bad memories. She\u2019d promised herself that tonight she\u2019d put her ridiculous fears aside and look for her friends there.</p><p>The three-story brick structure rose up into the night sky. The lighting here hadn\u2019t been maintained, leaving deep pools of darkness to hover about the building like an aura of decay.</p><p>A heavy thud and a screech of wrenching metal rose up from behind the structure.</p><p>There was definitely someone back there. Or something .</p><p>Images of those dark creatures flickered in her mind. Her muscles locked up in fear, and for a moment, she stood frozen to the pavement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The real danger out here tonight was the cold, not monsters, and the longer people were left to suffer in it, the more dangerous it became.</p><p>Hope forced her legs to move. Her first steps were slow and shuffling, as if her own body was working against her. Then slowly, she picked up speed, shoving all thoughts of monsters from her mind.</p><p>As she crept down the alley that led to the back of the building, she heard more noises she couldn\u2019t quite identify. There was a grunt of pain and the rattle of wood tumbling about. Once, she almost thought she heard a woman\u2019s voice, but she couldn\u2019t be sure. The only woman she knew who was too stubborn to come in out of the cold was her friend Rory.</p><p>Hope cleared the corner, and the first thing she saw was the gaping hole where the overhead door had been ripped open and partially off its track. The metal looked like it had been punched in with a giant fist, leaving jagged shards behind.</p> <p>From inside the opening, Hope saw a brief flash of color\u2014the sickly yellow of suffering.</p><p>Rory.</p><p>Desperate fear washed over her, making her lurch forward through the ragged opening. It was too dark inside to see, so she fished inside her satchel for the flashlight she always carried.</p><p>A feral growl of rage rose up from her left. It wasn\u2019t a human sound. Not even close.</p><p>Primal fear surged through her, and she had to fight the need to curl into the smallest space possible so she could hide.</p> <p>Her search for the flashlight became frantic, her gloves hindering her as she fished around in her bag.</p><p>She located the hard, heavy cylinder, only to have it slip from her grasp.</p><p>Heavy, pounding steps shook the floor. A woman cried out in fear somewhere to Hope\u2019s right.</p><p>She grasped onto the flashlight and powered it on as she ripped it from the bag. The beam of light bobbed around, catching motes of dust as it passed.</p><p>Hope aimed it toward the sound of torment. The light bounced off something huge and shiny. Something pulsing with muscle, and moving so fast she couldn\u2019t keep the light trained on it.</p><p>Its aura was black nothingness.</p> <p>Panic gripped her tight. She needed more light to ward off the thing. Something as hideous as that would hate the light. She felt it on an instinctive level, as if she\u2019d been taught how to protect herself from the monster.</p><p>Hope swung the light around to the employee entrance next to the pulverized overhead door, hoping there would be a switch nearby. Surely, whoever came in through that door would need to have access to lights, right?</p><p>The beam of light shook in her grasp, vibrating with the trembling of her hands as she searched. It seemed to take forever, but as she neared the door, she saw a series of switches.</p><p>She sprinted over the dusty floor, praying that the power here was still on\u2014that whoever was trying to sell this place had left the lights on for potential buyers.</p><p>Hope shoved all four switches up at once. There was a muted thunk, then an electric buzz. Light poured down over the room, and while many of the bulbs were burned out, it seemed as bright as the surface of the sun compared to a moment ago.</p><p>She blinked her eyes and turned, forcing herself to look at what her flashlight had touched.</p><p>The room was large and open. Lines that had been painted on the floor to outline separate areas were now covered in dust. A stack of wooden pallets had toppled, and the dust from their fall had not yet settled.</p><p>Across the room was a giant, hulking creature poised over someone she couldn\u2019t quite see. All she could tell was that they were surrounded by that yellow aura of hunger and suffering she\u2019d come to know so well on the streets.</p> <p>The beast\u2019s head swiveled toward her, the movement sinuous and fluid. Its green eyes fixed on her, and she swore they flared brighter for a brief moment.</p><p>An unnatural fear rose up inside Hope, screaming for her to run. She knew what this thing was. She didn\u2019t know its name or where it came from, but she knew that it wanted her blood.</p><p>A roar filled her ears as a distant memory tried to surface. Her head spun and she clutched the wall behind her to stay on her feet.</p><p>Please, God. Not now.</p><p>As much as Hope wanted to remember her past, she wouldn\u2019t survive the distraction. She fought off the memory, mourning its loss even before it passed.</p><p>The beast snorted out a heavy breath, sending four curls of steam into the cold air. Its mouth opened, revealing sharp, wicked teeth.</p><p>Hope was sure the thing wore a sinister grin.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d shouted a man.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see him, but it was his aura that peeked out from behind the monster. It pulsed with a flare of bright blue courage, and a second later, the monster roared as if it had been struck.</p><p>Now that its attention was no longer focused on Hope, her knees unlocked and started working again. She needed to find help. Fast.</p><p>She turned to do just that, when she caught a glimpse of an aura peeking out from behind the toppled pile of pallets.</p><p>Hope rushed over and found a man lying unconscious on the floor. One side of his face had darkened with a bruise, and in his loose grip was a board covered in the same shiny stuff that coated the monster\u2019s skin.</p><p>His aura was faint, the colors flickering like the flames of a dying fire.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to make it if she didn\u2019t do something.</p><p>Across the room, a crash sounded as the fight wore on. Hope didn\u2019t waste time figuring out who was winning. It was going to take all her strength to get this man out of harm\u2019s way. Just in case it was the monster who won.</p><p>She shoved the pallet pinning him down off his legs. His jeans were dark with blood.</p><p>Hope patted his face, hoping to wake him. His eyes fluttered open, but she doubted his ability to focus. His pupils were huge and a cold sweat covered his brow. \u201cLogan. I need Logan. Poison. He can fix it.\u201d</p><p>Hope didn\u2019t know how he knew that, but she doubted he\u2019d waste his breath lying.</p><p>Her gaze slid across the room to the fight. The man battling that beast must be Logan. She had to help him. She had no idea how to defeat the monster, but she\u2019d seen a length of metal pipe back near the door, and she wasn\u2019t afraid to use it.</p><p>Logan looked up from the floor where he landed. The spots cleared just in time for him to see the demon\u2019s giant, slimy foot hurling toward his head.</p><p>Logan rolled aside, dodging at the last instant. Chips of concrete flew into his face, stinging as they hit. He smelled his blood a moment before he felt the hot trickle of it sliding down his cheek.</p><p>The creature\u2019s foot was raised, poised for another attack. Logan\u2019s body shook with weakness, so cold he could barely feel his limbs. Only the dull throb of pain managed to get through the growing numbness of his body.</p><p>He was running out of time. Soon, the poison would incapacitate him, making him an easy meal.</p><p>There was no way Logan was walking away from this alive. The child had to be his first priority. He just needed to buy Pam enough time to escape. If her child survived, he could one day save others of Logan\u2019s race.</p><p>The thought brought him a sliver of solace.</p><p>It was time to pull out all the stops. He gathered up a bit of power and burst from the ground, shoving his dagger deep into the demon\u2019s groin. The beast howled. Black blood spurted from the wound.</p><p>Logan shoved the blade sideways to slice open a large wound before jerking it out. He stumbled backward as the demon clutched at its wound, trying to stop the flow of blood. Not that it would do any good. That blow was fatal. It was just a question of how long it would take the demon to bleed out and whether Logan would survive until it did.</p><p>It thrashed around, spraying blood across the floor in a black arc. One giant fist lashed out at Logan, knocking him back into a wall. Pain radiated out from his spine, but at least now he was out of the way of more blows.</p><p>The demon\u2019s eyes flared bright green as they fixed on him. He saw a streak of movement, heard a battle cry. A woman ran across the floor, wielding a pipe like a sword.</p><p>Logan screamed for her to stop, but he was weak and out of breath. All he managed to get out was a growl of warning too low to reach her.</p><p>She slammed the pipe into the demon\u2019s leg. It roared in anger and turned around to face the new threat.</p><p>She hit it again and jumped back out of its reach. It took an awkward step toward her and slipped on its own blood. It toppled to the ground, nearly crushing the woman beneath it. She got out of the way just in time, backing up until she hit a large wooden crate.</p><p>Black blood pooled under the demon. Its tongue swept out to lap up its own blood in a vain attempt to heal itself. But it was too late for that. It was bleeding too fast.</p><p>Finally, with a last shuddering breath, the demon died.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time to revel in the kill or celebrate their victory. Logan staggered away to where Steve had landed, so he could rid the man of poison. He\u2019d just made it to Steve\u2019s side when his legs simply gave out.</p><p>The longer he waited to finish this, the more likely it was that the scent of his blood would draw other Synestryn to him.</p><p>Steve, his family, and the mystery woman needed to be long gone before that happened.</p><p>Logan closed his eyes and concentrated on manufacturing an antidote to the poison within his veins. It was slow, and every bit of energy he used had to be dragged out of the deepest recesses of his body. Each spark of power slowed his heart. His breathing became shallow, and he was so cold that his breath no longer misted in the frigid air.</p><p>By the time he was finished, he was blind, shivering uncontrollably, and could barely move. Even his own head was too heavy to support.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t draw the antidote from his veins as he normally would have done. There was no syringe and no time. Instead, he closed his mouth over Steve\u2019s and forced the antidote through his saliva glands and into the human\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Moments later, Steve moved. The movement was weak at first, then grew as the man\u2019s strength returned.</p><p>\u201cYou need blood,\u201d said Steve.</p><p>\u201cNot yours. Poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find help.\u201d Like a rag doll, he moved where Steve pushed him, too weary to even speak and tell him not to bother. There wasn\u2019t time.</p><p>Cold sank into his body\u2014a bone-deep cold he knew would never leave him. His breathing began to falter and his heart\u2019s rhythm stuttered as it slowed.</p><p>Pain and cold surrounded him as death came for him. And as Sibyl had said, it was not going to be gentle with Logan. It was going to scrape every last breath from his lungs and wring every last beat from his heart, forcing him to endure every second of pain and cold and hunger. He would find no peace in oblivion.</p><p>There was still so much work to do and now he was leaving his brothers to do it all alone. But selfishly, that was not his last thought. His last thought was how much he wished for one single moment of warmth before he died.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Hope stared in shock at the scene that played out before her. One moment that poisoned man had been at death\u2019s door, and the next, he was on his feet, heading straight for Hope. All from a kiss from Logan\u2014a man too beautiful for words.</p><p>Logan lay still and pale, his face a work of art even in his suffering. And he was suffering. His aura did not lie. It was the color of bile\u2014of pain and sickness\u2014streaked with the bright red of pain, tainted with black shards of hopelessness.</p><p>His face was gaunt, with stark shadows under his cheekbones. Dark hair fell over his wide forehead, highlighting the striking paleness of his skin. Blue tinged his full lips and she fought the urge to warm them with her own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hope was still staring in shock as the poisoned man came toward her. His movements were a bit shaky, but purpose filled his every stride. \u201cYou have to help him. He needs your blood.\u201d</p><p>A spike of fear struck her as she realized she knew nothing about these men or what they wanted. The mention of blood had her mind reeling, going through all the ritualistic killings she\u2019d heard of over the years, the whispers of what might have befallen those who\u2019d gone missing. The things humans would do to one another were sickening.</p><p>Hope backed away, but the stranger caught her arm. \u201cPlease help him. He\u2019s dying and needs blood. I have to find my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call for an ambulance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know this is a lot to accept, but look over there.\u201d He pointed to the sagging corpse of the monster. \u201cThat thing is real, as are a lot of other things in this world. Right now, you need to accept that fact and save a dying man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s mouth tightened in anxious frustration. \u201cGo to him. Tell him you offer to help him. He\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d</p><p>That made no sense. \u201cStop it,\u201d she said, jerking her arm out of his grasp.</p><p>Love brighter than any she\u2019d ever seen coursed through his aura, twining with fear. \u201cI need to find my wife. She\u2019s out there alone, pregnant and scared out of her mind.\u201d</p> <p>His wife was a lucky woman. Hope had never known a man who loved as deeply as this one did.</p><p>He stared down at her, worry twisting his face. \u201cIf I could help Logan myself, I would, but I was poisoned. He saved my life. Please. Please save his.\u201d</p><p>With that, the man turned and left to find his wife, disappearing through the opening in the metal door in an awkward, hurried sprint.</p><p>Hope looked down at Logan. His aura had shrunk. The colors dimmed. He had only a few minutes left to live.</p><p>She glanced over at the dead monster. He\u2019d killed it. He\u2019d apparently saved that man from poison somehow.</p><p>There were a lot of holes in Hope\u2019s memories\u2014things she would never know about herself. But there was one thing she knew for a fact: People who would willingly sacrifice themselves for another were rare in this world. She could not stand by and do nothing while one of them died.</p> <p>She fell to her knees beside his body, ripping the gloves from her fingers so she could check for a pulse and make sure he was still breathing.</p><p>His leather coat hung open along his front, letting the cold sink into his body. If she didn\u2019t do something, she feared he wouldn\u2019t survive until an ambulance arrived.</p><p>Hope stripped out of her coat and covered his torso with it, praying the heat clinging to the quilted fabric would be enough to see him through. Immediately, the frigid air slid through her sweatshirt, its icy fingers stealing away her warmth.</p><p>She ignored the chill and jerked a blanket from her bag, sending a stack of sandwiches flying. She tucked that around him as well to keep him warm while help arrived.</p><p>With one hand, she pulled her cell phone from her back pocket, while feeling for his pulse with the other hand. It was faint, but there.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d she whispered to the stranger. \u201cHelp is on the way.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d just dialed 9 when the man\u2019s eyes fluttered open. They were a pale, silvery gray\u2014so light that they seemed to almost glow in the darkness. She\u2019d never seen eyes like his before. The color was mesmerizing, luring her to stare and keep staring.</p><p>Hope was sucked in by his gaze for a moment before she remembered what she was doing. \u201cYou need to hold on. I\u2019m calling for an ambulance now. I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d</p> <p>She moved to finish dialing. The phone was knocked from her hand and went flying across the concrete.</p><p>He\u2019d moved so fast she hadn\u2019t seen his hand strike out until it was too late. Shock streaked through her, and by the time she\u2019d processed what he\u2019d done, he\u2019d grabbed a fistful of her hair and jerked her head to the side.</p><p>His eyes fixed on her throat, and she was sure she saw light spilling from them.</p><p>Fear cut off her scream. Her body seized up. All she could do was stare at him and wait for him to release her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he growled, letting out a rough, animal sound.</p><p>He became a blur of movement and enveloped her body in a crushing hug. He smelled of snow and desperation. His aura changed, pulsing with surges of bright blue victory. She felt the chill of his lips; then a sharp pain stabbed her neck. A moment later, a heavy, languid feeling fell over her, pinning her in place.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move. She couldn\u2019t fight. And somewhere, a whispering presence in her mind told her she didn\u2019t even want to try.</p><p>As his grip on her tightened and the ravenous tugging at her throat intensified, Hope just let go and drifted within his grasp.</p><p>He grew warmer. Or maybe she was getting colder. She couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>Pain that had been with her only moments ago turned to pleasure. Her body swelled with it, expanding with light and color. Tingling waves of warmth shivered through her limbs and pooled in her belly. A giggle bubbled within her, but she was too weak to let it out.</p><p>That pleasure grew until even the memory of pain was distant and inconsequential. All that mattered was drifting inside this cushion of comfort and purpose.</p><p>Whoever he was, whatever he was doing to her, Hope knew in her soul that he\u2019d awakened something within her that would never again be lulled to sleep.</p><p>Power roared in the woman\u2019s blood, stronger than any he\u2019d ever tasted. Including the blood of the powerful Theronai Helen. Logan drank it down as survival instincts took over. He was heedless of his prey, gripping her tight so she couldn\u2019t fight or flee.</p><p>He needed her, and he wasn\u2019t going to let her go.</p><p>Weakness fell away as power seethed inside him, stretching his cells. Her blood was rich, purer than any he\u2019d ever tasted. He couldn\u2019t get enough. Each sucking gulp filled him more, driving away the pain of hunger and biting cold.</p><p>Warmth suffused him, making him giddy with relief. His cock stirred for the first time in centuries, shocking him. But even that shock could not penetrate the joyous feeling of no longer being hungry.</p><p>Her heart fluttered, struggling to pump blood that was not there. Her breathing faltered, and her hands fell limp at her sides. A quiet sound of pleasure spilled from her mouth.</p><p>It was that sound that saved her life.</p><p>Logan finally overcame the drunken high her blood gave him enough to realize he was killing her.</p><p>Anger at his carelessness swept through him as he willed the puncture wounds on her neck to close and ripped his mouth away from her skin. She lay limp and helpless in his grasp. Too pale. Too weak.</p><p>Her honey-colored hair splayed across the sleeve of his black coat. Her eyes slid open, and in them he saw betrayal.</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d look at him that way until he realized what she\u2019d tried to do here tonight. She wore no coat against the cold, but there was one her size draped over his lap. A blanket lay crumpled between them. Individually wrapped sandwiches sat a few feet away, discarded on the floor.</p><p>He suddenly remembered her words, her sweet voice reassuring him that an ambulance was on the way.</p><p>She\u2019d come to him, offering help, and he\u2019d nearly killed her.</p><p>Guilt bore down on Logan, driving away the intoxicating haze of finally being full after so many years of hunger. Only seconds had passed, but even those had pushed her closer to death.</p><p>She needed fluids. Human blood. He didn\u2019t dare risk giving her his own for fear the shock to her system would kill her, or that some trace of poison lingered there. And even if his blood didn\u2019t kill her, he couldn\u2019t risk leaving her drugged by the narcotic effects his blood could cause.</p><p>She needed her memories of tonight purged so they could not draw Synestryn to her, but she was too weak for that. He\u2019d have to find her later, after the humans had restored her health. After he had checked and made sure that Steve, Pam, and their child were safe.</p><p>Logan gathered up her body and rose to his feet. Muscles that had been withered for decades flexed, strong and solid in his limbs. The leather of his coat creaked against the stretch of his biceps. He reveled in that power\u2014in feeling whole and strong, as he was meant to be.</p><p>There was a hospital not far from here. He ran toward it, his body gliding smoothly over the frozen ground. Buildings blurred past him as he moved. Wind tore at his face, but could not penetrate the warmth she\u2019d given him.</p><p>Buoyant elation rose inside him, celebrating his survival. The woman in his arms was responsible for that, and he was not going to let her gift cause her death.</p><p>Logan would save her, and then when he did, he was going to find a way to repay her. He\u2019d see to it that she was protected and cared for for the rest of her life.</p><p>The fact that she was heavily blooded, and therefore a perfect candidate for Project Lullaby, was only going to make that easier.</p><p>Logan cleared the emergency room doors and spotted the nurse behind the desk. She was young and plump, with a harried expression on her face and a name tag that read BARB. In one single instant, Barb\u2019s gaze moved over Logan\u2019s rescuer and dismissed her as unimportant. Beneath her notice.</p><p>\u201cWhat drugs is she on?\u201d asked the nurse as Logan approached.</p><p>Annoyance rose to the surface, tightening Logan\u2019s mouth. He refused to waste time arguing with Barb. Instead, he stared into her eyes and grabbed a hold of her mind.</p><p>Her face went slack and she swayed on her feet for a moment. Logan stilled her thoughts of disdain for Hope and replaced them with something else. He wove within her mind a series of emotional responses to events that never happened, implanting fleeting memories of Barb and Hope laughing and crying together. He borrowed from thoughts of Barb\u2019s sister, and connected them to Hope, creating a temporary, artificial connection.</p><p>\u201cYou love this woman like a sister, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Logan.</p><p>Pain creased Barb\u2019s face and tears filled her eyes as Logan let go of her mind. \u201cOh God. What happened to her?\u201d</p><p>Logan filled his voice with compulsion, refusing to leave Hope\u2019s care to chance. \u201cShe needs a blood transfusion. Fluids. Immediately. Move!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a gurney!\u201d shouted Barb.</p><p>Behind the desk, people scurried to obey.</p><p>Logan laid the woman on the clean white sheets. In the bright fluorescent lighting, he could see how beautiful she was. Her features were elegant, with high arching eyebrows and smooth, flawless skin. Her bone structure was model perfect, exquisite in its symmetry. Even now, with death hovering nearby, she had a regal beauty few humans possessed.</p><p>It was going to be a long time before he stopped seeing her face every time he closed his eyes. Even longer before he stopped seeing that look of betrayal shining in her gaze.</p><p>Logan turned and left her in the capable hands of her own people.</p><p>He\u2019d done what he could. It was time to go and plan her place within Project Lullaby. His brother Tynan would help him decide where she would best belong\u2014where she\u2019d be happiest. They\u2019d decide which man would be strong enough to ensure the continuation of her amazing bloodline.</p><p>The thought of putting her into the hands of another man gave him pause, but he assured himself it was only an aftereffect of taking so much of her blood. He felt connected. As if she were now part of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he liked it.</p><p>That alone was warning enough for Logan to back away. He couldn\u2019t become personally entangled in the life of a human woman. Their roles were set. Immovable.</p><p>She would be paired with a human male who would make her happy\u2014one who would complement the power flowing in her veins, rather than dilute it. They\u2019d bring children into the world who could save Logan\u2019s race from starvation. She was a source of power. Food. It was as simple as that.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t nearly enough.</p> <p>Logan fought the urge to slip back into the emergency room to check on her. The less time he spent with her, the better. He couldn\u2019t grow any more attached than he already was. It was time to hand her off to Tynan and get back to the mystery that had brought him here.</p><p>He still had yet to find the address that had been written in blood on his bathroom mirror a few days ago, along with the message You have not been forgotten. You are not alone.</p><p>Between the women and children who\u2019d been rescued from the Synestryn, and the deaths of Angus and Gilda, Dabyr had been in an uproar. His presence there had been necessary to help people stay calm and positive. Grief and fear were enemies Project Lullaby could scarcely afford.</p><p>Tonight had been his first chance to seek out the address. He\u2019d gotten close, but the frantic call for help from Steve had distracted him. And then the woman had distracted him even more.</p><p>It was time for Logan to get back to the job at hand. He needed to find the reason for the mysterious message on his mirror and make sure it posed no threat to his race.</p> <p>With any luck at all, he\u2019d find a man with the same vibrant power in his blood that Logan\u2019s lovely rescuer possessed. Tynan would pair her up and in a few years, her children would help save his people.</p><p>A pang of longing stabbed at him as he left the hospital and went back out into the cold. There were so many things he wanted that could never be. The woman who\u2019d saved him tonight had served only to remind him of the things he could never have.</p><p>As he dialed Tynan\u2019s cell phone, he realized that he didn\u2019t even know her name.</p><p>And it was best that way.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>The flare of power that Krag had felt for a brief instant was gone now. All that was left was a faint ghost of energy fading as the seconds passed. Usually when he felt the presence of a blooded human, it was a gradual thing that grew as they came closer to him.</p> <p>But not tonight. That flash of power had roared into his senses as if it had been plunked down out of nowhere. And it had vanished just as quickly.</p><p>The flash had come from downtown, several miles away. Perhaps a plane had landed and taken off with a blooded passenger aboard. If so, the human was already gone and out of his reach. Time to move on. Unless it happened again.</p><p>Krag settled back in his throne, surveying his worshippers. Both human and Synestryn alike, they gathered around him, eager to do his bidding.</p><p>Except for one.</p><p>\u201cBring her out,\u201d he ordered, his voice booming off the cement walls of his home.</p><p>This defunct manufacturing facility had been easy to convert into a fortress. What few windows there were high in the walls had been blacked out with paint, keeping out the deadly light of the sun. The main space was large, with several smaller rooms that had once been offices. Krag had those converted into his sleeping quarters, leaving room for his women on the floor surrounding his bed.</p><p>It was truly too bad that one of those women had defied him so openly. She was pretty. Young. Full of life, her blood more powerful than most.</p><p>But like a cancer, she had to be cut out before she could spread her rebellion to the others.</p> <p>Two burly human men dragged her before him. Her clothing was torn and dirty. Her dyed hair hung in wild tangles around her face. The glaring pink of her shoes seemed to mock him, declaring to all that she held no respect for his position.</p><p>Her hands were bound in front of her. No doubt a consequence of the angry red claw marks she\u2019d left on one of the men\u2019s cheeks. She was gagged, but there were no tears in her eyes as he would have hoped. No remorse. Only the glowing anger of her rebellious nature and promised retribution.</p><p>He was going to enjoy breaking her.</p><p>\u201cRemove the gag,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>The men hastened to obey. As soon as the dirty fabric cleared her mouth, she spat on the ground at Krag\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cKneel.\u201d</p><p>Her guards shoved her down so hard he could hear her bones hit the concrete.</p><p>Krag smiled. \u201cHave you considered my offer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather fuck a rotting pig corpse than let you touch me.\u201d</p><p>Anger flared for an instant before he controlled it. He smoothed his features to regal stillness. \u201cThrow her down below. I\u2019m certain there is at least one rotting pig down there for her amusement.\u201d</p><p>She screamed, but it wasn\u2019t a cry of fear. Not this woman. Her scream was of feral outrage. Of angry defiance.</p><p>The men picked her up by her arms and hauled her out of his sight. The flooded section below housed some of the less advanced members of his race. They would make quick work of her. And when they were done, he\u2019d mount her skull on the wall as a reminder to the others not to question his authority.</p><p>Before her screams faded, Krag beckoned one of the obedient women forward. She shivered in ecstasy at being chosen, as was proper, before crawling to his feet.</p><p>He patted his lap, inviting her to jump up like a pampered pet. As soon as he had her settled there, her naked body trembling, he jerked her head to the side and bit deep.</p><p>Her blood was weak, but once he\u2019d taken it all, he felt better. Stronger.</p><p>Krag shoved her corpse to the floor, then motioned for her to be taken away. Let the lesser Synestryn feast on her flesh and bones. He had no more use for her.</p><p>Hope opened her eyes, already knowing that Logan was gone. She couldn\u2019t feel his presence or that consuming pleasure he\u2019d given her.</p><p>Fear wove through her for a moment, but she wasn\u2019t sure if it was fear of the man, or fear caused by the fact she knew he was gone.</p><p>A plump, dark-haired nurse hovered over Hope. She couldn\u2019t remember the woman, but the way she was looking at Hope with tears in her eyes made her wonder if she shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Hope blinked a few times to make sure that blurry vision wasn\u2019t making her see concern that wasn\u2019t real. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Barb,\u201d she said, her tone of expectation telling Hope she should know the woman.</p><p>Was her memory getting worse? Was she losing more chunks of time? Hope pushed herself up in a panic and looked around, hoping it would clear her head.</p><p>She was surrounded by a striped curtain. Beyond that curtain, she could hear voices and the low moans of a man in pain. Disinfectant laced the stale air. A machine beeped insistently in the background. An IV bag hung above her, feeding fluids into the back of her hand.</p><p>A hospital. That\u2019s where she was.</p><p>Hope didn\u2019t know how she got here. The last thing she remembered was Logan. He\u2019d grabbed her and . . . bitten her neck.</p><p>Her hand flew to the spot, feeling only smooth, whole skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, honey?\u201d asked Barb.</p><p>\u201cDo you see anything? Any marks on my neck?\u201d</p><p>Barb leaned forward and brushed Hope\u2019s hair away. \u201cIt\u2019s a little red. Does it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her skin tingled, and there was a throbbing warmth, but that was all. \u201cWho brought me in?\u201d</p><p>Barb frowned as if trying to remember. \u201cA man. Tall. Dark hair. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>That description could be almost anyone. Or it could have been Logan. Either way the answer was the same. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor will be in to see you soon. We couldn\u2019t find any injuries. Do you know what happened?\u201d</p><p>Hope shook her head. What she thought had happened couldn\u2019t have. It wasn\u2019t possible. Either the stranger had bitten her and left marks, or he hadn\u2019t bitten her at all. Those were the only options.</p><p>Weren\u2019t they?</p><p>A wave of dizziness slid over her, and she shut her eyes to let it pass.</p><p>The smells of the hospital assaulted her nose, dragging from her memories of the last time she\u2019d been here\u2014the night Sister Olive had found her in the empty Tyler building and brought her here, insisting she get checked out. Hope had no injuries then, either. Nothing that explained her amnesia. She hadn\u2019t known her name or how old she was. Hope still didn\u2019t know. No one had claimed her. The only thing that had been in her possession was a wooden amulet clutched in her fist. The name Hope Serrien was burned into it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even know if that was her real name.</p><p>That had been a decade ago and Hope still had no answers. All she had was a nagging sense of duty\u2014that there was some vital task only she could complete. Every day that went by that didn\u2019t reveal her task left her feeling more restless and defeated.</p><p>There was something inside her\u2014some forgotten knowledge she could almost put her finger on. It was there, evading her grasp, but she knew it was there. When Logan had been holding her, she\u2019d almost been able to remember why she was here.</p><p>\u201cI need to go,\u201d said Hope.</p><p>Barb shook her head. \u201cNot until we know what happened. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>Hope had to find him. She had to find Logan and figure out what he knew. Maybe he knew who she was. What she was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving. Bring me whatever paperwork you need me to sign, but do it fast. I won\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>Whoever Logan was, Hope didn\u2019t want him to get far. She was going to find him. And then she was going to force him to give her the answers she needed. One way or another.</p><p>Logan met Steve and Pam in their apartment. They were fine. All three of them. Logan called Joseph\u2014the leader of the Theronai\u2014and asked him to send someone to guard them so they could rest. He then did what he could to remove the memory of tonight from their minds. He didn\u2019t want them to worry\u2014didn\u2019t want the memory to draw more demons to them.</p><p>Tomorrow the couple would go to Dabyr, where they\u2019d be safe. After tonight\u2019s attack, living in the city was no longer an option for them. If Logan hadn\u2019t been so close, if the GPS gadget on his cell phone hadn\u2019t made it possible for Steve\u2019s call to go to the closest Sentinel\u2014namely Logan\u2014things would have turned out very different tonight. It served only to display just how fragile their progress truly was.</p><p>As Logan got back in his van, the blond woman\u2019s face danced in his head. It was strange to no longer feel weak and hungry. Even walking inside Steve\u2019s formidable mind had been easy. There was no effort. No strain.</p><p>The power in that woman\u2019s blood was amazing. Too bad Logan knew he had to share.</p><p>Out of habit, he turned on the engine to get some heat before he realized he wasn\u2019t cold. Still.</p><p>Normally, the flush of feeding would have faded by now, leaving him chilled to the bone. For some reason, this time was different.</p><p>Logan dialed Tynan\u2019s cell phone. \u201cWe need to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have blood to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new source?\u201d The weariness in Tynan\u2019s voice worried Logan.</p><p>\u201cYes. A young woman. Her blood is strong. It\u2019s possible she may even be a Theronai.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Her blood is different from theirs\u2014unlike any I\u2019ve had before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to find her a suitable mate as soon as possible. Is she currently attached to a male?\u201d</p><p>Logan hadn\u2019t even considered that possibility, but as soon as he did, anger stirred inside him. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFind out. If she is, find out if her mate is suitably blooded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if not?\u201d asked Logan.</p><p>\u201cRemove him from her life.\u201d</p><p>Her face appeared in Logan\u2019s mind, as vivid and clear as if she were sitting next to him. She had a sweet face. Kind, amber eyes the color of autumn sunset. Not only was she lovely, she was obviously caring as well. Why else would she have stayed to help him at great risk to her own life?</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do that,\u201d said Logan. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe both know she\u2019ll be happier paired with a mate of our choosing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s to say that\u2019s true? It\u2019s not something we can prove, simply something we tell ourselves to relieve the guilt of what we must do.\u201d</p><p>Tynan\u2019s voice hardened. \u201cAll of our matches are happy ones. We make sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we\u2019re wrong, just this one time? I can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll send someone who can. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>Logan debated not telling him. Only the knowledge that their race couldn\u2019t afford any animosity held his rebellion. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll be the one to come and see to her. I don\u2019t want to entrust her to anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Tynan, his skepticism clear.</p><p>\u201cHer blood is too pure to risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain there\u2019s not more to it than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d asked Logan.</p><p>\u201cDo you have feelings for the woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. No more than is reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t become involved with her,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cNone of us can. If she\u2019s human, we need her to breed. If she\u2019s Theronai, she\u2019s off-limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not need you to tell me the facts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not detached enough. Without detachment our goals will become confused.\u201d</p><p>Anger made Logan\u2019s voice sharp. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly clear about our goals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what might those be, Logan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same as yours. Survival of our race. We\u2019ll pair her with an acceptable mate and all will be well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s human, do you want to bed her first? Get her out of your system? That can be arranged.\u201d</p><p>Said in such a cold, clinical tone, the idea made Logan sneer. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Of course I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish. I\u2019ll come, sample her blood myself as soon as I can get away, and we\u2019ll see her happily settled.\u201d</p><p>Do you want to bed her first?</p><p>The question haunted Logan, putting into his head a possibility that should not exist. He hadn\u2019t wanted a woman in centuries. He\u2019d been too hungry, too weak for his body to respond in any sexual way. Until tonight.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t weak now. Thanks to her blood, there was a stirring of something he\u2019d thought long dead\u2014an interest that went beyond survival. Holding her, feeding from her, had aroused him. Made him hard.</p><p>He wanted her. There was no denying it, but that didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d act on that desire.</p><p>\u201cCome soon,\u201d said Logan. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long they\u2019ll keep her at the hospital. She was too weak for me to remove her memories, so that must still be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t lose her. Her blood is yours now.\u201d</p><p>Which meant he\u2019d be able to find her if he chose to do so. Always.</p><p>Already the temptation to do just that was something he had to actively resist. \u201cI have one quick errand to run, and then I\u2019ll be off. I can\u2019t stay and help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you won\u2019t stay,\u201d said Tynan.</p><p>\u201cAs you say.\u201d</p><p>Logan hung up the phone and drove toward the address that had been written in blood on his bathroom mirror. As he passed through the frozen streets, his mind filled with thoughts of what might await him. Would it be a home filled with people who could feed his race? The location of a gateway into Athanasia they could access? Even a group of humans willing to help them without all the coercion and lies would have been a welcome sight.</p><p>When he pulled up in front of the run-down building where he\u2019d fought earlier tonight, and read the address, his excitement died.</p><p>This place, this Tyler building, did not house the savior of his race. It was simply an empty structure, void of hope. Worse yet, it was entirely possible that it had been a trap\u2014that the creature he\u2019d fought tonight had been sent here to wait for his arrival and had caught Steve\u2019s and Pam\u2019s scents as they\u2019d passed by earlier.</p><p>Logan\u2019s throat burned with anger as he stared at the run-down building. Power raged inside him, tempting him to raze the thing to the ground.</p><p>He could do it. He had enough strength now.</p><p>But if he did, he\u2019d waste all the power she\u2019d given him. He couldn\u2019t do that, no matter how angry he became. Self-control was as vital to his people\u2019s survival as blood. All the Sanguinar knew that, and those who didn\u2019t had died. Or been killed.</p><p>Logan wasn\u2019t always proud of the choices he\u2019d had to make over the years, but he was still standing, as were many of his kind. Without those unpleasant choices, the Sanguinar would have been long extinct. And if that happened, it would be only a matter of time before the Theronai and Slayers fell as well, and the human race was left with no protectors.</p><p>The ends justified the means. It had to. After all the things Logan had done, it simply had to.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Hope couldn\u2019t sleep. As tired as she was, every time she closed her eyes, she saw Logan\u2019s face. Beautiful. Suffering. Powerful.</p><p>She wished she didn\u2019t know his name. Somehow, knowing made him seem more real. Without that scrap of information, it would have been easy to pretend that everything that had happened tonight was a figment of her imagination.</p><p>Heaven knew her mind wasn\u2019t exactly a fortress. Whatever had stripped her life\u2019s memories away had left its scars. She saw things that couldn\u2019t possibly exist. Felt things that could not be real.</p><p>And right now, she was sure she could feel Logan\u2019s presence nearby, moving about the city. There was a warmth emanating from him, like sunlight on her skin.</p><p>Part of her willed him to come closer so she could bask in that warmth, while the saner part of her wished he\u2019d just go away\u2014so far she couldn\u2019t feel a thing.</p><p>Hope rolled onto her side, facing him. \u201cYou\u2019re not real,\u201d she whispered into the darkness of her bedroom.</p><p>Somehow, saying it out loud only made it worse. Something had happened tonight that put her in the hospital, and if she couldn\u2019t even trust herself enough to believe what she saw, then she was much worse off than she thought.</p><p>Something was wrong with Sibyl. Cain knew it. She hadn\u2019t come out of her room since her parents\u2019 deaths two weeks ago. She\u2019d hardly spoken to him except to tell him she was fine and to ask him to bring her some of her mother\u2019s clothes.</p><p>Everyone mourned differently, and the distance that had been between Sibyl and her mother was no doubt adding to the pain of grief now. Perhaps Gilda\u2019s clothes gave Sibyl some kind of comfort. Cain deeply hoped so.</p><p>At least she\u2019d been eating. The trays of food he\u2019d left at her door were always returned empty. If not for that, Cain\u2019s fatherly instincts would have kicked in and he\u2019d have removed her from her room by force.</p><p>So far, it hadn\u2019t come to that.</p><p>Cain retrieved the empty tray and rapped softly on her door. \u201cSibyl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sleeping.\u201d</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t. He could tell from her voice she was wide-awake. Cain had been watching over her for centuries and she couldn\u2019t fool him with such a bad lie.</p><p>\u201cYou need to come out. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking changes nothing.\u201d Her voice sounded odd and deep, as if she were sick, only she never got sick. She had to have been crying.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. You of all people should know how powerful words can be.\u201d</p><p>When Sibyl was eight, she\u2019d promised her mother she\u2019d never grow up. And she hadn\u2019t. Centuries later, she was still trapped in the body of a child.</p><p>\u201cGo away. Please.\u201d</p><p>Cain sighed. He was a patient man. He\u2019d give her more time. Just not too much. Staying locked away in her room like this wasn\u2019t healthy. He loved her too much to let her destroy herself with grief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a couple of hours,\u201d he promised. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk then.\u201d</p><p>And if not then, he\u2019d keep at her until she relented. Little Sibyl was nothing if not stubborn, and it was Cain\u2019s job to see to it that she didn\u2019t suffer because of the inherited streak.</p><p>One way or another, she was coming out of that room and facing reality. And when she did, Cain would be there for her as he always had been.</p><p>Sibyl held her breath until she heard Cain\u2019s heavy steps fade as he moved down the hall.</p><p>She almost asked him to bring her more food, but she feared he\u2019d figure out that something was wrong. Terribly wrong.</p><p>Sibyl tugged on the sleeve of Gilda\u2019s gown, trying to hide her wrists. They were all wrong. Bony. Too long. Everything about her new body was wrong.</p><p>She took a lurching step forward, tripping on her own feet. As she caught herself against the dresser, she knocked over the trinkets that sat atop it. A small crystal box shattered against the floor.</p><p>Her feet were bare. She had nothing that would fit them anymore. If she stepped wrong, she was sure she\u2019d cut herself.</p><p>And she was sure she\u2019d step wrong. Her body was no longer her own. It was this odd, alien thing that kept thwarting her every move. And the hunger was nearly unbearable.</p><p>The only thing that dulled it was the thought of her parents lying crushed under all that stone.</p><p>Cain hadn\u2019t told her that part, but he hadn\u2019t needed to. Sibyl had known it would happen all along. She\u2019d known they\u2019d die. That her sister, Maura, would be the cause of it. She\u2019d seen all that in her visions. And she\u2019d mourned for them a long time ago.</p><p>What she hadn\u2019t seen was herself, this gangly body and the loss of her ability.</p><p>The future was no longer her domain. She couldn\u2019t see it. Couldn\u2019t gift it to others. It stretched out, bleak and unknown, as if she were some normal person.</p><p>Without her ability, that\u2019s exactly what she was. Normal. Nothing special.</p><p>Sibyl couldn\u2019t even reach Maura anymore. Not even through the doll.</p><p>For the first time in her life, she was truly alone. Truly afraid.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been run over by a truck,\u201d said Jodi. Her blond hair was pulled up in a ponytail that stuck out through the back of a KC Royals baseball cap. Giant silver hearts swung from her earlobes.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d said Hope.</p><p>The workroom of the studio was Jodi\u2019s territory. She framed and matted all of Hope\u2019s portraits and photographs, and the woman had an eye for the job. What had started as a friendship forged during a business management class had bloomed into a growing business for both of them. Hope snapped the pictures; Jodi took them and created art. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Morning light streamed in, glinting off the tools lined up on Jodi\u2019s workbench. The walls in here were covered in beautiful pieces\u2014little instances of people\u2019s lives that would live on for as long as the ink and paper lasted. Memories that could not be erased.</p><p>Hope\u2019s friend, roommate, and coworker ran her blade down the mat, making a perfect cut. \u201cI call \u2019em like I see\u2019em. No one\u2019s going to want their picture taken by a woman who can\u2019t even keep her eyes open. You should call it quits and take a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only have one more appointment today. I\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>Jodi grinned, waggling her pale eyebrows. \u201cSo, where were you last night? Or should I say this morning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>Hope considered blurting out the truth. Sadly, she couldn\u2019t think of a way to say it without using the word vampire, so she resisted the urge. \u201cI met this guy and lost track of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d said Jodi, her tone disbelieving. \u201cOne has a tendency to lose track of time when one is macking on some hot guy. He was hot, right?\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s face flashed in her mind, all perfect symmetry and stark angles. Just the thought had her fingers itching for her camera. She could take a great photo of him. Except she wasn\u2019t sure vampires could even be photographed. Or that he was even real.</p> <p>It had taken all morning, but she had convinced herself that last night\u2019s events were nothing more than a bizarre dream. There was no horrible monster. No beautiful Logan. All those events were simply something her mind had constructed to combat her fear of going near the Tyler building where she\u2019d been found a decade ago.</p><p>\u201cHello. Hope. Are you in there?\u201d asked Jodi, waving her hand in front of Hope\u2019s face. The large silver heart ring she wore caught the morning light and left little spots floating in Hope\u2019s vision.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>Jodi took Hope by the arm and led her out of the workroom toward the stairway that led to their shared apartment upstairs. \u201cGo to bed, girl. I\u2019ll wake you up as soon as your one o\u2019clock gets here.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she was right. Maybe a nap would clear her head and rid her of the last remnants of a man who couldn\u2019t possibly exist.</p><p>Madoc stepped into Joseph\u2019s office unannounced. His black hair was a mess, as if he\u2019d just gotten out of bed. \u201cThere\u2019s a naked man at the front gate. He\u2019s a Slayer.\u201d</p> <p>Shock raced through Joseph, silencing him for a moment. Why would their enemy be at the gate? Was it some kind of trick? Custom dictated that a party offering to negotiate would show up naked as proof they were unarmed, but after so many years of the stagnant war between them, why would the Slayers want to negotiate anything? \u201cWhat does he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked to talk to you. Do I let him in or do I kill him?\u201d Madoc\u2019s blunt features were expressionless, as if he truly didn\u2019t care which of those alternatives Joseph picked.</p><p>\u201cIs he alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There are some men sitting in their vehicles at the main road. The only person at his side is one very pissed-off woman.\u201d</p><p>A woman? If one of the Slayers had found a female Theronai, would they have stuck to the old laws and brought her here? It wasn\u2019t likely, but it was possible, and with all the women popping up lately, Joseph refused to take any chances. \u201cLet him and the woman in, but only them. Make them walk. No vehicles past the gate. Alert the men to be ready for trouble. Meet me at the front doors.\u201d</p><p>Madoc nodded and left.</p><p>Joseph combed his fingers through his hair and straightened his clothes. It wouldn\u2019t do his people any good to show up looking like the insomniac he was.</p><p>He hurried from his office, his mind spinning with possibilities. By the time he wound his way through the building, a dozen men were waiting for him at the front doors. They were all armed and their faces were grim.</p> <p>He addressed them, looking each one in the eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble. Keep your swords sheathed unless I order otherwise. If this is a trick, we\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s the last of its kind.\u201d</p><p>Joseph was satisfied they\u2019d listen. For now. He stepped forward and opened the wide double doors.</p><p>The man standing there was Andreas Phelan and he was, indeed, naked. He was nearly as tall as Joseph, with brown hair and tawny eyes. The tops of his ears were slightly pointed, proof that the Slayer blood in him was strong. His body had the sleek, high-performance muscles of an athlete. Joseph had met him once before when he\u2019d had to sentence one of his own men to death. He truly hoped these circumstances were more cheerful.</p><p>Judging by the angry, thrashing woman over his shoulder, this visit would be interesting if nothing else.</p><p>Andreas set her down, holding her steady until she gained her balance. She had been wrapped tightly in a sheet and gagged with a strip of tape over her mouth. Her sunny blond hair was a tangled mess. Her face was red, and her eyes burned a pale golden yellow that promised retribution.</p><p>\u201cThank you for receiving us,\u201d he said, inclining his head briefly at Joseph. \u201cThis is my sister, Lyka, who has promised to behave.\u201d</p><p>The last part had clearly been said as a warning to his sister.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>Andreas lifted his hands away from his body and turned in a slow circle. \u201cAs you can see I\u2019m unarmed. Lyka is as well, though I understand if you would like to remove the sheet and verify that for yourself.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him and a furious yell filtered through her gag.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t dare arm her when she\u2019s this angry at me,\u201d said Andreas.</p><p>Joseph looked at Madoc. \u201cCan you ask Nika to come down and check her for weapons?\u201d</p><p>Madoc lifted his phone from his belt and made the call.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d offered Morgan Valens.</p><p>Joseph gave him a hard stare before he realized it was jealousy that had caused it. He didn\u2019t want any of the men looking at her naked body, though he guessed it was simply a reaction to her vulnerability. \u201cNo. You won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI request that we be allowed into your home so that we can talk,\u201d said Andreas.</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA truce between our people,\u201d said Andreas.</p><p>Truce? Joseph felt the men behind him shift uncomfortably, and he himself scanned the area, looking for signs of a trap.</p><p>Andreas\u2019s mouth tightened in irritation. \u201cI understand that you\u2019re skeptical, but I swear to you this is no trick. Do you really think I\u2019d bring my sister along if I\u2019d intended to attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gagged. Perhaps she\u2019s not your sister at all.\u201d</p><p>Andreas reached over to the woman and carefully worked the corner of the tape up. \u201cReady?\u201d he asked, with a hint of apology in his tone.</p><p>She grunted, her nostrils flaring.</p><p>The Slayer ripped the tape free, wincing as he did so, as if the act hurt him, too. He pulled a wad of cloth from her mouth and nearly had his fingers bitten for his effort.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d she shouted. \u201cIt was bad enough you had to drag me here, but throwing me over your shoulder and making me look at your naked ass was going over the line. Do you want me to vomit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou refused to come willingly,\u201d said Andreas in a weary tone, as if it was an old argument.</p><p>\u201cThis is a fool\u2019s errand. The Theronai will never agree to a truce. Their thirst for vengeance is too great. You\u2019ve signed our death warrants.\u201d</p><p>Joseph held up his hands to stop her tirade. \u201cHold on a minute. No one is killing anyone yet. Tell me who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyka Phelan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister,\u201d said Andreas.</p><p>\u201cHalf sister,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>Nika walked up to the group. She\u2019d gained a bit of weight over the last couple of weeks, filling out the gaunt hollows under her cheeks and giving her pale skin a bit of color. Her white hair hung straight, swaying about her chin to frame her face. Her bright blue eyes were on Madoc, and though she said no words aloud, Joseph was sure she\u2019d asked him what this was all about.</p><p>The mental link the pair had was beyond anything Joseph had ever witnessed. They\u2019d been together for only a couple of weeks, and in that time, they\u2019d become a well-oiled killing machine. Madoc and Nika could now take down an entire nest by themselves, though it left a hell of a mess behind.</p><p>Nika went to the woman, reached up, and placed her hand on her head. Lyka flinched, as if Nika\u2019s hand was cold.</p><p>Nika turned to Joseph. \u201cShe has no weapons, but wishes she had one, so she could use it on this man.\u201d She pointed to Andreas.</p><p>Joseph looked at the Slayer. \u201cJust like you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay we come inside?\u201d Andreas asked.</p><p>What the hell. It wasn\u2019t like a naked Slayer and his sister showed up on their doorstep every day. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to one of the cabins in back. We had a little incident with some explosives last year, so I\u2019m a bit cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuits me,\u201d said Andreas. \u201cWe\u2019re playing by the rules, all nice and civilized. Right, Lyka?\u201d</p><p>Lyka growled at her brother.</p><p>\u201cSomeone fetch this man some pants,\u201d ordered Joseph.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate something to wear, too,\u201d said Lyka.</p><p>The fact that she was naked under that sheet was not lost on Joseph. He found himself staring, trying to discern her shape. All he got was caterpillar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find her something of Andra\u2019s that will fit,\u201d offered Nika. \u201cThey\u2019re about the same size.\u201d</p><p>Andreas picked up his sister in his arms and said, \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>Joseph walked around Dabyr to one of the vacant cabins near the lake. Four of his men guarded his back, but he\u2019d dismissed the others, knowing that there was a lot of bad blood between the two races.</p><p>It had been years since the last confrontation, but Theronai lived a long time, and he didn\u2019t know any of his men who hadn\u2019t lost someone due to violence initiated by the Slayers.</p><p>As leader, he had to put aside his own prejudices and focus on the present. He wouldn\u2019t think about the friends he\u2019d lost at the hands of the Slayers. At least not right now.</p><p>If things turned ugly . . .</p><p>Joseph opened the door and flipped on the light. This cabin had been prepared for disuse, and the furniture was covered with white drop cloths. He motioned toward a small couch for his guests to sit.</p><p>Andreas set his sister down and then donned the pair of borrowed jeans, unselfconscious about his nudity. Lyka was still wrapped up in the sheet, and Joseph was keenly aware of hers.</p><p>\u201cMind if I get dressed?\u201d she asked Joseph, her tone caustic and belligerent.</p><p>Joseph nodded his head toward the small bathroom behind him. \u201cFeel free. Morgan, untape her.\u201d</p><p>The Theronai flashed a bright smile. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Lyka lifted her chin to look up at him. \u201cI may be unarmed, but that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t find a way to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Morgan laughed.</p><p>\u201cBehave, Lyka,\u201d scolded her brother. \u201cShow some honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he has his way, I\u2019ll be showing a hell of a lot more than honor. I\u2019d really rather not put myself on display to our enemy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEnough,\u201d said Andreas. His voice was low, but the menace threaded through his tone was enough to make Joseph\u2019s hand twitch toward his sword.</p><p>Lyka pressed her lips closed and stood there while Morgan ripped the tape from the sheet.</p><p>Joseph wanted to watch him open such a lovely package, but he knew better than to leer. \u201cYou wanted to talk. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>Lyka gripped the now loose sheet, and went into the bathroom where Nika had dropped a set of borrowed clothing.</p> <p>Andreas pulled in a breath, like he was preparing to do something distasteful. \u201cI\u2019ve only recently come into power over the Slayers. Until I was privy to the information our previous leader had, I had no clue how bad things truly were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy people are dying\u2014not by the hands of the Synestryn, but by their own decisions. We\u2019ve bred with humans for so many generations that only a few of us still have the power of our ancestors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re weak, so now you want to end the war? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re weak, and because of that, we\u2019re no longer as effective at fighting the Synestryn as we once were. They\u2019re getting stronger every year. Their numbers are growing. You know as well as I do that if we don\u2019t do something, we\u2019re going to lose everything.\u201d He leaned forward, his tawny eyes fixing on Joseph. \u201cI was born into this war. I\u2019ve even done harm to your people in my youth, but I see now that it can\u2019t continue. We can\u2019t keep fighting each other if we\u2019re to have any chance of beating back the demons.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why not just go on as we are, ignoring each other? It\u2019s been years since I wasted any assets on your people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that things are changing. We\u2019re at a crossroads. If we don\u2019t join together, I fear that the war with the Synestryn is already lost and we just don\u2019t know it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I\u2019ve seen things. I\u2019ve followed huge hoards of Synestryn in the night, watching them. They\u2019re migrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. They\u2019re closing in around you, filling the caves that riddle this area.\u201d</p> <p>Joseph had seen proof of that as well, though not as up close as Andreas claimed to have seen. From the corner of his eye, he saw his men shift uncomfortably. Of all the men he had under his command, Madoc had been out fighting the most. He\u2019d nearly run himself into the ground searching out every last living creature that had fed on Nika\u2019s blood.</p><p>Joseph turned to Madoc. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Madoc frowned and crossed his thick arms over his chest as he shifted closer to Nika. \u201cI think it would be a dumb-ass move to trust him. This is out of the blue. We don\u2019t know a thing about him.\u201d</p><p>Andreas nodded, not seeming angry. \u201cI understand your lack of trust. That\u2019s why Lyka\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>She walked out of the bathroom, wearing a pair of loose sweats and a T-shirt. Joseph\u2019s eyes skimmed her body, taking in the athletic curves he could detect beneath the clothes. Her hair was a million shades of yellow and gold and a total mess. It poufed around her face, like a mane.</p><p>Joseph found it cute.</p><p>Something in him loosened up as he watched her, like the pressure behind his eyes had been vented. A headache he\u2019d had so long he\u2019d stopped noticing it faded.</p><p>\u201cLyka has agreed to stay here under your authority as proof of my good intentions.\u201d</p> <p>Lyka snorted. \u201cI think agreed is a bit of a stretch. You didn\u2019t exactly give me much of a choice.\u201d</p><p>Joseph stared at Andreas in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019re giving me your sister as a hostage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that the only way to save my people is to resort to the old ways. I\u2019m abiding by the customs of my ancestors. Lyka\u2019s the perfect choice, because while she makes me want to scream and strangle her scrawny neck sometimes, there is no one on this planet I love more.\u201d</p><p>Tears pooled in Lyka\u2019s eyes and she turned away, blinking them back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got an odd way of showing it,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cWhat makes you think I won\u2019t just kill her the moment your back is turned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a smart man, a man of honor. If you weren\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t have brought me your brother-in-arms when his soul died.\u201d</p><p>Just the memory of giving Chris\u2019s life over to Andreas was enough to make Joseph\u2019s gut clench in grief. \u201cIt was necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt proves you do what you must. As do I. You know as well as I do that all the Sentinels are nearing extinction. We have to do something, and I\u2019ve decided to take the first step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you want from us?\u201d asked Joseph.</p><p>\u201cNothing I\u2019m not willing to give myself. I\u2019d like to share intelligence and plan a strategy that has a hope of beating the Synestryn back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said your people are weak. What good are they in a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of us are weak. My family\u2019s bloodline has been protected, as have a few others. I admit that most of our people will need protection, but I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re used to that\u2014that dozens of humans live here.\u201d</p><p>Joseph refused to confirm it. He trusted Andreas to a point, but until it was necessary to share information, he wasn\u2019t going to offer anything.</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d asked Joseph. \u201cHow many of your people can fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you all the details you want as soon as I have your promise for peace.\u201d</p><p>Any promise Joseph offered would be binding, so he had to be careful what he said. \u201cI will agree to a temporary truce\u2014long enough to discuss this with my people and the Sanguinar. If things are as you say, then we\u2019ll consider something more binding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need more than that. I need your promise not to attack my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given you all I can for now. You can accept that or not. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>Andreas\u2019s jaw clenched, but he gave a curt nod. \u201cMay we stay while you decide? Or would you rather we get a hotel room in town?\u201d</p><p>Joseph looked to Madoc. \u201cWould you please get our guests settled in one of the suites? Make sure they\u2019re comfortable.\u201d And carefully watched. Joseph knew Madoc would do that without being asked. The man wasn\u2019t exactly the most trusting, especially with his wife under the same roof.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>They all left. Joseph hung back for a moment, staying in the cabin alone. He hoped like hell this wasn\u2019t a trick, because truth was, things were getting worse by the day. Without a united front, their chances of fending off the Synestryn before they could overrun Earth were slim.</p><p>On the other hand, if what Andreas said was true, then chances of fending off the Synestryn with the help of the Slayers weren\u2019t any better.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Hope made it through the rest of her day and hurried over to the homeless shelter where she volunteered. There were still a few minutes before the dinner rush started, and Hope had fled to the rooftop to soak up what was left of the sun.</p><p>Sister Olive came into the rooftop greenhouse where Hope lounged. It was her favorite spot, all warm and sunny, especially on a day like today. As cold as it was outside, the sun was shining bright, making a sun worshiper like Hope groan in delight.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you up here,\u201d said Sister Olive. She was in her sixties, dressed in faded, plain street clothes rather than a habit. Her iron gray hair was pulled back in a tight bun at her nape, and her eyes were the same color as the sky above her head.</p><p>\u201cDid you need me?\u201d asked Hope.</p><p>Sister Olive shook her head and went about tending her plants. \u201cNo, I just wanted to see if you were okay. You look tired.\u201d</p><p>The scents of tomato plants and herbs filled the greenhouse, calming Hope\u2019s frayed nerves. \u201cI had a late night.\u201d</p><p>Concern drew Sister Olive\u2019s overgrown brows together. \u201cI hope there was no trouble.\u201d</p><p>Hope didn\u2019t want to worry her. Sister Olive was the closest thing to a mother Hope had. She\u2019d taken Hope in when no one else claimed her, given her enough education to get her GED, and helped her start her photography business. And while Hope would never make big bucks, her work helped fill some of the void her lack of memory had left behind by creating lasting memories for others.</p><p>\u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle,\u201d she said, praying it was the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou went out looking for people again, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Hope couldn\u2019t lie to a nun. \u201cSomeone has to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave that to the police. You\u2019re going to get hurt if you go sticking your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong. I know there are gaps in your education, but I thought I\u2019d at least taught you that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being careful,\u201d said Hope. \u201cBesides, the police can\u2019t do much. They\u2019re already stretched thin as it is. There aren\u2019t resources for them to devote much time to looking for a handful of people they aren\u2019t even convinced are really missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this. People move on. They don\u2019t always say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Hope filled a plastic watering can and hefted it up onto the bench beside Sister Olive. \u201cI know that, but I have a bad feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I. I\u2019m worried you\u2019re going to get hurt doing something you\u2019re not even remotely equipped to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have eyes. I can look for people as well as anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Sister Olive\u2019s mouth turned down at the edges as she stared over her glasses at Hope. \u201cMy fear is that you\u2019ll actually find out what\u2019s happened to them. The hard way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do believe I\u2019m right. There is something bad going on.\u201d</p><p>Sister Olive stripped off her glove and cupped Hope\u2019s cheek. \u201cWhat I believe is that I wouldn\u2019t survive if anything happened to you. You, child, are part of my heart. I knew from the moment I found you that you were special.\u201d</p><p>Hope soaked up the older woman\u2019s words like thirsty plants soaked up water, and then sent up a prayer of thanks that this woman had been the one who\u2019d found her all those years ago. \u201cYou say that about everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re especially special. God has plans for you. I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>Hope covered the woman\u2019s hand, knowing she\u2019d never meet another soul as sweet as Sister Olive. \u201cFor all we know His plan is for me to find what\u2019s happening and stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. What I do know is that I can\u2019t stand by and do nothing. We\u2019ve lost four regulars in as many months. And it\u2019s been a week since I saw Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat young woman with all the piercings and the pink hair?\u201d</p><p>Hope nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the one. She didn\u2019t come in every day, but she was here at least a couple times a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was probably just passing through. It happens all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been around for more than a year. How is that passing through?\u201d asked Hope. \u201cDon\u2019t I have a responsibility to look for her?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sister Olive sighed, pulled off the other glove, and set them on the workbench. \u201cA shepherdess guarding her sheep. I guess I shouldn\u2019t complain about that now, should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful,\u201d she promised Sister Olive.</p><p>\u201cYou do that. This place needs you. I need you.\u201d She dusted off her hands. \u201cSpeaking of which, I need to go and check on dinner. We\u2019ll have a big crowd tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down to help in a minute.\u201d</p> <p>Sister Olive patted her shoulder. \u201cYou take your time. I know how much you miss the sun, and we don\u2019t have much of it this time of year. Enjoy it while it lasts.\u201d</p><p>Sister Olive left. Hope stripped out of her sweatshirt and let the sun soak into her skin. The tank top she wore was thin, allowing the delicious heat to slide over her.</p><p>The smell of basil and soil filled her nose, calming her nerves. Everything was fine. She\u2019d find Rory tonight and give her hell for scaring her like that.</p><p>Hope lounged there, soaking up the warmth until the sun disappeared behind the surrounding buildings. She felt better now that she\u2019d had some time to herself. She hadn\u2019t once thought of Logan while she was here. Or that monster.</p><p>All was well in her world once again. She was safe, strong, and ready to finish off her duties for the day.</p> <p>The dinner rush went by fast. Hope packed her bag full of sandwiches and blankets and was ready to hit the streets in search of Rory.</p><p>She stopped at the door, turning back to duck into the kitchen. She found the biggest, sharpest knife she could and added it to her bag. Just in case.</p><p>Iain slid his blade from the dead Synestryn and searched the tunnel for more. He\u2019d come here to this nest to find the one kind of demon none of his Theronai brothers could fight: Synestryn with the faces of children.</p><p>Even though Iain\u2019s soul was long dead, he could still remember what it had felt like to have one. He knew that there had been a time when the thought of slaying such a creature would have turned his stomach. But no longer.</p><p>He stared down at the dead abomination. It may have had the face of a child, but that was where the resemblance ended. It was fast, with six spindly, claw-tipped legs. It had been able to cling to the ceiling of the cave before propelling itself toward Iain for the kill.</p><p>He held up his sleeve, looking through the holes that thing\u2019s teeth had left in his leather jacket\u2014teeth strong enough to bite through the magical wards meant to protect him.</p> <p>No, that thing was no more an innocent child than he was. But if he was the only one of his kind who could see that, then so be it. Everyone needed a reason to get up in the morning. Killing baby demons was his.</p><p>He\u2019d push through the rest of this system of tunnels tonight, then head for the next one. Same ol\u2019, same ol\u2019.</p><p>Ava\u2019s guards heard the commotion coming from down the corridor, and for the first time in what seemed like decades, she was left alone.</p><p>The chittering speech of the insectlike monsters who had held her captive grew louder, as it always did when they called more of their own kind.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have much time, and she was going to use every second of it to get herself out of this place.</p><p>The rough rock tunnels that were a maze to her when she\u2019d first been brought here were now easy to navigate. Unfortunately, the only way out was down the tunnel, the way her guards had gone.</p><p>Fear had been a part of her for so long she almost failed to recognize a difference in the pounding of her heart as her bare feet slapped against the dirt floor. Little rocks dug into her skin, but she didn\u2019t slow for fear she\u2019d miss her one chance for escape.</p><p>Her lungs burned from the unusual exertion, and she had to hold her round belly so it didn\u2019t feel like it was going to be ripped from her body with every hurried step. The weight of her pregnancy slowed her down too much, but that was probably what her guards had counted on.</p> <p>Ava cleared a corner and nearly ran headlong into combat. She skidded to a halt, grabbing the wall of the cave to steady herself.</p><p>One man stood in the center of a thick ring of monsters\u2014both the ones who guarded her as well as the smaller, feral ones that looked human from the neck up.</p><p>Ava knew better than to be fooled.</p><p>The man\u2019s sword moved almost too fast to see, and everywhere it passed, monsters fell. Black blood splattered over his clear face shield, but it didn\u2019t seem to slow him down. His powerful body moved with a mesmerizing grace and Ava had to jerk herself away from staring.</p><p>The dry skittering of more monsters grew louder, coming from her left.</p><p>They were going to see her and lock her up again. She couldn\u2019t let that happen. She couldn\u2019t have her baby in this place.</p><p>Ava pressed herself into a shadowy crevice, hoping her protruding belly wouldn\u2019t give her away. She held her breath, prayed her pounding heart would quiet itself, and squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>They came so close to her she could feel a breeze from their bodies as they passed. Not one of them slowed. They all headed straight for the fight.</p><p>Ava didn\u2019t stick around to see whether the man won. There was nothing she could do to help him, anyway. The best thing she could do was run and hope that she and her baby got out of this hellhole alive.</p><p>Logan called Tynan as soon as he woke. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDabyr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were supposed to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I wasn\u2019t able to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace. She took a turn for the worse.\u201d</p><p>A pang of grief burst inside Logan\u2019s chest. He\u2019d grown fond of the human. She was kind. Giving. A few days ago, she\u2019d donned a magical device that transferred her health and vitality to a Theronai who had been paralyzed. The artifact worked, and Torr was now on his feet once again, but Grace\u2019s sacrifice had been great. The Sanguinar had done what they could, but no one expected her to live.</p><p>\u201cHow is Torr?\u201d asked Logan.</p><p>\u201cDesolate. Angry. He makes demands on me that are not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long does she have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDays at most. I told Torr I was leaving tonight, that I had work that must be done.\u201d</p><p>Logan doubted the man took that news well. \u201cAre you safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis people have contained him so he won\u2019t hurt me when I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you arrive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be a few hours. I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m close. But I won\u2019t be able to stay away long, so have the woman ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWring a promise from her to gain her cooperation. We\u2019re running out of time. These matches are taking too much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey take as long as they take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriant did some calculations. If we don\u2019t double our pace, sixty percent of our race will be dead within the next twenty years.\u201d</p><p>That news sent shock winging through Logan. He\u2019d known things were grim, but he\u2019d had no idea how bad they\u2019d gotten. He\u2019d thrived on a steady diet of hope and hard work, and it seemed cruel now that his efforts weren\u2019t good enough.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me, Logan?\u201d</p><p>His voice cracked with the defeat that crushed his chest. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork faster, brother. We need her on our side. Now.\u201d Tynan hung up.</p><p>Logan ran his fingers through his hair in frustration. All that work and it wasn\u2019t even truly paying off.</p><p>How many lives had he altered? How many people had he tricked or coerced into doing his bidding? He\u2019d lied. He\u2019d even gone as far as entering the minds of his subjects to convince them to help.</p><p>They\u2019d all done it willingly. Or so they thought.</p><p>Sure, those people were happy, but it wasn\u2019t because of their own choices. It was all Logan\u2019s doing. Artificial.</p><p>And the sad part was, he was prepared to do it again tonight. With the woman who had saved his life.</p><p>She had saved him, and now he was going to turn her life upside down.</p><p>The thought turned his stomach, but he knew better than to let his emotions sway him. Logically, it was the only course of action. If his race died, there would be no one to heal the Theronai or Slayers. They would fall to injury and poison. Their numbers would shrink until they, too, became extinct. Synestryn demons would overrun Earth. Countless people would die screaming in pain\u2014food for the Synestryn. Better to sacrifice a few to artificial happiness than to allow the fall of mankind.</p><p>At least that\u2019s what he told himself as he set out to do what he knew he must. This was war, whether the humans knew it or not. And in war, there were sacrifices.</p><p>He just wished that the woman who\u2019d saved his life didn\u2019t have to be one of them.</p><p>Hope saw no sign of Rory or any of the missing men as she searched the streets. None of the people she\u2019d come to know had seen Rory. She hadn\u2019t been to the local convenience stores or any of the other shelters in town. It was as if she\u2019d just vanished.</p><p>The police weren\u2019t concerned. Rory lived on the streets. They assured her that people like Rory moved around. And without a last name, Hope couldn\u2019t even file a proper missing person\u2019s report. The best they could do was take down her contact information and let her know if anyone matching Rory\u2019s description turned up in jail. Or in a morgue.</p><p>With that image firmly in Hope\u2019s vivid imagination, she gathered her courage to go back to the building she hated so much\u2014the one she was certain had somehow eaten her past.</p><p>Not that a building could do such a thing. But it stood there, mocking her, taunting the edges of her mind with memories she could almost grasp. Like a fleck in her vision, as soon as she turned to look at it, it darted away, slipping out of reach.</p><p>Hope clutched a flashlight in her gloved hand and marched around the Tyler building to the back where the overhead door had been busted out. Someone had screwed a sheet of plywood over the opening to keep trespassers out.</p><p>She peered through the small window of the employee entrance, shining her flashlight inside. There was no giant monster corpse lying there, only an oily stain on the concrete. The only other proof of the battle was the fallen stack of pallets and the scuff marks in the dust coating the floor.</p><p>Hope twisted the doorknob. Locked. Of course.</p><p>She felt a subtle heat caress her nape a moment before she heard a low, cultured voice. \u201cIt\u2019s awfully cold to be out alone on a night like this.\u201d</p><p>Hope whirled around, lifting her flashlight to strike.</p><p>Logan stood there, ten feet away, well out of range. His arms were crossed over his wide chest, and his pale eyes narrowed in speculation.</p><p>Her heart pounded so hard she was sure he could hear it. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLooking for you.\u201d He stared up at the building. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d find you here. Not after last night.\u201d</p><p>Last night. When he\u2019d killed the monster and done . . . something to her. She could still feel his lips on her throat, moving as if kissing her.</p><p>Hope\u2019s hand strayed to the spot and one side of Logan\u2019s mouth lifted in amusement.</p><p>\u201cSo you do remember,\u201d he said as he took a step forward. It had been only one step, but somehow, he was within reach, so close she could touch.</p><p>He was so beautiful. Wickedly so. The kind of man that made a woman\u2019s mind grind to a halt and her body go languid with need. His aura was bright, almost blinding, swirling with colors she\u2019d never seen before. She didn\u2019t know how to interpret it, but it hardly mattered so long as she could keep staring at the movement of rainbows dancing around him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sensuous curve of his mouth promised delight. The sharp angle of his jaw and his high cheekbones cast loving shadows across his face and throat. They drew her gaze in, daring her to reach out a hand and touch. Even his silky, dark hair called to her, begging her to slide her fingers close to his scalp and drag his mouth where she wanted it most. She wasn\u2019t even entirely sure where that was, though she could imagine the fun she\u2019d have finding out.</p><p>Not that she was going to do any of that. She wasn\u2019t. But a girl could dream, and Logan was definitely the stuff of dreams. \u201cMy memory isn\u2019t exactly trustworthy. I\u2019ve learned not to pay any attention to it.\u201d</p><p>That news made an inky black brow lift in question. \u201cI\u2019ve always adored memories.\u201d</p><p>His eyes brightened, seeming to glow from within for a split second. His aura shifted, pulsing with an infrared flush of desire. Hope felt herself lean forward, trying to get closer.</p> <p>Logan reached out and drew one finger from her forehead, down her temple, over her cheek, and onto her neck. A heated shiver swept through her as his finger made contact with the spot his mouth had been last night. \u201cI\u2019d like you to share yours with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShare?\u201d she asked, her voice barely there. Her chest was tight with longing, leaving little room for air.</p><p>Not that she needed it. She didn\u2019t need anything except the sight of this man and the feel of his fingers on her skin. It made her insane, but there was no help for that now.</p><p>\u201cI only want a quick peek. Just a glimpse of the woman you are.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid around her neck, curling at her nape. He pulled her close, bowing his head until his forehead rested against hers.</p> <p>He smelled of sunlight on snow\u2014cold and clean. But the warmth of his skin seemed to burn into hers.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t right. There was something odd about him, and she needed to put some space between them in order to clear her senses and figure out what it was.</p><p>She shifted her weight to take a step back and was suddenly jerked against his torso, his arm wrapped around her, his hand splayed low on her hip. The hold was possessive. His grip demanding.</p><p>\u201cJust relax,\u201d he whispered, and she was sure she could feel it in her mind as well as hear it in her ears. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>There was a hot pressure behind her eyes\u2014not painful, but not right. It didn\u2019t belong. She instinctively fought the invasion, which seemed only to make it worse.</p><p>\u201cLet go, lovely. Let me inside.\u201d</p> <p>His words made heat flare in her belly. She pulled in a gasping breath. This wasn\u2019t right. It felt good, but it wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>Hope had no chance of breaking his grip. His body felt like hot steel against her front, his arms hard metal bands. And he smelled so good. She kept dragging his scent into her lungs, letting it become a part of her. She was losing herself in this man, slipping away.</p><p>With a surge of willpower, Hope gritted her teeth and shoved against that pressure in her head. \u201cNo!\u201d she shouted, pushing him away.</p><p>Logan flew backward, slamming into the pavement.</p><p>Shock held Hope immobile as the realization of what she\u2019d done set in. Her whole body trembled with fear and fatigue. A headache screamed behind her eyes. Her breath came out in harsh, uneven gasps, billowing in the cold air.</p><p>He pushed gracefully to his feet, his eyes never leaving her. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>Not who. What.</p><p>Hope had always known she wasn\u2019t normal. The best guess of the doctors had placed her in her late teens or early twenties the night her life began. There were no records of her birth. No parents. No friends. Not a single person had come forward when her photo had been plastered all over TV and newspapers. No one claimed her. Except Sister Olive.</p> <p>And now, nearly a decade later, Logan was voicing her deepest fears. No one had claimed her because no one knew her. It was as if she\u2019d been plunked down, out of nowhere. An alien.</p><p>Or worse.</p><p>She\u2019d always pretended she was normal. Her memory loss was a head injury no doctor could find on any CAT scan or MRI. She\u2019d built a life for herself\u2014a home for herself\u2014based around a fundamental, flimsy lie: Hope was human.</p><p>Between Logan\u2019s question and the powerful outburst she\u2019d just displayed, Hope\u2019s house of cards was beginning to fall.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d she said, her words lacking the strength she\u2019d intended to give them.</p><p>Logan dusted off his jeans and shook his head. \u201cNot on your life. I need you.\u201d</p><p>Hope scoffed at that, letting out a laugh of derision she couldn\u2019t contain. \u201cI bet you do.\u201d She nodded down at the bulge in his jeans\u2014the one she\u2019d been trying to avoid acknowledging.</p><p>\u201cWould my erection be less offensive if I told you that\u2019s the first time that\u2019s happened to me in a long, long time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a flatterer. And a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go. Do not follow me.\u201d She turned to walk away, determined to search the inside of that blasted memory-stealing building despite how freaked-out she was now.</p><p>Logan took hold of her arm and his living heat slid through her coat into her skin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t let you go. I need you. My people need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bullshit just keeps getting deeper.\u201d She tried to jerk out of his grasp, hoping for another burst of strength, but his hold stayed firm.</p><p>He stepped forward until his body was pressed against her back. Instantly, she wished for a longer coat\u2014one that would mask the thick press of his erection against her ass and the languid warmth it caused to pool in her belly.</p><p>His arm snaked around her, sliding under her sweater until his fingers curled along her ribs. They were so warm. So gentle.</p><p>Never before had she allowed a stranger to touch her like this. She had no idea why she was now.</p><p>Hope felt his breath flutter across the top of her ear. \u201cPlease don\u2019t run. I promise I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>A comforting weight descended over her, but she knew it was a trick. Some kind of magic trick he was playing on her screwed-up mind.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes. Please give me five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d She could think of too many things a man like him could do with that amount of time. Her heart pounded hard at the idea, and a burst of need exploded in her chest.</p><p>He let go of her and caressed his way up her arm, over her shoulder, and up her throat until his hand settled along the side of her face. \u201cI want to see your memories. Learn who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was it possible you were able to cast me to the ground with more strength than a man twice your size?\u201d</p><p>He had a point. \u201cWhy? Why do you want to see my memories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we can help each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many questions. It would take less time to show you than to explain. Aren\u2019t you curious?\u201d</p><p>She was. That was the problem. She\u2019d wanted to know the answer to so many questions for so long that even the merest hope of learning the truth called to her. What if he wasn\u2019t lying? What if he could see her memories and tell her once and for all if she was human or something else?</p><p>Hope nodded, feeling the heat of his fingers slide along her face. \u201cOkay. Take a peek, but I swear that if you try anything funny, I\u2019ll beat your head in with my flashlight.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>She was a violent thing, but Logan discovered that it aroused him. Like everything else about her.</p><p>He truly shouldn\u2019t have allowed himself to get this close, to let the soft swell of her ass cradle his swollen cock. The appendage had a mind of its own, jerking and pulsing against her as if it could get closer.</p><p>She was meant for someone else. He had to remember that.</p><p>Logan had spent years ignoring hunger. This was simply one more type of hunger he would learn to ignore. Quickly.</p><p>Before she changed her mind, Logan pressed his advantage and swooped into her thoughts. She didn\u2019t fight him this time. In fact, he felt himself being pulled in, welcomed as if he belonged here.</p><p>He started with her most recent thoughts and memories. Tonight.</p><p>She was afraid of him. Attracted to him. He saw himself through her eyes and there was an odd sort of colorful halo surrounding him. He\u2019d never seen anything like it before, but she was so used to it, her easy acceptance made him skim over that detail.</p><p>She was looking for someone. A friend. Logan could see the young woman\u2019s face clearly. Pretty. Dark eyes. Blond hair that had once been dyed pink, growing out to hide her face.</p><p>Logan tucked that away, and moved back along her memories, seeing a stream of nameless people sliding through her life. Some of them she knew well. Others were strangers. She seemed to care for all of them, worry for them.</p><p>He moved back to her memories of last night, knowing he needed to remove all traces of the Synestryn she\u2019d seen. That memory could lure others to her, putting her at risk. It had to be cleaned from her thoughts for her own safety.</p><p>Logan found the memories from last night. He saw himself battle the demon, and felt her fear as she\u2019d watched. She\u2019d seen him as courageous and noble. It was such an odd thing to witness that he lingered there for a moment, reveling in her perception of him. To her, he was a hero. He\u2019d saved Steve\u2019s life.</p><p>Of course, she didn\u2019t know that he\u2019d done it for his own selfish purposes. He needed Steve to survive. His people needed Steve. There was nothing noble at all about what he\u2019d done last night. It was all cold, practical logic.</p><p>And yet, witnessing how she felt about the event gave him pause. He liked how she saw him. He found himself hesitating when he knew he had to rid her of the memory.</p><p>But if he did, how would she see him then? Would she remain in his arms, pliant and cooperative? Or would she become mistrustful and bolt the moment she got the opportunity?</p><p>That was not something Logan could allow. No matter how much he liked playing the part of a noble hero, her memories of the demon had to be erased.</p><p>Like a surgeon extracting a tumor, he found the edges of that memory, preparing to cut it out. The seams between when she showed up and saw the demon, and the time she woke up in the hospital had to be knit together in a way that would not leave her curious. The less he removed, the easier it would be for her, but if he left too much, she might poke at the memory until holes formed and the events came rushing back to her.</p><p>He found what he thought was the optimal balance and began to extract those memories to take them into himself.</p><p>It didn\u2019t work. No matter how hard he tugged, the memories remained fixed in place. If he tried any harder, he\u2019d hurt her, and that was simply not something he could tolerate.</p><p>This kind of thing rarely happened, but he had heard of it. Sadly, that left him with only one option: He had to blur what was there.</p><p>His skills with this kind of work were far less advanced. He had to leave the majority of the memory intact, while hazing over that which would draw Synestryn to her.</p><p>Slowly, Logan began layering a fog over the creature, covering it in every moment of her memory. It took several iterations, but when he was done, all that was left was a black, shadowy spot in her vision, as if she\u2019d never been able to clearly see the thing that had attacked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan wasn\u2019t sure how well his work would hold. He\u2019d have to check on it again later to ensure that nothing had come unraveled. Which meant he had to stay by her side, at least for a little while.</p><p>Time had no meaning while he worked, but they were out in the open and he needed to finish his task before it became dangerous.</p><p>He moved back in time, watching her body change and thin with adolescence. He wanted to see her parents so he could help uncover the mystery of her powerful bloodline, but he didn\u2019t get far before his consciousness rammed into something. A wall. A barrier of some kind. He pushed against it, and felt an answering moan of pain coming from the woman he held in his arms.</p><p>It was too strong for him to break through without hurting her. Logan wasn\u2019t willing to do that. At least not now. He couldn\u2019t afford to ruin her newborn trust.</p> <p>He moved within the stream of her memories, weaving through them until right before he hit that barrier. She was young. Cold. Afraid. Naked and shivering in an alley as she hugged herself. The world around her was strange, the building looming over her larger than anything she\u2019d ever seen before. Through her eyes he saw her staring down at a chunk of wood. It had been rounded and sanded until it was as smooth as a river pebble. A thin leather strip woven through a roughly drilled hole. Burned into the wood was the name Hope Serrien.</p><p>Her name.</p><p>Why would that be? Why would someone strip her of her belongings and memories and leave her this one token of her identity?</p><p>Logan had no idea. What he did know was that it was no coincidence that the address scrawled in blood across his mirror was the same one where Hope\u2019s memories ceased. The same one where the demon he\u2019d killed last night had emerged. The same one where they stood now, pressed together, their minds connected.</p><p>This place held some kind of significance. Logan didn\u2019t know what it was, but he was going to find out. And in the meantime, he had something to occupy his thoughts: finding Hope a suitable mate.</p> <p>He removed himself from her mind, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to ease away from her body. He held her, sharing warmth as the cold wind whipped around them.</p><p>\u201cHope Serrien,\u201d he said, feeling her name roll from his tongue.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour life. Your memories. Where they began. Here, in this place.\u201d</p><p>She turned inside his arms, facing him. Her eyes were filled with a shame he couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know no more than you do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must. The things you can do . . .\u201d</p><p>The desperation in her voice called to him. He ached to wipe it away and replace it with pleasure. A woman like her deserved nothing less. The way she cared for others was rare\u2014a gift to be treasured.</p><p>\u201cI may be able to help. Given enough time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime?\u201d She sounded distant, almost distracted, as she stared at his mouth. She licked her lips.</p><p>The urge to bend down and kiss her was almost more than he could fight. Logan\u2019s body tensed with the effort, his muscles clamping down to hold him in check. \u201cCome with me. I have someone I\u2019d like you to meet.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure who that man would be yet, but he\u2019d figure that out once he\u2019d secured her agreement. Perhaps putting a name to the man who would belong to her would help him remember his place.</p><p>He was a matchmaker\u2014a tool. Nothing more. Certainly not someone who should be thinking about how well Hope fit in his arms, or how her scent went to his head, driving away all rational thought.</p><p>Before things got out of hand and he did something irrevocable, Logan gently separated them and took a long step back. Cold air sucked her heat from his skin and he mourned the loss.</p> <p>Hope blinked a couple of times as if the move had helped clear her head. \u201cI can\u2019t go anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are missing. And even if they weren\u2019t, I have a job to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you find your friends. I\u2019m quite good at hunting people.\u201d Her face paled, and he realized his wording had been indelicate. \u201cI mean finding people.\u201d</p><p>She had the loveliest amber-colored eyes. They reminded him of sunlight streaming through autumn leaves\u2014sunlight he could see but never feel against his skin. In the moonlight, her hair was a paler gold, the color of honey. Shadows lay against her cheek like a lover\u2019s caress, and the uncertainty in her gaze made him want to hold her close.</p><p>But what she needed right now was not his touch. She needed reassurance that he could help. That he was harmless.</p><p>Logan knew without a doubt the latter was a lie. He was more predator than man, scheming to get his way whenever necessary. And if he had to do so again now to gain her cooperation, so be it.</p><p>He forced a kind smile to curve his lips. \u201cWe\u2019ll find your friends, and then you can come with me as repayment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you live your life?\u201d she asked. \u201cCounting the cost of your service to others so the debt can be repaid? I\u2019m not sure I can accept the help of someone like that.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her in confusion, unsure of what he\u2019d said to upset her. \u201cIt only seems fair that if I help you, you would offer me something in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair. I see.\u201d She bent and picked up her flashlight from where it had fallen out of her grasp. The beam fell across his eyes, ruining his vision for a moment. \u201cThanks for your offer, but no thanks. I\u2019ll find Rory and the others on my own.\u201d</p><p>It took Logan a moment to regain his mental balance. Usually when he offered his aid, people accepted. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d been turned down. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. I\u2019ll figure it out on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . why? I\u2019m offering to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>She shone her flashlight along the brick wall and began to walk. Away from him. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not the kind of person who is willing to strike a deal with an asshole. I lived on the streets long enough to know that it will only get me in trouble.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d lived on the streets? He\u2019d sped through her memories so fast, he must have missed that part of her life. The news that she\u2019d suffered like that made something fierce and dangerous rise up inside Logan. His claws began to extend, and he had to take several deep breaths through his nose to keep his fangs from showing.</p><p>He shoved his hands in the pockets of his trench coat and followed her. \u201cWhere do you live now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>She stopped and turned to face him. Her feet were braced apart, and her grip on the sturdy Maglite tightened. \u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>Logan truly didn\u2019t know what to say. He meant her no harm, but the lengths he was willing to go to ensure her participation in Project Lullaby would frighten most humans.</p><p>He settled for the ever-present lie. \u201cNo. Of course not.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her amber gaze unwavering. \u201cI saw what you did to that . . . monster. Didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>The fact that she remembered enough of it to know it had been a monster proved just how inept he\u2019d been at masking the memory. \u201cI have no idea what you saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you didn\u2019t kill it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerceptions are tricky things. People see the same thing differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you see me?\u201d she asked. \u201cAs some sort of gullible girl to be sucked in by a hot, mysterious guy?\u201d</p><p>The idea that she found him \u201chot\u201d held more than a little appeal to him. But that wasn\u2019t what he needed from her, and it wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d asked.</p><p>He studied her, enjoying the path from the snow boots on her feet, up her slim legs, over the curve of her hips, past the puffy jacket that hid too much, and on to her lovely face. Every inch of the journey delighted him, and made him think of how she might look divested of all her trappings. Including her angry glare. \u201cYou\u2019re alone. Vulnerable. Afraid.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the erection he couldn\u2019t seem to rid himself of. Her lips tightened in disgust. \u201cAnd that excites you?\u201d</p><p>She was slipping away from him, growing cold, shoving so much mental distance between them that Logan would never be able to bridge the gap. Normally, women were much easier to deal with than Hope was. Normally, they stumbled over themselves, enthralled by his looks, offering him anything he asked for and some things he didn\u2019t. While she may have liked his appearance, she was far from enthralled.</p><p>\u201cNo. Your beauty excites me.\u201d</p><p>She let out a derisive snort. \u201cGood-bye, Logan.\u201d She walked away, searching for something along the wall.</p><p>Logan hurried to catch up. He had to mend things with her, but every time he opened his mouth, he seemed to muck things up. \u201cYour past intrigues me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cWhat do you know of my past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I\u2019d like to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could help you with that. I could help you break through that wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that cost me? Wait, let me guess. All I have to do is sleep with you.\u201d</p><p>Her words made lovely images explode in his mind. Long, tanned limbs draped in shadow. Her slender fingers gliding over his naked skin. The sweet curve of her breasts. His cock buried inside her while he fed from her beautiful neck.</p><p>All powerful, compelling daydreams. All completely out of the question.</p><p>Logan cleared his throat so he could speak. \u201cI offer my services as a gift. Free of charge.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and turned, and as her gaze fell upon him once again, he felt satisfied and somehow more complete.</p><p>A slight smile played at her lips. \u201cI see you\u2019re a fast learner.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes slid down his body. Logan shifted, closing his coat to hide the inconvenient effect she had on his body. \u201cThe swiftest. I assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people would ask how, not why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people would trust whatever words came out of that lovely mouth of yours, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>So she did find him appealing. He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve learned my secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now you have to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. I\u2019d give my life for yours.\u201d</p><p>A blond eyebrow twitched upward. \u201cLaying it on a bit thick, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth. I need you. My people need you. Whatever it takes to gain your cooperation, I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so this is about what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean only to remove any barrier that stands in the way of your acceptance of my proposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat proposal is that?\u201d</p><p>The truth seemed to be making more progress than manipulation did, so Logan decided to give it a try. The novel approach felt clumsy to him, but he was an adaptable creature. \u201cThere\u2019s a man I\u2019d like you to meet.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the sound echoing off the brick building. \u201cYou\u2019re doing all of this to set me up on a blind date?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem worried by the notion. Only amused. \u201cWhat if I am?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hope shook her head. Moonlight slid over the silky strands. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time. I don\u2019t date. I\u2019m too busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding lost friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will help you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI already told you I didn\u2019t want your help. I\u2019m not interested in partnering with any man who has to be paid off to do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you that what I\u2019m asking of you is the right thing? And that I seek only to further the greater good?\u201d</p><p>Disbelief filled her tone. \u201cBy setting me up on a blind date?\u201d</p><p>He was getting caught in the language, his meaning becoming diluted because of the words. It would be so much simpler if he could convey his wishes to her directly\u2014send his thoughts into hers so she understood them without the barrier of communication.</p><p>Logan stepped forward, reaching toward her.</p> <p>Hope stumbled back, raising the flashlight as a weapon. \u201cStay where you are. You\u2019re not getting more of my blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember that?\u201d Which meant her mind was powerful indeed. No wonder her mental barrier was so formidable. Chances were she\u2019d erected it herself in an effort to forget some painful past best left uncovered.</p><p>If it hadn\u2019t been for Logan\u2019s need to know her origins, he would have decided then and there to let that barrier stand.</p><p>But he did need to know. She may have siblings. Children. If so, he needed to find them.</p><p>Her gloved hand strayed to her neck. Her voice became distant, vibrating with a subtle trace of fear. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure until just now. I thought it might have been a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize if I hurt or frightened you.\u201d</p> <p>She took a long step back. Her face had gone ashen and he could hear her pulse speed.</p><p>His mouth began to water, but he ignored it. He\u2019d fed well from her. He was still strong. Still full. He didn\u2019t need any more of her blood. It was merely a want, and one he wouldn\u2019t indulge. Not only was she likely to still be weak from what he\u2019d taken; if he fed from her now, she\u2019d never trust him.</p><p>\u201cAre you a vampire?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Logan detested the term, and he felt his mouth twist with a sneer. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed that monster. You took my blood. If you\u2019re not a vampire, then what are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnxious to help you find your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can drink her blood.\u201d</p><p>He pinned her with a stare, gliding forward. \u201cWould that bother you? To see my lips at another woman\u2019s throat?\u201d</p> <p>Fear vanished from her features and was replaced with indignation. \u201cHardly. Get over yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to stand out here in the cold and continue to talk, or would you rather find your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory. Her name is Rory.\u201d</p><p>He nodded his acknowledgment. \u201cTell me about her. Where did you last see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the convenience store on the corner. I tried to get her to come sleep at the shelter where I work and she refused. As always. She said she\u2019d rather sleep here, in this building, where there were no prying eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she paranoid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Would it matter to you if she was crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a woman I know named Nika. Everyone thought she was crazy, too. As it turned out, she simply saw things the rest of us could not. Since then, I\u2019ve become more conservative in making judgment calls about such things.\u201d</p><p>Hope\u2019s body went still. \u201cWhat kinds of things did she see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Do you see things? Did your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered too quickly. \u201cI just mean you hear stories about people seeing odd things. You know. Ghosts. Vampires.\u201d</p><p>She was baiting him. Logan refused to take it. \u201cAs far as I know, such things do not exist. Though there are other things that do. Far worse things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could spend a week of nights listing the nightmares that lurk in the dark. I fear, however, we do not have that kind of time. Rory is still lost.\u201d</p><p>Hope nodded. \u201cRight. You\u2019re right. We need to focus. Ghost stories will wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your plan for locating her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking for a way inside. This is the only place where I know she stayed that I haven\u2019t searched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you notified the human police?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cIs there any other kind?\u201d</p><p>He realized his mistake too late. \u201cI only mean the ones who care. The good cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not what you meant. I don\u2019t want to slow us down, but I\u2019ll have you know I\u2019m making a list of questions.\u201d</p><p>Good. That meant she was planning to be with him long enough to ask questions. \u201cAs you please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answer is yes, I did report her missing. The police did what they could, which wasn\u2019t much. Which is why I\u2019m out here, trying to break into private property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d he said, heading back to the boarded-up overhead door.</p><p>As strong as he was now, thanks to Hope\u2019s blood, all he had to do was shove his foot against the wood. The force of his kick ripped the screws holding the wood loose, sending the board clattering onto the concrete floor inside.</p><p>\u201cHow did you . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work out,\u201d he lied.</p><p>While she was still staring in shock, Logan stepped through the opening. He channeled power to his senses, gathering information and seeking out threats. The poisonous Synestryn that had nearly killed him last night had chosen this place for a reason. For all he knew, there might be more demons lurking inside.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>The only reason Tori had not yet slit her own wrists was the promise of revenge. It burned inside her, churning and roiling in her belly until she couldn\u2019t think of anything else.</p><p>The Synestryn lord Zillah was going to die. She wasn\u2019t sure how yet, but every one of the hundreds of painful possibilities was appealing in its own way.</p><p>He\u2019d stolen her when she was little. Caged her. Fed her his blood. Raped her. Forced her to bear his spawn\u2014all dead. Like his soul.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter how many times she tortured him or killed him, it would never be enough. Her hunger for his agony would never be sated. Her thirst for his suffering never quenched.</p><p>She could feel his presence burning in her blood. His blood.</p><p>Beneath her pale skin, she could see the black of his essence pulsing inside her. The healers here had tried to get rid of it, but it had only made them sick.</p><p>She made them sick.</p><p>The door to her room opened and panic ripped through her. She held her breath, peering out from under the bed where she lay. Big, booted feet crossed the carpet.</p><p>\u201cTori?\u201d</p><p>Andra\u2019s voice. Her sister.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought you something. Can you come out?\u201d</p><p>Andra wouldn\u2019t go away until she\u2019d given her whatever it was. It was faster to let her do what she wanted and get it over with.</p><p>Tori wriggled out from under the far side of the bed. She stood, pressing herself into the corner.</p><p>Light from the hall spilled inside, burning Tori\u2019s eyes. After so many years of living in blackness, light burned. Especially sunlight.</p><p>For so many years, she\u2019d dreamt of seeing the sun again, and now it brought only pain.</p><p>That was one more sin Zillah had to pay for.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sleep under there, baby,\u201d said Andra, her voice soft, like she was talking to a child.</p><p>She was shielding something on a tray with her hand. A searing glow poured over Andra\u2019s face and body.</p><p>Tori closed her eyes. \u201cThis room is too big.\u201d It loomed around her, like the open jaws of a giant monster. One wrong move and those jaws would clamp shut, trapping her inside.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out. So you\u2019re more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d asked Tori, hoping her sister would hurry up and leave.</p><p>\u201cI brought you something.\u201d</p><p>Andra moved her hand and the flare of fire stabbed Tori\u2019s eyes. She hissed in pain, falling to a crouch to cover her head so she wouldn\u2019t get burned.</p><p>There was a sound of heavy breathing, then the smell of smoke. Her sister\u2019s voice was filled with guilt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. I didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d</p><p>Tori didn\u2019t answer. There was nothing she could say to make it better. For either of them.</p><p>\u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t want a bunch of people around, but I wanted to do something.\u201d</p><p>Now that the fire was gone, Tori looked up. Andra held something Tori recognized but could not name. It was sweet. She remembered that much. Mom used to make them in the dreams she had before the caves.</p><p>Andra offered it. The tiny, pink torch stuck out from the top, sending a tendril of smoke into the air between them. \u201cIt\u2019s a cupcake.\u201d</p><p>Cupcake. Yes. That was the word.</p><p>Tori took it. Her fingers sank into it until she lightened her grip. The sweet smell of it turned her stomach, but she hid that from her sister. She thought it might hurt Andra\u2019s feelings.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to eat it now if you don\u2019t want to. I just wanted to do something,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Her sister reached out to touch her, but Tori flinched away. She couldn\u2019t stop herself.</p><p>Andra\u2019s hand fell to her side and sadness covered her. Even her hair looked sad. \u201cToday is your birthday, baby. Don\u2019t you remember? You\u2019re eighteen.\u201d</p><p>Shock stilled Tori\u2019s heart for a moment. That had to be wrong. She had been in those caves forever. Not just ten years.</p><p>Andra let out a sad sigh and rose to her feet. \u201cIs there anything I can do? Anything I can get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Tori automatically. She didn\u2019t like it when people were around. It was easier to think when she was alone under the bed. Safe.</p><p>Andra nodded. As she left the room, she said, \u201cHappy birthday, Tori,\u201d then shut the door.</p><p>Tori stared at the cupcake for a long time. She opened the bottom drawer of the little cabinet beside her bed and set the cupcake inside. She might need it later, if she got hungry, and she didn\u2019t want anyone to see it and take it away.</p><p>It was her cupcake. She\u2019d kill anyone who tried to take it.</p><p>Andra managed to shut the door before the tears started to fall. Her baby sister was home, but she wasn\u2019t okay. Whatever the Synestryn had done to her had destroyed her. Their blood still flowed in her veins.</p><p>Tynan said she was dangerous. To others as well as herself. He wanted to put her in a magically prolonged sleep until they could figure out how to filter her blood.</p><p>If they could figure out how. So far, everyone had failed.</p><p>Maybe he was right. Andra had hoped that with time and love, Tori would heal, but that was looking less and less likely as each day passed.</p><p>Her husband Paul\u2019s comforting presence slid through the luceria that linked them together. He was in a meeting with Joseph, but he was never far from her mind.</p><p>He was worried what Tori might do.</p><p>Andra wasn\u2019t. If she had to, she\u2019d restrain her sister. She refused to fear her. Tori needed help, not to be shunned.</p><p>The real fear wasn\u2019t what Tori would do to others; it was what she\u2019d do to herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe Tynan was right. Maybe it was time to put Tori to sleep. Just for a while.</p><p>Hope stepped through the hole Logan had opened in the overhead door. Leather stretched over his broad back. She was sure the first time she\u2019d seen him, he\u2019d been thinner. Gaunt. But now he was packed with lean, athletic muscle. So much so his coat barely fit. She wanted to run her hands over him to see if it was real or just one more trick her mind had played on her. Of course, the thought of touching him made her hands shake and something hot and excited fluttered in her stomach.</p><p>She had to forcibly drag her gaze away from his back and focus on what they were doing.</p><p>The building was quiet. Dust floated in the beam of her flashlight. The scent of lumber and musty animals filled her nose. There was barely any ambient light sliding in from the windows. Several of them had been boarded up, and those that weren\u2019t were filthy with age and neglect.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d asked Logan.</p><p>\u201cThe Tyler building. They built custom furniture here years ago. It\u2019s been for sale for as long as I can remember.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder, his pale eyes brilliant in the dark. \u201cHow did you lose your memory?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to talk about this. Not with him. Not with anyone. \u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the thing with amnesia. You can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you wounded?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she repeated, shoving the words out from between gritted teeth so he\u2019d take a hint.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me about your friend. Why are you looking here for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lives on the streets. She\u2019d stay here sometimes, along with a lot of other people. It\u2019s a good place to get out of the cold and snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes she comes to the homeless shelter where I volunteer. Picks up a quick meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure she\u2019s missing? Could it be that she\u2019s moved on?\u201d</p> <p>Hope sighed, gathering her patience. It wasn\u2019t his fault he was asking the same questions she\u2019d already answered a hundred times. \u201cI\u2019d like to think she would have said something to me. She knows I worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you worry about all the people you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but not like Rory. She was young. Too young to be out here alone. She told me she was twenty-five, but she looked sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA runaway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. She\u2019s tough. Rebellious. That\u2019s enough to tell me she isn\u2019t new to the streets.\u201d</p><p>They passed through a doorway that led to a stairwell. Logan went up. \u201cIs she a prostitute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t ask. Does it matter?\u201d</p><p>Logan shrugged. His leather jacket creaked. \u201cNot to me.\u201d</p> <p>A tension riding along Hope\u2019s neck loosened at his words. He wasn\u2019t the type of man to instantly write off another because of mistakes they\u2019d made or the things they were driven to do for the sake of survival. That was refreshing. And unexpected.</p><p>It gave her the courage to let him in on her fears. \u201cHave you ever had a bad feeling? One that wouldn\u2019t go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConstantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean something that had no basis in logic or fact, but you were sure was true, anyway?\u201d</p><p>He stopped on a landing and gave her a steady look. \u201cThe notion is not a foreign one, no. Do you have a feeling like that?\u201d</p><p>Hope nodded, avoiding his gaze. \u201cYeah. About Rory. She was running from something. I\u2019m afraid that that something might have caught up with her.\u201d</p><p>Logan laid a comforting hand on her shoulder. She could feel the warmth of his touch sink through the puffy layers of her quilted jacket and into her skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think she was running?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe moved around a lot. Never slept in the same place two nights in a row. Most people develop patterns. She had none that I could tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long time for someone like that to stay in one place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I thought so, too. I asked her about it once and she said she was looking for someone. She wouldn\u2019t say who.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s eyes narrowed in speculation. \u201cDid she happen to have a ring-shaped birthmark that you\u2019re aware of?\u201d</p><p>Hope was taken aback by the odd question. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His gaze grew intense, brightening a bit in the gloom of the stairwell. \u201cDo you have a ring-shaped birthmark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would explain a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? All you\u2019re doing is confusing me.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid down her arm until he grasped her fingers. Her leather gloves warmed to his touch, and she wished she hadn\u2019t put them on now. The need to feel his skin on hers was suddenly an overwhelming, consuming thing.</p><p>He took a small step toward her, closing the space between them. \u201cI would very much like it if you\u2019d answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me why first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat mark is important. It\u2019s proof of a certain . . . genetic predisposition that identifies its bearer as a rare treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike some kind of blood donor or something?\u201d</p><p>A small smile stretched his mouth, making him heartstoppingly beautiful. \u201cIndeed. Do you wear it?\u201d</p><p>Hope shook her head, feeling a stab of disappointment. The way he said it\u2014that rare treasure bit\u2014made it sound romantic and special.</p><p>What she wouldn\u2019t give to be a good kind of special, instead of a brain-damaged, head-case kind of special.</p><p>\u201cNo. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand before letting it go. \u201cNo worries. It simply means we still have a mystery to solve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMystery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe location of your missing friend, of course,\u201d he said, though she was certain that he\u2019d meant something else entirely.</p><p>\u201cRight. We should get moving. I don\u2019t like being here. Gives me the willies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have that, now, can we?\u201d He turned and headed up the stairs, exiting the door onto the third floor. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have anything with Rory\u2019s blood on it, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer blood?\u201d</p><p>He nodded as he scanned the large open area sprinkled with wooden platforms she guessed were workbenches.</p><p>\u201cIf I had some, I\u2019d be able to locate her easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d asked Hope.</p><p>He ignored her question and headed toward the far end of the room where several bare mattresses sat. \u201cThis looks like a place one would sleep, does it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you find her with her blood?\u201d</p><p>Logan gave her a panty-melting grin. \u201cThere are some things even your sweet face cannot coax out of me.\u201d</p><p>The veiled compliment slid through her, warming her down to her toes. Staring at that smile, she forgot what she wanted to know or why it mattered. His male beauty filled her head and made a pool of longing swell deep in her belly.</p><p>She stood there, staring, watching his pale eyes slide over her body. That sunshine-warm feeling he gave off blasted her front, making her nipples bead up against a shiver of need.</p><p>He pulled in a deep breath through his nose and his hands fisted at his sides. \u201cWhen you look at me like that, I forget who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you want me. Like you wouldn\u2019t care if I tossed you down on one of those dirty mattresses and took my pleasure with you.\u201d</p><p>Would she care? If it meant she could get his hands on her bare skin, sliding over her. Or maybe even get his mouth on her neck again and feel that hot tugging at her throat.</p><p>The memory of what he\u2019d done to her bloomed in her mind, only this time, there was no fear, only that languid pleasure of his mouth on her, his tongue swirling over her skin.</p><p>Her hand fluttered to that spot, feeling an answering warmth glowing there so bright she was sure he could see it.</p><p>A low hiss rose from him and his eyes flared bright, spilling light across her chest. \u201cYou should not tempt me.\u201d</p><p>Her voice shook with need as she answered. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a man,\u201d he said, making it sound like a warning.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDangerous. Hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me feed you.\u201d She\u2019d meant food, but the way his gaze shot to her neck made her realize the other interpretations her words might have.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too giving for your own good. I will use that against you. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlas, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy warn me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head, and when he spoke, she was sure she saw a white flash of fangs in his mouth. \u201cI have no idea. You\u2019re a weakness I can\u2019t seem to understand. It\u2019s best we complete our task and go our separate ways before I do something irrevocable.\u201d</p><p>He turned, striding toward the mattresses, clearly ending the conversation.</p><p>Hope stood where she was, shaking. Now that he was farther away, she could feel her body returning to normal. Her pulse slowed, as did her breathing. The dots of sweat that had formed along her hairline evaporated into the cold night air. Her abdomen relaxed and that flush of heat dissipated from her skin.</p><p>Whoever he was, whatever he was, Logan was potent. Intoxicating. Hope had always abstained from drugs and alcohol, worried that such things had contributed to her amnesia. She\u2019d never even been tempted. But Logan was a different matter entirely. She wanted him. More than she\u2019d ever wanted a man before in her life.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t right. She sensed that there was some reason he kept his distance.</p><p>Perhaps he was married.</p><p>The thought shriveled something small and hopeful in her heart. She\u2019d never poach. Not even for a man as beautiful as Logan. It was best they kept their distance and stayed professional. She wouldn\u2019t turn away his help to find Rory\u2014she couldn\u2019t do that to her friend\u2014but she could keep things light. Stay detached.</p><p>With that decision made, Hope felt better. Stronger. She pulled in a deep breath and went to Logan\u2019s side where he was staring down at the floor.</p><p>Silvery light spilled out over the dusty mattress. It was coming from Logan\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He appeared to be in some kind of trance, his focus beyond the floor. His face was lax and his breathing slow and even.</p><p>A moment later, he blinked several times and crouched next to the mattress. \u201cSomeone was killed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d</p><p>He gave the mattress a hard shove and it slid over the floorboards, leaving a trail in the dust. There was a dark, irregular stain on the wood, several feet across. Hope shone her flashlight on it and saw the rusty brown of dried blood.</p><p>\u201cIs that what I think it is?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBlood. And whomever it belonged to couldn\u2019t have survived that kind of loss.\u201d</p><p>Hope didn\u2019t ask him if he was sure. She guessed he knew what he was talking about in this area of expertise.</p><p>\u201cIt looks old,\u201d she said, trying to convince herself it was true. It had been only a few days since she\u2019d seen Rory. It couldn\u2019t be hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA couple of days at most.\u201d</p><p>Worry tightened Hope\u2019s throat. \u201cHow can you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe smell. She was healthy at the time of her death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s blood,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that from the way it smells.\u201d</p><p>He stood suddenly, his eyes darting to the far side of the room. He grabbed her arm and pushed her behind him. \u201cSomeone\u2019s here. Stay silent. I\u2019ll shield us from sight.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea what he meant, but a second later, she felt a stirring of something around them. It brushed her cheek, but felt nothing like wind. The fine hair along her arms lifted as a silvery light slid up from the ground in a cylinder.</p><p>It surrounded them both, pulsing and fluttering with what looked like bits of glitter. The effect was oddly like being trapped inside a snow globe.</p> <p>Hope didn\u2019t dare ask how he\u2019d done it. She worried her voice would give them away.</p><p>What if it was the killer coming back?</p><p>A door on the far side of the room opened and Hope saw the faintest edge of an aura slip through a moment before a man entered the room. From this distance, with sparkling flecks blocking her vision, she couldn\u2019t see him clearly, but his aura was familiar.</p><p>Faded with time and bent with age, the halo of color surrounded the man, gliding along as his constant companion. Red streaks of pain slid through swaths of cool green acceptance. Pale golden strokes of happiness hovered behind him, and ahead of him was calm, fearless, brilliant hope. Sections of color were simply missing, as if his aura was too old and weary to fill in the gaps.</p><p>Hope had seen this before. It was the aura of the elderly\u2014of those who were ready to go to meet their maker.</p><p>The man shuffled forward, a paper sack clenched in his gnarled hand. His plaid coat hung open, showing off baggy clothes beneath. He lifted his head, giving her a glimpse of his face.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Charlie,\u201d she whispered close to Logan\u2019s ear. \u201cI know him. He\u2019s harmless.\u201d</p><p>The glittering column dissipated, taking with it the odd tingling energy that had created it.</p><p>\u201cHello, Charlie,\u201d said Logan in a low, calm voice.</p><p>The man stopped in his tracks, clutching his sack to his chest. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>Hope stepped forward so he could see her clearly, shining the flashlight on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Hope Serrien.\u201d</p><p>The man sagged in relief. \u201cHell, girl. You nearly scared me out of my skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shelter was crowded. I couldn\u2019t take it tonight, so I thought I\u2019d slip up here for a bit. Who\u2019s the fella?\u201d</p> <p>Logan ignored his question. \u201cThere\u2019s blood on the floor. Do you know how it got there?\u201d</p><p>Charlie\u2019s rheumy eyes narrowed. \u201cSon, you\u2019d best leave that alone if you know what\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p><p>That sounded suspiciously like he did know.</p><p>Hope crossed the space, hurrying to his side. \u201cWas it Rory? Was she here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sweet girl. No good can come of you poking your nose into things. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t. If Rory was killed here, you would have reported it, right?\u201d</p><p>Charlie turned around as if to leave. \u201cThe less I see, the safer I am. You, too.\u201d</p><p>Hope took his arm, feeling his bones easily through the layers of clothing. \u201cYou have to tell me. I won\u2019t make you talk to the police. I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d</p><p>Charlie shook his shaggy head. \u201cGirl, there\u2019s nothing the police can do to fix some things. What happened here is one of them. You\u2019d best leave it be. Walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I can help,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>Charlie looked him up and down, wearing a dismissive expression. \u201cIf so, I\u2019ll eat my hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid. Understandably so. But I assure you that if there is some kind of creature lurking here, I\u2019m more capable of dispatching it than any policeman would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat so?\u201d asked Charlie.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think it\u2019s some kind of creature?\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s chest expanded with a frustrated breath, but it didn\u2019t come out in a sigh. \u201cI killed one here last night. Typically, these things congregate in nests. When you see one, there are more lurking nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike cockroaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I need to find myself a new place to sleep, then.\u201d</p><p>Hope couldn\u2019t let him get away. Not until she knew the truth. \u201cPlease, Charlie. At least tell me if it was Rory. I have to know what happened to her.\u201d</p><p>The old man paused, his thin lips mashing together in hesitation. \u201cI didn\u2019t see who it was. By the time I got here, her head was already gone. There were things feeding on her, though. And they weren\u2019t no rats.\u201d</p><p>An image of Rory\u2019s lifeless body being gnawed away by animals flashed in Hope\u2019s mind, horrifying her. She choked back a cry of anguish, pressing the back of her hand against her mouth. It took several deep breaths to gather herself enough to speak.</p><p>\u201cHer shoes,\u201d asked Hope. \u201cWere they pink high-tops?\u201d</p><p>Hope had found a pair in a donations box and given them to Rory. Since the other woman had dyed her hair the same color, Hope was sure she\u2019d like them. And lace-up shoes like that were good. They were harder for someone else to steal when you were sleeping. She figured Rory needed every advantage she could get.</p><p>Charlie frowned as if trying to remember. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think I would have remembered a thing like that.\u201d</p><p>Hope sagged in relief. Logan\u2019s hand caught her elbow and held her steady. He gave her a worried look and studied her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she told him. \u201cThat couldn\u2019t have been Rory.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded and turned his attention to Charlie. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a money clip stuffed with cash. He peeled off a couple hundred dollars and handed it to Charlie. \u201cThank you for your service.\u201d</p><p>Charlie eyed the money in suspicion. \u201cI didn\u2019t do nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe here. Buy a room. Get warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d said Hope. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>Charlie hesitantly reached for the money. Logan grabbed his hand and held on, covering the other man\u2019s hand in both of his.</p><p>That odd tingling feeling slid through the air again, only this time there were no glittery flecks surrounding them. Pale silvery light flared for a split second\u2014so fast Hope couldn\u2019t locate the source of it.</p><p>Charlie\u2019s aura changed. Some of the gaps filled in, and a few of the red streaks of pain dissipated. From the corner of her eye, she saw those streaks appear in Logan\u2019s aura for a moment before fading away, as if he\u2019d somehow absorbed them.</p><p>Charlie stumbled back.</p><p>Logan surged forward, steadying the old man before he could fall. \u201cCareful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d asked Charlie, his eyes wide with accusation.</p><p>Logan frowned in confusion. \u201cDo?\u201d</p><p>Charlie shoved the money in his pocket and wiped his hand on his pants. He looked at Hope. \u201cGo home, girl. I don\u2019t know what that man is, but I sure as hell know it ain\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>Hope glanced at Logan, who was the picture of innocence.</p><p>Charlie left, standing straighter, his shuffling gait more steady and swift than she\u2019d ever seen it. The stairwell door shut behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d said Logan. But he was paler than he had been, which seemed impossible. And his aura was smaller. Dimmer. As if whatever he\u2019d done had cost him something.</p><p>Hope had never seen anything like it before.</p><p>\u201cYou helped him somehow,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>She was trapped now. She couldn\u2019t very well tell him she could see auras. She\u2019d never told anyone. \u201cI could tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>\u201cWoman\u2019s intuition.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed as he scrutinized her. \u201cDid you know I can smell it when you lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d he asked. \u201cAfter all you\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s the thing that you find ridiculous?\u201d</p><p>He had a point\u2014one she was not going to look at very closely.</p><p>He intrigued her. The more time she spent with him, the more she wanted to know about him, the more she wanted to unravel the mystery he presented.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she heard herself say before she realized what she was doing. \u201cI\u2019ll go on that blind date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn exchange for . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. You gave Charlie a gift and I want to repay your kindness. But I can\u2019t be distracted by dating until I find out what happened to those missing people, what happened to Rory. Help me if you like. Or don\u2019t. That\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll help me. Do you promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already said I would. We don\u2019t have to bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndulge me. Give me your word.\u201d</p><p>Hope sighed. The man had some odd ideas, but if he could track blood, he was going to be more useful than the police could ever hope to be. \u201cFine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>As the words left her mouth, a weight descended on her, like someone had doused her under a waterfall. She gasped in shock and actually looked up to see if something had fallen.</p><p>A satisfied smile lifted his mouth. \u201cLovely. A bargain is struck.\u201d</p><p>Hope didn\u2019t know exactly what she\u2019d gotten herself into, but she was pretty sure it was binding. And somehow, the idea of being with Logan long enough for their \u201cbargain\u201d to play out didn\u2019t bother her nearly as much as it probably should have.</p><p>\u201cCan we just get moving?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a big building and I want to make sure Rory\u2019s not in here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Logan gave her a small bow. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Logan had done it. He\u2019d wrung a promise from Hope and now she was bound to it.</p><p>Sadly, he didn\u2019t feel like celebrating his victory. Instead, he scolded himself for his lack of discipline. He never should have healed the old man. It was a waste of power, one he\u2019d be kicking himself for when he\u2019d used up that which he\u2019d taken from Hope.</p><p>Still, as stupid as it had been, he wasn\u2019t sure he would do differently now, given the opportunity.</p><p>Renewing Charlie\u2019s strength, driving away some of the pain of his years . . . It was rewarding in a way Logan had nearly forgotten. It had been centuries since there had been enough strongly blooded humans roaming Earth to fuel his kind properly. Long gone was the time when he could walk into a village and heal the sick and lame knowing there would be ample offers to feed him.</p><p>Back then, he could squander his power, letting it flow freely into the world. He could do good.</p><p>It had been . . . satisfying.</p><p>But now things were different. Bloodlines were too diluted. The power of the ancient Athanasians\u2014a race of amazingly strong beings on a distant planet that was the source of all Sentinel magic\u2014was nearly wiped from the world, traces of it so minute, he and his kind spent nearly all their time searching for them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Until Hope. Her blood was powerful in a way he hadn\u2019t experienced for years. It was rivaled only by a few Theronai women, such as Helen, who\u2019d been recently discovered\u2014women whose blood was carefully guarded by their dangerous, sword-wielding husbands.</p><p>Once again he wondered if Hope might be one of them\u2014a Theronai, the child of an Athanasian man and a human woman. It was possible. The women they\u2019d found had no idea what they really were. Hope could be one more.</p><p>And if so, then the stirring in his groin when he looked upon her was more than inconvenient. It was forbidden. If she was a Theronai, touching her could start a war. If she was a Slayer, touching her could get him killed. If she was human, she belonged to Project Lullaby, and touching her would be akin to betraying his own kind.</p><p>Perhaps it was time to call in one of the Theronai. They were far better suited to protect her than Logan was\u2014at least once the power Hope\u2019s blood had given him was gone and he was once again weak.</p> <p>He found himself resisting the idea of handing her safekeeping to another. He\u2019d found her. He\u2019d fed from her. He\u2019d bargained with her. They were tied together.</p><p>That was the thought that spurred Logan to action. He was already growing too attached to the woman, and whether she was human, Theronai, or Slayer, that simply could not stand.</p><p>Logan retrieved his phone and dialed Joseph, the Theronai leader. Let him send someone to see to her safety and test her identity. If she was a Theronai, one of her own kind would know. If she wasn\u2019t, she\u2019d be in safe hands until such time as Logan or Tynan could find her a suitable mate. It was the safest course of action\u2014one that would preserve the power flowing through her veins, and prevent Logan from doing something unforgivable.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>It was still early in the evening when Iain finished cleaning out the nest and went back to his Suburban.</p> <p>Fucking demons hadn\u2019t even put up enough of a fight to make him breathe hard. And the paltry battle sure as hell hadn\u2019t done a thing to ease the pain swelling in his chest more with every day that passed.</p><p>He would have thought that after his soul died off some of that pain would have gone away. But no. No such luck.</p><p>His blood was running hot and he was way past the point where meditation would do him any good. The only thing that would help now was more fighting.</p><p>Iain pulled up an electronic map on his phone. Nicholas had rigged the thing to pinpoint the known locations of the child-face abominations. He selected the little pink dot that indicated his current location and deleted it. The next closest one was northern Kansas, which was a good two-hour drive on backcountry roads.</p><p>He hoped like hell that by the time he got there, the pain wouldn\u2019t be any worse. Too much more and he wouldn\u2019t be able to fight. And that he simply could not stand.</p><p>Iain put the vehicle in gear and headed for a road. He\u2019d made a bit of a mess of some farmer\u2019s field getting out here, but there was no help for that. At least he\u2019d taken care of their infestation.</p> <p>He\u2019d just eased back onto a pitted blacktop road when he heard a noise rise up from behind him. It was low. Faint. More a brush of air than a sound.</p><p>A slow, satisfied smile stretched his mouth as he pulled to the side of the road.</p><p>Apparently, one of the demons had slipped past him and hitched a ride with the wrong man.</p><p>Ava\u2019s body clenched hard, driving the breath from her lungs. The baby was coming. Right now.</p><p>She huddled under the blanket she\u2019d found, crouched in the far backseat of the big SUV, trying to be quiet. She curled around her child, hugging her knees as close as possible in an effort to ward off the pain. A coppery taste filled her mouth as she bit down on her lip, struggling to be silent in the face of so much pain.</p><p>The tires bounced, jostling her hard. A second later, the car tilted sideways as it was parked in a deep ditch.</p><p>A car door opened, but Ava didn\u2019t dare lift her head to peer out a window to see where they were. They hadn\u2019t been driving long enough yet for her to have made a clean escape. She was still too close to the caves.</p><p>The back door at her feet was ripped open. The man she\u2019d seen in the cave was standing there, holding a gleaming sword, looking ready to kill her. His face was a snarl of rage and veins in his neck stood out.</p> <p>Fear, her faithful companion these long months, was there at her side, holding her close, refusing to let go. She held her dirty hands up as if they could do anything to shield her from his blade.</p><p>Her voice came out raw and scratchy from the fight to keep from screaming. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s expression altered from rage to suspicion, but his blade stayed high and ready to strike. \u201cWho are you? And how the hell did you get in my ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in those caves. I escaped. I didn\u2019t know where else to go.\u201d</p><p>She started to ask for his help, but her words were cut off as another wave of pain crushed her body. This time, there was nothing she could do to stop a low moan of agony.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d The man sheathed his sword, leaned inside, and grabbed her arms. He pulled on her, but her body was too tense to cooperate as he tried to pull her from the car.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak. Pressure grew inside her as her body contracted. There was a wrenching kind of pain. She felt her skin tear as the baby\u2019s head crowned.</p><p>Ava pushed the blanket away and reached between her legs, heedless of her lack of clothing. The jeans she\u2019d been wearing when she was taken hadn\u2019t fit her for months. Even the stretchy T-shirt she wore couldn\u2019t cover her belly. Her immodesty had stopped having meaning a long time ago, and she only vaguely remembered now that there had been a time when she cared.</p><p>The man jerked the blanket away, finally seeing what was going on. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d she grated out between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cHell. Hold on.\u201d He didn\u2019t look worried. Simply resigned.</p><p>\u201cHave you done this before?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelivered a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Couple of times.\u201d</p><p>That made her feel better. Safer. And then another contraction hit and all she could feel was pain and pressure. Her body took over, forcing her to bare down. Another searing sting burned her as the baby\u2019s shoulders passed. Her child slid from her. The pressure faded, leaving her panting for breath. She caught her baby\u2019s slippery body and brought him up to her chest.</p><p>She had a baby boy. A wave of something nameless and profound washed over her, altering her forever. She was a mom. In this single, still moment, nothing else mattered.</p><p>Her boy let out his first choked cry. It grew louder as the seconds passed, reassuring her as nothing else could.</p><p>She\u2019d done it. She\u2019d delivered a healthy baby despite the torture she\u2019d endured for almost a year.</p><p>The man was hunched over, his body filling the doorway. He was staring at her with an odd look on his face. A kind of resignation. \u201cI\u2019ll find something to tie off the cord.\u201d</p><p>The wetness beneath her began to cool, making her shiver. She covered them both, reveling in the squawking cries of her boy.</p><p>The man came back a moment later with two strips of frayed cloth. She allowed him to tie off the cord and sever it with a sharp knife.</p><p>Something hot and wet slid from between her legs, followed by a gush of fluid.</p><p>The man glanced down and a grim look tightened his hard features. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding. I need to get you to a doctor.\u201d</p><p>It was his speed that gave away the urgency of the situation. So far, his movements had been methodical and easy\u2014fast but not rushed.</p><p>He was rushing now.</p><p>As the car jolted over the road, Ava held her baby, protecting him from the rough ride as well as she could. She could feel the slow trickle of blood flowing from her, but didn\u2019t know what to do to stop it. She wadded the blanket up between her thighs and clenched them together.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d said the man. \u201cBump.\u201d</p><p>The car lurched, going airborne for a second before landing hard. Ava was getting nauseated from the ride, but she didn\u2019t dare sit up and look out a window. Moving might make the bleeding worse.</p><p>She heard him talk to someone on the phone, but couldn\u2019t hear the words over the roar of the engine. All she could hear was the pissed-off tone in his voice.</p><p>\u201cHow much farther?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot much. You just hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold. Can you turn on the heat?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, then responded with, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>The next time they went over a big bump, Ava\u2019s arms didn\u2019t seem to work. Her baby shifted and she had to struggle to keep him safe against her chest. When her head began to spin, she realized that the weakness wasn\u2019t a simple mistake. The blanket between her legs was soaked.</p><p>She was bleeding out.</p><p>Her vision blurred, going dark around the edges. She focused on her baby and swallowed a lump of regret. She wanted to see him grow up. Wanted to play with him and teach him things. She wanted to protect him from the monsters that had taken her.</p><p>They\u2019d put this baby inside her. She knew they were going to want him back.</p><p>Her strength was fading. She wasn\u2019t going to make it much longer. She forced her voice out so it was loud enough for the man to hear. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours now. Promise me.\u201d Her voice was getting weaker. She wasn\u2019t sure if he heard her. If so, he didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Ava could no longer keep her eyes open. She was so cold. She kissed her baby\u2019s head and gathered her strength for one last plea for help. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cProtect my son.\u201d</p><p>Iain didn\u2019t dare give his promise. If that child was one of the abominations, it was his job to kill it. From what little he\u2019d seen, he couldn\u2019t tell if there were signs of Synestryn blood flowing through the infant\u2019s veins, but with her in that cave, pregnant and alone, chances were good the father wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>Several silent minutes passed as Iain sped over the rutted road. She didn\u2019t speak again.</p><p>\u201cAre you still with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer, he knew she was either dead or unconscious. And that the child was back there, unrestrained.</p><p>If it was human, he could kill it if he hit a bump the wrong way.</p><p>Iain slowed the Suburban and pulled off the road. He got out and drew his sword before approaching the back door. If the child came springing toward him, fangs bared, he was going to be ready for it.</p><p>Logan found more blood on the second floor. He crouched next to the spot. It was fresh, only a few drops, but enough to know it was from a heavily blooded human male. And he\u2019d shed it tonight.</p><p>Hope let out a breath laced with fear. \u201cIs that . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time to get you out of here,\u201d said Logan. \u201cI\u2019ll continue my search and find you when I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know where I live.\u201d</p><p>He stood and looked in her eyes. The need to reach out and stroke her cheek slammed into him, blindsiding him. He fisted his hands in the pockets of his coat to keep from touching her. \u201cI have your blood inside me. I\u2019ll be able to find you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you have any idea how stalkerish that sounds?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGo home.

In case you run into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will gladly take your number, but there are others I can call for help if necessary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBig, strong men with lots of guns?\u201d she asked, forcing a smile.</p><p>Logan\u2019s hand was on her face before he\u2019d realized how foolish his touch of reassurance was. Her skin was warm and soft under his fingers. The planes of her smooth cheek were basked in shadow, casting an air of mystery around her. She leaned into his touch just the slightest bit, but he sensed the subtle movement. Reveled in it.</p><p>He heard her pulse speed and felt her skin warm. She looked up at him, her amber eyes shining with trust and something else. Something hot and womanly.</p><p>There was desire in that look, and while Logan was used to such things, he wasn\u2019t used to feeling a physical response to them.</p><p>His own pulse sped and he felt a wave of heat sweep down his body, settling in his groin. The untimely swelling of his manhood made him wish for things he could not have\u2014made him wish for the man he had been once upon a time, before the blood of the ancients had dwindled from this world.</p> <p>No longer. Duty had to come before pleasure. If he failed in that, others would die. Perhaps even the woman standing before him.</p><p>She covered his hand with hers, holding it in place against her cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing to me. But I\u2019m starting to like it.\u201d</p><p>Logan refused to touch that comment. He couldn\u2019t think about giving her pleasure. If he did, his thoughts would stray beyond duty to a place much more enticing.</p><p>He pulled his hand away and took her elbow in a firm grip, guiding her to the stairwell exit. \u201cYou must go now. I have colleagues on the way. If you don\u2019t hear from me before sunrise, I\u2019ll seek you out tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait up for you,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how late it gets.\u201d</p><p>Regret burned in his chest. \u201cI cannot come to you in daylight. I\u2019ll send another to protect you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe rarely get what we want in this life. I suggest you become accustomed to it.\u201d</p><p>They exited the stairwell and walked toward the hole in the overhead door. \u201cBelieve me. I already am.\u201d</p><p>Rather than stop and interrogate her about her intriguing answer, Logan escorted her outside to his van. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you home, then come back here and investigate the blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He unlocked the doors and opened hers. \u201cI\u2019ll follow the trail and see where it leads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat trail? I only saw a few drops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a scent trail.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgain with your sense of smell. That\u2019s not normal, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. But it is useful.\u201d He shut her door and went around to his side. The van\u2019s engine started smoothly. He turned to ask her how to get to her home and saw her staring in the back of his van.</p><p>There was a narrow mattress back there. All the windows were blacked out.</p><p>\u201cAre you some kind of pervert?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHardly. But sometimes I\u2019m forced to sleep here.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed a little and toyed with the blackout curtain, which currently hung open. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but I travel frequently.\u201d</p><p>The night was running out and he still had a lot of work to do. \u201cWhich way?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNorth two blocks. Take a right. The studio is three blocks down on the right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStudio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA photography studio where I work. I live upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Logan drove her there and pulled up in front of the studio. \u201cStay inside around as many people as possible. I\u2019ll contact you as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Hope hopped out of the van. \u201cDon\u2019t make me wait, Logan. I\u2019m not a patient woman.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be swift.\u201d</p><p>Hope hurried up the stairs and disappeared into the building. Logan sat there for a long moment, feeling the cold sink into him more with every step she took.</p><p>It was all in his head. It had to be. He was simply worried over losing sight of such a precious source of power. There was no other explanation\u2014at least none he\u2019d allow himself.</p><p>Before he could dwell on that too long, he put his van in gear and headed back for the building where the blood trail began.</p><p>It was time to go blood hunting.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Jackie Patton refused to hide in her room. She\u2019d spent the last two years as a prisoner in a cave. That was as much of her life as she was willing to allow the Synestryn to steal from her. It was time to move on. To what, she wasn\u2019t sure, but whatever it was, it wouldn\u2019t be in this room the Sentinels had provided for her.</p><p>She was still weak from her ordeal, but getting stronger every day. Food was settling better in her stomach, and now that she\u2019d cut the matted tangles from her hair and put on real clothes rather than tattered rags, she felt almost human.</p><p>Funny how ironic that was, all things considered.</p><p>Jackie opened her door to find Helen standing there, her fist poised to knock. \u201cI was just coming to see you.\u201d</p><p>Jackie looked at the other woman, studying her, looking for the family resemblance in the woman who was apparently her half sister.</p><p>Helen\u2019s brown hair was braided, with each of her twin braids falling forward over her shoulders. Her face was sweetly rounded, which seemed at odds with the power the woman wielded.</p><p>Jackie had seen firsthand what that woman could do with magical fire.</p><p>\u201cI was just going down to the dining hall for some food,\u201d said Jackie.</p><p>\u201cMind if I join you?\u201d</p><p>Jackie did, but manners won out. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>They walked down the winding halls. Jackie had already gotten lost a couple of times before she learned the numbering system that helped her navigate. The numbers got smaller the closer she was to the public areas.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d asked Helen.</p><p>\u201cBetter. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ve all been very solicitous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke with Tynan about you. He said he thought you were well enough to discuss your plans.\u201d</p><p>Jackie didn\u2019t much like the idea that the vampirehealer, or Sanguinar as they called him, had spoken about her condition with others. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose HIPPA means anything to you people, does it?\u201d</p><p>Helen had the decency to blush. \u201cI promise I didn\u2019t ask for details. I just needed to know if you were well enough to start thinking about your future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should ask me. Not some blood-drinking monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTynan isn\u2019t a monster.\u201d</p><p>Jackie held her tongue. Anyone who lived on the blood of another was a monster. Period. It didn\u2019t matter if he used that blood to save lives or not. \u201cI\u2019d prefer we don\u2019t discuss him over food. I\u2019d rather be able to eat.\u201d</p><p>Helen\u2019s mouth flattened, but she nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Jackie truly doubted that. \u201cWhat exactly is it you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Theronai. You may be able to save the life of one of our men and yet you\u2019ve avoided all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly good company right now.\u201d</p><p>Helen pulled Jackie to a halt. There was no one in the hallway, giving them privacy. It served only to make Jackie that much more nervous.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready for this kind of pressure. She was barely able to keep from screaming in anger and grief every time she opened her mouth.</p><p>Jackie knew Helen was trying to help, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that it made Jackie feel used and dirty. She\u2019d had enough of that for one lifetime.</p><p>\u201cI can only imagine what you\u2019re going through. You were held captive, starved, fed on.\u201d</p><p>Jackie cringed, pulling away from Helen and her words. As bad as those memories were, they paled in comparison to the suffering she\u2019d been forced to witness. There had been children in those caves with her. The things they\u2019d endured had been much worse than Jackie\u2019s torture. No matter how hard she\u2019d tried, she hadn\u2019t been able to save them all. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to. All I\u2019m asking is that you stop hiding from the men. While you may be able to save one of their lives, what I really hope is that one of them might be able to save yours in return.\u201d</p><p>No. Jackie had seen the way Drake looked at Helen. The way Paul looked at Andra. And she couldn\u2019t even stand to see the way Madoc looked at Nika. It was too much. Too full of need. Jackie had been looked at like that for two years. She\u2019d seen bloodlust glowing in the eyes of beasts too hideous to be considered men.</p><p>She never again wanted to be used. Ever. And any man who tried to do so was going to wish he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Her hands balled into fists and she had to unclench her jaw so she could speak. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to do this. I simply can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you can. I think you\u2019re stronger than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever strength I had I used up over the last two years, keeping those children alive. It\u2019s all gone now. Your leader promised me a safe place to rest and recover. If there are strings attached, I\u2019ll go someplace else.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure where. Her house had likely been sold. Her job was certainly filled by now. The manufacturing facility couldn\u2019t have stayed open without a manager, and there was an endless list of people eager to take her place.</p><p>She had nowhere to go, but she\u2019d leave all the same if these people wanted to use her.</p><p>\u201cNo strings,\u201d Helen hurried to say. \u201cI swear. I only meant to let you know that joining with one of the men may be as much of a help to you as it is to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen. Please don\u2019t ask me again.\u201d</p><p>Helen nodded, sadness plain on her pretty face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I upset you. We won\u2019t talk about it again. Let\u2019s just go share a meal and get to know one another.\u201d</p><p>Jackie couldn\u2019t do that. She couldn\u2019t face the dining hall knowing those men would be there, staring at her, wishing for something she could never give. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind. I\u2019m going back to my room now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go with you. We\u2019ll order some food to be brought up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019d rather be alone.\u201d</p><p>At least that way no one would ask the impossible of her. It might make her a coward to hide in her room like that. It might even make her a virtual prisoner. It didn\u2019t matter. She could not be what these people wanted her to be. And if she didn\u2019t get out of here soon, what was left of her humanity might soon vanish.</p><p>Logan followed the scent trail into the basement of the run-down furniture factory. Water had seeped in down here, leaving behind the musty smell of mildew. Beneath that was the unmistakable smell of wet animal hide, cloying sweetness, and malevolence. Synestryn.</p><p>Logan cloaked himself with his power, hoping to avoid any unnecessary combat. He was strong enough now to fend for himself, but he didn\u2019t want to squander his power in that way. It was better to save battle for the Theronai, or even the Slayers. He was more valuable in other ways. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He checked his watch. There was still an hour before backup arrived. He worried that by then the trail would grow cold, or lead him to another location. He needed to gather intelligence so that when the Theronai did arrive, he could put them to good use.</p><p>Assuming the man he hunted was still alive.</p><p>The basement wasn\u2019t open like the floors above. It was sectioned off into what had once been storage rooms or offices. A long hallway led down the center of the level with a dozen doors on either side.</p><p>He followed the hall to where the scent of blood was strongest. There were a few more drops of blood on the floor here. From beneath the door, he scented much, much more.</p> <p>A muffled cry of pain sounded on the far side of the wood. The man was still alive.</p><p>Logan twisted the knob, strengthening his shield to prevent anything from seeing his presence. A rush of power slid from him, and he mourned the loss of it. That was power he could have shared with his brothers.</p><p>But only if he made it out of this alive.</p><p>He stepped inside, forcing his eyes to adjust to the inky blackness of the room. The first thing he saw was the faint glow of the man\u2019s body heat. As he fueled his vision further, he saw half a dozen demons surrounding the man\u2019s body. They licked the blood seeping from his wounds.</p><p>The man remained still, as if immobilized. \u201cIs someone there?\u201d he asked, his voice faint and weak, almost garbled.</p> <p>Logan stayed silent.</p><p>One of the Synestryn lifted its head, which swiveled back over its narrow body. It was the size of a large cat with a long snout. It had no ears, only gaping holes at the sides of its head. The front legs were shorter than the back ones, and all of them were tipped with gleaming, sharp claws. Bright green eyes peered out at Logan, but they did not flare with recognition of his presence.</p><p>Logan\u2019s mask had held.</p><p>A wide, flat tongue swept over its bloody muzzle before it returned to its meal.</p><p>The man moaned, the sound one of hopeless despair. He knew he was dying. So did Logan.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let it happen. This man was blooded. He was too valuable to waste his blood on such creatures.</p> <p>Warrior or not, Logan had to save this man\u2019s life. For all he knew, he might be Hope\u2019s perfect mate.</p><p>Logan slid his dagger from his coat. He approached silently, keeping his shields up until the last possible second. He slashed across the neck of one demon. Black blood spurted out of the wound. It hissed and flailed, raking blindly at him.</p><p>He fell back out of its reach. His shielding faltered and he didn\u2019t have time to get it back up.</p><p>He grabbed the demon\u2019s thin body and hurled it across the room. A few flecks of its blood landed across the back of his hand, burning his skin. He bit off a cry of pain and shoved a burst of power toward the wound to heal it.</p><p>The other demons sensed an easy meal and bounded after their wounded pack mate, leaving the man\u2019s side.</p><p>Logan had little time before the distraction no longer held their attention. He bent down, tossed the man over his shoulder, and headed for the door.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t quite reached the hallway when sharp, stabbing pain radiated across his back. It took him a moment to realize that at least one of the things had attacked him, slashing at him with claws.</p><p>He shifted the man\u2019s weight, pulling him forward to protect him from attack. Cradling the man in his arms made his weight more awkward, and Logan stumbled.</p> <p>A wobbling weakness slid up his legs, and his body reacted before his mind could. Instantly, his blood went to work manufacturing an antidote for the paralytic. He felt a wave of power flow over him, weakening as it passed.</p><p>Hope\u2019s power.</p><p>He was using up the strength she\u2019d given him much faster than he\u2019d hoped. And now it seemed that he was going to have to use even more of it to get out of this alive.</p><p>The idea of never seeing her again tore at him, making an anger he\u2019d rarely felt before rise up and bellow in outrage.</p><p>Logan stumbled out the door, turning his body to ward off any more attacks from behind. One of the beasts still clung to his back, so he slammed his weight into the wall, crushing it.</p><p>A hiss of pain rang in his ears as the demon fell and lay twitching on its side. He kicked it away and lifted his eyes in time to see another two charging.</p><p>Logan used a flash of power to slam the door shut. An instant later, the creatures thudded into it and began to claw at the wood.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait to see if they made it out. Already his body was weakening, dragging down the hall as his blood struggled to cure the growing paralysis.</p><p>He\u2019d made it to the stairway and looked up at what seemed like an insurmountable task. Each jagged step looked like a mountain he had to scale. With every beat of his heart, his strength faded. The weight of the man in his arms bore down on him, crushing the air from his lungs.</p><p>Logan shoved more of his dwindling power reserves into creating the antidote, hoping to speed the process. He could feel the cells within his body jumping to obey, squeezing out tiny droplets.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>The scratching at the end of the hall grew in intensity. Logan leaned against a wall to hold himself up.</p><p>It didn\u2019t work. His legs went rubbery beneath him and he slid to the floor, panting and sweating.</p><p>A moment later, one of the doors midway down the hall slid open. Out from it stepped a creature like those trying to claw their way through the door. Only this one was much larger, filling the hallway as it rose up on hind legs.</p><p>Apparently, the demons he\u2019d fought had been offspring. And this one was a fully grown adult.</p><p>Its elongated muzzle opened, letting out a feral hiss. Then it charged.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Something was wrong. Hope could feel it in her blood.</p><p>Her insides itched. She couldn\u2019t sit still. All of that she could have brushed off as her nerves\u2014her worry for Logan\u2014but there was one thing she couldn\u2019t ignore. That glowing-sunshine type of warmth she\u2019d felt since meeting Logan was starting to fade. Without it, she felt cold and strangely lonely.</p><p>He was in trouble. She was certain of it.</p><p>She dialed his cell phone. He didn\u2019t answer. His cultured voice came over the line, asking her to leave a message.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you get this. I\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>Hope hung up, feeling no better. That pervasive itching deepened until she was curled around herself, panting and sweating.</p><p>Screw this. She wasn\u2019t going to sit here, waiting for a call, when he might be out there, dying. She didn\u2019t understand this connection they had, and she sure as heck didn\u2019t like it. But that didn\u2019t change the fact that she had to do something.</p><p>The only thing she could think to do was to go back and check on him.</p><p>Sister Olive didn\u2019t allow guns in the shelter where Hope had grown up. She had never even considered getting a gun, but was cursing that decision now. She didn\u2019t know who or what she was going to face once she found Logan, but she doubted they would respond to reason and a nice, civil discussion.</p><p>She did, however, have a baseball bat tucked under her bed, just in case. She was definitely taking that with her.</p><p>Hope went out the back exit and cut through alleys, running as fast as she dared over the slippery pavement. Cold wind whipped her hair around her face, sucking the air from her lungs.</p><p>Even with the shortcut, it seemed to take forever for her to get to the defunct furniture factory. Every step she took seemed to ease some of that restless itching.</p><p>Without even pausing to get through the creeps this place gave her, she hurried through the busted door, following her instincts and the last bit of fading warmth she knew came from Logan. They led her to the basement entrance.</p><p>Hope had never been down there before. The door loomed over her, daring her to open it.</p><p>She clenched the bat in one hand and reached out for the handle with the other. Her hand shook, and oddly, she just now realized she\u2019d forgotten her gloves.</p><p>A rough sound of pain echoed behind the door. There was a harsh breath of air and a low, snakelike hiss.</p><p>The pained sound came again, giving Hope the courage to do the right thing.</p><p>She turned the knob and pulled the door toward her. She braced it open with her foot and took a solid grip on the bat.</p><p>It was pitch-black inside. Not even the lights she\u2019d flipped on as she came in reached this far into the corner. She leaned in and felt blindly for a light switch.</p><p>She heard a scuffling sound and a shocked breath. It came from below her\u2014several feet below.</p><p>Her heart pounded fast, vibrating in her chest with fear. Her breathing was so rapid, a steady stream of silvery mist bloomed in front of her, blocking her vision even more.</p><p>She took a step inside, reaching, feeling for a switch with her hand and the top step with her foot.</p><p>The door shut behind her, shoving her forward as it latched. It banged against the bat, and the hollow racket echoed in the darkness stretching before her.</p><p>She thought she heard her name, but couldn\u2019t tell over the frantic pounding of her heart.</p><p>Finally, she found a switch and shoved it up with clumsy, cold fingers.</p><p>Light flared to life in the hallway below. An enraged bellow of pain blasted up the stairwell. Crumpled at the bottom of the cement stairs was Logan. Halfway up the flight was another man. Logan turned his head slowly, and looked up at her, fear shining in his eyes. His mouth moved, but no sound came out. His aura was dim, tinted red with pain.</p><p>A shadow fell over him. A heartbeat later, a paw came into view. It was black, tipped with shiny black claws. Its aura was the black nothingness that haunted her nightmares.</p><p>Hope didn\u2019t need to see the rest of it to know it was bad. Really bad.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Logan shouted, but the word came out as more of a breath than a yell.</p><p>The other man with him\u2014the one lying unmoving and bleeding\u2014stared up at her with pleading eyes. The faint aura hovering around him was threaded with tentacles of that black nothingness, as if it had somehow infected him. He looked broken, paralyzed. She couldn\u2019t leave him lying there. She had to at least try to help them.</p><p>A vibrant humming exploded inside her skull. Pressure pulsed inside her as something tried to break its way free.</p><p>Memories. She was teetering on the edge of seeing something from her past, but didn\u2019t dare take the time to examine it. If she did, none of them would live long enough to celebrate.</p><p>She shoved the memory back, screaming inside to let out some of the frustrating disappointment she suffered. For all she knew, that memory would never again bubble to the surface, leaving it lost forever.</p><p>As soon as the pressure passed, her body disconnected from her mind, acting on its own. She moved down the stairs as if dreaming, gliding in a smooth, fluid way she\u2019d never felt before.</p><p>An odd buzzing tingled through her limbs. Her muscles rippled, tightening as the shuddering feeling passed through her body. She had no idea what had caused it or what it had done to her, but right now, she simply didn\u2019t care. Her focus was on getting all three of them out of here alive.</p><p>She saw the creature hunched below, cringing from the light she\u2019d turned on. She felt an inky fear hover around her, not quite penetrating. The demon was huge. Frightening. It could kill her with one well-placed swipe of its paw and still she wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><p>At least not yet.</p><p>She grabbed the back of the man\u2019s shirt and hauled him up the flight of stairs before she\u2019d even thought about how it should have been impossible for her to move that much weight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The adrenaline. That had to be what was making her stronger, helping her compartmentalize.</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop to think, simply dropped the man on the first floor and went back downstairs where Logan was. She had to go down farther, which allowed her to view more of the demon. She\u2019d been gone only a few seconds, but in that time, the demon had knocked out the bulb over its head and was covering its eyes with one paw while blindly swinging for the next light\u2014the one over Logan.</p><p>Hope grabbed Logan\u2019s leather coat and began hauling him up the stairs, too. He was heavier than the last man\u2014much heavier than he should have been, given his lean build. He thudded along, his body jerking with every stair, but she was able to keep only his head from hitting. Nothing else. He\u2019d have to deal with the bruises left behind if they made it out of this alive.</p><p>\u201cLeave me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m nearly recovered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she snorted out. \u201cYou look like it. Shut up and think light thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s coming,\u201d he warned her. \u201cDrop me and run. Save the human.\u201d</p><p>Hope spared a quick glance over her shoulder and saw the demon had managed to knock out another light. It oozed forward up the stairs, moving methodically, catching up with them more by the second.</p><p>Hope pulled harder, dropping the bat for more leverage. It clattered as it fell, bouncing off the steps until it hit the demon.</p><p>The monster swiped at the bat, slicing it in half with its claws. Two large pieces as well as three smaller ones flew out, slamming into the walls so hard they splintered.</p> <p>Hope did not want to be on the receiving end of that kind of power.</p><p>They had only a few steps to go. Then she\u2019d find a way to bar the door and keep that thing below.</p><p>Logan\u2019s hands began to move and he started pushing himself up, helping her. They moved faster, but it wasn\u2019t fast enough.</p><p>The demon slinked up the steps, catlike in its grace. It opened its jaws wide, showing off tiny, serrated teeth. Primal fear exploded inside her chest, shoving the breath from her lungs.</p><p>She reached behind her, one hand feeling for the door handle. She found it and pulled, wrenching her shoulder in the process. Logan reached for the door, shoving it open, trying to help her as much as he could.</p><p>Hope had just stepped across the threshold when the monster sprang up at them. It leapt forward, closing the distance. It dug its long claws deep into Logan\u2019s legs. He bellowed in pain.</p> <p>The demon pulled. Logan\u2019s coat ripped out of her hands and he slid down the stairs, snatched away by the demon.</p><p>Hope lunged for him, but the thing was too fast. He was gone\u2014dragged into the blackness the monster had created below.</p><p>Jackie knocked on Joseph Rayd\u2019s office door. He was the leader of these people, and if she wanted something, it was best to go straight to him and forgo all the middlemen.</p><p>He looked up from whatever he was working on, his hazel eyes meeting hers. His spine straightened, but his shoulders were still bowed as if he carried some great burden.</p><p>\u201cPlease come in,\u201d he said as he rose from his desk. He was a big man and with every step he took closer to her, she wanted to shrink away.</p><p>Jackie held up her hand to stop his advance. \u201cNo need to get up. I was hoping I could speak to you for a moment.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, motioning to a chair across from his desk. \u201cSure. Have a seat.\u201d</p><p>It had been a long time since Jackie had been in such a civilized setting, though she was used to being on the other side of the desk. This side seemed odd and alien, putting her in a position of servitude somehow.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t like it. She wanted her old life back\u2014the one full of boardroom meetings and schedules and making things happen.</p><p>Sadly, that life was over. She knew better than to believe otherwise.</p><p>Jackie sat perched on the edge of the chair. If he made a sudden move to touch her as so many of the men here had, she could bolt and avoid him. \u201cI want to leave.\u201d</p><p>Joseph frowned. \u201cLeave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place. These people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave Dabyr? But you just got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s become apparent that my presence here is causing problems. These men of yours are looking to me as some kind of savior. I can\u2019t handle the pressure. Not so soon after . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t bring herself to verbalize even one of the things she\u2019d endured.</p><p>He leaned forward, bracing his elbows on the desk. Silvery strands of hair gleamed at his temples. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them to back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple and you know it.\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cEven you look at me with hope in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think that would be a good thing. Not everyone has the power to give people hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I offer is false. I\u2019ve seen the unions between your people\u2014what you think I\u2019ll be a part of one day. I\u2019m telling you now that it can never happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019m a grown woman. I know my own limits, and after . . . everything, I know that I\u2019ll never again be able to tolerate the touch of a man. Especially one who isn\u2019t human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019ve suffered is horrible. But you\u2019re strong. You may not be able to see how you can come through it, but I know you can.\u201d He stood and moved around the desk. Jackie gritted her teeth and held her ground. \u201cI also know that if you trust us enough to stay and find a compatible Theronai, he could help you through this. Help you heal.\u201d</p><p>Joseph was too close. She slid in her chair, pressing up against the far edge so hard she knew it would leave a bruise. \u201cI need to leave. I need to go somewhere where the expectations are not so high. And I need to work. Be useful. Find some reason to get up in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Joseph let out a sigh and nodded. \u201cThe Synestryn will want you back. I can\u2019t let them have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t know where I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be drawn to you.\u201d</p><p>That thought made her blood thicken in her veins. She could feel their taint inside her, dirtying her soul. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying I\u2019m a prisoner here as I was in those caves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m saying that if you leave, you can\u2019t do it alone. You\u2019ll have an armed escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a job? I don\u2019t see that working out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would with the right job.\u201d He said it like he already had something in mind.</p><p>\u201cAnd what job would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know why you were taken. The Synestryn are trying to breed more human-looking demons so they can more easily mingle among people. I\u2019m certain there are other women like you out there\u2014women who were taken and need to be saved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the women you have to worry about,\u201d said Jackie before she thought better. \u201cIt\u2019s the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was used for my blood. I was food. Fuel. The children were not so lucky. They were altered. Fed the blood of the monsters so they changed.\u201d</p><p>Joseph nodded. \u201cLike Tori. They took her as a child so that she could grow up and give them children.\u201d</p><p>Jackie swallowed hard, struggling not to throw up on his carpet. She\u2019d seen what happened to those kids. She\u2019d heard their screams.</p><p>\u201cYou were a prisoner a long time,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cYou might have heard or seen things that can lead us to others. I was going to ask you to lead a team, but I didn\u2019t want to push you before you\u2019d had time to recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m recovered.\u201d At least as much as she was going to.</p><p>\u201cTynan will have to clear you for field work, but if he does, you can get out of here and have a job all at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Just the idea of it made her feel like she could breathe again. She knew she couldn\u2019t go into those caves again, but they\u2019d moved her a couple of times. She might see something that would help find the location of the other caves. \u201cWho would you send with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be your choice. At least in part. If you\u2019re more comfortable with bonded Theronai, I understand, but you have to have some strong sword arms with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Helen. Not Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re your sisters. I would have thought they\u2019d be your first choice.\u201d</p><p>Jackie shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s too much pressure. We may be related by blood, but I don\u2019t know those women. I don\u2019t want to pretend that I do. Or that I want to.\u201d</p><p>Joseph stared at her for a long time. Even though she guessed he was trying not to, he looked at her with hopeful expectation lighting his eyes. \u201cHow about Paul and Andra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo pack what you need,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cYou\u2019ll leave tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jackie stood up to leave but Joseph\u2019s voice stopped her. \u201cI\u2019d like to know if it\u2019s true,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf what\u2019s true?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors that every Theronai you\u2019ve met has felt something. That their lucerias have reacted. They\u2019re saying you\u2019re compatible with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s true, I need to be prepared for the fallout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat fallout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings could get ugly. My men could turn on one another, fighting over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them can have me, so why should they bother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogic won\u2019t play much of a role if it\u2019s true,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d indulge me so I\u2019m at least armed with the truth.\u201d He held out his hand. It was wide and square with shiny callused patches.</p><p>Jackie looked at his hand, then back to his face. He wore no expression. No hope, no excitement. He didn\u2019t move toward her or show any signs of impatience.</p><p>It was his stoicism that gave her the courage to step forward. She closed her eyes and pretended she was in a boardroom, meeting customers. She grabbed his hand and gave it a quick shake.</p><p>Jackie felt nothing but heat, strength, and the fine trembling of her own hand. But when she opened her eyes and looked at him, he\u2019d gone white with shock. His hazel eyes were wide and he stared at the ring on his left hand, watching colors swirl within the band.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for him to speak. She didn\u2019t want to hear what he had to say. She turned and ran down the hall, getting away as fast as she could.</p><p>The rumors were right. She was some kind of freak.</p><p>Logan was consumed by pain. His legs burned with it as the demon\u2019s claws sank deep into his bones. The antidote his blood had created to combat the paralytic was working, but not nearly fast enough to save his life.</p><p>At least Hope had gotten out safely. Logan took solace in that.</p><p>As the Synestryn dragged him down the hall to its den, Logan forced the antidote to his arms, giving him the strength to pull his dagger. It wasn\u2019t going to do much good, but he refused to let this creature kill him without a fight.</p><p>He sat up enough to reach down and slam the blade into one of the demon\u2019s paws. The tip went through the soft tissue and into Logan\u2019s leg.</p><p>He gritted his teeth against a scream of pain and lifted the blade to strike again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The demon jerked back its paw, licking at the black blood dripping from the wound. A menacing growl rose from the beast, promising retribution.</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t wait to see what it had in mind. He lifted his blade and struck again, swiping at the closest paw, praying he\u2019d hit a tendon.</p><p>The demon was too fast. It snatched back its paw and batted at Logan before he could strike. The dagger flew from his numbed hand, ringing against the concrete floor several feet away.</p><p>Logan\u2019s legs still hadn\u2019t started to work yet, so he called on some of his dwindling power to draw the weapon back to him.</p> <p>It vibrated on the floor and slid only a few inches before it stopped.</p><p>Hunger roared inside Logan. The power in the blood he\u2019d taken from Hope was gone. He was out of energy. And time.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Hope scrambled to find her cell phone. Logan had said the police couldn\u2019t help, but at this point, she didn\u2019t think they could hurt, either.</p><p>Her cell phone was gone. It must have fallen out during her run or while she was dragging people around.</p> <p>Frustrated panic gripped her as she looked around, making a futile search of the area.</p><p>The man she\u2019d rescued still hadn\u2019t spoken or moved. He watched her with wide eyes the color of golf course grass. He had short, sandy blond hair and wore ripped-out jeans and a concert T-shirt.</p><p>He might have a cell phone.</p><p>Hope rushed to his side and started searching his pockets. Her voice was an octave higher than normal. \u201cI\u2019m going to call for help and get you out of here. Just hang on, okay?\u201d</p><p>Her hands shook as she slid them over his body, searching for the hard edges of a cell phone. She found a small one lodged in his front pocket and dug in his jeans for it. \u201cSorry to be so forward. I don\u2019t normally fondle strange men.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing in return. Not that she\u2019d expected him to.</p> <p>She grabbed the small phone and pulled it out, only to discover that it wasn\u2019t a phone at all. It was a lighter inside a rumpled, mostly empty pack of cigarettes.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave him down there alone,\u201d she told the stranger. \u201cI can\u2019t stand by and let him die. I have to do something.\u201d</p><p>But what? She was no superhero. She couldn\u2019t handle something like that monster, alone and unarmed.</p><p>She needed help and she needed it now. Sadly, there wasn\u2019t a pay phone for blocks and she didn\u2019t dare leave this paralyzed man alone, either.</p><p>Maybe her phone was on the stairs. If she could get it and call for help, then it might save both men\u2019s lives.</p><p>The creature had dragged Logan away. It was safe to go down there. She was sure it was.</p><p>Hope swallowed down an acidic bubble of fear and walked to the door. She heard nothing on the far side. Of course, her heart was hammering so hard it probably masked plenty of noise.</p> <p>With a prayer for courage, she cracked the door open and peeked inside. Nothing sprang at her. No demons lurked within sight.</p><p>The stairs marched down into blackness, mocking her ability to do the same. The demon had destroyed the lightbulbs, making it impossible for her to see past the sixth step.</p><p>She\u2019d rushed out without her satchel. Which meant she\u2019d also left behind her flashlight. What she wouldn\u2019t have given to have that light now.</p><p>Or a torch.</p><p>Right. She had fire. She could make a torch. Couldn\u2019t she?</p><p>It was worth a shot.</p><p>Hope sprinted over the dusty floor to the toppled stack of pallets. She braced her foot against it and pulled on one of the boards. The nail screamed as it was wrenched out of place, but she was able to get it free.</p><p>She grabbed a wad of discarded newspaper she found on the floor and crumpled it into a tight ball. She stabbed the ball onto the bent nail and went back to the stranger\u2019s side where she\u2019d left the lighter.</p><p>It took a moment for her to fumble it free of the cigarette package, and even longer for her to get her fingers to work the thing. The tiny flare of light made her rejoice.</p><p>The flame wobbled as she set the newspaper on fire. She angled it so the dry wood would catch fire, holding her breath the whole time.</p><p>A few seconds later, the pallet board caught flame and victory surged inside Hope.</p><p>She was going after her phone, and if she didn\u2019t find that, she was going after Logan.</p><p>Iain readied himself for the infant to attack. He flung the back door open, sword poised to strike.</p><p>Nothing happened. He saw no movement, heard no warning hiss coming from inside the vehicle.</p><p>The woman lay still. The blanket covering her was soaked with blood. Her face was lax, her eyes staring unfocused and fixed in death. She\u2019d bled out. He\u2019d failed to get her help in time to save her life.</p><p>There had been a time not so long ago that Iain\u2019s failure would have bothered him. But no longer. The life of one human woman apparently wasn\u2019t enough to stir his dead soul.</p><p>Not that he cared. He\u2019d long since stopped caring. His entire focus now was on playing the part of a healthy Theronai long enough to give his brothers hope\u2014to help them cling to life long enough to find their mates.</p><p>He could remember a time when his desire to help had burned fierce and bright inside his chest. It no longer did, and his actions were more from habit than anything else. Still, those habits ran deep, giving him a reason to pull in his next breath.</p><p>Atop the woman\u2019s chest, the blanket shifted as something beneath it stirred.</p><p>The child. It let out a faint cry of distress.</p><p>Iain used the tip of his sword to move the blanket, pulling it down, uncovering the child.</p><p>It didn\u2019t lunge for him. In fact, it flailed around, its tiny arms and legs jerking in the air. It had four limbs. No tentacles. It didn\u2019t even have teeth, much less fangs.</p><p>It looked like a normal human baby.</p><p>A flicker of relief fluttered deep inside Iain, so faint it barely registered. He wasn\u2019t going to have to kill it.</p><p>Him. The baby was a boy, not an it.</p><p>Iain sheathed his sword and gathered the squalling infant. He was tiny. Iain\u2019s hands swallowed him up.</p><p>The child screamed louder, his cries vibrating with demand to fix what was wrong.</p><p>He was probably cold.</p><p>The blanket was too wet and bloody, so Iain tucked the naked baby inside his shirt, warming him against his chest. He zipped up his jacket to keep the wind out.</p><p>Something warm and wet slid down Iain\u2019s stomach.</p><p>The child had peed on him. Of course.</p><p>Iain covered the dead woman with the blanket and got behind the wheel. He needed to get the baby back to Dabyr where someone could care for it. Unfortunately, that trip was going to take several hours and he doubted the child would hold its bodily functions for that long.</p><p>Time to find some diapers.</p><p>He pulled back onto the road, holding the baby in place with one hand while he drove. After a few minutes, the child\u2019s cries quieted, then stopped completely. He could feel the warm brush of air against his skin as the baby breathed, telling him he was fine.</p><p>Not that Iain was worried. Death was probably the best thing that could happen to the boy. His mother was gone. His father was likely dead. The Synestryn would have had no reason to keep a man alive. They would have drained his blood and eaten him.</p><p>This child\u2019s life would no doubt be filled with pain and suffering. It would be a kindness to simply let him die. If it weren\u2019t for Iain\u2019s vow to protect humans, he probably would have.</p><p>The vow stayed his hand, removing the choice from his conscience. Whatever hardships the boy would face were his to bear. He\u2019d have to suck it up and deal like the rest of the world.</p><p>Iain found an all-night convenience store and pulled into the parking lot. He parked away from the entrance, as far away from lights as he could. Anyone who glanced in his ride would see the bloody blanket covering the woman\u2019s body. He really didn\u2019t want any trouble with the police.</p><p>As soon as he shifted, the child let out a disgruntled breath at being disturbed. He patted the lump under his coat and hurried into the store.</p><p>He found diapers and bought the smallest ones they had. He also grabbed some wet wipes, a can of formula, a plastic bottle sporting yellow ducks, and some bottled water. The boy was going to have to eat sometime, though hopefully not before he got back home.</p><p>The clerk behind the counter was a man in his early twenties with as many piercings as pimples. He grinned at Iain\u2019s purchases. \u201cDaddy duty, huh?\u201d</p><p>Iain ignored the kid and pulled out his wallet.</p><p>The baby squirmed and let out a shrill scream.</p><p>The kid\u2019s grin faded. \u201cYou got a baby under there?\u201d</p><p>Iain laid more than enough money on the counter, grabbed his sack, and left. As he got back in his car, he could see the clerk on the phone, talking fast.</p><p>Shit. He was probably calling the police, telling them all about the big, scary man with the stolen baby under his coat.</p><p>A venomous anger streaked through Iain\u2019s blood. The baby screamed and he realized he\u2019d tightened his hold and had to ease up.</p><p>If he hit the highway now, every cop in the area would find him, the baby, and the dead woman. He needed to stick to the back roads and hide for a while\u2014maybe switch vehicles.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t drive, dial his phone, and hold the baby all at the same time, so he sped out of the parking lot and headed for the closest Gerai house. They were scattered all over this part of the country, and there were two less than an hour away. He picked the one closest to Dabyr and raced for it as fast as he dared.</p><p>The demon crouched over Logan\u2019s legs, feeding from the blood that seeped from his wounds. His body was fighting the paralysis, but not fast enough. He couldn\u2019t feel his legs anymore, though perhaps the demon\u2019s saliva contained yet another toxin he couldn\u2019t combat.</p><p>Logan scoured his mind for options, but the churning hunger inside him was distracting.</p><p>Being a meal for a Synestryn was even more distracting.</p><p>He closed his eyes, gathering up what little bit of power remained. He wasn\u2019t yet sure what to do with it\u2014there wasn\u2019t enough for a powerful assault\u2014but he\u2019d think of something.</p><p>Light seeped through his closed eyelids. The beast at his legs hissed in annoyance.</p><p>Logan looked up to see what it was. Standing a few feet down the hall was Hope, holding a burning board aloft. Her hair seemed to glow in response to the firelight, and her eyes burned a bright, determined gold. Fear tightened her mouth and widened her eyes. Her chest rose and fell with her rapid breathing.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen anything more beautiful in his long, long life.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here!\u201d he ordered, using a bit of his remaining power to spike the command with a compulsion for her to obey.</p><p>He must have been weaker than he thought, because she didn\u2019t even pause long enough to blink before striding forward, flame first.</p><p>\u201cHow do I kill it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t. You run. Now.\u201d A little more power left him as he struggled to force her obedience.</p><p>\u201cAnd leave you here for it to snack on. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She stabbed the torch forward and the demon flinched back. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t like light. I know that much.\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward. The demon batted at the torch, missing. Its eyes streamed with tears.</p><p>\u201cGive me the torch,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll kill it while you run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even stand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>Hope took another step forward, jabbing the fire near the demon. It inched back, hissing in frustration and rage.</p><p>\u201cCan you hold the torch?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>She handed it to him. The wood was rough in his palm. He kept his grip tight, not wanting to lose their only real weapon.</p><p>\u201cKeep it back. I\u2019m dragging you out of here.\u201d</p><p>Before he could argue, she grabbed the collar of his coat and began pulling him back faster than he would have thought possible for a woman her size.</p><p>She was strong. Inhumanly so.</p><p>The importance of that would have to be examined later. For now, he had to pour all his concentration into holding the demon back with nothing more than a chunk of burning wood and steadily weakening arms.</p> <p>As they moved down the hall, the Synestryn followed them, keeping out of reach of the firelight. Occasionally, it would bend its head and lap up a spot of blood on the floor left behind from Logan\u2019s wounds.</p><p>Its eyes burned a bright, eerie green, telling Logan that it hadn\u2019t given up on a meal yet.</p><p>They hit the first step. Hope grunted with effort. Through the leather, he felt her arm quivering with the strain of dragging his weight. Logan lifted himself, helping her as much as he could with one arm.</p><p>The demon kept up its pace, searching for an opening. Fire had eaten its way down the wood and was now only a few inches from his hand. Once he had to drop it, the demon would pounce.</p><p>They had to be out of here before that eventuality.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go faster,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>Her voice was breathless. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>Even without looking at her, he could almost feel her gather her will, as if the air around her had shifted at her command. The torchlight wavered, the flame eating its way toward Logan\u2019s hand.</p><p>The demon made a grab for Logan\u2019s leg. Its claws raked across his skin, but sliced cleanly through his flesh, leaving nothing for them to catch on.</p><p>Pain burned his limb and he felt more poison enter his bloodstream.</p><p>The torch became heavier. So did his eyelids. His arm drooped and the demon lurched forward.</p><p>Logan raised it up at the last second, singeing away a spot of fur on its paw. It howled in pain and its eyes glowed brighter.</p><p>The last few steps bumped beneath him, rattling his spine. He heard the squeak of door hinges and felt a cool rush of air pass his cheek.</p><p>The demon flinched away from the relatively bright light of the first floor. Crackling power gathered around them, like static electricity. A moment later, Logan\u2019s body nearly flew across the concrete, landing a few feet away. Hope slammed the door shut, picked up a discarded length of pipe, and slammed it down on the handle.</p> <p>The metal doorknob bent slightly, jamming it shut.</p><p>The demon pounded against the door, rattling it on its hinges. That bent knob wasn\u2019t going to hold it off for long.</p><p>Hope came over, grabbed the torch from his hands, and shoved it in the crack under the door, swinging it from side to side.</p><p>The demon screamed, but the pounding stopped. For now.</p><p>She came over and crumpled beside Logan, panting. \u201cPlease tell me you have a cell phone on you. Mine\u2019s gone and we need to call for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to get out of here. That demon will be back.\u201d</p><p>She let out a heavy sigh and her head hung limp from her neck in exhaustion. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can drag you both out of here. I barely made it up those last few steps.\u201d</p><p>Not to mention the fact that he was bleeding and the scent would eventually draw other Synestryn to him to feed.</p><p>He was too weak to heal himself. Too weak to even stand. He needed blood. If she wasn\u2019t going to leave his side, he had to be strong enough to defend her.</p><p>\u201cFeed me,\u201d he whispered, feeling ashamed that he had to ask. \u201cGive me some of your blood and I\u2019ll get us all out of this mess.\u201d</p><p>Hope\u2019s hand covered the spot where he\u2019d fed from her last night. Uncertainty drew her pale brows together before she gave him a resigned nod. \u201cNo more hospitals,\u201d she warned him. \u201cDeal?\u201d</p><p>Logan couldn\u2019t speak. His mouth had already begun to water in anticipation. His body clenched at the thought of holding her close again, of feeling her power sliding into him to become a part of him.</p><p>He returned her nod, sealing the deal. Even unspoken, the promise he\u2019d given her had power. It fell across him, warm and sweet like a lover\u2019s kiss.</p><p>Hope brushed her hair away from her neck and bent down. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare make a habit of this,\u201d she said.</p><p>Logan feared he already had.</p><p>Krag stilled as that flash of power slammed into him again, coming out of nowhere. This time he was ready for it.</p><p>He closed his eyes and concentrated on the path, letting his mind slide out and through the ribbon that led to the source of that power.</p><p>The frozen landscape flew past him, giving way to homes and then to the run-down buildings at the edge of the city. The speed at which they passed was dizzying, but he held tight, needing to know who the source of such a vast amount of power was.</p><p>Krag caught only a glimpse of honey blond hair and a slender neck for an instant. A Sanguinar was feeding from the source. A woman.</p><p>How dare that leech touch what belonged to Krag? All blooded humans in this region belonged to him. Their blood was his.</p><p>Rage broke Krag\u2019s concentration and he was flung away from the scene, dragged back into his body against his will. He fought it, struggling to go back to the woman and see her face, but it was useless. The connection was already gone.</p><p>At least he\u2019d seen her location. It was an old, run-down building some of his minions used for shelter. The Tyler building.</p><p>Krag sent his mind back out, racing across space until he touched the thoughts of the demon lurking in the basement of the Tyler building. He shoved his orders into the demon\u2019s mind, forcing it to obey. It shuddered in defiance, but in the end, Krag\u2019s will won out.</p><p>Now all he had to do was send one of his Dorjan\u2014his human servants\u2014to fetch her and bring her back here. With any luck at all, he\u2019d have her at his feet before sunrise.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>The flash of pain was gone, leaving Hope floating in blissful warmth. It was better than she remembered. Pleasure became a palpable thing, winding around her cells and soaking into them. The gentle tugging at her throat, the feel of Logan\u2019s lips moving against her skin, made her head spin, and not with loss of blood, either. As the seconds passed, he became stronger, gathering her up in his arms and holding her tight.</p><p>He sat up and swung her around until she was cradled in his lap. She felt his muscles swell and harden against her body. His erection throbbed against her hip, sending zingers of need arcing through her.</p><p>She heard a strangled sound of shock coming from somewhere nearby, but it didn\u2019t matter to her. Nothing mattered but the scent of Logan in her lungs and his strength surrounding her, keeping her safe. Here, there were no worries. No fears. No monsters could touch her here, in this place of blissful peace.</p><p>Weakness slid into her, but even that was welcome. Her eyes drifted shut and sleep beckoned.</p><p>Hope fought it off only because she didn\u2019t want to miss even a moment of what Logan was doing to her. It was too good to miss.</p><p>His tongue slid across her skin, sending a parade of shivers marching down her spine. A moment later, his mouth pulled away and she lay in his arms, looking up at him.</p><p>He was so beautiful. His jaw was tight and that lovely silvery light in his eyes was back, glowing with need\u2014a kind of need she\u2019d never seen on a man\u2019s face before. It made her feel special. Cherished.</p><p>\u201cIf there were more time . . .\u201d he whispered, his voice stroking over her like a caress. He didn\u2019t finish what he was saying, but she enjoyed filling in the blanks for herself.</p><p>If there were more time, he\u2019d kiss her. Touch her.</p><p>And then he laid her down on the cold floor, leaving her feeling weak and alone.</p><p>Hope struggled to sit up.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said from somewhere behind her. \u201cGive yourself a moment.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to, but her body had other ideas. That unexplained strength she\u2019d experienced before was gone now, leaving the opposite in its wake. She could barely hold up her own head. She had to settle for rolling onto her side to see what he was doing.</p><p>He was at the stranger\u2019s side, bent over his neck. Feeding from him.</p><p>Feral jealousy rose up inside Hope. She didn\u2019t want Logan doing that to anyone else. Ever. Only her.</p><p>The reaction was so strange and unwanted, it shocked her. Of course she didn\u2019t want Logan to drink her blood all the time. What kind of an idiot wished for a thing like that?</p><p>Logan leaned back and pressed an elegant hand to the man\u2019s head. The stranger closed his eyes as if falling asleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was poisoned. I had to administer an antidote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get it?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her question. \u201cI\u2019ll take him to a human hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not me. You said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not you. You I get to keep an eye on myself.\u201d He said it in a way that made her wonder if he saw the task as a chore or a pleasure. \u201cCan you walk?\u201d</p><p>Hope was wobbly, but she could walk as long as it was out of here. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll carry him. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>They hurried outside to Logan\u2019s van. He loaded the unconscious man in the back and drove to the hospital. He parked at the emergency entrance and got out. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a few minutes,\u201d he told her. \u201cWill you please await me here?\u201d</p><p>Hope nodded and leaned her head back against the seat to rest. She was still feeling woozy, but she\u2019d take that over dead any day of the week.</p><p>Logan came back out wearing scrubs. He had a trash sack full of something clenched in his fist.</p><p>\u201cWhere are your clothes?\u201d she asked as he got back in the van.</p><p>\u201cBloodied. I have to dispose of them properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like you have some kind of disease. I really hope that\u2019s not the case with all the necksucking you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile lifted one side of his mouth. \u201cI can assure you there\u2019s nothing for you to worry about. You\u2019re perfectly healthy.\u201d</p><p>Except for a slight case of brain damage that made me enjoy getting fed on by a vampire. Not that she was going to bring that up.</p><p>He drove onto the highway and headed east. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are too many people here for me to simply toss my clothing out the window. I have to go to a safe place where I can burn them. You\u2019re coming with me until I\u2019m certain there will be no lasting damage.\u201d</p><p>Worry crept into her. \u201cDamage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried not to take too much from you\u2014just enough for us to escape\u2014but after what I took from you last night . . . I just want to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not trying to scare me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Hope. That\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\u201d</p><p>He opened a compartment between them and pulled out a bottle of water. \u201cHere. You need the fluids.\u201d</p><p>Hope popped it open and drank, struggling to make sense of everything. She\u2019d let a vampire suck her blood. Twice. Sure, he didn\u2019t call himself that, but that\u2019s what he was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she\u2019d almost died tonight. So had Logan and that other man. If she hadn\u2019t shown up, they probably would have died.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t had that odd burst of strength, all three of them would have bought the farm right then and there in that creepy old building.</p><p>She opened her mouth to ask Logan if he knew anything about what might have caused her to get so strong so fast, but closed it again before she could speak. She didn\u2019t know this man. She didn\u2019t know anything about him other than he could drink her blood and feel better.</p><p>That was not something that recommended him for a confidant.</p> <p>She leaned her head back on the seat, wondering why she trusted him enough not to jump out at the first stop. Maybe it was what he\u2019d done for Charlie. He\u2019d done something to help the old man, to ease his pain. And he hadn\u2019t even wanted credit for it.</p><p>That went a long way in her book. Not many people would bother to help, and those who did wanted recognition. But not Logan. He\u2019d hidden what he\u2019d done, though she didn\u2019t understand why.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDizzy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>He reached over and wrapped his long fingers around her wrist, checking her pulse. His touch was warm, gentle. Warmth radiated out from him, streaking through her blood.</p><p>Hope shivered in response.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, more because she didn\u2019t want to admit his effect on her than anything.</p><p>Logan cranked up the heat until it was pouring out of the vents by her feet. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t help, tell me so I can care for you properly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProperly?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her quickly before returning his attention to the road. \u201cI might need to restore some of the strength I took from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you want me to drink your blood?\u201d The idea should have grossed her out. Yesterday morning, it would have. But a lot had happened since then, and she found the idea of giving him the kind of pleasure he\u2019d given her more compelling than she would have ever imagined.</p><p>She wanted to make him feel good. The fact that she\u2019d get her mouth on his neck was simply an added bonus.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he hurried to say, as if the idea was somehow forbidden. \u201cOf course not. It would merely be a transference of energy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to. All you need to know is that I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>While Hope wouldn\u2019t mind a little of that, she didn\u2019t like being treated like a child. \u201cI want to understand. You don\u2019t get to turn my life upside down and not tell me the whole story.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance I\u2019m going to have to remove your memories of tonight\u2019s events. The less you know, the more comfortable that process will be for you.\u201d</p><p>Remove her . . . ? \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Logan sighed. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt. And it\u2019s for your own good. Synestryn can sense those memories. They\u2019re like a beacon that calls them to you. If I can\u2019t scrub them away, you\u2019ll be in danger.\u201d</p><p>Anger burned hot and bright in her belly. She had to force words out between clenched teeth. \u201cYou touch my memories and you\u2019re a dead man.\u201d</p><p>He let out a musical laugh. \u201cYou are such a fetching creature. As if you could actually stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is taking any more memories from me. Ever.\u201d</p><p>His laughter died off suddenly. \u201cHope, I\u2019m sorry. I forgot you already face a substantial loss. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you promise not to touch a single memory I still have left.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a long moment with only the sound of the tires on pavement filling the space. His jaw was tight with righteous determination. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I cannot do that.\u201d</p><p>A void opened up inside her and was instantly filled with a sense of betrayal. \u201cStop the car. Let me out here.\u201d</p><p>They were through the suburbs and towns were getting smaller as each one passed. If she didn\u2019t want to be stuck out in the middle of nowhere, now was the time.</p><p>\u201cNo. If I leave you alone in the dark, chances are you won\u2019t survive until sunrise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>A silvery light flared, splashing across the steering wheel. \u201cI do. I\u2019ve seen it happen often enough to know. Now, you can be as angry with me as you like, but you\u2019re going to do it here, next to me, where I can protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saved your life,\u201d she reminded him. Sure, it made her a smaller person to bring it up, but the way she saw it, he owed her at least a little respect for what she\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cYou did. And I\u2019m repaying the favor by keeping you from needlessly going to your slaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, then drop me off somewhere public. A police station. I\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, remorse softening his tone. \u201cYou\u2019re too precious to entrust your safety to humans. I have to insist that you come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do what? Where are we going? What, exactly, do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meeting friends. They will see to your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about our deal? What about those missing people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friends are far better equipped to handle that task than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re handing me off. I\u2019m too much of a bother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. I find your company . . . stimulating.\u201d</p><p>Hope couldn\u2019t stop herself from looking at his crotch. It was a knee-jerk reaction. Uncontrollable.</p><p>He was hard. His erection tented against the loose fabric of his borrowed scrubs.</p><p>The idea that she could do that to him was more than a little exciting. A thrill winged through her belly, exploding into a thousand tiny, shimmering streamers.</p><p>She\u2019d never been very physical. She\u2019d dated a few men. Had sex with a couple of them. But not even all-out sex with all the bells and whistles made her feel half as good as she did now, thinking about how Logan would feel sliding inside her.</p><p>Hope squirmed in her seat.</p><p>Logan\u2019s nostrils flared as he pulled in a deep breath. His eyes fluttered shut for a brief second and a shudder shook his big body. \u201cWe cannot.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask him what they couldn\u2019t do. She knew what he meant. No sense in playing coy. \u201cYou\u2019re married,\u201d she stated, knowing a man like him had to be taken.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not married. I\u2019m also not human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken. Not that I would have slept with you anyway.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a brief, pointed stare so full of arrogance she had to marvel at the trick. A small smile played at his mouth. \u201cYou think not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully full of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone should cure you of that conceit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel free to try. But do so in a hurry. Our time together is nearly at an end.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, Hope began to grieve. Sure, he was arrogant and strange, but there was something compelling about him\u2014something that called to a part of her soul that hovered on the dark side of her memories. She didn\u2019t know what it was or what it meant, but what she did know was that she didn\u2019t want Logan to leave her life. At least not yet.</p><p>If Logan didn\u2019t hand Hope\u2019s care to another soon, he was going to do something unforgivable. Already he could see her slim body writhing beneath his as he drove his cock deep into her, over and over.</p><p>She was warm and soft, and the way she went pliant as he fed from her, letting out those quiet little noises of pleasure, nearly drove him mad.</p><p>He could smell her arousal as they drove. Combined with the sharp scent of her anger, breathing her in was intoxicating. It made him forget his purpose and think only of how she would smell and sound if he stripped her bare and tasted every inch of her skin.</p><p>Down that road lay the destruction of his race, so Logan shoved aside his inconvenient desire for the woman and focused solely on doing what must be done.</p><p>As soon as he had her settled safely inside the closest Gerai house, his bloodied clothing burning in the fireplace, he excused himself and snuck outside.</p><p>\u201cI need you to come and handle this woman,\u201d he told Tynan as soon as he answered the call. He knew he sounded desperate, but he couldn\u2019t help it. He was desperate.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Logan considered veiling the truth, but that would get him nowhere. Tynan needed to know the risk in order to respond appropriately. \u201cI want her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. The longer I\u2019m with her, the more convinced I am she might be a Theronai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but her blood is pure enough that there is a chance. You know what happened the last time someone stole away one of the Theronai\u2019s mates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember. And with a truce between the Slayers and Theronai closer than it\u2019s ever been, I don\u2019t want anything reminding either side of why the war began in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I, which is why you must come. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot get away. I\u2019ve tried. Between Grace and Tori, my hands are full. Why not escort her back to Dabyr and wash your hands of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised to help her find the cause of some locals gone missing in exchange for her cooperation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoolish,\u201d chided Tynan.</p><p>\u201cI realize that now. Too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contact Joseph. He\u2019ll send one of his unbonded men to deal with her problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already spoke to him. I\u2019m expecting his men to show up at any time.\u201d Logan didn\u2019t like the idea. He didn\u2019t like the thought of some giant pawing at Hope, desperate for her to save his life.</p><p>She would if she was able. The fact that she\u2019d gone back for Logan in that basement proved she was selfless and courageous. If she thought she could save a man\u2019s life, she\u2019d tie herself to him. Logan was sure of it.</p><p>And the thought made a dangerous anger swell deep inside him. He didn\u2019t want her tied to a Theronai. He didn\u2019t want her tied to anyone except him.</p><p>\u201cYou need to come,\u201d he told Tynan, desperation lifting his voice. \u201cYou need to take over her placement\u2014wherever that might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re far better at finding good matches than I am. And I\u2019m a stronger healer than you. My place is here, doing what I can to help Grace and Tori.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen send someone else in your stead. Please.\u201d</p><p>Tynan\u2019s sigh filled the phone line. \u201cI need to know you can handle this. And so do you. There aren\u2019t enough of us left to be handing duties off to another.\u201d</p><p>A cold wind whipped around Logan. He stared up at the sky, watching stars twinkle. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I know this. But the things I\u2019m feeling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill need to be controlled. Remember the goal. Think of a life without hunger. A life with children.\u201d</p><p>Tynan wanted a child of his own and had for as long as Logan could remember. He deprived himself of the joy, knowing that any child born to them would be doomed to a life of starvation and pain. None of the Sanguinar could do that to a child. Especially Tynan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Logan could change the lives of his people for the better, there was no other choice for him to make.

Not that it was much of a street or that anyone would pass by.</p> <p>He let himself into the safe house and dumped all of his supplies on the living room floor.</p><p>The baby had been crying for the last half hour, and if that smell was any indication, he was tired of lying in his own shit.</p><p>Iain wasn\u2019t a fan, either.</p><p>He stripped out of his coat and eased the child out from under his reeking T-shirt. The mess was impressive, covering both of them equally.</p><p>Iain toed out of his boots, unfastened his sword belt, and stripped naked. He made a quick call for backup, started up the shower, and carried the child inside. He\u2019d never before held something quite as slippery as a naked, soapy baby, so he took great care not to drop him on his head.</p> <p>By the time they were both clean, the boy was screaming his head off and Iain\u2019s was beginning to pound.</p><p>He dried the baby off, diapered him, and wrapped him up in a clean, dry towel. Then he set him in the center of a bed while he dressed in fresh clothes. His boots and sword went back on.</p><p>The child was still crying.</p><p>Iain read the instructions on the can of powdered formula and followed them to the letter. It took a while for the infant to get the hang of drinking from a bottle, and he made a soggy mess, but after a few tries, they both figured out the best way to make it work.</p><p>The child fell asleep. Iain tried to remove the bottle only to have him start sucking again.</p><p>Fine. If that was the way he was going to be, then Iain might as well get comfortable.</p> <p>He sat down in a recliner and eased it back. Some Gerai would be here soon to take the child off his hands. Then he\u2019d take care of arrangements for the mother\u2019s body and be back out there fighting right around sunrise.</p><p>Iain looked down at the tiny life in his arms. Every detail was perfect. Once upon a time he\u2019d wanted children of his own. He remembered the fact, though he couldn\u2019t quite remember why he\u2019d felt that way. Babies were too much work. Their lives too easy to end.</p><p>Still, there was something soothing about the boy. Holding him settled some of the seething rage that was always bubbling below the surface. It was probably some kind of survival instinct Iain had never experienced before\u2014something that prevented adults from simply killing a messy, loud, stinky inconvenience.</p><p>Whatever it was, it was nice. Peaceful.</p><p>Iain closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t think about what he\u2019d done or what he had to do. He didn\u2019t worry about his brothers\u2014those who looked to him for guidance when their lifemarks became barren. He simply existed.</p><p>If his eyes hadn\u2019t been closed, his heartbeat slow, he might not have heard the faint howl coming from the north.</p><p>Synestryn.</p><p>He\u2019d been so concerned about caring for the child he had forgotten to consider the mother\u2019s blood. If she was blooded, every nasty within scent of her would be on its way here.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t take the car and run. Her blood was all over it. Gerai hadn\u2019t brought him a new ride yet.</p><p>There was no help for it. Iain was going to have to fight off an attack and hope the kid didn\u2019t start crying and draw attention to himself.</p><p>When Logan came back inside, he was a different man. Colder. More distant. Hope tried to find out what had happened, but he avoided her and went to shower.</p><p>She sat on the couch, flipping through TV stations in an effort not to think about Logan\u2019s naked body streaming with hot water. The door of the little house opened, interrupting her inappropriate thoughts.</p><p>Hope\u2019s heart jumped and she sprang from the couch, holding the remote control out like a weapon.</p><p>The man who\u2019d come in was big. Tall. Broad. He had dark blond hair and laser blue eyes. A fine network of scars crossed his face, puckering the skin. His aura throbbed with red-hot pain, consuming the other colors. She could see faint streaks of pale silvery honor and nobility peeking out through the red.</p><p>Seeing so much pain, having it blasted into her retinas made her reel back in horror. She held up her hands to ward it off, shaking and speechless.</p><p>Sadness bowed the man\u2019s shoulders for a second. A flash of gray-blue disappointment spread out over his aura before it was eaten up by cool green resignation. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you. My name is Nicholas. Logan sent for me.\u201d</p><p>His voice was quiet and reassuring. The fact that he stayed on his side of the room was even more reassuring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Hope Serrien. Logan\u2019s in the shower.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the hearth, where the clothing had been burned and a fire still crackled away. \u201cYou were in a battle?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He started forward, only to stop himself after a couple of steps. \u201cWere you hurt?\u201d</p><p>Hope shook her head. \u201cLogan was. He\u2019s better now.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s jaw tightened with a pulse of anger. \u201cDid he . . . hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he might have . . . Never mind. I\u2019ll speak to him about it.\u201d He motioned to the couch. \u201cPlease, sit down. I didn\u2019t mean to disturb you.\u201d</p><p>Logan stepped out into the living room, his hair black with dampness. A pristine towel hung around his neck and he wore fresh jeans and a T-shirt that clung to his chest. \u201cNicholas. I\u2019m glad you could come. Where are the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only me. We\u2019re stretched too thin.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded, his face grim. \u201cI understand. Have you touched her yet?\u201d</p><p>The odd question rocked Hope back on her heels. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas eyed Logan in irritation. \u201cWe\u2019ve only just met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch me?\u201d asked Hope again, looking from one man to the other.</p><p>\u201cTouch her,\u201d ordered Logan.</p><p>Hope crossed her arms over her chest, pinning her fingers under her arms. \u201cWhat the hell are you two talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to her about this?\u201d Nicholas asked Logan.</p><p>Her voice got louder until she was almost yelling. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas looked at her with an apology shining in his blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am. You\u2019ll have to forgive us. I know this must all seem strange to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust touch her and be done with it,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d warned Nicholas. \u201cWay off.\u201d</p><p>Logan stared at Hope for a moment, then nodded his head once. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll be in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease sit down,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cI\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d</p><p>Hope sat, perched on the edge of the seat. \u201cMake it quick. I\u2019m tired of all the mystery already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a problem with Sanguinar. I\u2019ll try to clear things up the best I can.\u201d Nicholas lowered his body into a chair across the room from her, clearly trying to come off as nonthreatening. \u201cI assume you know Logan\u2019s not human, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not either. Our question is whether you\u2019re one of us\u2014like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a vampire, too?\u201d</p><p>Amusement pulled at Nicholas\u2019s scars. \u201cNo. I\u2019m a Theronai. My people work in pairs. One man, one woman. Only there aren\u2019t many women of our kind left. Logan thinks you might be one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does he want you to touch me?\u201d Even asking the question hurt. She didn\u2019t want Logan to hand her off to someone else as if she weren\u2019t good enough for him.</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s a chance that if I touch you, my luceria will react.\u201d He held up a wide hand. On it was a simple band that swirled with flecks of color\u2014so many she had trouble focusing on it.</p><p>She blinked rapidly, concentrating on the lines crossing his face. Whatever had left those scars had been one hell of an opponent. A man built like Nicholas would not have been easy to hurt.</p><p>\u201cSo, can we just shake hands or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. If you\u2019re okay with that. I\u2019ve waited a long, long time to find my partner. A few more minutes won\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>Hope didn\u2019t want to spend a few more minutes with him. She wanted to be back with Logan. Best to just get this over with and figure out if she was who he thought.</p><p>She might not be human. The idea was so bizarre, and yet it explained a lot. Maybe that\u2019s why she saw auras. \u201cIf I am like you, would that explain why I can\u2019t remember anything before about ten years ago?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s possible. What I do know is that if you are meant to be my partner, I\u2019ll do anything in my power to make you happy. Including getting your memory back.\u201d</p><p>His earnestness touched her. She sensed he was a sweet man. A good man.</p><p>Hope held out her hand. She couldn\u2019t stop it from shaking. She closed her eyes, cringing at her own cowardice.</p><p>Warm, callused fingers closed around her hand. His touch was gentle, careful.</p><p>She looked up at him. He stared in rapt attention at his ring as if it held the secret to life. She didn\u2019t know what he was looking for, but she saw nothing.</p><p>After a long moment, he bowed his head in defeat. He blew out a long, weary breath and a wave of deep blue sadness smothered the vibrant red pain for a moment before it, too, got swallowed up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have bothered you,\u201d he whispered, grief plain in his voice. Then he turned and left out the front door.</p><p>Nicholas had known better than to get his hopes up. She wasn\u2019t the one. She couldn\u2019t save him.</p><p>Pain bore down on him, crushing him under the weight of disappointment. He didn\u2019t know how much longer he could keep going. And even if he did, even if he kept fighting the good fight and miraculously managed to find a woman who was compatible with his power, what then?</p><p>He saw the way Hope had looked at him, flinching back in revulsion. He knew his scars had either frightened or disgusted her. Not that he blamed her for the honest reaction. His appearance was shocking. There was no help for it.</p><p>He heard the front door open behind him. The heavy fall of footsteps told him it was Logan and not Hope.</p><p>\u201cI presume things did not go well,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. Time to move on. Demons to slay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stay?\u201d</p><p>The last thing Nicholas wanted to do was hang around, wishing for something that wasn\u2019t going to happen. He respected himself too much to beat himself up like that. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo protect her. She\u2019s blooded. She risked her life to save mine tonight. I fear she would do the same thing again if necessary.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s opinion of Hope rose a notch. \u201cNo kidding?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she managed it. There were two of us, both paralyzed. She dragged us up a flight of stairs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nicholas let out a low whistle. \u201cStrong woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoolish woman. Her blood is too valuable to spill. I need someone who can take care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her back to Dabyr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t go,\u201d said Logan. \u201cAt least not until she finds the answer to her mystery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what mystery is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, people she knows are going missing. She\u2019s certain of foul play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she right?\u201d asked Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen eight Synestryn in two nights near her home. Inside the city limits.\u201d</p><p>Normally, Synestryn stayed out of sight. They avoided public areas, like cities, preferring suburbs and rural locations. The hunting might be sparser, but the risk of being caught was much lower.</p> <p>Nicholas had to get rid of the infestation. It was too dangerous to allow demons to live among so many people. \u201cGive me the details. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take her into combat with me,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cShe needs to go to Dabyr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re bound by a promise. I can make her go, but only after the cause of the missing people is determined.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stared at Logan. He didn\u2019t trust the Sanguinar. Logan was way too pretty to be trusted. He was used to getting his way. The fact that this woman had managed to wring a bargain out of him was one more sign that she was one of their own.</p><p>Which meant she might be able to save one of his brothers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Joseph send more men. If she won\u2019t go willingly to Dabyr now, then we\u2019ll keep her safe until she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in the meantime, the other unbounded warriors can test her for compatibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d said Nicholas.</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cIt will be as you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell her, or do you want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat our plans are.\u201d</p><p>Logan frowned in confusion. \u201cWhy would we tell her?\u201d</p> <p>For a smart guy, Logan was a complete idiot. \u201cBecause it\u2019s her life. Because she\u2019s a grown-up and gets to make her own decisions. Because you don\u2019t muck around in someone else\u2019s life without at least telling them you\u2019re doing it.\u201d</p><p>Logan smiled in amusement. \u201cYou truly are na\u00efve if you believe that. The best way to muck around in someone else\u2019s life is by keeping it a secret from them.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stared at Logan for a long time, unsure whether he wanted to punch the man or weep for him. \u201cPeople are not here for your amusement. We\u2019re responsible for the things we do to them. I truly hope you understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to lecture me about responsibility. I know that lesson all too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t mind telling Hope what we plan to do so she won\u2019t be frightened.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s phone rang. He answered it, listened briefly. \u201cI\u2019ll come immediately. Before dawn.\u201d He hung up and said to Nicholas, \u201cI have to go. Urgent matters. You understand.\u201d</p><p>What Nicholas understood was he was being handed responsibility for Hope\u2019s safety and comfort. And while he was equipped to manage both, he couldn\u2019t help but feel like Logan was using him to avoid something. Or someone.</p><p>Logan got in his van and drove away.</p><p>Nicholas sighed and turned back to the house, trying to figure out how he was going to explain everything to Hope in a way that wouldn\u2019t frighten her or piss her off.</p><p>He told himself it was good practice for the day he found his other half. If he was lucky enough to live that long.</p><p>Krag\u2019s Dorjan came back empty-handed.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the woman?\u201d he asked the human he\u2019d sent to find her.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t there. We searched the whole building. There were signs of a fight. Blood. But nothing else.\u201d</p><p>If that Sanguinar had bled her dry, Krag was going to stake him out in the sun for the Solarc\u2019s Wardens. \u201cWhere did she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The Dorjan\u2019s failure grated against Krag\u2019s patience. He needed that woman. If her blood was as pure as Krag hoped, she could be enough of a prize to appease his father\u2019s anger. Krag could return home and take his rightful place as his father\u2019s heir.</p><p>The domain he\u2019d scratched out for himself here was nothing compared to his father\u2019s realm. The sources of food there were rich and plentiful, as if someone had been raising blooded human children as one would cattle. Krag wanted that power. He was the firstborn. He deserved it.</p><p>But when his father had beheld his second son\u2014the one who could walk among humans, unnoticed\u2014Krag had been shunned and banished.</p><p>He had to prove to his father he was worthy of his inheritance, that he could rule over his domain, destroying any rebellion or attack.</p><p>The woman he\u2019d sensed would go a long way toward proving he was worthy. Especially if he could breed her and give his father a grandchild more perfect than Krag\u2019s brother could ever be.</p><p>The thought warmed his blood, making him merciful. Rather than torturing the man kneeling before him for his failure, Krag drew his dagger and rammed it into the man\u2019s heart. He fell over, a look of shock frozen on his face.</p><p>Demons snarled nearby, but did not dare to come feed without Krag\u2019s approval.</p><p>He nodded to them, stepping back as they flooded around his feet to clean up the mess.</p><p>Krag turned to his right-hand man, a Dorjan who went by the improbable name Hacksaw. \u201cCan you find her?\u201d he asked his servant.</p><p>The Dorjan lifted his dark eyes from the floor. A scar bisected his lip where a piercing had been ripped out. His wide shoulders straightened with purpose and his meaty fists clenched. \u201cI can, Master.\u201d</p><p>Krag went to the man and pressed a finger to his forehead. He shoved the knowledge he had of the woman into Hacksaw\u2019s head. The skin under his finger sizzled and blistered as the memories were implanted.</p><p>Hacksaw shuddered in pleasure or pain. Krag couldn\u2019t tell which and didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Once the information was in place, Krag dismissed him and turned away. \u201cDon\u2019t take long,\u201d he warned the Dorjan. \u201cDon\u2019t make me wait.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Hope listened quietly to everything Nicholas had to say.</p><p>There were more men like him. She might be able to save one of them, and if she did, she\u2019d have access to magic.</p><p>As she listened, she kept waiting for a spark of recognition\u2014something that told her she was on the right path, that she was what he thought she was. Unfortunately, as his story went on, she began to realize that nothing he said resonated with her. It simply didn\u2019t feel right.</p><p>With Logan, she felt like the veil between her and her memories became thinner, like she was getting closer to the truth. And while Nicholas was gentle with her feelings and careful not to shock her, she felt . . . nothing.</p><p>Finally, she had to stop him before he got his hopes up too high. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nicholas, but I\u2019m not a Theronai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. None of the others knew, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I\u2019d have a ring-shaped birthmark. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be in a place you can\u2019t see, under your hair.\u201d</p><p>Hope didn\u2019t know how to explain to him that it didn\u2019t feel right. That while she was beginning to believe that she wasn\u2019t human, what he told her left her feeling unconnected.</p><p>She offered him a wistful smile. \u201cI can\u2019t be someone just because you want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he said. \u201cI also know that no matter who or what you are, we\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you protect the people on the streets\u2014the ones who keep disappearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do that, too. Logan told me it was important to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. While I\u2019m not close with everyone who\u2019s gone missing, I still feel a responsibility toward them, as if it\u2019s my job to ensure their safety.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas smiled, making his scars pucker. \u201cSee? That\u2019s the kind of thing that proves my point. You feel your sense of duty even without your memories. That has to count for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you want it to. Believe me, the idea of being some magical woman who can save people\u2019s lives is compelling, but I have to be honest with myself. And so do you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his blue eyes sad. An answering plume of blue swirled in his aura of pain. \u201cNo, what I have to do is keep hope alive. For us, it\u2019s more important than food or water. Without hope, we\u2019re already defeated.\u201d</p><p>She understood that. She\u2019d lived in hope of learning her past for a long time. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you. I don\u2019t think I am who you want me to be. But I\u2019ll do what you ask. As soon as we find what happened to all these missing people, I\u2019ll meet your friends. Let them touch me. And if I can save one of them, I will.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas swallowed hard, then nodded. When he spoke, his voice was tight with emotion. \u201cThank you. That means more than you can ever know.\u201d</p><p>He got up and walked out of the house. Hope got the sense he needed to be alone. So did she. There were so many things to work out in her head, all of them crammed together one on top of another.</p><p>She\u2019d just committed to lining up for savior auditions for a group of men she\u2019d never met. On top of that, chances were she was going to let them all down the way she had Nicholas.</p><p>She was no savior. She didn\u2019t look forward to the moment that these Theronai came to realize that.</p><p>A feeling of inadequacy hung over her, making her feel heavy. She leaned back on the couch and covered her eyes with her arm.</p><p>She was tired. Lonely. Logan had left without even saying good-bye, and his brush-off stung.</p><p>She\u2019d thought they had a connection. He\u2019d drunk her blood. Twice. She\u2019d saved his life. And yet, apparently, that wasn\u2019t enough to even warrant a quick word of farewell.</p><p>He\u2019d abandoned her. And whether he felt connected to her or not, she felt him. Even now, lying here with her eyes closed, she knew which way he\u2019d gone. She could feel him glowing against her left side like the sunshine she craved so much.</p><p>She glanced at her watch. It would be dawn in a few hours. She\u2019d have Nicholas take her home, bundle up against the cold, and enjoy the sunrise. It would calm her, center her, give her strength.</p><p>She could hardly wait for summer to get here so she could strip down and bask in the sun. Winter had been long and was hanging on for dear life. Maybe once all of this bizarre stuff was behind her, she\u2019d take some time off and drive down to Florida. She could lie on the beach and listen to the ocean. Maybe if she relaxed enough, her memories would loosen up and simply come to her.</p><p>That would be nice.</p><p>At least she thought so. There was still a part of her that wondered if that mental wall was there for a reason. Maybe what was on the other side was too dark and scary to stand. Maybe her mind had blocked it out as a way of protecting her.</p><p>If so, did she really want to see what was on the other side?</p><p>The question rolled around in her head, rattling in annoyance. She\u2019d had this debate with herself a hundred times. In the end, there was only one answer. Those memories were hers. Ugly or beautiful, she wanted them back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jackie sat in the back of the SUV trying not to pay attention to all the lovey-dovey stuff going on up front. Paul and Andra were the perfect couple: beautiful, tall, strong, working together as one unit in complete accord.</p><p>It was more than a little nauseating.</p><p>Jackie stared out the window, watching the dark landscape slide by. After living so long in darkness, her eyes had no trouble seeing into the inky blackness of the countryside. And while she saw no demons, she knew they were out there. One wrong move and she could be right back where she was only a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>She patted her purse, feeling the hard lump of the handgun she\u2019d insisted on having before leaving the safety of Dabyr. No matter what happened, those demons were not taking her again. At least not alive.</p> <p>Andra\u2019s phone rang. She said something quiet Jackie couldn\u2019t hear, and then hung up. \u201cChange of plans,\u201d she announced. \u201cIain is in trouble. We\u2019re going to go help him since we\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>Iain. The man who\u2019d pulled her out of her cage and then looked at her with a dark hunger she\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>Jackie fought against the memories, but in the end, she relived every moment of her rescue again. The fear of that night flooded her, making her body tremble. She could almost smell the blood and filth of unwashed bodies as she and the others ran from the cave. Big men were on all sides, hurrying them forward.</p><p>Iain had gone back for the others. For the children. He\u2019d saved them all that night\u2014all those who were left to save.</p><p>Jackie didn\u2019t want to think about the ones who hadn\u2019t made it out. She didn\u2019t want to see the faces of those who were born and died in captivity, never to know the warmth of the sun.</p> <p>The car lurched around a corner, hitting a rut in the gravel road. Jackie\u2019s head bumped into the glass, breaking the hold those bleak memories had on her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll find,\u201d said Paul as he sped down the lane. \u201cStay close to me and Andra, okay?\u201d</p><p>Jackie nodded, her throat too clogged with emotion to find any room for words to escape.</p><p>Andra turned her long, lean body in her seat and looked at Jackie. Her short, dark hair framed her face, making her blue eyes stand out in contrast. \u201cIf things get ugly, I\u2019ll put a shield around you. You don\u2019t have to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>Jackie didn\u2019t bother to tell her she was constantly afraid these days, and there wasn\u2019t a shield in the world that could change that.</p><p>They came to a rocking stop in front of an aging farmhouse. Paul didn\u2019t even turn off the engine before he slammed out of the SUV, drawing his sword. Andra was only half a second behind him.</p> <p>Now that they were gone, Jackie had a clear view out the front windshield. The SUV\u2019s headlights flowed over the icy landscape, glinting off trees and tall, dead grass. Everything was coated in a thin layer of ice, giving the area an almost fairy-tale type of feel. Only this wasn\u2019t a friendly tale; it was one of the dark, twisted, cautionary tales from long ago, filled with monsters and death.</p><p>Half a dozen demons littered the area, their eyes glowing with a hungry light. They were furry, with thick, heavy limbs like a bear, but they had almost human features. Their mouths were too big to be human, their teeth too long. And the pale green light spilling from their eyes was definitely not human.</p><p>Jackie had seen these things before. She\u2019d seen them feed on the bodies of the dead. She\u2019d seen them fight and kill one another for a scrap of food, then consume their own when one fell.</p><p>Her body froze in the vehicle, unable to move. She sat there, staring, shaking. A cold sweat seeped from her pores.</p><p>Paul\u2019s sword gleamed as he fought the demons. Andra was by his side, her attention split between the monsters and Jackie.</p><p>Andra shouted something Jackie couldn\u2019t understand. Her heart was pounding too loud for her to hear anything else. She closed her eyes to block out the sight of the things that had stolen her life and instead concentrated on breathing.</p><p>The SUV rocked as if something had jumped on top of it. Jackie\u2019s eyes shot open, but she saw nothing. Her breath fogged up the window on her left. Andra lifted a hand and a faint blue light spilled out over the hood, sweeping back to engulf the left side of the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d shouted Andra, and this time Jackie understood her words.</p> <p>Panic forced her into motion. She fumbled for the latch on the seat belt, but her sweaty fingers slipped from the plastic. The sound of metal scraping over glass squealed out from behind her.</p><p>Jackie spun her head around to see what was behind her only to discover that it wasn\u2019t metal on glass she\u2019d heard; it was one of the demons clawing at the back window. Pale blue sparks spewed up from the claws, keeping the thing from doing any damage to the glass. But for how long?</p><p>With that thing only inches away, Jackie\u2019s world began to cave in. She remembered all the cold, dark nights she spent in terror for her life. She remembered the faces of every one of the women and children who were slain and eaten by those monsters. She\u2019d known from the moment of her escape that they would want her back. And here they were, clawing at her, trying to reach her so they could take her back to that nightmare.</p><p>Jackie wasn\u2019t going to let that happen.</p><p>A calmness settled over her as she made her decision. She reached for her purse and the revolver inside. Her hand settled around the textured grip, keeping it from slipping out of her sweaty palm. It was already loaded. All she had to do was disengage the safety and it was ready to fire.</p><p>Five bullets for the demon. One for her.</p><p>Iain didn\u2019t know how long Andra\u2019s shield was going to hold, but he knew that he had to get the woman out of the SUV before it failed. There were three Synestryn back there, and every one of them was going to want a bite.</p><p>He finished off the demon in front of him, then shifted to his left, forcing the rest of the beasties to hit Andra\u2019s shield. She\u2019d created a tunnellike barrier, forcing the demons to come at them only one or two at a time. Paul could handle that for as long as it took Iain to get to the woman.</p><p>He\u2019d seen panic enough times to know its face, and the woman he\u2019d found in those caves\u2014Jackie\u2014was wearing it now.</p><p>Iain opened the car door nearest the house and leaned inside, trying to ignore the slavering demons only inches away from Jackie\u2019s head.</p><p>They were so going to die when he got a minute.</p><p>As soon as his head and shoulders were inside the vehicle, he saw the muzzle of a .45 aimed at his face.</p><p>Iain was impressed. Apparently she hadn\u2019t completely panicked.</p><p>\u201cSave it for the Synestryn. We need to get you out of here,\u201d he told her as he reached in and pressed the release button on her seat belt. The canvas strap slithered away from her body, catching on her arm.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t moving. She was staring at him, holding that gun so tight her knuckles were white from the strain.</p><p>\u201cMove your arm,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>Iain held back a sigh as he pushed the gun down and pried her fingers from the grip. \u201cThe seat belt is stuck on your arm.\u201d</p><p>Jackie looked down where he indicated and recognition flared in her wild gray eyes. Her slim arm moved, freeing the seat belt.</p><p>As soon as he touched her, Iain\u2019s heartbeat slowed. His luceria leapt away from his neck as if reaching for her. The ring vibrated, humming close to his skin. A sense of calm descended over him, contrasting sharply against the chaos of combat and the rage of his dead soul. He knew he didn\u2019t have time to study the odd reaction, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care.</p><p>He\u2019d felt like this only once before\u2014the night he took Jackie from her cage. It had passed so quickly, he hadn\u2019t even allowed himself to believe it had ever happened.</p><p>It meant she could save his life. Too bad she was too late to do anything for his soul.</p><p>Iain shoved away all thoughts of salvation and forced himself to focus on keeping the woman alive. The Band of the Barren was full of men that needed a woman like her, and he was going to see to it that she lived long enough to meet them.</p><p>Blue sparks jumped from the Synestryn\u2019s claws for a second; then they stopped as the thing made its way through to the glass.</p><p>\u201cTime to go.\u201d Iain grabbed her arm and pulled her across the seats, practically dragging her from the SUV.</p><p>Her feet hit the ground, slipping on the ice. Iain kept a tight hold to keep her from falling and ushered her inside the house, where she\u2019d at least have the protective wards of the Gerai house to keep her safe. They might not hold for long, but they were better than the SUV.</p><p>He pushed her through the door, grabbed the handle to shut it behind him, and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a baby in the bathtub. Don\u2019t let the Synestryn get him.\u201d</p><p>Logan had to hurry if he was going to meet Alexander and check in on Hope before sunrise.</p><p>He sped down the highway, finally pulling into a secluded Gerai house tucked at the end of a long driveway. Trees surrounded the old farmhouse, sheltering it from prying eyes.</p><p>Logan jumped out of his van and hurried to the front door. By the time he got there, Alexander Siah had opened it, beckoning him inside.</p><p>Alexander had been instrumental in the success of Project Lullaby. The man had an ability to cure cancer that was unparalleled. Even Tynan couldn\u2019t match his skill when it came to the disease.</p><p>For years, Alexander had been gaining the cooperation of heavily blooded humans in exchange for cures for themselves or loved ones. He saved lives, and the humans paired up and created new ones.</p><p>Their breeding program was of questionable morals, but necessary. Without Alexander\u2019s aid, they would be years behind where they were now, so when he\u2019d told Logan they needed to meet, Logan had not questioned him.</p><p>Alexander was several inches taller than Logan. He wasn\u2019t as thin as the last time Logan had seen him, proof that he\u2019d fed well recently. His icy green eyes flashed with impatience beneath his steeply arched eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cCome inside. We must hurry,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>Logan stepped inside and came to an abrupt stop. A man stood there, imposing in his size. An air of power and menace wafted from him, forcing Logan to dial down his senses so he wouldn\u2019t be overpowered by his presence.</p><p>The man had medium brown hair and golden brown eyes. He stood a bit over six feet and his limbs were thick with muscle. His stance was belligerent, his booted feet braced apart and his hands fisted on his hips. The tops of his ears were slightly pointed, displayed openly, rather than hidden as many Slayers did.</p><p>Logan looked at Alexander in disbelief. \u201cYou brought a Slayer to a Gerai house? Are you mad?\u201d</p><p>While the war between the Theronai and Slayers had stagnated over the decades, bringing a Slayer onto Theronai soil was a surefire way to reignite violence.</p><p>Alexander shook his head. \u201cTynan sent the word out. You wanted the most powerfully blooded males we could find. Eric Phelan is the man you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>Logan absorbed that shocking news for a moment. As far as he knew, the Slayers had bred with humans to the point where their bloodlines were too diluted to be of much use. But if Alexander said differently, Logan believed him.</p><p>Eric\u2019s jaw clenched in anger. \u201cYou said you\u2019d make this quick. I have places to be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have a bargain,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll abide by it, but you two better hurry the hell up. If my brother finds out I\u2019m here, taking a chance of messing up his precious plans for peace, you\u2019ll be sucking blood from my corpse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother?\u201d asked Logan.</p><p>\u201cAndreas Phelan.\u201d</p> <p>That name rang a loud bell. \u201cThe new leader of the Slayers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And he earned his title through beating the hell out of everyone else who wanted it, so I suggest you don\u2019t cross him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d said Logan. His mind was reeling, trying to sort out this new twist of events. \u201cWhy am I here, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric\u2019s blood is strong. He\u2019s the man you\u2019re looking for to breed with Hope.\u201d</p><p>A slight snarl lifted Eric\u2019s lip. \u201cI\u2019ll fuck whoever you want, but we have laws about breeding. You know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cYour brother has been clear about that. I assure you that if he doesn\u2019t find Hope a suitable mate\u2014if he doesn\u2019t accept her bloodline\u2014our bargain will be fulfilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d said Eric. \u201cWhere\u2019s the woman?\u201d</p><p>Logan looked at Alexander. \u201cYou want me to have Hope breed with a Slayer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis blood is stronger than any human. Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s with a Theronai right now. He\u2019s convinced she is one, too. He\u2019ll take her back to Dabyr for all the other Theronai there to test her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Eric. \u201cI\u2019m not fucking some Theronai\u2019s woman. My brother would kill me, and he\u2019d take years doing it, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know if she\u2019s a Theronai or not,\u201d said Alexander. He looked at Logan. \u201cTest his blood. You\u2019ve had hers, right? You\u2019ll know if they blend.\u201d</p><p>He would. All he needed was a few drops of Eric\u2019s blood. It would react strongly to Hope\u2019s if they were a good match. \u201cFine. We\u2019ll try that, but if he\u2019s not a match, then this meeting never happened.\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t dare step closer to Eric without permission. Slayers were violent. And quick. Logan had already been injured enough for one night. \u201cMay I?\u201d he asked Eric.</p><p>Eric held out a beefy arm. \u201cKnock yourself out. Just don\u2019t make me do the same. Mind your manners. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Logan did. He would take only a little\u2014just enough to answer his question.</p><p>He took Eric\u2019s wrist and brought it to his mouth. The man\u2019s skin was hot, but that was natural. Slayers\u2019 body temperature was above that of humans or Theronai. Their metabolisms burned hot and fast.</p><p>As soon as Logan\u2019s fangs broke the skin, it began to heal. He hurried to finish the job, to prevent him from having to bite Eric a second time.</p><p>As his blood pooled in Logan\u2019s stomach and spread through his system, it combined with Hope\u2019s blood. Logan let go of Eric and closed his eyes, focusing on what was going on inside him.</p> <p>Eric\u2019s blood cells sought out Hope\u2019s, merging with them. The two combined, much stronger than the sum of their separate parts. Logan\u2019s body warmed and sparks of power filled his limbs.</p><p>The effect didn\u2019t last long, but it was unmistakable. Hope and Eric would make a powerful couple. Their children would be strong, their blood possibly as strong as a Theronai\u2019s.</p><p>As good as that news was, it rang hollow inside Logan\u2019s chest.</p><p>He looked at Eric, imagining him with Hope, their bodies entwined, creating life.</p><p>Jealousy rose up in Logan so swiftly he didn\u2019t have time to stop it from taking root. It wove its way through his bones, making him writhe with possessive rage. Hope was his. He did not want to share her. Not with Eric. Not with anyone.</p><p>Not that he had a choice. He\u2019d never had a choice.</p><p>Logan swallowed down that jealousy and looked at Alexander. He knew if he so much as glimpsed at Eric, those violent urges would return. \u201cIt is as you say. They are a good match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to gain permission from Andreas,\u201d said Eric. \u201cI can\u2019t have a kid with her unless he approves.\u201d</p><p>Logan barely kept the sneer from his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve never even met her, yet you\u2019re willing to create a life with her? What if she doesn\u2019t want it?\u201d</p><p>Eric crossed his thick arms over his chest. \u201cI thought it was your job to see that she did. Isn\u2019t that what you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so willing to help?\u201d asked Logan.</p><p>Eric gave a careless shrug. \u201cI\u2019ll be saddled with a wife as soon as my brother finds one for me. What\u2019s the difference if you do it first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d asked Eric. \u201cDo I look like a child who believes in such things? I\u2019ve always known I\u2019d marry out of duty to the race. It\u2019s no big surprise, unless you count the fact that I\u2019ve avoided it this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Hope? Doesn\u2019t she deserve love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be safe. She\u2019ll have family. Children. She\u2019ll have a home and a place she belongs and people who would give their lives for her. If that\u2019s not enough for her, she doesn\u2019t deserve more.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she did. She deserved to be loved for the exquisite creature she was. If Eric couldn\u2019t see that, he didn\u2019t deserve her.</p><p>Alexander put a staying hand on Logan\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m sure Eric will come to care for her in time. Let them meet. We\u2019ll see what comes of that and then go from there.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Logan knew this was the best course of action\u2014or at least the most logical. \u201cThere\u2019s only one problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d asked Eric.</p><p>\u201cHope is with Nicholas, and there\u2019s no way he\u2019d ever allow a Slayer anywhere near her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get rid of him,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cSend him away and bring her to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy,\u201d he told the men. \u201cNicholas thinks she might be a Theronai. He\u2019s going to take her back to Dabyr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could get rid of him,\u201d said Eric. \u201cMake it look like an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d said Logan. \u201cWe\u2019re too close to a truce to do anything to upset it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll put on a hat. Cover my ears. Go to meet her. He\u2019ll never know what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We need Nicholas. I\u2019ll take care of him. I\u2019ll find some way to separate them. And then I\u2019ll bring her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d said Alexander.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. The risk of a Theronai showing up here is too great. We\u2019ll find another place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Eric grabbed his jacket from the couch. \u201cYou boys figure it out and let me know. I\u2019ll show up and marry the girl so we can get on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA true romantic,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>Eric looked him in the eye. \u201cRomance is for children and women. I\u2019m not either of those. And neither are you. Do your job and you\u2019ll get what you want. So will I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want, Eric? Exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as you. To be left the hell alone so I can do my job.\u201d</p><p>Eric walked out. His motorcycle started up, making Logan wonder how he could stand riding it in this weather.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having second thoughts, aren\u2019t you?\u201d asked Alexander.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMating Hope to him. You know they\u2019re a match. I could see it on your face when you fed from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d admitted Logan. \u201cAt least their blood is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that as if it\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. I want her to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be. So will Eric. He blusters, but we both know what happens to a man when he falls in love. He grows softer, more pliable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that man is capable of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be. For her. For their children.\u201d</p><p>Logan could easily see an infant with Eric\u2019s eyes and Hope\u2019s smile. Their children would be beautiful. Strong.</p><p>The image should have comforted him and given him hope for the future of his race, but all it did was leave a hollow ache in his chest, as if something vital had been removed.</p><p>His feelings for the woman were getting in the way and they were growing stronger by the hour.</p><p>He opened his mouth to demand that Alexander take over her care, but the words would not come out. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of not seeing her again.</p><p>It was a warning\u2014a screaming siren of doom\u2014but Logan couldn\u2019t bring himself to back away. She\u2019d saved his life. She\u2019d fed him. He was tied to her in a way no other man was. If Alexander took over, he\u2019d feed from her and that bond that Logan shared with her would be diluted. It would no longer be something only he and Hope shared.</p><p>Besides, he needed to prove to himself he was strong enough to do this. She wouldn\u2019t be the only woman he felt a connection to as the years passed. If he walked away before he could overcome his attraction to her enough to do his job, he\u2019d forever wonder if he could. The worry would plague him. He\u2019d question his confidence at a time when there could be no question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what must be done,\u201d he told Alexander.</p><p>His friend nodded. \u201cI know you will. You always have.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>A baby in the bathtub?</p><p>Jackie gathered herself and searched the small house until she found the infant. He was wrapped up tight, screaming his little head off. His face was red and his squawking cry was hoarse, as if he\u2019d been screaming for a long time.</p><p>She picked him up and cuddled him to her body. He quieted after a few seconds, sucking in gulping breaths of air.</p><p>She\u2019d seen what the Synestryn did to babies born in those caves. She wasn\u2019t about to let it happen to this one.</p><p>Jackie retrieved her gun from where Iain had set it next to the front door. She checked to make sure the safety was off, then stood with her back to the wall.</p><p>If the people outside didn\u2019t finish off the demons, she was going to have to do it herself.</p><p>Rory crouched on top of a rusting file cabinet to get out of the water. She was so cold her bones ached. She hugged herself, shivering, trying to stay awake. She hadn\u2019t slept in days. Maybe longer. Time meant nothing down here. Every hour was an endless progression of hunger, thirst, and fear.</p><p>In the murky water below, something slithered just below the surface. Ripples spread out in three places, and she couldn\u2019t tell if there were three different creatures down there, or one really big one. Either way, it wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>She stood, reaching overhead to the tiled ceiling. A lifetime ago, Rory had hung paper snowflakes from fishing line at school to decorate. She remembered the teacher showing her how to lift the ceiling tiles so she could wrap the line around the metal bars that held them up.</p><p>Maybe she could pull one of those metal bars free and use it as a weapon. It was worth a shot.</p><p>Rory slid two dingy tiles aside and wiggled the bars. Dust and insect carcasses rained down on her, but it was better than whatever was in the water below. After what she\u2019d waded through, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever be clean again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It took some work, but she managed to free a short piece. The end was blunt and the metal was light, but it was better than no weapon at all.</p><p>Rory went back to her crouch, clutching her prize in her hands. If that thing came for her, she was going to kill it.</p><p>Fatigue made Hope\u2019s body sluggish as she climbed the stairs to her room. It was five in the morning, and she had only a couple of hours to sleep before she had to be up for work.</p><p>She flopped back onto her bed, feeling something hard under her. She pulled it out. It was her cell phone, which seemed almost comical.</p> <p>Hope entered the phone number Nicholas had given her, which was scrawled in ink on the back of her hand. He\u2019d said he\u2019d stay nearby until dawn, that she\u2019d be safe during the day without him, but insisted she take his number, just in case. Which worked for her. She didn\u2019t like the idea of having a babysitter sleeping on her couch, which was what he said he\u2019d do if she didn\u2019t cooperate.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t used to being bossed around, and she didn\u2019t much care for it, even if she knew Nicholas was right about the danger.</p><p>Hope fell into a fast, hard sleep and when she woke, it was growing light outside. It wasn\u2019t time for her alarm, but something had woken her.</p><p>She blinked her blurry eyes and tried to get her sleepdeprived brain to function. The lights were off. Only a faint slice of streetlights gleamed from the edge of her blinds. The smell of cold, fresh air filled her room, along with a darker, more intoxicating scent.</p><p>Logan.</p> <p>Hope reached for her lamp, fumbling to turn it on. The lightweight base rocked as her knuckles slammed into it. Finally, she found the knob and light flared through the room, blinding her for a moment.</p><p>When the stinging eased, she saw Logan. He sat on the foot of her bed, watching her.</p><p>Hope should have been scared. She should have been outraged that he\u2019d slip uninvited into her room. But all she could feel was curiosity and a slow, budding warmth.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not even six in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPracticing your stalker technique?\u201d</p> <p>He frowned for a second, the action creasing his beautiful face. His hair was damp as if he\u2019d just showered, falling perfectly over his pale brow. There was a healthy glow brightening his cheeks, which made her wonder if he\u2019d taken blood from someone tonight.</p><p>The spike of jealousy that rammed through her was as unexpected as it was unwanted. She didn\u2019t care whose blood he drank so long as it wasn\u2019t hers. It was none of her business.</p><p>Mocking laughter flooded her mind as she tried to get herself to believe the ridiculous lie. She wanted him to need her again\u2014to make her feel that exquisite pleasure only he could give her.</p><p>\u201cI had to come before dawn,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Not until she\u2019d cleared her head. He was too potent to face so soon after waking up.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d Hope pushed herself out of bed and went into the bathroom and shut the door. She took her time washing up, content to make him wait.</p><p>Assuming he was there at all. For all she knew this could be some kind of vivid dream.</p><p>As soon as the thought entered her mind, she dismissed it. If this had been a dream, Logan would have already had her naked and been making love to her while he fed from her neck. And while she\u2019d never admit that to another soul, she had to be honest with herself. Logan excited her, even the scary parts. Perhaps especially the scary parts. She felt drawn to him, connected to him.</p> <p>When he\u2019d left her with Nicholas, she\u2019d felt abandoned\u2014like some vital part of herself had been ripped away and held hostage.</p><p>She\u2019d never had fantasies about vampires before. All these wayward thoughts were his fault\u2014no doubt the result of some kind of vampire cooties. Having her blood taken had changed her somehow, and part of her wondered if it wasn\u2019t an improvement.</p><p>While she\u2019d been with other men before, not one of them had made her feel even half of what Logan had. And he hadn\u2019t even taken off her clothes. She could only imagine the kind of pleasure being naked with him could bring, feeling his skin against hers. No clothing to mute the sensation. And now that the thought was in her head, it was going to occupy all free space.</p><p>Hope dried her face and straightened her shoulders to face him. When she opened the bathroom door, he was sitting exactly where she\u2019d left him, so beautiful she forgot to breathe.</p><p>He\u2019d replaced the long leather coat that he\u2019d burned with an identical one. The sweater beneath it was the same pale silvery gray as his eyes, and it clung to muscles she swore hadn\u2019t been there when she\u2019d first seen him. His gaze roamed over her long sleep shirt to the bare legs beneath. Her toes curled under his scrutiny, and she wondered if he liked what he saw.</p><p>A faint shimmer of light glowed in his pale eyes for just a split second before he squeezed them shut. \u201cWhat I have to say can wait until you\u2019re dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not until I\u2019m awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies for that. I had to come before dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have knocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t want Nicholas to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked as she gathered up a fresh set of clothing.</p><p>\u201cHis kind tend to be a bit . . . possessive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis kind? You mean men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean Theronai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was locked.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat posed no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you turn into mist and come in through tiny cracks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve watched too much TV.\u201d A smile lifted one side of his mouth. Instantly, the need to feel her lips against his exploded inside her. She needed to see if he tasted as good as he smelled, and if that wicked smile was teasing or a promise of more to come.</p><p>\u201cTV?\u201d she asked, all her thoughts dribbling from her ears.</p><p>Logan rose and glided toward her, holding her gaze. Her head tilted up as he came closer so she wouldn\u2019t have to look away. She really didn\u2019t want to look away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to discuss myths and fiction. I\u2019m here for more important matters. I want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>Hope had to blink several times to get the gears in her head to spin again. \u201cI already told you I would, once we find those missing people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet the police handle that. You and I can leave now. Together.\u201d</p><p>That sounded nice. \u201cWhere will we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a special place. Secluded. Romantic. Eric is there, waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Hope jerked, reeling back at the mention of another man\u2019s name. He might as well have thrown ice water down her shirt.</p><p>She turned away, grabbed up her clean clothes, and went into the bathroom.</p><p>It was clear Logan didn\u2019t want her. He kept shoving other men at her, and like a fool, she kept letting him. Not this time. She wasn\u2019t going anywhere with him. And it didn\u2019t matter how many men he brought around. She was staying put in her life, where she belonged.</p><p>When she came out of the bathroom armored in comfortable clothing, she faced him down. \u201cTell Eric to find someone else. I\u2019m not interested. I\u2019m done letting you play matchmaker. I don\u2019t care if I never get my memories back. I don\u2019t care if I have to find Rory on my own. You\u2019re using me and I don\u2019t like it. I\u2019m not playing anymore.\u201d</p><p>One second he was a few feet away, and the next he was right in front of her, his strong hands wrapped around her upper arms. \u201cYou made me a promise. You can\u2019t escape that, so don\u2019t even try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I want, and if you try to stop me, I\u2019ll call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman police. There\u2019s nothing they can do to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to test that theory,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Hope. Don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything. You\u2019re the one who keeps trying to foist me off on other people. I don\u2019t understand why. What is it you want with me?\u201d</p><p>His grip loosened as his gaze slid over her face. There was longing in that look. Needful desire that went beyond sex.</p><p>He was into her. He couldn\u2019t hide that. A man didn\u2019t look at her the way he did if he wasn\u2019t at least thinking about getting her naked. And Hope wanted that. Bad. A man like Logan didn\u2019t come by more than once in a lifetime, and she wanted to at least give them a chance. She wasn\u2019t a fool. She knew things would probably end in disaster, like they always did. But for Logan, the risk of heartbreak was worth whatever time they might have together, no matter how fleeting.</p><p>His eyelids lowered, masking his emotions. \u201cThe things I want don\u2019t matter. Only the things my people need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Trust me when I tell you that I would never allow anything bad to happen to you. I want you to be happy. Safe. Loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know enough to realize you\u2019re deserving of only the best.\u201d Pain creased his brow, shimmering in his eyes. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something I simply cannot give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even willing to try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not willing to risk disaster.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he wasn\u2019t, but she was. He deserved to be happy, too, and from the way he looked at her, he wanted her as much as she did him. If there was a chance for them to find some joy in each other, she owed it to both of them to make it happen. Even if it was only a little fling.</p><p>Hope broke his grip on her arms and slid her fingers through his hair. As soon as she had two fists full of his silky locks, she held him still while she went up on tiptoe. She pressed her lips to his, testing the theory that they\u2019d be good together.</p><p>At first he was stiff and resistant, but it didn\u2019t take long for that to change. He yielded with a rough groan of defeat. His mouth opened and melded to hers. She licked over the inside of his bottom lip, tasting him as she\u2019d been dying to do. He growled in excitement and she felt a shudder race through him. His hands slid around her, gripping her hips, pulling her body against his. Heat bloomed between them and she swore she could feel his heart pounding through their clothes.</p><p>Her feet left the floor as he lifted her and pressed her against the wall. His body held her pinned, freeing his hands. Those long, elegant fingers caressed her face and neck while their kiss deepened. Her tongue traced over his teeth until she found the sharp tip of one fang. A thrill raced through her as her body remembered how good his bite had made her feel.</p><p>Sweet tremors fluttered in her belly where his erection pressed against her. His scent grew stronger and darker as the fever between them increased.</p><p>There was no more question in her mind. Despite the fact that he kept trying to set her up with other men, he wanted her. She could feel it in every rapid breath and every heated touch. Only a man who wanted her would kiss her like he was, demanding and thorough.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to let him deny it again.</p><p>Hope\u2019s fingers trailed down his back, enjoying the hard planes and contours beneath his leather coat. And while she totally dug the whole black-leather, bad-boy look, what she really wanted was to feel his naked skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slid her fingers beneath his sweater, shoving it up so he\u2019d know she wanted it off. Instead of giving her the space to strip him bare, he held her pinned by her shoulders to the wall and took a long step back.</p><p>A stain of lust darkened his cheeks and his lips were shiny from hers. His nostrils flared wide and his face twisted in a grimace of pain. \u201cWe cannot do this.\u201d</p><p>Her throat was tight as she fought the need to shut him up and get his mouth on hers where it belonged. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt felt right.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut as if trying to gather his control. \u201cYou\u2019re meant for another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeant? The only person I\u2019m meant for is the one I pick. And right now, I pick you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and stepped back out of her reach. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t allow myself to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo . . . feel strongly for you. My job is to see you safely in the arms of another. That is all.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the fact that he didn\u2019t get to decide she was meant for anyone and focused on the more important issue. \u201cYou want me. You can\u2019t deny that,\u201d she said, her voice rough with budding anger.</p><p>\u201cI must deny it. Please. Don\u2019t test me again.\u201d</p><p>His rejection hurt, which pissed her off. She didn\u2019t know him well enough to allow him to hurt her. Why should she care so much if he didn\u2019t want to be with her? She hardly knew him. Just because he made her feel good didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d done it on purpose. For all she knew that was an involuntary action on his part\u2014a package deal with all the bloodsucking.</p><p>Sadly, whether he should be able to hurt her didn\u2019t matter. He had.</p><p>Her tone came out flippant and snippy. \u201cFine. But you stay the hell away from me, understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could. It would be easier for both of us. But I made you a promise, and I intend to see it fulfilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help, Logan. Just go on with your life and let me do the same.\u201d</p><p>He reached out as if to touch her, but pulled his hand back before he could. \u201cI\u2019m going to help you. And you will help me. We struck a bargain, and we will both fulfill our ends.\u201d</p><p>He walked out of her room, but she didn\u2019t follow him. If he didn\u2019t want her, fine. She had enough self-respect not to chase after him.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Synestryn kept attacking until sunrise, drawn by the dead woman\u2019s blood. Iain finished off the last of them and wiped his sword on the fur of the closest one. Exhaustion hung heavy on his frame, but at least some of the pain had eased. He felt like he could think straight for the first time in days.</p><p>Paul held Andra close, supporting her weight over the icy ground. Blood, severed limbs, and twisted bodies were everywhere. Little droplets of black blood froze along blades of grass, clinging like chunks of malignant coal. It was going to take at least an hour for the sun to burn away so much filth.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d asked Paul. He was breathing hard and each breath froze as it hit the air.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d said Iain.</p><p>Paul nodded. \u201cI need to refuel. We\u2019ll be inside in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>The couple shuffled off to find a clean patch of ground that wasn\u2019t covered in blood. Paul could draw strength from the earth and feed it to Andra, who looked like she could use about a week\u2019s vacation.</p><p>Iain left them to it and went inside to check on the kid. As soon as he opened the door, he was met with the muzzle of a .45. Again.</p><p>Jackie had a baby in one hand and a revolver in the other. A fierce expression twisted her mouth and made her gray eyes stand out.</p><p>Iain waited there, giving her time to realize who he was. Slowly, recognition registered and she lowered the weapon.</p><p>Her whole body seemed to sag as if the life had drained out of her. Her face was pale and she was shaking like crazy. She weaved on her feet and Iain was sure she was going to drop the baby on his head.</p><p>He reached for the child and that gun came right back up.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d He held his hands up. \u201cJust trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour clothes. You stink of them. Go wash.\u201d</p><p>Iain looked down and sure enough, there were a few places on the front of his shirt where their blood had burned holes through the fabric. His coat had hung open, and the magic shielding on his leather coat hadn\u2019t been able to protect the fabric.</p><p>\u201cBe right back. The fight\u2019s over. Sun\u2019s up. Relax.\u201d</p><p>He cleaned up, changed shirts, and came back out. The woman hadn\u2019t relaxed. Not even close. She was still armed, watching out the windows, moving from one to the next as if something was going to jump out at them.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t come for us in the daylight,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking any chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept you\u2019re holding a gun and a baby and shaking so hard I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t shot your own foot off.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him.</p><p>\u201cHow about you set the gun down.\u201d</p><p>She turned then, and something in her face pulled at him, making him take a step closer. There was a vulnerability there\u2014one that didn\u2019t belong. From all accounts, this woman had spent years in a Synestryn nest, and not only had she survived, but several of the others they\u2019d rescued that night had reported that Jackie was the reason they were still alive. She\u2019d protected them as much as she was able, finding them food and warmth when there was none to be had.</p><p>She swallowed, her eyes pleading. \u201cI can\u2019t set it down. My hand won\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her hand. Her knuckles were white. Tendons stood out, stretched to the limit. She\u2019d been gripping it so hard for so long her hand had probably gone numb.</p><p>Iain moved toward her slowly. He really didn\u2019t want his head blown off because he made a sudden move around an armed, skittish woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to help, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSomething happens when your kind touches me. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Then give me the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t trust you. I\u2019ll keep him safe.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest and stepped close enough he could loom over her. \u201cThe gun or the baby. I\u2019m taking one of them. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>A helpless kind of vulnerability settled over her expression for an instant before she banished it. She squared her shoulders and slowly lifted her arm toward him. It was the one holding the gun.</p><p>Iain nodded, accepting her choice, engaged the safety, and started prying her fingers away from the grip. The instant he touched her skin his luceria began to hum. The gaping hole in his chest where his soul had been before it died seemed to shrink. His monster\u2014the dark, dangerous creature that had started growing inside him the day his soul had died\u2014was lulled to sleep, and until now he hadn\u2019t realized just how much control the beast had stolen from him. For the briefest second, he remembered what it was like to feel things deeply. Good things, not just anger and fear.</p><p>The baby grunted, and rather than coldly calculating the odds of his survival, Iain felt something. Some connection. He . . . cared.</p><p>The feeling rattled him so much his heart started pounding hard and he broke out in a sweat.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d she said, her voice tight and strained.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease hurry.\u201d</p><p>Iain did as she asked and made quick work of loosening her grip enough to ease the weapon away. Her hand was curved into the shape of a claw, and without thinking, he massaged it, rubbing all the delicate muscles so they\u2019d start working again.</p><p>Jackie stared at him, but she didn\u2019t pull her hand away. She let him ease her, which somehow served to ease him as well.</p><p>His luceria trembled at his throat and finger, but he could detect no colors swirling in its pale depths. All the color had been leeched away by time and the decay of his soul. His lifemark was bare. His soul was dead. And no matter how excited the luceria got, there was nothing Jackie could do to save him.</p><p>He was already dead. His body just hadn\u2019t caught up with his soul yet, because he wouldn\u2019t let it. There was too much work left to do. He couldn\u2019t leave yet. His brothers needed him.</p><p>Jackie tugged her hand away and shook it. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>With her touch gone, the ragged emptiness in his chest opened up again. The monster roared back to life, thrashing around within Iain\u2019s head. He had to grit his teeth and lock his knees to keep from staggering back in pain.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he lied. He was good at lying. It was the only thing keeping him and the Band of the Barren alive. \u201cWe should go as soon as Paul and Andra get back. We need to get the kid to Dabyr where he\u2019ll be safe. And I need to bury his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died in childbirth.\u201d</p><p>Sadness painted Jackie\u2019s face. \u201cThat happens a lot with their babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Synestryn.\u201d</p><p>A quiet rage seeped in, filling him from his feet up. \u201cThat\u2019s not a Synestryn baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in denial. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not. It can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at his eyes.\u201d</p><p>Iain leaned over. The baby was awake, staring up at him. His eyes were blue. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it a second.\u201d</p><p>He kept staring, his hand on his sword. He did not want to kill this child.</p><p>Then he saw it. A black plume of movement swirled in the boy\u2019s eyes, tainting the iris.</p><p>Iain stumbled back. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jackie frowned in confusion. \u201cI thought you knew. I thought you\u2019d found him in one of the caves.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his belly filling with acid. The baby had seemed so human. So perfect. He\u2019d cared for it, cuddled it. And now he had to kill it. \u201cGive it to me.\u201d</p><p>Jackie turned away, shielding the child with her body. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asshole! You\u2019d kill him because of who his father was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt. I\u2019d kill it. That\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the gun again, and stared at him with a look so feral he was certain she\u2019d use it on him. \u201cIt\u2019s a job you don\u2019t have to do. None of their babies survive. None of them. He\u2019ll last a day. Maybe two. That\u2019s all he gets and there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m letting you take even one second of that away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019ve seen it over and over. I wish I didn\u2019t, but I do.\u201d Pain radiated out from her, so strong Iain could feel it bombarding his skin. Whatever she\u2019d been through, it had been bad. She\u2019d witnessed horrible things. They all had. But that didn\u2019t change his duty.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let it live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will kill you if I have to,\u201d she warned him, leveling the weapon. \u201cHe\u2019s innocent. You\u2019re clearly not. There\u2019s no question for me about who should live and who should die here.\u201d</p><p>Iain didn\u2019t dare test her. He knew she wasn\u2019t bluffing. He could see her firm resolve in her stance, in her face. She would pull that trigger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If it weren\u2019t for his carefully developed sense of duty, Iain would have let her.

It breaks my heart and tears me up inside. I still see the faces of each one of the babies we lost in those caves. When he\u2019s gone, I\u2019ll see his, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re certain he\u2019ll die?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs certain as I am that I\u2019ll shoot you in the head if you take another step closer.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Fine. Let her have her way. If she wanted to watch the thing die a slow death, that was her business. But it wasn\u2019t something Iain could tolerate.</p><p>He walked out, got behind the wheel of Paul\u2019s ride, and took off without them. Let them find their own way. He had things to do.</p><p>Jackie stepped outside, making sure Iain was gone. As fast as he was driving, she didn\u2019t think he was coming back.</p><p>Good. She didn\u2019t like the way he made her feel, all soft and weak.</p> <p>She cuddled the baby close, seeking the comfort of its tiny presence. As short as his life would be, there was still magic in it. She\u2019d seen it over and over. Women found love they never would have known without those few hours with their children. Their heartbreak was soul-crushing, but for those few hours, they were happy and knew a special kind of peace only a baby could bring.</p><p>Jackie stared down at him, uncovering his face just enough so that he could see the sun. None of the others had ever had that joy and she wanted to share it with him.</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d she said, holding his little body upright. \u201cThat\u2019s the sun. Isn\u2019t it pretty?\u201d</p><p>The baby blinked and started crying like the light hurt his eyes. She hadn\u2019t thought about that, though she probably should have. His father would have hated sunlight.</p><p>She tugged the towel up to shield his eyes and noticed that as soon as she did, the black plumes rioted in his eyes as if the sun had held them back.</p><p>A spark of hope lit inside her. She tugged the towel down again, letting sunlight spill onto his soft head without shining directly into his eyes.</p> <p>The plumes shrank and disappeared.</p><p>Holding her breath, she covered and uncovered him several times. The black in his eyes responded as if hiding from the light.</p><p>Maybe the sun was the key. Maybe all those babies in the caves died because they had no sun.</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare get her hopes up too high, but she allowed herself enough to fight back the desolate surety of death. This child could survive. The odds weren\u2019t good, but it was possible.</p><p>If he was to survive, he needed two special things: She needed to get him somewhere safe\u2014back to Dabyr, where the Synestryn couldn\u2019t reach him and there were Sanguinar around to help keep him alive. And he needed a name.</p><p>Hacksaw\u2019s mind burned with the information the master had put into it. Even the pain of such a gift was its own kind of pleasure. He\u2019d gained the notice of the master, which was something he\u2019d only dreamed about.</p><p>A thread of power connected the two of them, allowing Hacksaw to feel closer to the master than he ever had before. And while that leash hurt, he reveled in the agony that would allow him to please the master.</p><p>Hacksaw went where he was led, driving into the city as fast as he dared. By the time he found the building where the master had seen the woman, the sun was already bright in the sky.</p> <p>Sunlight streamed through his car windows, blocking some of the pain screaming in his mind. For a split second, Hacksaw remembered a time before the master. He\u2019d been happy then. He hadn\u2019t hurt. He hadn\u2019t been afraid.</p><p>And then, as quick as the feeling came, it was gone again, leaving Hacksaw disoriented.</p><p>Had there been a time before the master? If so he didn\u2019t want to know about it. That time wasn\u2019t important. The only thing that mattered was obedience.</p><p>A search of the run-down building showed no signs of the woman. There was only one young man there, huddled in a corner against the cold.</p><p>Hacksaw grabbed him by the front of his shirt and hauled him to his feet.</p><p>The man cried out in fear and batted at Hacksaw\u2019s hands. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a woman. Pretty. Blond. She was here last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about any woman. I only found this place today. I wasn\u2019t here last night. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hacksaw pulled out a switchblade and shoved it against the man\u2019s throat. \u201cTell me where she is or I trigger the blade.\u201d</p><p>The man started to blubber. \u201cI swear I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Hacksaw\u2019s thumb moved to the switch.</p><p>The man\u2019s words tumbled from his mouth, almost too fast to hear. \u201cIt could be Hope. She\u2019s blond. I\u2019ve seen her on the streets trying to get people to come to a homeless shelter where she works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few blocks north. I could show you.\u201d</p><p>Hacksaw moved the knife and let go of the man. He shoved him toward the door. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>The man led him through back alleys until they reached the shelter. It was an aging building that someone had tried to keep from decaying. The sign out front was plain, its paint fading, welcoming all who came.</p><p>Hacksaw spun the young man so he was in front of him, facing away. Then he slit his throat. Blood arced onto the pavement, but it didn\u2019t touch Hacksaw\u2019s clothes. He didn\u2019t want anything rousing the suspicion of those inside, including this kid.</p><p>A few seconds later, the guy had bled out and wasn\u2019t nearly so messy. Hacksaw dumped him in a trash bin, covering him with garbage. Someone would find him soon, so he didn\u2019t have much time to get the job done.</p><p>He walked around to the front entrance and went inside to find the master\u2019s woman.</p><p>Sibyl stumbled over her feet as she crossed her bedroom floor. She fell into the small table where she used to take tea, bumping her arm hard enough that it went numb for a moment.</p><p>She didn\u2019t fit in the little wooden chairs anymore. She was sure she\u2019d grown more overnight, despite the fact that her mother\u2019s clothes still fit the same. The gray silk gown clung to her new curves, and no matter how long she looked at herself in the mirror, this body still seemed alien to her.</p><p>For centuries she\u2019d wanted to grow up and be normal. She\u2019d never thought that doing so would cause her to pay such a high price.</p><p>Sibyl hugged the porcelain doll to her chest and sat on the edge of her bed. She\u2019d always been able to reach her sister, Maura, before. Even when she wasn\u2019t invited. But now, even with the doll that looked like her sister to help strengthen the link, she couldn\u2019t get through. It was as if there was no one on the other end of the line\u2014all she heard was silence.</p><p>She refused to believe that Maura had died. Sibyl would have known if she had.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t she?</p><p>Cain knocked on her door. \u201cI brought you food.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to tell him to leave it outside as he\u2019d been doing, but instead, she heard a tool rattle in the lock on her door.</p><p>Sibyl raced across the room to prevent him from opening it, but her clumsy body thwarted her. She didn\u2019t pick up her too-long feet far enough and ended up stubbing her toe. She tried to catch her balance, but that only made things worse.</p><p>She toppled forward, barely missing the edge of her dresser as she fell.</p><p>Her bedroom door opened and Cain stood there with a tray in his hands, staring for a long moment.</p><p>Then he dropped the tray and drew his sword. It became visible as he pointed it down at her, thrusting the tip toward her face. \u201cWho are you and where the hell is Sibyl?\u201d</p><p>She stayed there, frozen for a moment, trying to ignore the pain in her stubbed toes and wrists. They\u2019d been taking a beating over the last few days as she struggled to adjust to her new size.</p><p>Slowly, so she wouldn\u2019t set him off, Sibyl pushed herself up. She kept her giant hands in sight and lifted her chin to look into his eyes. She was as tall as his shoulder now, when she\u2019d always come only to his waist, and seeing him from this height was odd.</p><p>\u201cI am Sibyl.\u201d</p><p>The tip of his sword dipped, then fell to his side. The look of shock on his face was almost comical. His dark green eyes widened and he leaned forward as if the distance was causing him to hallucinate.</p><p>\u201cSibyl?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, feeling her hair sway around her thighs. It had grown as well, and she hadn\u2019t dared ask for scissors to cut it, fearing he\u2019d get worried and barge in here.</p><p>Like he had just now. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to see me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a grown woman. How did this happen?\u201d</p><p>A flutter of grief passed through her. She\u2019d thought she\u2019d grieved for her parents when she\u2019d seen the vision of their deaths years ago, but the past few days had proven her wrong. Now, facing the man who\u2019d seen to her protection for longer than her own father, she felt unwanted tears burning in her eyes.</p><p>She willed them away and straightened her spine. \u201cI believe Gilda\u2019s death freed me from the prison of that child\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only guess, but I believe that whatever magic she wrought to keep Maura and me small was destroyed the night of her death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother freed you?\u201d said Cain, staring openly at her.</p><p>Sibyl had long since stopped referring to Gilda as her mother. Cain knew that and yet he persisted in constantly reminding her of their relationship. \u201cOr simply confined me to a new prison. This body is defective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefective? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry all the time. I fall constantly. Look,\u201d she said, shoving up the too-short sleeves of the inherited gown. Dozens of bruises marred her arms. She raised the hem of her skirt, showing even more bruises on her shins. \u201cThis isn\u2019t normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn days you\u2019ve gone from a small child to an adult. There\u2019s bound to be adjustment issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she allowed.</p><p>Cain recovered an apple from the discarded tray and wiped it on his sleeve. \u201cHere. Eat this. I\u2019ll get you something else in a minute. But first you\u2019ve got to tell me why you were hiding. I can understand how you wouldn\u2019t feel like celebrating, considering how this happened, but why would you hide it from me?\u201d</p><p>Sibyl bit into the apple, unable to resist the offer of food. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like myself. I didn\u2019t want to worry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was worried as hell, wondering if you were in here crying all day and night. At least this is something I can deal with.\u201d</p><p>He kept staring, his eyes going from the top of her head to her bare feet. She felt like some kind of zoo animal put on display. And that was with Cain\u2014the man she trusted more than any other in the world. Once the others saw her, she was going to feel even worse.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get you some different clothes. Something that fits. And I need to tell Joseph. Your change has a lot of implications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the fact that now that your body has caught up with your mind, you may be compatible with one of the men.\u201d</p><p>No. Sibyl wasn\u2019t ready for that. She\u2019d lived as a child for hundreds of years. She wasn\u2019t willing to step from that directly into the role of wife. She needed some time. Some freedom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want the men to know.\u201d</p><p>Cain frowned at her. \u201cOf course they\u2019re going to know. Knowing will give them hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t even walk across a room without tripping. Any man who sees me like this will coddle me. I can\u2019t stand the thought of being treated like a child. Ever again.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly, his lips flat in unhappy acceptance. \u201cYou can take the time you need to adjust, but this isn\u2019t something we can hide. You\u2019ve had the mind of an adult for a long time. You know what we\u2019re up against.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I will take my place in the war. I will bind myself to a man and fight by his side. But not now. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen when? And what will you do in the meantime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to live. Finally. I\u2019ve been alive for centuries, but I\u2019ve never really lived my life on my terms. I\u2019ve always been under the control of someone else. My parents. You.\u201d</p><p>He jerked back as if she\u2019d struck him. \u201cI didn\u2019t control you. I protected you as I would my own daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou watched over me day and night. You knew where I was all the time. You kept tabs on my life and the company I kept. I understand why you did it. I even accept that there was no other way, but that was when I was small. Weak.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still weak,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cFor now. But I\u2019ll get stronger every day. And I\u2019m going to do it on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving Dabyr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving . . . ? Are you crazy? Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve been a prisoner my whole life. I\u2019ve thought about this for days, and I realize that as long as I stay here, I\u2019ll be treated like a child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you hear yourself? You\u2019ve only thought about this for days. What\u2019s the rush? Your parents died. You haven\u2019t even processed that yet, haven\u2019t grieved. You need to stay where I can take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t. If I do, my life will stay as it has been. I can\u2019t stand that, Cain. I need some space. Some freedom.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her, peering through the lacy curtains. \u201cWhere will you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Away from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be safe. What if your sister finds you?\u201d</p><p>Sibyl didn\u2019t dare tell him that her powers were gone. He\u2019d see that only as a further weakness and reason why she should stay caged. \u201cI won\u2019t let her. I\u2019ll go somewhere safe. Perhaps one of the other strongholds.\u201d</p><p>When he turned back to her, his eyes were suspiciously shiny. \u201cIf anything happened to you, it would end me. I get that that\u2019s a terrible burden to lay at anyone\u2019s feet, but I have to be honest. I love you. I\u2019ll always love you. You\u2019ve been my little girl for hundreds of years, and that\u2019s not something that goes away no matter how big you grow. You\u2019re always going to be a part of me.\u201d</p><p>Because Sibyl loved him, she refused to lie. \u201cI love you, too. I promise I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p> <p>Cain nodded. Sadness bowed his body as he turned toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Joseph. I\u2019ll make sure you get what you need.\u201d</p><p>Just like he always had.</p><p>Cain didn\u2019t know how he was going to stand losing Sibyl. Caring for her had been his greatest joy in life. And now she was leaving.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t blame her for wanting to go, but that didn\u2019t stop the mountain of grief he felt from crushing him.</p><p>His baby girl was leaving him. It didn\u2019t matter that she wasn\u2019t his biological child, or that she hadn\u2019t even really been a child for a long time. The only thing that mattered was that he\u2019d felt like a father. And now she was taking that away.</p><p>He knew she\u2019d always love him. He also knew that it was healthy for her to move out on her own, but after so many years, he wasn\u2019t sure if his heart could handle the shock.</p><p>He arranged for more food to be taken to their suite as he headed for Joseph\u2019s office. He wasn\u2019t sure how he was going to convince their leader to let an unbound female Theronai out on her own, but he had to find a way. Sibyl deserved to be happy. He wanted that for her more than he wanted anything. And if he had to fight Joseph to make it happen, then that\u2019s what he\u2019d do.</p><p>A searing pain hit his chest, nearly knocking him over. It felt like something had stabbed him, and he jerked his shirt up to see what it was.</p><p>A trio of leaves fell from his lifemark, fluttering down over his skin as they fell.</p><p>Cain braced himself against the wall. He\u2019d always had a healthy batch of leaves. His pain had always been manageable.</p><p>That had been Sibyl\u2019s doing. She\u2019d needed him, and because of that, he\u2019d stayed strong and solid.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need him anymore, and based on the proof gathering at the base of his lifemark, his soul knew it.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>\u201cI saw two new faces today,\u201d said Sister Olive that night as she loaded blankets into the washing machine. \u201cA man and a young woman. The man was asking some of the others about you. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>Hope stifled a yawn as she folded laundry. The easy, mundane chore helped soothe her nerves, giving her time to think. Fatigue grated against her eyes and ached in her joints.</p><p>She\u2019d finished her last appointment and closed up shop early, leaving Jodi to her work. The whole day had oozed by in a fog of fatigue and frustration and she needed to get out and clear her head.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if she was going to see Logan again or not. She tried to convince herself that having him out of her life was for the best, but she couldn\u2019t quite choke down that lie.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see a man. I only saw the young woman,\u201d she told Sister Olive. \u201cThe pretty one with the dark, frightened eyes. The one in the too-small clothes.\u201d Not only had they been too small, they\u2019d also been slutty, like something a streetwalker would wear. That coupled with the fear screaming through her aura made Hope wonder what had happened to the poor girl.</p><p>\u201cI found her something that fits in the donation box. And I called Dr. Oakes to see if she could stop by for a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think she was abused,\u201d said Hope. She\u2019d thought the same thing when she\u2019d seen the small, black-eyed woman stumble in here as if dazed.</p><p>\u201cDr. Oakes will be the judge of that. We\u2019ll get her any help she might need.\u201d</p><p>Hope stacked a folded towel onto the pile. \u201cDo you think she\u2019ll stay that long?\u201d</p><p>Sister Olive shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We can only pray she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to talk to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think she\u2019s too skittish for that. Give her some space and we\u2019ll let Dr. Oakes approach her.\u201d</p><p>Hope nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been here as much lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChild, I\u2019m surprised you stuck around this long. Your business is growing. You need to nurture it like a plant or it\u2019ll die on the vine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy business is fine. And I like being here. You\u2019re my family. Besides, I seem to be the only one around here that\u2019s convinced people are going missing.\u201d</p><p>Sister Olive smoothed stray strands of iron gray hair behind her ear and gave Hope a hard stare. \u201cPeople come and go. You know that as well as I do. If you go out there trying to keep tabs on everyone, you\u2019re going to scare them away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong? What if this feeling I have is right and they\u2019re out there, hoping someone will save them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou plan to save them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a bit dangerous? You need to leave that kind of work to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing what they can,\u201d said Hope, repeating what the cops had told her over and over.</p><p>Sister Olive abandoned the laundry and gave Hope a tight hug. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare get yourself hurt. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out again tonight, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Hope nodded. \u201cI have to. I can\u2019t sit around and do nothing.\u201d</p><p>Sister Olive gave her a maternal smile. \u201cI understand. You have a calling you need to answer. I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d</p><p>That was good, because while Hope desperately wanted Sister Olive\u2019s blessing, she knew she\u2019d continue on her chosen path even without it. She didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval to do what she thought was right. Not Sister Olive\u2019s and certainly not Logan\u2019s.</p><p>Tynan had done what he could for Grace and was on his way out to finally meet Logan when Nika stopped him in his path. Her white hair and pale skin made her blue eyes stand out in stark contrast. She was dressed from head to toe in black leather, and Tynan would have bet his fangs that Madoc had made sure it was imbued with the strongest protective wards the Sentinels had to offer.</p><p>\u201cYou have to do something,\u201d she said, hands on her hips, her booted feet braced apart.</p><p>\u201cI am doing something. You\u2019re getting in my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to do something about Tori,\u201d she clarified. \u201cShe\u2019s slipping away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her last night. She\u2019s suffering, but she\u2019s not getting any worse. I\u2019ve done all I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is getting worse.\u201d Nika frowned in confusion, shaking her head. \u201cI can\u2019t touch her mind much anymore. She keeps me out. But sometimes, I get a glimpse of her thoughts and they\u2019re not healthy. She\u2019s consumed with thoughts of revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s good. She needs something to work toward, and while I\u2019d rather she be pushing herself to become well enough to take her place among the Theronai, I won\u2019t complain about her choice of motivation. So long as she stays motivated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour efforts to clean her blood have failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only do so much for her at a time. You have no idea how exhausting\u2014how painful\u2014it is to fight back the taint that\u2019s in her.\u201d</p><p>Nika stripped off her leather jacket and tossed it on the floor. She shoved up her sleeve and offered him her delicate, pale arm. \u201cGo ahead. Chow down.\u201d</p><p>Tynan shook his head and backed up a step. Not only would Madoc kill him\u2014again\u2014if he touched her, he didn\u2019t want her blood inside him. It would give her too much power, allowing her to see into his thoughts.</p><p>Tynan had far too many secrets to keep to let that happen. His as well as those of others he\u2019d fed from. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m on my way to meet Logan. He\u2019ll give me what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving. Not with Tori like this.\u201d</p><p>Frustration grated along his nerves. He knew better than to let it out on Nika, but the urge to vent at someone was nearly overwhelming. \u201cI\u2019ve been stuck here for days, taking care of both your sister as well as Grace, who is, by the way, much worse off than Tori. I have done everything within my power to see to it that they both recover. Logan has found a new source of power, and if you value your sister\u2019s life, you will step out of my way and let me pass.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot until you promise me you\u2019ll fix her.\u201d</p><p>Tynan had no idea what kind of control a promise like that would hold over him, so he refused. \u201cYou\u2019re only standing in the way of what you want most.

Madoc had broken it only days earlier, and it was going to take a lot longer than that for Tynan to forget.</p><p>He spun around to face the warrior. \u201cNika has decided I should take her blood rather than go out hunting for it. I was explaining to her that you would not approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe leech is right,\u201d said Madoc. \u201cHe\u2019s not getting another fucking drop of your blood, Nika.\u201d</p><p>Nika glared at Tynan. \u201cHe\u2019s leaving. Tori is still sick and he\u2019s going to walk away. We can\u2019t let him do that.\u201d</p><p>Madoc picked up her jacket and draped it over her slender shoulders. With a touch so gentle that Tynan wasn\u2019t even sure Madoc was capable of it, he lifted Nika\u2019s chin. \u201cHe\u2019s been busting his ass, love. I know you\u2019re worried. We all are, but what\u2019s wrong with Tori is going to take time to fix.\u201d</p> <p>Nika\u2019s eyes flooded with tears. \u201cShe\u2019s in pain. I have to find a way to make it stop.\u201d</p><p>Madoc pulled her against his body, wrapping his thick arms around her. He held her head against his shoulder, smoothing her hair with comforting strokes.</p><p>He looked at Tynan over Nika\u2019s head. \u201cIs there anything else you can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing left is to put her to sleep while we work on driving the Synestryn blood from her system. I offered her the option and she refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk to her about it. If she agrees, will you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I return,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cBut I need to go now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo,\u201d said Madoc. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk to Tori.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anything happens while I\u2019m away, Alexander is here at Dabyr tonight. I\u2019ll try to be back before sunrise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let anything happen,\u201d said Madoc, more to Nika than to Tynan. \u201cWe\u2019ll take good care of Tori while you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>After dinner, Hacksaw saw the blond woman dart through the swinging door that led to the kitchen. She had her coat on like she was leaving.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let her get away. The master would not be pleased if he failed to bring the woman back. Alive. He had to remind himself of that part so he didn\u2019t accidentally mess up and kill her, no matter how much easier it would be.</p><p>He didn\u2019t dare follow her out the back way for fear of being noticed. Instead he hurried through the growing crowd of stinking men, out the front, and ran around the side of the building to intercept her.</p><p>She moved between buildings fast, huddled against the cold. She had a bag slung over her shoulder, which meant he had to be cautious of weapons. She didn\u2019t look to be the sort to shoot him, but anything was possible.</p><p>The switchblade in his pocket grew cold, reminding him that it was there, waiting to be used. It had been a long time since he\u2019d killed a woman, but he could still remember how easily the knife slid into her soft skin. And that look of fear on her face had been better than any drug he\u2019d ever used.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t as good as a word of praise from the master, but it was close.</p><p>The woman turned a corner, disappearing from sight. Hacksaw hurried to catch up to her, unwilling to lose sight of her for even a minute.</p><p>She was behind buildings now\u2014out of sight of the street and passing cars. It wasn\u2019t dark yet, but that was too bad. He\u2019d have to risk attacking her in what was left of the daylight. No one was out in this cold, anyway. All he had to do was knock her out, tie her up, and drive his car back here and dump her in it. He\u2019d be back to the master in time for him to wake and see the gift Hacksaw had brought him.</p><p>The rest of the night he\u2019d spend basking in the master\u2019s praise.</p><p>A shiver of anticipation raced down his spine. He couldn\u2019t make that happen fast enough. He had to act. Now. Get the woman and get his reward.</p><p>He was only a few yards behind her now. As quietly as he could, he broke into a run.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder. Saw him. Her eyes widened with fear and she froze for a second before she sprinted away.</p><p>Hacksaw followed at a dead run.</p><p>Cold air sawed in and out of his lungs, but did nothing to cool his blood. He loved the chase. He was going to love catching her even more.</p><p>She was fast, but he was gaining on her. He\u2019d have her before she cleared the next corner.</p><p>Panic pounded through Hope\u2019s blood. The man chasing her was a killer. She could see it in the bleak, empty spots in his aura. Black surrounded them, like the rotting edge of a wound. He looked human, and maybe he was, but not completely. He\u2019d been touched by something dark and malevolent. Infected.</p><p>She sprinted, sucking in huge gulps of frigid air. Her feet slipped on the ice. She cursed herself for not calling Nicholas to come with her. It was an hour until dark. She thought she\u2019d be safe until the sun went down.</p><p>The man chasing her proved her wrong.</p><p>Hope fumbled for her cell phone. Nicholas\u2019s number was programmed on speed dial as he\u2019d insisted. Her gloves made the phone slippery, but she didn\u2019t dare take the time to strip them off.</p><p>She tried to punch Nicholas\u2019s number, but her gloves got in the way and she pressed too many buttons.</p><p>The phone bobbed in her vision and she couldn\u2019t focus on it, so she went by the feel of the buttons, hoping she remembered right.</p><p>Before she could hit send, something hard slammed into her from behind. The phone spun out of her grasp. She landed hard on the icy pavement, hitting her chin. Her teeth snapped together. Her head spun and confusion swamped her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t figure out what she was doing on the ground, especially in this cold.</p><p>Hope was flipped over. A man hovered over her. His teeth were locked together in a snarl. His bottom lip was scarred, as if someone had sliced it open and it had healed crookedly. A scraggly beard hid his jaw and a feral light burned in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cGot you,\u201d he growled at her. \u201cThe master will be pleased.\u201d</p><p>Hope didn\u2019t know who or what he was talking about. She\u2019d never seen this man before. She would have remembered his rotting aura if she had.</p><p>Blood seeped from her chin, cooling as it ran along her neck. She tried to say something that would stop him, but her mouth seemed to be frozen shut. Whether from the fall or from fear she wasn\u2019t sure, but nothing was working right. She couldn\u2019t figure out how to fix it.</p><p>The man balled up his fist. Hope realized he was going to hit her and she tried to fight him. She shoved with her arms and legs, but not fast enough. That beefy fist flew toward her. The impact registered for a split second and then everything went away.</p><p>Logan was jarred from a deep sleep. Something was wrong.</p><p>His hand jerked to the dagger sitting next to him as he prepared to defend himself. He surveyed the back of his van, looking for signs of an intruder, but there were none. He was parked inside a locked, rented storage unit, and there were no signs that sunlight had breached his hiding place.</p><p>He felt a flash of fear, followed by a sharp pain. Instantly, he knew the sensations weren\u2019t his, but belonged to someone close to him. Someone with whom he\u2019d shared blood.</p><p>Tynan? Alexander?</p><p>Logan closed his eyes and concentrated. He sought out the source of that fear, hoping to feel it again now that he was alert enough to study it.</p><p>He felt nothing.</p><p>Perhaps it was a dream? That seemed unlikely. He rarely dreamed, though he had yesterday. He\u2019d dreamed of Hope, of feeling her body tensing beneath his as she climaxed. He\u2019d dreamed of her pleasure, of the soft sounds she made and the way she\u2019d dug her fingernails into his back. He\u2019d dreamed of her taking his blood, of accepting him and claiming him for her own.</p><p>Just the memory of that dream was enough to make him painfully hard. He didn\u2019t have time to be distracted by lust. He had to determine what had woken him.</p><p>He closed his eyes, pulling his power around him. He let some of it fly out in a wave, like a ripple on a pond.</p><p>The magical disturbance bounced some of that energy back, and with it came the scent of Hope\u2019s fear.</p><p>She was being attacked.</p><p>Rage detonated deep inside him, giving his weak body strength. The sun was still up, but he refused to let that stop him. Hope needed him. He had to go to her.</p><p>He shoved his dagger into his coat pocket and briefly considered the folly of his actions. If even a single ray of sunlight touched his skin, he\u2019d summon one of the Solarc\u2019s Wardens\u2014the powerful, deadly warriors that enforced the Solarc\u2019s curse upon the Sanguinar. Not only would the Warden cut Logan down for allowing the sun to touch his skin, but it would take with it anyone else in sight. The Wardens had no emotion. They felt nothing. They were programmed to kill, and would continue to do so until they were destroyed.</p><p>He had to be careful. He had to be sure that did not happen.</p><p>Logan found his protective clothing. He covered every inch of his skin, donning a mask and gloves, then sped out of the storage facility where he\u2019d parked his van to sleep away the daylight.</p><p>The sun glared at him, as if detesting his presence. It was low on the horizon, but even so, Logan felt it draining his strength.</p><p>He concentrated on the part of Hope that was inside him, allowing it to lead him toward her. He couldn\u2019t tell how far away she was, but what he did know was she was alive and he was going to do everything in his power to make sure she stayed that way.</p><p>The van\u2019s engine screamed as he sped through the streets. He\u2019d stayed near Hope\u2019s home, unable to make himself go too far away from her. It was a silly notion to want to sleep near her, but one he\u2019d been unwilling to resist.</p><p>Her pull on him intensified, telling him he was getting close. He took a turn too fast, his van lurching over the curb as it hit. A horn behind him blared at his mistake. Not that he cared.</p><p>He sped down the side street only blocks from the shelter. This part of town was run-down, having been mostly abandoned for the brighter, cleaner parts of town.</p><p>Another hard turn brought him to a private drive that had once been delivery access for several of the surrounding buildings. Now it was a dumping ground for old couches and rusted appliances. A toppled water heater barred his path, forcing him to skid to a stop.</p><p>He rushed out of the van, following the delicate connection he had to Hope through her blood.</p><p>When he rounded the corner and saw a man loading her limp body into the trunk of a car, he realized he hadn\u2019t considered what he\u2019d do once he found her.</p><p>Rage gathered like a storm inside him. He felt it crackle along his skin. Even with the sun weakening him, feral power roared through him.</p><p>How dare someone hurt Hope? How dare they touch her, dumping her body in a trunk like so much dirty laundry?</p><p>He was silent as he approached. The car was running. The man had accessed this area via another street, giving him the ability to escape by car if Logan didn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>Logan was definitely going to stop him.</p><p>He gathered up some of his power, waiting for that bastard\u2019s hands to be off of Logan\u2019s woman. As soon as he laid her body down and stood straight, Logan struck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hurled that power out, slamming the man into the back wall of a brick building. His head hit with an audible thunk; then he crumpled to the dirty ground.</p><p>Logan hurried to the back of the car. Hope was curled up so she fit. Blood smeared over her face and neck.</p><p>Some of his rage burst free in the form of a bellow. The man who\u2019d done this to his Hope was going to die. If he hadn\u2019t already. But first he had to get her to safety.</p><p>Logan gathered her in his arms and lifted her from the trunk. He couldn\u2019t heal her easily here. He needed to touch her skin, and if he bared his, he risked summoning one of the Solarc\u2019s Wardens. If that happened, both he and Hope were dead.</p> <p>He had to get her into his van where he could tend her.</p><p>Hope\u2019s head was limp against his shoulder. He could hear her breathing and heartbeat, but he wasn\u2019t going to be satisfied until she was whole and awake, looking at him with those beautiful golden eyes.</p><p>As soon as he knew she was going to be okay, he\u2019d go back for the unconscious man lying in the trash. And drain him dry.</p><p>Logan laid Hope in the back of his van, pulled the curtain and door shut, and then removed his gloves and mask. The smell of Hope\u2019s blood caused an odd combination of anger and hunger to roil in his stomach. For now, he couldn\u2019t act on either.</p><p>He smoothed her hair away from her face and soaked up the warmth of her skin. While he would have enjoyed stroking her until she woke, he resisted the urge and focused on his task.</p> <p>He let his power slide inside her, seeking out her injuries and knitting them shut. He closed her skin, being careful not to leave behind a scar. It took more energy to work slowly, but he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of marring her perfect skin.</p><p>The small fracture in her jaw was harder to heal. But even that was nothing compared to the bruising inside her skull. He did what he could to heal her, but there was too much damage for him to finish the task as weak as he was. He made sure she was stabilized and retreated from her body.</p><p>He was shaking with effort. The sun was setting, but not down all the way. It bore down on him, sucking his strength, making every task ten times as hard.</p><p>He covered his skin again and moved to the front of the van. Nearby buildings shaded them from the last rays of sunlight, making it safe for him to open the door.</p><p>Logan went back to the human garbage lying on the ground and stared long and hard at the man who dared hurt his woman.</p><p>No. Not Logan\u2019s woman. He couldn\u2019t think of her like that. Just because he was drawn to her did not mean he could stake a claim. He had to stay objective. Distance himself.</p> <p>With her lying in the back of his van, that was an impossible task. The need to tear her attacker apart and drain him dry of blood pounded on Logan, demanding he take repayment for the injustice done to her.</p><p>Logan dragged the man deeper into the shadows and lifted his mask over his mouth. He craned the man\u2019s head back at a brutal angle and bit deep.</p><p>The taste of rotting filth filled his mouth. Logan jerked back, vomiting the tainted blood onto the ground.</p><p>Dorjan. This man was filled with Synestryn blood, protecting him from Logan\u2019s hunger.</p><p>Logan\u2019s body fought to purge him of every last bit of that vile blood. He struggled against the nausea that roiled in his stomach and the dizziness that spun his head.</p><p>The blood that flowed through that man\u2019s veins was strong. The Synestryn that had infected him was powerful. Even now, Logan could feel the demon stirring, waking. If he didn\u2019t rid himself of every last drop, the demon might be able to sense his presence, or even possibly read his thoughts.</p><p>Logan thrust up a mental wall to surround his mind. He kept his thoughts light, inconsequential. He didn\u2019t look at his surroundings or allow any other image that might identify his location to pass by his eyes.</p><p>He gathered up the tainted blood that had escaped and forced it up his throat and into his mouth. He spat the rest onto the ground. It oozed toward him, and he scrambled back, avoiding its touch.</p> <p>The man who\u2019d stolen Hope moved behind Logan, rising to his feet. Dark red blood seeped down his neck where Logan had bitten him. The man\u2019s eyes were wild, but filled with an uncanny intelligence.</p><p>\u201cI see you,\u201d said the man, though his voice echoed with an eerie hollowness.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the human who spoke. It was the voice of the Synestryn who controlled him.</p><p>Logan wasn\u2019t strong enough for a battle of wills. Not while the sun was still up. Not when Hope needed every bit of his strength to heal her.</p><p>The human lurched forward, his legs moving awkwardly as if controlled by a puppeteer.</p><p>Logan scrambled to his feet and backed away. He needed to get back to Hope and get both of them out of here.</p><p>The human moved faster than should have been possible. He dropped to a crouch and sprang at Logan, teeth bared.</p><p>Logan tried to dodge, but his body was heavy with fatigue. Both the poisoned blood and the last bit of daylight served to weaken him until he was barely able to stand upright, much less combat an attack.</p><p>The man\u2019s weight plowed into him, knocking him to the ground. Logan\u2019s head hit the pavement, and he was stunned for a second. Something cold and hard slid over his back, and it took him a moment to realize that he was being dragged across the ground.</p><p>Toward the last, dying rays of sunlight streaming between the buildings.</p><p>Logan tried to clear his head enough to figure out a way to stop his slow, deadly progress toward the light. His hands were clumsy. His mind was clouded and slow.</p><p>He remembered his spare dagger, which he\u2019d slid into his coat pocket earlier. He pulled it out and swiped at the man\u2019s arm, slicing him deep. Dark blood poured from the wound, but the man didn\u2019t slow or even show signs that he\u2019d been hit.</p><p>The human was no longer controlling his body. His master was behind the wheel.</p><p>Dirty concrete slid under Logan as he was dragged closer to the sunlight.</p><p>He stabbed again. This time his blade hit bone and stuck.</p><p>The man lifted him up with his other hand and shoved him the last few inches into the light. Sunlight hit his chin, which was bare from his earlier attempt to feed.</p><p>The air around them shuddered and groaned as a portal was ripped open. Searing light burned Logan\u2019s eyes. The ground shook and a horrible tearing sound deafened him.</p><p>The human turned and fled. Logan\u2019s dagger clattered to the ground. He scooped it up, even though he knew it would likely do no good against a Warden.</p><p>The light died down just as Logan regained his footing. He didn\u2019t dare waste even a second looking to see if one of the Solarc\u2019s enforcers had appeared. He knew one had.</p><p>And if he didn\u2019t get back to his van and drive her away, Hope would be slain.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Joseph rubbed his eyes. The headache that had become his nearly constant companion was back with a vengeance. Ever since that meeting with Andreas, it had been getting worse.</p><p>The stress of leadership was getting to him. He wasn\u2019t cut out for this job. He\u2019d never asked for it. It was just pure, dumb luck that had his people thinking he was the right choice to lead them.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t exactly worked out well.</p><p>Gilda and Angus were dead. Jackie refused to choose one of his men despite the fact that she seemed to be compatible with all of them. Whatever had happened to her in those caves had left deep scars, and Joseph had no idea if or when they would heal enough for her to take her rightful place in the war against the Synestryn.</p><p>Joseph couldn\u2019t even bring himself to ask Tori to search for her partner among the Theronai. She was still a kid, and the things she\u2019d suffered were not the kinds of things that led a woman to trust a man. Ever. She needed time to heal\u2014years of time they didn\u2019t have.</p><p>Torr\u2019s paralysis was gone, but the man refused to go out and fight. He was glued to Grace\u2019s side, watching her die slowly. There was nothing any of the Sanguinar could do to save her, and they\u2019d wasted precious resources trying.</p><p>The human women and children they\u2019d rescued from a Synestryn nest a couple of weeks ago were not adjusting well to their freedom. The kids had nightmares. One of the women had killed herself three days ago, and Tynan had suggested that more may follow in her footsteps. He\u2019d put all of them on suicide watch.</p><p>Demons were closing in around them. Some of them had human faces\u2014something Joseph knew would cause even the coldest Theronai to hesitate in battle. Their vows to protect humans ran deep and the Synestryn were using it against them.</p><p>Things were falling apart. Even with the discovery of Theronai women in the world, they\u2019d only found a few\u2014not enough to turn the tide of war. His men lost more leaves every day, putting each of them closer to death. He\u2019d had to sentence Chris to death only days ago, and he spent too much time wondering who would be next.</p><p>He had to do something\u2014anything\u2014to give his people hope.</p><p>Perhaps Andreas\u2019s offer was the key to that hope.</p><p>Joseph had talked to several of his most trusted men, along with Tynan, who spoke for all the Sanguinar. They all agreed that ending the stagnant war with the Slayers\u2014believing it wasn\u2019t a trick\u2014was a risk they had to take.</p><p>If it was a trick, at least Joseph wouldn\u2019t have to worry about his headaches anymore.</p><p>He left his office and went to the dining hall where Andreas had been spending his time, out in the open, very publicly. It was like the man was trying to make a point that he had nothing to hide, which made Joseph nervous.</p><p>Still, reports indicated that the human children were drawn to him. Madoc had even gone so far as to tell them to stay away, but as soon as his back was turned, the kids came back, begging Andreas to play a game with them.</p><p>Kids were good judges of character. They had no idea what was at stake or what Andreas was trying to do. They just knew that a new guy had come to play with them and break up some of the monotony of life at Dabyr. They weren\u2019t afraid of him.</p><p>That went a long way in Joseph\u2019s book.</p><p>He found Andreas sitting on the floor in front of a TV, playing some kind of racing video game. One of the little girls they\u2019d found in the caves with Jackie was racing him and he was doing a good job of not being obvious about letting her win.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d said Joseph.</p><p>Andreas handed his controller to another child and stood up. The children grabbed onto his legs, begging him to stay. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes. We just have a little boring grown-up stuff to do.\u201d</p><p>He extracted himself from the children and gave Joseph a level stare. \u201cI hope you have good news for me.\u201d</p><p>Joseph led him to a table at the far side of the dining area. He\u2019d spotted at least four of his men nearby, keeping watch on Andreas, and there were several more out in the courtyard, working out. If things turned ugly, help would be here in seconds.</p><p>Carmen sat only two tables away, typing on her laptop. He knew she was taking online classes, but had no idea which ones. She\u2019d hardly spoken to him since he\u2019d claimed her as his daughter, thinking he was doing so out of pity rather than honoring the memory of their fallen brother-in-arms, Thomas.</p><p>Thomas\u2019s dying wish was that Joseph claim her as kin, and Joseph was honor bound to uphold that wish. But Carmen was human. She didn\u2019t understand their ways, and had yet to come around and forgive him for doing what was right. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe she never would.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your sister?\u201d he asked. Joseph hadn\u2019t seen a single glimpse of Lyka since their arrival.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in our suite, pouting.\u201d</p><p>Joseph couldn\u2019t imagine her doing anything quite so petulant, though he could easily see her lower lip all full and begging for a kiss.</p> <p>The wayward thought shocked him and he shoved the image away, putting his head firmly in the game.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided?\u201d asked Andreas, his body tense with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cI have. I agree to a truce with your people.\u201d</p><p>Andreas blew out a long, relieved breath. \u201cThank you, Joseph. You won\u2019t regret your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast. You need to understand that our truce is in your hands. We will not attack you first. If provoked, we will defend ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Andreas thrust out his hand. \u201cGood,\u201d he said as Joseph and he shook. \u201cThat is all I ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf any of your people break this truce, there will not be another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. They won\u2019t. We want peace as much as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cYour people are prone to violence. It\u2019s in their blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is obedience. They will do as I say, or they will challenge me for the right to lead our people in a different direction.\u201d</p><p>Joseph had heard about their customs, how their leader was chosen through combat. Andreas would have had to beat dozens of challengers for the right to lead his people. Which meant he was one tough son of a bitch.</p> <p>Andreas rubbed his hands together in eagerness. \u201cExcellent. Now all we need to do is settle the formalities of our bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFormalities?\u201d</p><p>The Slayer frowned like he didn\u2019t understand why Joseph was confused. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m leaving Lyka here to guarantee my trust; now I need the same from you. Who have you chosen to come with me?\u201d</p><p>Outrage flooded Joseph\u2019s blood. His voice rose, drawing the attention of people nearby. \u201cYou want me to give you a hostage?\u201d</p><p>Carmen turned and looked at them. From behind him, Joseph heard the rasp of steel on steel as one of his men freed his sword. Apparently, his voice had carried farther than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>He held up his hand, signaling his men to stop.</p><p>\u201cThat is the way these things are done,\u201d said Andreas, as if his request was perfectly reasonable.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way we do things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI already told you that we\u2019re following the old ways. You keep my sister and I keep yours. It\u2019s a civilized tradition, and tradition is the only thing keeping peace among my people now. I would have hoped you\u2019d see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can rule however you choose. But once your traditions start involving my people, they\u2019ve gone too far. Even if I had a sister, which I don\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t send her with you.\u201d</p><p>Andreas\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cI can see my work here is not yet done. Perhaps you\u2019d allow us to stay for a while and give you time to get used to the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay here for a century and I\u2019m still not going to give you one of my people. It\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me. I get that. But I can\u2019t go back to my people empty-handed and expect them to go along with this. I can show no sign of weakness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you revoking your offer of peace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m asking you for a show of good faith. If you can\u2019t do that . . .\u201d</p><p>Carmen shoved her chair back and came to their table. She glared at Joseph, and then said to Andreas, \u201cI\u2019m his daughter. Take me.\u201d</p><p>An awful, ear-grating, tearing sound woke Hope. It sounded like a giant had ripped a Mack truck in two with its bare hands. Searing light burned her eyes, even through her closed lids. As soon as the flash faded, she forced her eyes open so she could look out of the open van doors.</p><p>The first thing she saw was Logan sprinting toward her. His gaunt face twisted in fear and his lips parted around a shouted order she couldn\u2019t understand. He was several yards away. His leather coat was flapping behind him like a cape. He held a big, bloody knife in one hand, and for a split second, she was afraid of what he\u2019d done.</p><p>And then her focus shifted to the thing behind him\u2014the thing he was running from.</p><p>It was beautiful. It gleamed with an internal light that surrounded it almost like an aura, but not quite. Shaped like a heavily muscled man, it was easily eight feet tall, made from what looked like shards of ice or crystal. It held a transparent sword in each fist, and the blades were so thin they seemed to disappear when the angle was right.</p><p>If it had been still, she would have sworn it was a work of art, perfectly sculpted into the shape of an ideal male. But it wasn\u2019t still. It moved like water, gliding over the pavement on bare feet. She could see the grime of the street through it, and was suddenly embarrassed that it was seeing her world so dirty.</p><p>There was no question that this thing was from another world. It was far too beautiful to be earthly\u2014so beautiful it made even Logan seem plain in comparison.</p><p>Hope blinked and felt tears spill onto her cheeks and cool in the frigid air.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d shouted Logan, pulling her from her trance.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d want to leave such a thing of beauty behind. It belonged in a museum or in an art gallery, on display for all to see.</p><p>And then it struck. One of its paper thin swords sliced through the air and the trailing length of Logan\u2019s leather coat was sheared off.</p><p>It was trying to kill him.</p><p>Shock trilled through her, spiking her adrenaline. Her heart kicked against her ribs, and her body broke into clumsy movement. She didn\u2019t know what she was going to do, but she had to move.</p><p>\u201cDrive!\u201d screamed Logan, his voice fading. He was only a few yards away, but she couldn\u2019t leave without him.</p><p>Hope scrambled into the driver\u2019s seat and started the engine. She felt the van bounce as Logan\u2019s weight landed in back. She put it in gear and hit the accelerator.</p><p>The tires squealed as they slipped on the icy street. The back doors of the van were still open, and in the rearview mirror she could see the crystalline man lift both of its blades to strike.</p><p>Smoke poured out of the back as the tires spun; then, finally, the van jumped forward as it gained some traction.</p><p>It was then that Hope realized that there was nowhere to go. Ahead of her stood a brick building. The alley running along it, both to her right and left, was barred with junk. The only way out was through that junk, or backward. Where the giant, armed, ice man lurked.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d she yelled as the front bumper rammed into an old water heater.</p><p>She heard Logan grunt in pain. The water heater spun sideways. The right tire went over something it shouldn\u2019t have and exploded.</p><p>Hope lost her grip on the wheel for a second, but the loss of control was long enough that they came precariously close to ramming into the brick building.</p><p>Which gave her an idea. Whatever that thing was made of\u2014glass, crystal, ice\u2014it was bound not to like being smooshed into a hard wall.</p><p>Hope spun the wheel hard, making the van screech about in a half circle. Something hit the inside wall of the van and she wondered if it was Logan\u2019s head. She winced at the thought, but held the wheel firm.</p><p>Looming in front of her, as tall as the van, was the crystalline man. His swords were raised to strike.</p><p>Time slowed. Hope gunned the engine. The thing sliced downward. Its swords ripped through the van\u2019s hood like it was tin foil. The engine died, but the van\u2019s momentum carried it into the creature, pinning it against a wall.</p><p>One of its swords snapped off, giving her hope that she might have actually defeated it. Then it held the broken stub of its sword aloft and the sounds of wind chimes and cracking ice filled the air. New crystals grew, forming a fresh blade in a matter of seconds.</p><p>A strong hand grabbed her arm. \u201cWe must go,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>He pulled her from the seat toward the back of the van. The ground beneath her shifted and she lost her balance. Logan held her up as the crystalline man kicked the van away from the wall to free itself.</p><p>Logan\u2019s grip was tight, keeping her on her feet. They jumped out and he pulled her toward the closest building.</p><p>With one hard hit from his shoulder, the locked door caved in. He pushed her inside. \u201cIt will follow. We need to find a defensible position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it have a weakness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlunt force. Lots of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rammed it into a wall with a van. If that doesn\u2019t kill it, what will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wrecking ball would be nice.\u201d Logan urged her forward into the vacant building. It smelled of sawdust and fresh paint. Shiny new cubicle walls showed that this place was being remodeled. Blue wires dangled from the ceiling and stacks of carpet tiles sat neatly in one corner. Toward the front of the building, near the lobby, the ceiling opened up to create an airy foyer. Several large windows let in what was left of the daylight.</p><p>Despite their dire situation, Hope was still impressed by the remodeling job. Sadly, it was devoid of any wrecking balls. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything like that here. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHide,\u201d he ordered. \u201cI\u2019ll hold it off while you get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>They wove through the cubicles until they found the front exit of the building. A hard vibration shook the walls.</p><p>\u201cThe Warden is here,\u201d said Logan. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you tell me how you\u2019re going to kill it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think of something.\u201d He looked up at the impressive two-story entrance. \u201cPerhaps drop something heavy on its head as it passes.\u201d</p><p>He shoved the front door open, cracking the glass with the force of breaking the lock. Then he pushed her through the opening. \u201cRun. Hide.\u201d</p><p>Logan turned his back on her, crouched, and jumped up. She saw him cling to the railing of the walkway above, and then he disappeared from sight.</p><p>Through the cracked glass, she saw a cleanly severed cubicle wall fly across the room.</p><p>As strong as Logan was, he was no match for that thing. And neither was she.</p><p>Logan waited until the last second. The Warden lumbered into view in the foyer below, its wicked blades slicing the air as it searched for prey.</p><p>A harmonic hum filled the air, the sound beautiful and deadly.</p><p>As soon as he had a clear view, Logan hefted the tile saw over the edge of the railing and tossed it at the Warden\u2019s head.</p><p>It spun around, striking out at the projectile. The saw was halved by the Warden\u2019s blade, but one of those halves struck home, taking a chunk of its shoulder with it.</p><p>The musical sound of growing crystal rose up as the Warden began to heal itself.</p><p>It looked up. Its transparent eyes fixed on Logan. A white light of recognition flared. Shards sprouted from its toes and forearms. It went to the nearest wall and began crawling up it, using those shards to dig deep and propel itself upward.</p><p>Logan backed away from the railing and darted along the catwalk.</p><p>Below, he saw a flash of movement and honey blond hair.</p><p>Hope. She\u2019d come back in to help him.</p><p>Fear and rage pooled in his stomach. With every second that passed, the sun sank farther below the horizon, giving him strength. He was a long way from his best, but he\u2019d find a way to kill that Warden and save Hope. There was no other option. He couldn\u2019t let this creature loose on a city full of unsuspecting humans. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Especially Hope. She was precious.</p><p>Logan heard footsteps behind the stairwell door. On his right, the Warden vaulted over the railing and headed for Logan at a dead run.</p><p>The stairwell door opened. \u201cHere!\u201d shouted Hope, holding the door open for his escape.</p><p>There was no time to argue. He darted through the door and grabbed her arm as he passed. He started to drag her down, but she resisted.</p> <p>\u201cUp. I have an idea.\u201d</p><p>Logan went with it, simply because fighting her would waste seconds they didn\u2019t have. He\u2019d stash her on one of the upper floors and continue on without her.</p><p>Even if he had to knock her out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll push it off the roof,\u201d she panted as they ran up the stairs.</p><p>That might work. He wasn\u2019t sure how many stories tall this building was, but it was possible the impact would kill it.</p> <p>The scream of bending metal and wind chimes rose up from below, getting closer. If they kept up this pace, the Warden would catch up with them before they reached the top of the next floor.</p><p>Logan slammed his shoulder into the door leading to the sixth floor. More signs of construction showed up here, though it hadn\u2019t progressed as far as on the first floor. The elevator shaft was easy to spot.</p><p>He ran for it and jabbed the up button, hoping it was functional. Surely, they hadn\u2019t been carrying all these construction supplies up the stairs.</p><p>Lights over the door moved as the elevator car slid toward them.</p><p>Through the window in the stairwell door one transparent eye gleamed. It saw them.</p><p>Hope stabbed the up button. He could smell her fear, and the need to protect her from it rose up in him, roaring with the need for violence.</p> <p>The stairwell door exploded inward. It flew across the room, gouging a deep scratch in the concrete floor.</p><p>Hope let out a frightened breath. \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened with a cheerful chime. Logan backed her inside with his body. He hit the button for the top floor, then the close-doors button. He waited until the doors began closing, and then darted out through the opening, knowing the Warden would come after the closest target.</p><p>The sun was down, but the last lingering glow on the horizon made everything he did harder. With his strength hampered, he was going to have only one chance to trick the Warden and shove him out through a window.</p><p>The Warden charged. Logan waited until the last second to duck behind the brick-and-steel-encased elevator shaft.</p><p>Crystal blades swung at him, lodging deep in the wall, their tips only inches from Logan\u2019s face. While the Warden struggled to pull them free, Logan sprinted to one of the large floor-to-ceiling windows. The wet street six stories down gleamed under streetlights that had just begun to flicker to life.</p><p>He picked up a drill lying nearby and swung it by the cord, smashing out the window.</p><p>The Warden freed itself and turned. It saw Logan and let out a howl that sounded like shattering glass. Its feet slipped on the floor as it gathered speed.</p> <p>Logan stood in front of the open window, his feet braced. He focused inward, collecting sparks of power as he wrung them from his blood cells.</p><p>The glow of sunset behind him seemed to burn his back, but he ignored it. There was no time for pain now.</p><p>The Warden\u2019s crystalline muscles bunched and it lunged for Logan. Logan dodged. The Warden flew out the window. Logan turned to watch it fall, to be sure it shattered on impact.</p><p>The Warden was right there, clinging to the window frame.</p><p>Logan heard its swords shatter as they hit the pavement below. Too late, he realized his mistake.</p><p>The Warden grabbed Logan\u2019s arm and hurled him out of the window.</p><p>The feeling of free fall registered as his arms and legs flailed to find purchase. There was nothing to catch himself on. He was between buildings, dropping like a stone.</p><p>Above him, he saw Hope\u2019s head peek out over the edge of the rooftop. Her eyes widened and her mouth opened around a scream of horror and loss.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>The Warden\u2019s head craned around, looking up at Hope, and through its transparent skull, Logan could see its eyes glow with the sight of its next victim.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Hope stared in shock as Logan\u2019s body fell. An unnatural wind whipped around her head, sending her hair into a frenzy. She swiped it out of her face in time to see Logan hit.</p><p>She flinched and a cry of denial was ripped from her mouth by the wind. Tears stung her eyes as she stared down, hoping for a miracle.</p><p>For a second, she thought she saw him move, but that was just wishful thinking. He couldn\u2019t have survived a fall like that.</p><p>The crystalline monster that Logan had called a Warden stuck to the side of the building like a spider. It looked up at her. Light poured from its eyes as it began climbing the wall, right for her.</p><p>Rage and grief flooded her system, making her fingers curl into fists. That thing had killed Logan. She was going to kill it.</p><p>She scanned the rooftop, searching for some kind of weapon. A pipe. A two-by-four. Something.</p><p>There was nothing up here but an air handling unit.</p><p>The Warden crawled over the edge. It had lost its swords somewhere along the way, but she could see a new growth of crystals beginning in its fists. It was growing new ones.</p><p>Hope couldn\u2019t let that happen. She had to strike now, while she could. Once it had its weapons back, it would slice her in two before she could even get close enough to kick it in the shin.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to die, but she didn\u2019t see any other choice. She had to knock it off the roof and send it careening to the pavement below.</p><p>She\u2019d catch herself at the last second if she could, but she didn\u2019t think that would be possible.</p><p>The brief ten years of her life\u2014those she could remember\u2014flashed through her mind. Of them, the brightest memories were those she\u2019d shared with Logan. She wondered if she\u2019d see him again in whatever afterlife awaited her, or if the only thing waiting was the deep black void that mirrored her forgotten past.</p><p>Either way, her decision was made. There was no time for regrets or second thoughts. The Warden had to die before it could kill anyone else.</p><p>Hope let loose all of her rage and fear, channeling it into her legs. They propelled her forward over the tarry roof. Strength poured through her limbs like it had when she\u2019d carried those men up the steps.</p><p>She screamed and jumped up, hitting the Warden in its chest.</p><p>It swiped at her, but its blades had not yet finished growing back. It missed and jerked back.</p><p>The Warden teetered. Hope threw her weight up and back, grabbing its head to throw it off balance. The slight shift worked. The Warden fell backward, the back of its knees catching on the ledge.</p><p>Its arms spun in the air as it tried to regain its balance. There was nothing to hold on to and it fell, going headfirst over the edge.</p><p>Hope scrambled to grab the ledge, but it was too late. It was too far away and getting farther with every microsecond.</p><p>Ten stories down, the ground waited for her.</p><p>\u201cLike hell!\u201d Joseph shouted at Carmen. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere with a Slayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked, her hands on her hips, her stance belligerent. \u201cIt makes perfect sense. Unless of course I don\u2019t mean enough to you to serve as a hostage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do. And you really shouldn\u2019t be offering to do something you know nothing about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople talk. It\u2019s all over Dabyr about how the Slayer brought his sister here so you knew you could trust him. It makes sense he\u2019d want the same insurance policy in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to your suite. Stay out of this. No one is going with him and that\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>A small muscle under her eye twitched, making Joseph realize his mistake too late.</p><p>\u201cFinal?\u201d she asked, her tone frighteningly calm.</p><p>Andreas stood up. \u201cI think I\u2019ll leave you two to chat.\u201d</p><p>Carmen grabbed his arm. \u201cStay. This won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>The Slayer looked down at her fingers, which were curled around his biceps. His nostrils flared and Joseph felt more than he saw a shift in Andreas\u2019s posture. His muscles tensed, as if readying for a fight. He pulled in a deep breath and shifted slightly, partially blocking her from Joseph\u2019s sight.</p><p>The Slayer was giving off huge protective vibes. As if Joseph would ever do anything to hurt Carmen.</p><p>She looked up at Joseph, seemingly unaware of the response Andreas was having to her. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here. I\u2019m suffocating with all these rules and restrictions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re for your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy safety is my responsibility, not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cThomas put your care into my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a grown woman. You can\u2019t see that.\u201d She turned to Andreas. \u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends. You act like an adult, you get treated like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better than I have here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir society isn\u2019t like ours,\u201d warned Joseph. \u201cYou may not like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re a hostage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHostage is such a loaded term,\u201d said Andreas. \u201cYou\u2019ll be our guest.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t good. Joseph had done nothing but screw things up with Carmen since she\u2019d shown up. She\u2019d had a rough life. She felt like no one had wanted her\u2014not her father, not her uncle, and now Joseph was inadvertently following in those assholes\u2019 footsteps. \u201cPlease don\u2019t go. We need you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You\u2019ve already got more screwed-up humans to take care of than you know what to do with. Let me go. I need to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho will teach you to fight if you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d said Andreas. \u201cShe\u2019ll learn alongside all the other women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d said Carmen. \u201cI already fit in better there.\u201d</p><p>Joseph hated letting her go. He was responsible for her. But he\u2019d made mistakes in dealing with her, and now he was reaping the results of those mistakes.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t let her go with Andreas, where she\u2019d at least have the Slayers to protect her, chances were she\u2019d leave anyway. Without any safety at all.</p><p>Joseph looked Andreas in the eye. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll protect her with your life.\u201d</p><p>Carmen sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d vowed Andreas.</p><p>Joseph felt the weight of his vow settle over him, giving him some comfort. It seemed only fair to offer that same comfort in return. \u201cI promise to keep your sister safe as well. She may hate living here, but she\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>Andreas nodded and offered Joseph his hand. They shook, sealing their bargain.</p><p>There would be peace among the Sentinels. At least for now.</p><p>Logan was still panting with the effort of using the wind to slow his own fall when he saw Hope and the Warden topple from the rooftop.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how he was going to find the power to save her, but he knew that he would do it or die trying.</p><p>Pain seared along his veins as he wrung every last speck of power from his blood. He felt his body shrivel and his skin sag on his frame. His bones felt brittle and he stooped under the strain.</p><p>He took one weak step toward the falling pair and reached out a hand. Wind answered his call and he sent a wedge of it toward them, shoving it between the two. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Warden\u2019s fall sped as Hope\u2019s slowed. He gritted his teeth and pushed harder, commanding the wind to obey.</p><p>A few feet away, the Warden smashed into the concrete, shattering into countless pieces. Its dying scream was deafening, smashing several windows nearby.</p><p>Hope flailed high above. Logan shoved the last dregs of his power at the wind. It pushed her up and over the ledge of the building. His vision failed and he fell to his knees. He didn\u2019t know if his aim was good, or if he\u2019d merely sent her flying over the far side of the building.</p><p>All he knew was that what he\u2019d done would cost him his life.</p> <p>His heart stuttered, then stopped. His body toppled and cold consumed him.</p><p>Hope landed hard on the rooftop. The wind was knocked from her lungs. Her head spun. She had no idea how she was alive, but she\u2019d seen Logan standing below, reaching for her.</p><p>He\u2019d saved her.</p><p>She pushed herself to her feet and stumbled to the edge of the building. Below she saw the remains of the Warden sparkling on the pavement. Next to it was Logan, lying too still.</p><p>Panic gripped her hard and she scrambled for the door. She went back the way she\u2019d come, but the elevator ride seemed to take half a year. By the time she shoved through the doors and out to Logan\u2019s side, she\u2019d had time to build up hope that he was alive.</p> <p>As soon as she saw him, shriveled and still, that hope died.</p><p>He was only a shell of the man he\u2019d been before. He looked old and dried up, as if the life had literally been wrung from him.</p><p>She fell to her knees at his side. He wasn\u2019t breathing. She felt no pulse.</p><p>Tears blurred her vision as the weight of grief tumbled down on her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let him die. Not like this.</p><p>Hope grabbed up a shard of crystal and sliced her wrist open. Blood splashed across his cheek before she managed to press the wound to his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare die,\u201d she warned him.</p><p>Blood leaked from the side of his mouth. He wasn\u2019t swallowing it.</p><p>Hope stroked his throat, trying to make it work, trying to get her blood into him.</p><p>He jerked as if a current had been sent through his body. He pulled in a deep breath. His eyes opened and he grabbed her arm, holding it to his mouth.</p><p>He drank down her blood, gulping audibly. Hope rejoiced in the sound, knowing her blood had saved him.</p><p>Weakness descended on her, but she didn\u2019t care. She wasn\u2019t going to fight him. He could take whatever he needed so long as he lived.</p><p>Her body melted, but Logan caught her before she could fall. He gathered her against his hard body and kept her warm.</p><p>Hope let go and drifted down into sleep. She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d wake again, but she hardly cared. If she died like this, she\u2019d do so feeling good.</p> <p>Krag felt the presence of the blooded woman flare into existence again. She was near Hacksaw and the Warden Krag had instructed him how to summon. Any Sanguinar foolish enough to risk daylight deserved to die.</p><p>Krag, however, was glad to know that the woman had survived. At least for now. There was no way to know if the Warden would find her and slay her, which made him impatient.</p><p>\u201cYou failed,\u201d Krag shouted into the mind of his servant, who had run in fear at the sight of the Warden.</p><p>Hope was protected. He came for her.</p><p>The Sanguinar. Of course he did. The leech would want her blood for himself.</p><p>That simply could not stand. She and her powerful blood were Krag\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cFind a way to draw her out. Find a lever that will force her to leave the side of her protector.\u201d</p><p>A lever?</p><p>The idiot human had done too many drugs and mangled his brain. \u201cFamily. Friends. Some mangy beast she lets pee on her rug. Someone or something you can use against her.\u201d</p><p>Right. A lever. I know just the one to use.</p><p>It took every scrap of willpower built over the centuries for Logan to release Hope. Her blood spread through him, renewing his strength and waking his senses. He held her close, curling his body around hers while he waited for his light-headedness to ease.</p><p>He\u2019d been only moments from death. Hope had saved him. Again.</p><p>Shards of the Warden glistened against the dirty pavement. None of them moved, proving the Solarc\u2019s servant was truly dead.</p><p>Logan lifted Hope in his arms. Her limp body felt almost insubstantial. How could something so delicate carry such strength and selflessness?</p><p>His van was destroyed, but her home was not far. He took her there, shielding her from sight of the passersby on the street. He carried her upstairs to her room, stripped her dirty clothing from her limbs, wiped away all traces of her blood, and tucked her into her bed. The sight of her in only her bra and panties sent waves of need crashing through him. He should have been too weak to even consider the carnal delights she could offer, but when it came to Hope, Logan seemed to have the boundless ability to torture himself.</p><p>There was no fireplace, so he set the bloodied cloth in a metal trash can, put it on the fire escape, and lit a fire. Sure that there were no traces of blood around to draw any Synestryn to her, he fetched a cup of water and compelled her to drink.</p><p>Perhaps he should have taken her to a human hospital, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do that, knowing how much she detested the idea. Besides, there was no way he would allow himself to be parted from her. Not now, so soon after nearly losing her.</p><p>Logan pulled the covers up to her chin to hide her lush body from sight. With that barrier in place, he allowed himself the pleasure of holding her, of knowing she was alive.</p><p>He held one hand over her heart, trying to ignore the swell of her breast so he could keep track of her pulse and breathing. Both seemed normal, which was impossible. He\u2019d taken too much blood from her, and on the heels of the other times he\u2019d fed from her, there was no way that what he\u2019d done tonight shouldn\u2019t have caused some damage.</p><p>He could find none.</p><p>Logan slid into her mind to make sure he hadn\u2019t missed some sign of distress.</p><p>She was sleeping. Dreaming.</p><p>Her consciousness reached for him as if detecting his presence. It wrapped around him, pulling him into her. He didn\u2019t fight it. If she wanted his company, it was the least he could do.</p><p>The idea that she did want his company\u2014that he could somehow ease her\u2014was a powerful feeling. It filled him with purpose and gave him hope that her sacrifice would not be a lasting one.</p><p>She let out a soft sigh of contentment, her body melting into his. Her mind shifted to a dream state, taking him along for the ride.</p><p>The chaotic swell of images made little sense, but then dreams rarely did. He glided along, skimming the surface but not allowing himself to be tugged in. As much as he\u2019d enjoy sharing dreams with her, he had work to do tonight. Hope\u2019s safety was foremost on that list, but there were other things that needed his attention. His devotion to Project Lullaby had to be absolute.</p><p>Hope\u2019s mental images morphed until she was on a beach at high noon. Logan could feel the warmth of the sun and a cool breeze on their skin. The sound of waves blocked out all others. She lounged there on the sand in her cheery yellow bathing suit, the picture of contentment and womanly perfection.</p><p>She lifted a hand to block out the light and turned to look at him. \u201cJoin me?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t supposed to be participating, but he\u2019d gone too far and allowed himself to slip deep inside her where her dreams resided.</p><p>He opened his mouth to refuse her invitation, but in the next moment, he was stripped of his clothing, lying next to her on a towel. He could almost feel what it would be like to soak up sunlight through her. It gave her strength, made her cells swell with power as if she was somehow feeding on the sun\u2019s energy.</p><p>It was such an odd feeling, Logan\u2019s mind nearly retreated from hers to figure out the puzzle. But he didn\u2019t want to leave yet. He wanted to be right here with her, where things were not real and his actions had fewer consequences.</p><p>She turned to her side and her slim fingers settled against his bare chest. The heat of them made him suck in a shocked breath. He longed to feel more of her skin on his\u2014to feel her run her hands over him as a lover might.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid of what you make me feel. My duty\u2014\u201d</p><p>She covered his mouth with her hand. \u201cShh. We\u2019re on vacation. There\u2019s no duty here.\u201d</p><p>Against his will, he kissed her fingers, his tongue flicking out to taste her skin. It was warmer here than he remembered, scented with coconut, and completely intoxicating.</p><p>She shuddered and a wicked smile curved her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re not running from me now.\u201d</p><p>He should. He knew he should, but what harm could come of indulging within her dreams? None of this was real. It was simply a complex string of chemical and electrical signals in her mind she was allowing him to witness\u2014a sort of shared hallucination. One he knew could never become reality.</p><p>Hope leaned over him, blocking out the sun. Her eyes seemed to glow with a golden light amidst the shadows of her face. He could stare into them for hours and never become bored.</p><p>But she had other ideas. She leaned down and kissed him. It was a soft kiss. Tentative. Chaste.</p><p>Logan\u2019s body did not translate it properly, and the animalistic side of him took it as a challenge. His blood heated and pounded through his veins. His heart sped and sweat broke out along his back.</p><p>He wanted more, and she was going to give it to him. Here, now, where no one would ever know.</p><p>Logan flipped her over, tucking her slim body beneath his. He liked her here, safe from harm and unable to escape. It appeased his predatory nature even as it fed it, making him want more.</p><p>Hope\u2019s fingers slid into his hair and she tugged him to her. He let her have her way, kissing her open mouth to claim the space for his own.</p><p>Ravenous need that had nothing to do with blood swelled inside him. His cock throbbed against her belly, demanding entrance into the slick heat of her body. The rub of her swimsuit angered him, so he took control of the dream long enough to rid them both of their clothing.</p><p>Her hot, naked skin against his felt better than any he\u2019d ever touched. Her nipples rubbed over his chest until she was arching into him for more. The smooth skin of her stomach, made slick by his need, stroked his erection, teasing it with a promise of more. She set his nerve endings alight, sending shivers of desire coursing through him.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she whispered, breaking their kiss. Her thighs opened, giving him room to settle between.</p><p>A deep groan rumbled in his chest as he tried to resist her invitation. It was too soon. He hadn\u2019t loved her enough yet for her to be ready.</p><p>Her hips thrust up, trying to mate them together. She grabbed his hair and forced his mouth to her throat. \u201cHere,\u201d she said.</p><p>She was asking for his bite? The idea made his entire body clench in need. He\u2019d never fed on a woman while he took her. The risk of losing control was too great.</p><p>But not here. Not in this dream where nothing was real.</p><p>Her fervent request couldn\u2019t be right, and his immediate reaction was to seek out the truth. He dove deeper into her mind, searching for some sign that he\u2019d misinterpreted.</p><p>All he found was an image of him through her eyes\u2014one too beautiful to be real\u2014and her writhing desire to be with him and feel him take her body and her blood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was no question in Logan\u2019s mind. She wanted it.</p><p>And he was going to give it to her.</p><p>He thrust any hesitance from his thoughts and let the predator in him loose. It howled in victory, and an unusual strength flooded his body. He felt muscles grow and bones harden as he pinned her hands above her head. Her amber eyes widened, and he couldn\u2019t tell if it was from fear or surprise.</p><p>Part of him didn\u2019t even care. She was his now and he was going to make the most of it.</p> <p>Need prowled through his blood, pounding in impatience. It would have been easy to shift his hips and push inside her, but more than wanting the pleasure of doing that, he wanted the pleasure of seeing her lose control. He wanted her to fall apart in his arms and scream in climax as he took her.</p><p>Logan pinned her writhing hips in place with one thigh while he brought his lips to her throat. His fangs scraped across her skin, making her suck in a breath. He teased her, kissing and nibbling his way down her throat. Her delicate collarbone intrigued him, and he licked his way across it to the hollow of her throat. Her pulse pounded hard and fast, in time with her rapid breathing.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged him, and the sound of pleading in her tone filled him with a deep satisfaction. There was no question whether she wanted him.</p><p>Logan kept her wrists pinned in one hand while he let his fingers slide down her arm. The heated silk of her skin made something dark and primitive rise up in celebration. Laid out like this for him, she was a feast. Her scent went to his head and the sound of her pounding heart and sighs of need made him feel invincible.</p><p>His pale hand cupped her breast. She arched as if trying to force him to brush over her nipple, but he resisted the urge, knowing how much better for her it would be if he made her wait for it.</p> <p>She fit into his wide palm perfectly. The pounding of her heart beneath her flesh called to him, as did her struggles to get him to comply with her wishes.</p><p>A deep yearning hunger spread through Logan, making his mouth water. He needed to know how she tasted, how her nipple felt as it beaded against his tongue. He needed to hear her sounds of pleasure as he suckled her.</p><p>Waiting became impossible. Her strength grew with each languid twist of her body.</p><p>What if she woke up before they were done?</p><p>A searing sense of desperation gripped him at the thought. This was his one and only time to be with her. Never again would he allow himself to indulge in the feel of her skin or the gasping sighs of her pleasure.</p><p>A fever overtook him, stripping him of control. He covered the tip of her breast with his mouth, soaking in her satisfied cry. He licked and suckled her while his hand stole down between their bodies.</p> <p>Her sex was slick and hot. It clenched around his finger, making Logan shake with the need to feel her around his cock.</p><p>He tried to be gentle, but his movements were rough and demanding as he pushed her thighs wide and lined up their bodies. She bathed the tip of his cock in silken heat, tempting him. He held himself back, barely resisting the urge to shove inside her until she could take no more.</p><p>Hope\u2019s hips lifted, meeting him with an urgency that neared desperation. Their bodies melded together perfectly as if they\u2019d each been made for the other.</p><p>Once again, she guided his mouth to her neck. \u201cNow, Logan. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>Which suited him just fine. Held in the snug perfection of her body, stroking every slick inch, he wasn\u2019t going to last long.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked her because he couldn\u2019t stand not to, because he couldn\u2019t stand her looking at him in revulsion, even if what he\u2019d done was only a dream.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He surged forward, sliding deep as his fangs pierced her skin. Hot blood filled his mouth, tasting of desire and pleasure. Hope moaned and clutched at his back, scoring his skin.</p> <p>Physical sensations ricocheted through his body. He was overcome by the taste of her, the scent of her. The feel of her sex gripping him as he thrust savagely into her body stole his mind. Sweet cries of building pleasure vibrated under his lips as he consumed her blood, her power.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like a normal feeding. It was more. Deeper. The two of them were connected in a way he\u2019d never allowed himself before\u2014in a way none of his kind allowed.</p><p>The thrill of the forbidden rose up inside him. He let it take over and send him crashing over the edge. He sucked hard on her throat, demanding she give up her blood. Her body clenched, every muscle locking down as a high-pitched scream of completion shattered the air. He\u2019d made her feel good. Made her come. A sense of victory rang through him. His orgasm ripped from him, forcing his hips forward, shoving his cock deep into her soft body as he let go of all control.</p><p>Hope shuddered around him, shaking as the last waves of her orgasm held her in its grip. Complete and utter satisfaction made Logan\u2019s head spin.</p><p>He closed the wound on her neck and slumped to the ground, rolling her on top of him.</p><p>The sun shone down on them, reminding him that none of this was real. That should have made him feel better, but instead, it left him feeling hollow. Empty.</p><p>All this dream had done was to make him wish for things he could never have. It gave him a taste of what he was missing with Hope\u2014of the pleasure and connection they could never share.</p><p>Logan stroked her back, lulling her dream self into a deeper sleep while he slipped from her mind and back into his own.</p><p>She was lying on top of him, draped over him as she\u2019d been in her dream. The covers were bunched around her waist, leaving the soft skin of her back naked to his touch.</p><p>His cock was aching and hard, twitching in irritation beneath his jeans. He didn\u2019t know if Hope had come during her dream, but he hadn\u2019t. Not that he deserved the release. What he\u2019d done was borderline unforgivable. If Hope\u2019s true mate ever found out about this, he could only imagine the consequences.</p><p>Logan allowed himself one single stroke of his hand on her skin before he pulled the blanket back up and slid away from her alluring body. She was even softer in real life than in the dream. Even more beautiful. He didn\u2019t know how he was going to resist her now that he\u2019d had a taste, but he had to find a way.</p><p>He only hoped that for her the dream was lost in the fog of sleep and that she didn\u2019t remember a thing.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Hope woke in her own bed, unsure of reality. First, the horrible thing with the Warden had happened, but had been too horrible to be real. And then Logan had been with her, naked and drawing exquisite pleasure from her body, too wonderful to be real.</p><p>Maybe it all had been a dream brought about by too much stress and worry over her missing friends. She needed to get up and clear her head so she could sort out reality from dreams.</p><p>She shifted slightly and felt a strong, warm arm tighten around her waist.</p><p>\u201cRest, love.\u201d Logan\u2019s deep voice was out of place in the quiet of her room.</p><p>She\u2019d never had a man in her bed before, but couldn\u2019t imagine wanting anything more than she wanted him at her side, knowing he was safe.</p><p>She turned around to face him. No lights were on, but his pale skin and eyes were easy to see in the deep shadows. She traced one finger over the dark arch of his brows and the fullness of his lips.</p><p>\u201cWas it real?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He stilled. \u201cWas what real?\u201d</p><p>With the heat of her dream shimmering through her, not even the fear of what had happened tonight could touch her. \u201cThe Warden. The attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo real. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>She was a little groggy, but it was passing more by the second. She remembered the man chasing her down, catching her. Then Logan was there. \u201cFine. How did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour blood. I\u2019ll always be able to find you.\u201d</p><p>Coming from someone else, that would have sounded creepy. Instead, she let his words comfort her, knowing he\u2019d already used his ability to save her once.</p><p>\u201cWho was he?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA Dorjan\u2014a human who subjugates himself to the Synestryn in exchange for money, power, or some other coin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he attack me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your blood.\u201d</p><p>It was one thing when Logan took her blood, but the idea of letting another do it was repulsive to her. The mere thought of it made her shiver in revulsion.</p><p>Logan reached out. His long fingers slid over her hair, tucking some of it behind her ear.</p><p>She could only imagine what a mess it was. In fact, she probably had a giant purple bruise forming on the side of her face where that man\u2014that Dorjan\u2014had punched her.</p><p>Her fingers gently pressed along her cheekbone, testing for damage. She found none.</p><p>\u201cDo you hurt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, though I should. You healed me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head in acknowledgment. \u201cThough perhaps I didn\u2019t go far enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour movements are stiff. Not at all like your usual grace.\u201d</p><p>The compliment made her smile. \u201cVery smooth, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do try to please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do please me. Even in my dreams.\u201d</p><p>A flush of embarrassment crept over his cheeks. Until now, she had no idea that vampires could blush.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I could do, considering you saved my life. Without your help tonight, that Warden would likely have killed me along with many others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let you die. I\u2014\u201d She cut herself off before she could admit her feelings for him. She wasn\u2019t entirely sure what those feelings were, but they ran through her, so deep she felt they\u2019d always be a part of her. She settled with, \u201cYou kept me from falling.\u201d</p><p>His eyes roamed over her face as if memorizing it. \u201cI\u2019ll always be there to catch you when you fall.\u201d</p><p>They were just words. She knew he didn\u2019t mean them, but hearing them was nice. Comforting. Hope had been on her own for as long as she could remember, and despite the fact that Sister Olive had taken her in, Hope had been considered an adult, responsible for herself and her actions.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you went through that. It was never my intention to see you come to harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I must insist that you allow me to see to your safety. There\u2019s a man. A powerful man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, covering his mouth, stopping what he was going to say. \u201cJust don\u2019t. Not tonight. We both nearly died.\u201d And the dream she\u2019d had of him on the beach was not the kind of thing a woman forgot. It may not have happened, but she felt changed by it all the same.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why we must speak of this. Your safety is of vital importance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is right now, this very moment. I don\u2019t want to plan for the future or discuss the possibility of more violence. I just want to celebrate our survival.\u201d And get back to that shimmering moment when he was filling her, driving her toward a pleasure too intense to be real.</p><p>\u201cCelebrate? There isn\u2019t time for such frivolity. Your safety\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m safe with you.\u201d She shed the blankets and pushed him down on the bed, straddling his hips. Until now, she hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d taken her clothes off, leaving her in only her underwear. Not that she minded that he\u2019d undressed her. It was going to make this so much easier. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan\u2019s eyes slid down her body. By the time they\u2019d started the journey back to her face, a silvery light was glowing inside those icy depths. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProving to you how healthy I am so you\u2019ll relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not healthy. I took so much blood.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to let him go down the guilt road. She had other plans. \u201cDo you have any idea how good it feels when you do that?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes closed tight as if blocking out the sight of her.</p><p>Fine. She knew how to combat that move. She lifted up the hem of his shirt and slid her hands inside, stroking his bare chest. She leaned down close to his ear and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s like being dipped in sunshine, only better. Has anyone ever done that to you? Have you ever had a woman bite you?\u201d</p><p>His body clenched, but she was set in her path. She was tired of Logan trying to hand her off to someone else. She didn\u2019t want someone else. She wanted him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, but that was okay. She could tell that regardless of whether he\u2019d allowed someone to take his blood, the idea did not repulse him. In fact, if the thick bulge of his erection was any proof, he liked the idea.</p><p>Hope shifted, sliding herself so she stroked him as she inched up his body. She kissed his jaw, his earlobe, just beneath. And then she kissed his neck, parting her lips and sucking his skin against her teeth.</p> <p>Logan\u2019s arms wrapped around her, holding her tight. A low rumble of warning vibrated in his chest, but she couldn\u2019t tell if he was warning her to stop or warning her not to.</p><p>The idea of pushing him far enough to find out the answer was too alluring to resist.</p><p>Hope nipped his hot skin. Logan let out a sound of torment that gave her pause.</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t.\u201d His voice was rough as if he\u2019d spent a week screaming.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I only want to make you feel the way you make me feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI used to think so, but not anymore. The longer I\u2019m with you, the more my preconceived notions fly out the window. The idea of tasting your blood doesn\u2019t even bother me. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>She scraped her teeth along his neck. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou belong to another.\u201d</p><p>That pissed her off. \u201cI belong to myself. If I choose to give myself to someone else, that\u2019s my business. You don\u2019t get to decide who that person is. Or isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t want you, Hope.\u201d</p><p>She ground her crotch against his erection, eliciting a groan from both of them. \u201cClearly you can. And do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s forbidden.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSex or me biting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to tell you the truth. It only makes you angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes me angry is that you actually think the truth is I belong to someone else. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will. You\u2019ll give yourself to another man and be glad we resisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you can see the future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, history. I\u2019ve seen this course of events before. You\u2019ll meet Eric. You\u2019ll fall in love with him. His rough edges will fade away and the two of you will be happy together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen it happen over and over. I cannot take that happiness away from you. Not for one night of pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming I believe you, which I don\u2019t, why can\u2019t I have both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur world is not like the humans\u2019 world. There are laws. Traditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has to know but us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll know. I\u2019ve worked for centuries to see the continuation of my race. I would give my life for you, but I can\u2019t offer theirs. I can\u2019t risk the life of a child we might conceive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m protected. I won\u2019t get pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you take my blood you might. I wouldn\u2019t have the control to fight you. I\u2019d take you. I\u2019d spill my seed inside you. You could conceive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the pill. We can go buy condoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot risk it. And any child we would have would be doomed to a life of humiliation and starvation. I will not allow it.\u201d</p><p>The thought of making a child suffer doused her lust. She scrambled away, pulling the blanket tightly around herself.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. You don\u2019t know any of that. You\u2019re just trying to frighten me.\u201d</p><p>Logan pulled his shirt down and sat up. He looked weary. Defeated. \u201cI wish I were. I wish we could have our liaison and no one would come to harm, but that\u2019s not the way our world works. That dream we shared was all we\u2019ll ever have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there? In my dreams?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThough I wish I hadn\u2019t been. It was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you were there,\u201d said Hope. \u201cIf that\u2019s all we can ever have, then it\u2019ll have to be better than nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We must finish our bargain and go our separate ways.\u201d</p><p>Wanting Logan was hard, but loving him and knowing there would never be anything between them was torture. She needed to have him out of her life before she was so deeply in love with him she\u2019d never find a way out.</p><p>She lowered her voice, unable to put any enthusiasm in the words. \u201cThe sooner, the better.\u201d</p><p>Hacksaw found the address of Hope\u2019s photography studio. The master\u2019s presence inside his mind propelled him forward, burning inside him as a punishment for his failure.</p><p>He\u2019d lost the master\u2019s woman. The bloodsucker who guarded her still lived.</p><p>But the night was young and the master\u2019s hold on Hacksaw was strong. His guidance would lead him to victory, so Hacksaw didn\u2019t even try to fight it. Not that it would do any good if he had.</p><p>A bell tinkled as he walked into the posh studio. Ornately framed portraits lined the walls. Beyond a doorway curtained in heavy, fringed fabric, he heard the sound of a woman singing.</p><p>Hacksaw parted the curtain with a dirty hand and slipped silently inside.</p><p>The woman wasn\u2019t Hope. Disappointment filled him for a moment as he watched her. She was wearing headphones, singing along with a tune that made her bounce in time with the music. She was pretty. Clean. He\u2019d seen women like this come into the master\u2019s domain and fall at his feet.</p><p>None of them were clean when they died, but the master didn\u2019t seem to mind. So long as they were obedient.</p><p>The woman hadn\u2019t noticed his presence. She was busy doing something with her hands\u2014something that involved a razor blade.</p><p>Bring her to me.</p><p>The master\u2019s voice echoed in Hacksaw\u2019s head, blocking out all other thoughts. He didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d want with her, but it didn\u2019t matter. What the master wanted, he got.</p><p>Hacksaw slipped around behind her. She didn\u2019t see him coming. He clamped a dirty hand over her nose and mouth, blocking off her air.</p><p>She yelped in shock and kicked back at him while her fingers pried at his. But Hacksaw was strong. He didn\u2019t let go. Not even when she slashed at him with that razor blade, drawing blood\u2014both his and hers.</p><p>Dark red and bright red drops splattered out across the picture of a chubby toddler.</p><p>His blood was so much darker than hers. He didn\u2019t know why that was.</p><p>The master\u2019s presence in his mind reassured him there was nothing to worry about. All was as it was supposed to be.</p><p>Hacksaw took comfort in that as he suffocated the small woman.</p><p>Her struggle slowed and finally stopped as she lost consciousness. Hacksaw didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d have before she woke, but his car was parked right outside and his trunk was ready for her body.</p><p>The master was going to be so pleased.</p><p>Logan smelled blood. Familiar blood.</p><p>He bolted from Hope\u2019s room and sprinted down the stairs to the studio below. She was right on his heels.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she demanded, her voice raised an octave in fear.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed. Fast.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait to see if she complied. He stepped into the hallway and pulled in a deep breath through his nose, smelling human blood. Tainted blood. The blood of the man who\u2019d tried to steal Hope.</p><p>Beneath that scent was a cleaner one. The blood of a human with no taint. She was blooded, but not heavily. The sour stench of her fear still lingered in the air.</p><p>Logan followed his nose to the studio\u2019s workshop. Hope was only seconds behind him.</p><p>On a large, sturdy workbench was a child\u2019s portrait spattered with blood\u2014both light and dark.</p><p>\u201cJodi,\u201d said Hope, the name filled with devastation. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jodi?\u201d</p><p>Logan followed the drops of blood out the front door and onto the sidewalk. Several congregated in a cluster at the end of an empty parking slot. He\u2019d put her in the trunk. Just like he had done to Hope.</p><p>Her hand clenched his arm. She was weaving on her feet, and despite the emergency that faced them, Hope was his primary concern.</p><p>The Dorjan knew where she lived. He\u2019d taken her roommate as leverage. Logan had to get Hope out of here. Now.</p><p>He reached around her waist and steadied her. \u201cI\u2019m going to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone. Jodi\u2019s gone. It\u2019s my fault, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You are not responsible for the choices of others.\u201d</p><p>Logan retrieved his cell phone and dialed Nicholas. \u201cI need your assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d asked Nicholas.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t safe to stay here, but he had no vehicle. It had been ruined by the Warden. \u201cThe coffee shop down the street from Hope\u2019s studio. As soon as you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nearby. It won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd can you request a team of Gerai to tow my van? We ran into some difficulties and I don\u2019t want my license plate drawing any unwanted police attention.\u201d It was something he should have thought to do before, but he\u2019d been too swept up in Hope and the shared pleasure of her dream.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cThe tracker in it will give them the location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Logan hung up and swept Hope back inside. He kept a hold on her, making sure she didn\u2019t topple over. She was swaying on her feet, moving along wherever he led without question.</p><p>She was in shock. A lot had happened tonight, and she was likely weak from the remnants of her injuries as well as feeding him. It was no wonder that she needed some time to process the situation.</p><p>He found a coat in her closet and eased it over her arms. A knit scarf went around her neck and he pulled her hood up to ward off the cold.</p><p>Her eyes were wide and shining with tears. Her mouth was tight with worry. \u201cIs he going to hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he lied.</p><p>Logan\u2019s heart ached for her and for her friend, who was no doubt terrified. If she was still alive.</p><p>He had to believe she was. Not much blood had been spilled, and what good was Jodi if she couldn\u2019t be used as a lever to pry Hope out into the open? She\u2019d be of no use to them dead.</p><p>He kept his tone gentle as he pulled her to her feet. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go meet Nicholas now. We\u2019ll figure out where Jodi went and we\u2019ll find her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was the same man who tried to take me, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is my belief.\u201d He pushed through the front doors of her studio, not bothering to lock them.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to use her as bait, isn\u2019t he?\u201d asked Hope.</p><p>She was smart, and now that the shock was wearing off, her mind was working and she had arrived at the same conclusion he had. He only wished it had taken her a bit longer\u2014that they would have been closer to rescuing Jodi before her head had cleared. The fog of shock was much easier to tolerate than stark reality.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news,\u201d he assured her. \u201cIf they intend to use her in that manner, they\u2019ll keep her alive.\u201d</p><p>Hope\u2019s knees buckled and he tightened his hold, pressing her against his body to steady her. The slight tremors shaking her frame were easy to feel, even through their winter clothing. \u201cThey can\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her, Hope. You hold on to that and all will be well. I promise.\u201d</p><p>As the weight of his vow fell on him, he realized his mistake. He should never have promised her such a thing. It was not in his power to give. But it was too late now.</p><p>He hurried her down the sidewalk, ignoring the curious stares of the few people they passed. He opened the door of the coffee shop and was immediately blasted by the smells of ground beans, cinnamon, and cocoa. His eyes watered from the intensity, but he managed to ignore it.</p> <p>Logan settled Hope at the table nearest the counter and ordered her hot chocolate. It was done by the time he\u2019d paid. He added extra sugar and used ice to cool it down. When the temperature no longer burned his mouth, he wrapped Hope\u2019s fingers around the paper cup and said, \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>The wisp of compulsion he used was slight, but he wanted no argument. She needed sustenance and fluids.</p><p>She also needed to be behind the locked gates at Dabyr. That was clear now. The Synestryn who\u2019d infected the Dorjan wanted her for some reason. It hardly mattered why. What did matter was that the demon was not likely to stop until he got what he wanted.</p><p>Logan would die before he let that happen.</p><p>Nicholas strode into the coffee shop, his scarred face grim. His black leather jacket clung to his wide shoulders. His hair was mussed from the wind and his cheeks were red from cold. The woman behind the counter gave him an uneasy look before she moved to the phone on the wall. If Nicholas noticed her mistrust, he gave no outward sign.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked, his voice quiet.</p> <p>\u201cNot here. Where are you parked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble-parked. I didn\u2019t want to wait for a spot.\u201d</p><p>Logan reached to help Hope from her chair, but stopped at the last moment, pulling himself back. Touching her was not his right, and the more he did so, the harder it became to remember that.</p><p>He looked at Nicholas. \u201cShe\u2019s weak. Shaken.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nodded and wrapped his big hand around her arm to lift her from her chair. His thick arm came around her waist, making Logan grit his teeth against a jealous cry of outrage.</p><p>He averted his eyes and Nicholas helped her into the backseat of his SUV and buckled her in. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, Hope. We\u2019re going to take good care of you.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Nicholas, her eyes bright with unshed tears. \u201cThey took Jodi. They couldn\u2019t get me so they took Jodi.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stroked her hair to soothe her. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p> <p>Logan had to unclench his fists before he could open the car door. Possessiveness was going to get him nowhere. Worse, it could exacerbate their troubles immensely. He had to stay logical and focused.</p><p>They drove away and Logan wasted no time filling Nicholas in on what had passed. The Theronai assessed the situation quickly. \u201cWe need to find Jodi before it\u2019s too late. We\u2019ll take her back by force and kill the demons who took her. But first we need to get Hope to Dabyr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d said Hope, her voice resonant with determination. \u201cJodi\u2019s my friend. She\u2019s in this mess because of me. I\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll only slow us down,\u201d said Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cThe longer we wait, the farther away they\u2019ll get. Logan can track them now, like he did the man in the warehouse.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shot him a sideways glance. \u201cThat true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I\u2019d feel better if Hope were at Dabyr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery second counts.\u201d Hope put her hand on his shoulder. Her finger inadvertently stroked his neck, making his body clench in desire. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let her die. Find her. You promised.\u201d</p><p>He had. It had been stupid, but he\u2019d made the mistake and now he had to live with it.</p><p>Logan eased the window down an inch. He hated letting the cold in to chill Hope, but there was no help for it.</p><p>He gathered some power and breathed in through his nose, seeking the scent of blood.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d asked Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cBlood hunting.\u201d His eyes cast a pale glow on the window as he eased himself into a trancelike state.</p><p>Minute particles of power wove through the air, creating faint, visible streams. Those particles seemed to be drawn to Nicholas. They bombarded him, adding to his already vast stores of energy\u2014energy that was slowly killing him.</p><p>Logan sifted through the streams, searching for the ones that matched the scent of Jodi\u2019s blood or the Dorjan who\u2019d taken her. He caught a slight glimpse and forced his mouth to move. \u201cTurn right.\u201d</p><p>Their direction shifted and two delicate strands of power came into view. He breathed in deeply, testing them to see if they were the ones he sought.</p><p>The match was true. Both Jodi and the Dorjan had gone this way. He had their trail now and it was only a matter of time before he caught them.</p><p>You\u2019re being followed by a Sanguinar.</p><p>Hacksaw heard the master\u2019s voice in his head, booming like a loudspeaker. He swerved off the side of the road, nearly hitting a mile marker.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>You cannot lead them here. Kill him.</p><p>Hacksaw didn\u2019t dare question the master. He didn\u2019t understand why the master wouldn\u2019t want the glory of slaying a Sanguinar himself, but it was not his place to talk back. Instead, he exited the highway and went down a quiet country road.</p><p>A few miles down was a turnoff on a hill that would give him an excellent view of the top. He got his machine gun from the backseat.</p><p>As soon as he saw the vampire, he\u2019d blow him away and take his corpse back to the master as a treat for his pets.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Krag split his attention between what Hacksaw was doing as well as the scene playing out before him. Two of his women had disagreed, and they were now rolling around on the floor, trying to kill each other.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know who\u2019d win. He didn\u2019t even care. The sport was enough of an amusement that he\u2019d see what he could do to enhance the experience in the future.</p><p>The brunette grabbed a chair and smashed it into the blonde\u2019s head. She stumbled back, arms flailing. When she fell, she landed wrong and something in her neck snapped.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t dead yet, but she soon would be.</p><p>He briefly considered draining her blood himself, but he preferred his meals to have a little more life in them. The blonde was of no use to him now.</p><p>He turned to the woman who\u2019d bested her. \u201cWe eat what we kill around here.\u201d</p><p>The brunette\u2019s face paled as she realized what he was demanding of her. \u201cI will feed her to your loyal servants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You will drink her blood and then I will feed you to them.\u201d He sent a compulsion to her, forcing her obedience. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>The woman sobbed as she bent over the blonde. Krag watched her struggle with her human nature for a moment before it became boring.</p><p>He closed his eyes and reached out to Hacksaw. The man was good with a gun, but there was no guarantee it would be enough. He wanted the blooded woman. He was tired of waiting.</p><p>Krag sent a mental missive to a pack of Handlers he controlled. Touching their minds made him break out into a sweat, but he\u2019d managed to give them his orders. Their excitement to be of service was unsettling in its enthusiasm. At least he knew they\u2019d be thorough and his orders had been clear: Find anyone associated with the blooded woman and burn them alive. Once she had no place to go, flushing her out of hiding would be much easier.</p><p>Hope was freezing from the inside out. Jodi was gone and it was her fault. She wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d done to cause it, but she knew that it had something to do with the black void of her forgotten past.</p><p>The auras of the men in front of her and those in the surrounding cars were too bright. They stung her eyes, nauseating her with their chaotic swirls of color. She closed her eyes and focused on the feeling of air sliding in and out of her lungs.</p><p>Too much had happened in the past few days, and she feared she wasn\u2019t strong enough to handle it. Not that she had any choice. This was her mess. Her responsibility. She had to find a way to fix things before it was too late.</p><p>Jodi.</p><p>She willed her friend to hang on and prayed that the merciful God Sister Olive had told her so much about would keep Jodi safe.</p><p>The reason for all of this was inside her somewhere, in her past. She\u2019d done something bad or angered someone along the way, and now they were taking their revenge. She had to break through that mental wall and figure out what had caused this before anyone else was hurt.</p><p>Logan was speaking quiet directions to Nicholas in the front seat. Hope kept her eyes closed and let the low sound of his voice calm her nerves. There was something about him that called to her, pushing her to try to get closer no matter how much he shoved her away.</p><p>She knew her actions were destined to cause her heartbreak, but she felt out of control and unable to stop herself from careening toward the inevitable.</p><p>For the moment, she needed to do whatever was within her control, and that meant finding a way to uncover the source of this pain she was causing others. If she knew what she\u2019d done to make this happen, maybe she could find a way to make up for it.</p><p>She moved back through her memories to the night they stopped. The first conscious thought she had was of being cold. Confusion set in swiftly and she wondered why she was there, in the dark, alone and naked.</p><p>Fear swiftly overcame the cold and confusion and she huddled, hugging herself in a futile effort to offer herself comfort. The lump in her palm drew her attention and she looked down and read the name on the wooden amulet.</p><p>She could read, which meant she\u2019d been educated. She spoke English, though Sister Olive had commented on her strange accent early on.</p><p>Hope had rid herself of it, not wanting anything to draw attention to how different she was from others. It had been almost a year before she\u2019d realized that other people didn\u2019t see auras the way she did. She\u2019d mistakenly referred to the strange color surrounding a small child once and his mother had looked at her like she was insane.</p><p>Her research had revealed that others saw auras, but she\u2019d never once had the courage to share that she did as well. Not even with one of them.</p><p>Hope pressed up against the spot where her past disappeared. She prodded at it, forcing herself to envision different scenarios, hoping one of them would feel right and click into place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was something she\u2019d done a thousand times before, using characters from books and movies to give her ideas for who she was or from where she\u2019d come.</p><p>Nothing fit. Even now, she forced herself to think of all the bad things she could have done to cause someone to hate her enough to hurt Jodi. Had she been involved in drugs? Gangs? Was she connected to organized crime?</p><p>Had she killed?</p><p>A heavy sigh of regret filled the air around her. She hoped she hadn\u2019t done any of those things, but proof was stacking up against her. There had to be someone out there who knew who she was and what she\u2019d done. Maybe it had taken them this long to find her.</p> <p>At least now she had an idea of why she wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be found. Maybe she\u2019d erased her own memories, on purpose.</p><p>A resonant hum filled her head as that idea struck a chord. She held her breath, tentatively poking at the idea.</p><p>The blank wall that had always stood there seemed to bulge inward, like someone pressing on a balloon. It was no longer rock hard and unyielding. She\u2019d found a soft spot\u2014one that said that whatever had caused her amnesia had been self-inflicted.</p><p>No. That couldn\u2019t be right. She\u2019d never do this to herself. She\u2019d never take away something so precious as her memories. Those were the things that made a person who they were. Past actions defined people. How could she have willingly given up her identity without a fight?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. She wouldn\u2019t. And yet it seemed to fit.</p> <p>A pounding headache broke out behind her eyes as she began to question the kind of person she\u2019d come to think of herself as. She wasn\u2019t the kind to give up, even when things were hard. She fought.</p><p>She\u2019d fought for years to make a place for herself. A name for herself. She\u2019d struggled for everything she had and would do so until the day she died. She created. She didn\u2019t destroy.</p><p>And yet, given the chance, she\u2019d rip apart the man who\u2019d taken her friend. She wasn\u2019t afraid of violence. She\u2019d been taught how to deal with it.</p><p>Hope stilled as that single thought broke free. She didn\u2019t remember a single lesson in fighting and yet the knowledge was there, as sure and solid as if it were part of her bones.</p><p>Someone had taught her the ways of violence, but she couldn\u2019t remember who, which led her to believe that it had happened in her past.</p><p>She pressed on that thought, being careful not to push too hard. She didn\u2019t want it to slip away. Not now. Not when she might well be given a reason to draw on those lessons in violence.</p> <p>Nothing came to her. No new thoughts. No images. No ideas. Her mind kept whirling around the question of what kind of life would she have led that would have trained her to fight and then allowed her to wipe the slate clean?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think of a single thing that made sense, and with every second that passed by, that soft spot seemed to harden again, thwarting her.</p><p>\u201cJodi\u2019s ahead,\u201d said Logan, breaking her concentration. \u201cSo is the Dorjan.\u201d</p><p>The front windshield shattered as bullets hit it, and they went sliding off the road in a violent spin.</p><p>Logan leaned to the left, ensuring that any bullet that hit Hope would at least be slowed down by going through his body first.</p><p>Nicholas made quick work of correcting their spin, then gunned the engine, charging the car from which the shot had been fired.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hit him,\u201d warned Logan. \u201cJodi is probably in the trunk, unprotected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d spat Nicholas; then he unbuckled his seat belt. The SUV skidded to a halt, and as soon as it was in park, Nicholas jumped out and drew his sword.</p> <p>\u201cStay here,\u201d said Logan. \u201cKeep low.\u201d</p><p>He slid from his seat, using the front of the SUV as cover. Another gunshot rang out and Nicholas jerked back.</p><p>He\u2019d been shot.</p><p>A scream of rage bellowed out of Nicholas as he lifted his sword and closed the distance.</p><p>Logan feared for Nicholas\u2019s life, but even more he worried about what would happen to Hope if she no longer had his sword to fight off this Dorjan and any other Synestryn who would be drawn to the scent of Nicholas\u2019s blood.</p><p>Logan darted across the frozen ground, using a burst of power to speed him. He arrived at the car only a split second before Nicholas.</p><p>Blood seeped from the Theronai\u2019s arm where the bullet had penetrated. The metallic scent of it filled his nose, making his mouth water. As rich as Nicholas\u2019s blood was, it wouldn\u2019t take long for nearby Synestryn to sense it and come running.</p><p>The Dorjan fired again, right into Nicholas\u2019s chest. The Theronai jerked back from the blow, snarling in pain. He brought his sword down, aiming for the man\u2019s hands poking out of the open window. The man jerked back at the last moment, but the blade knocked the gun from his hands.</p><p>Nicholas grabbed the man by his shirt and ripped him out through the window. His blade was in his fist, which he pulled back and struck the Dorjan with the butt of his sword. The blow landed, rattling the Dorjan\u2019s teeth. Nicholas\u2019s eyes opened wide in shock. He dropped the man and stumbled back to reveal the hilt of a knife protruding from his chest.</p><p>Logan closed the last few feet of distance as the Dorjan crumpled unconscious to the ground.</p><p>Nicholas slid down, barely catching himself on all fours. He reached for the knife.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Logan, shoving a strong compulsion into his words. \u201cDon\u2019t pull it out.\u201d</p><p>The Theronai could bleed to death before he could prevent it if that blade was removed. He knelt beside Nicholas and helped ease him to the ground.</p><p>The warrior\u2019s breathing was shallow and uneven. The sound of his heart was all wrong, telling Logan that there was a good chance the knife had hit it.</p><p>Logan was vaguely aware of a car door slamming shut. He heard footfalls quickly approaching. Hope.</p><p>He didn\u2019t dare look up at her. The horror that would surely show on her face would be too much of a distraction and right now he needed to keep his wits about him.</p><p>\u201cJodi\u2019s in the trunk. Free her. There should be duct tape in our vehicle. Restrain the Dorjan.\u201d He didn\u2019t check to see if she complied. He trusted she\u2019d do what was necessary.</p><p>Logan gathered his power and sought out the worst of Nicholas\u2019s injuries. The knife had indeed nicked his heart, but it wasn\u2019t as bad as it could have been. He grabbed the knife and slowly retracted it as he healed the wound shut from the inside out.</p><p>He blocked out the raw sounds of pain coming from Nicholas, shoving his consciousness into the other man\u2019s mind enough to hold him still while he worked. One inadvertent twitch and the damage could be fatal.</p><p>Strength fled his body as he worked. The knife was now out and the bleeding stopped, but he had two bullet wounds left to mend before he could rest.</p><p>\u201cTake what you need,\u201d said Nicholas through gritted teeth. \u201cWe have to get the women out of here. My blood . . .\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t ask if he was sure. He simply pulled Nicholas\u2019s head to the side and bit deep, drawing strength from the other man to heal his wounds.</p><p>The rush of power filled his head for a moment before he could control it and focus. He shoved the bullets out and used the quickest, most effective method of healing he could. It was also the most painful, making Nicholas\u2019s body bow off the ground in an arc of agony.</p><p>Logan hated the other man\u2019s suffering. He would have preferred more time to ease the healing process along, but they had none. His only remaining choice was to will Nicholas to sleep, which he did with a harsh, unyielding command.</p><p>He finished the healing process, then stripped all the bloody clothing from Nicholas\u2019s body, leaving him bare from the waist up. He eased Nicholas\u2019s heavy body to the passenger\u2019s seat of the SUV. With the power the Theronai\u2019s blood had given him, it was no effort.</p><p>Jodi was lying in back, unconscious. Logan laid his hand on her head and closed the wound on her hand. Her blood wasn\u2019t powerful enough to draw demons unless they were close, but he used a paper napkin to wipe away what he could.</p><p>Hope was back near the Dorjan. His car door hung open and she\u2019d taped his hands to the interior handle. Logan grabbed Nicholas\u2019s sword from the ground and handed it to her. \u201cPlease take this back to the others and wait for me in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stop this man from hurting you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill him?\u201d</p><p>Logan was riding along a thin edge, barely staying in control of the rage he wanted to let loose. He kept his voice even through a sheer act of will. \u201cThis man tried to hurt you. He abducted Jodi. He shot and stabbed Nicholas. Death is too good for him. Now go! We don\u2019t have much time before demons find us.\u201d</p><p>Hope nodded and stepped back.</p><p>Now there was no one standing between him and the man who\u2019d attacked Hope.</p><p>He pressed his hand to the man\u2019s head and then touched his thoughts.</p><p>The taint of Synestryn hit his senses, making him gag. He stomped on that reflex, forcing himself to ignore the vile touch of evil. Without any grace, he shoved his way into the other man\u2019s mind, searching it for the motivation for his attack.</p><p>His name was Leonard, but he\u2019d taken on the nickname Hacksaw as a teen. His past had been plagued by drugs and violence. He had no education to speak of, but what he lacked in schooling he made up for in dedication.</p><p>Leonard would do anything for the Synestryn named Krag, the one he referred to as the master.</p><p>The face of a Synestryn lord hovered over Leonard\u2019s thoughts, motivating every facet of his life. Krag\u2019s skin was hairless and scaly in places. His lips were so thin they were almost nonexistent, unable to hide his pointed teeth.</p><p>And despite all of that, Krag\u2019s resemblance to a human was unsettling. Like the Synestryn lord, Zillah, Krag would have been able to walk among humans in the dark and likely go unnoticed.</p><p>The fact that another creature like Zillah existed was proof of just how far Synestryn kind had gone to blend in with their prey.</p><p>Logan let the import of that news pass him by. He\u2019d consider it later, but for now he needed to finish this job and be out of this puppet\u2019s mind as fast as possible.</p><p>He passed images of other people who were in Krag\u2019s thrall. The stream of faces was impressive. The latest was a young woman with hot pink \u2013 tipped hair and matching high-tops.</p><p>Rory. Hope\u2019s missing friend.</p><p>That was not a coincidence. Logan was certain of that. Krag was somehow tied to the missing people. Maybe all of them. He couldn\u2019t be sure without descriptions, so he filed away those memories of Leonard\u2019s to ask Hope about later.</p><p>The man\u2019s vile thoughts twisted in Logan\u2019s mind, urging him to hurry.</p><p>He homed in on Leonard\u2019s thoughts of Hope. He\u2019d been sent to fetch her. He\u2019d known what she looked like, where she lived.</p><p>Which meant only one thing: So did Krag.</p><p>If Hope was being hunted, she was in deep danger. She couldn\u2019t stay here in the city. He had to get her to safety. Now, while he still could.</p><p>He shoved deep into Leonard\u2019s mind, erasing from it Nicholas\u2019s blow to his head. In its place he planted a false memory of another battle, one in which Leonard shot them all down. Hope died trying to free Jodi from the trunk, and their bodies were left alongside the road. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Creating the vivid details of the scene made Logan\u2019s stomach turn and his head pound. He could barely think of Hope in those terms\u2014dead and rotting in a ditch\u2014but he did what was necessary to protect her, no matter how disturbing he found it.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Hacksaw\u2019s head pounded. He was barely able to stay on the road long enough to drive home. His eyes kept losing focus. His arms felt weak and heavy.</p><p>He walked into the master\u2019s home, ashamed that he\u2019d failed.</p> <p>Hacksaw fell to his knees before the master\u2019s throne. He bowed his head in shame. He didn\u2019t dare look up. \u201cThe woman and her friend are dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did they die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . shot them. They tried to escape. I had no choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are their bodies?\u201d</p><p>Hacksaw looked up, startled that he hadn\u2019t considered to at least bring that much of an offering. \u201cI . . .\u201d He couldn\u2019t think of a single excuse for why he\u2019d forgotten such an obvious thing.</p><p>The master\u2019s tongue flicked out over his teeth. \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring them?\u201d</p><p>His head pounded. He was weaving on his knees, barely able to stay upright. His failure was making him sick, but he deserved every bit of suffering. \u201cNo, Master. But I\u2019ll go back and get them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d ordered the master.</p><p>Hacksaw pushed himself to his feet. He shuffled forward, his legs too heavy to lift.</p> <p>\u201cYou smell of deception. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never lie to you, Master.\u201d</p><p>The master grabbed him by the throat and dragged him forward, forcing him to look into his eyes. Hacksaw couldn\u2019t breathe, but he accepted his punishment, refusing to struggle. His life belonged to the master and he could do with it as he willed.</p><p>The master\u2019s hand pressed to the side of Hacksaw\u2019s head. He had only three fingers, but each one burned like fire. It felt like they were gouging into Hacksaw\u2019s skull, drilling into his brain.</p><p>What little light there was in the throne room began to fade. A sense of failure weighed down on Hacksaw, driving tears from his eyes.</p><p>He\u2019d displeased the master. He\u2019d been chosen and he\u2019d failed.</p><p>His legs went numb. Blood dripped down the side of his head. Images exploded in his mind only to be pulled from him.</p><p>The master shoved him away. Blood coated his fingers as if they\u2019d been dipped in it.</p> <p>Hacksaw lay crumpled on his side, unable to move.</p><p>The edges of his vision were fading, but he saw the master give a wave of permission to the demons beside him. \u201cEat him.\u201d</p><p>The demons approached, their yellow saliva glowing as it dripped from their jaws.</p><p>Hacksaw craned his neck to see past them. He wanted the master\u2019s face to be the last thing he saw before he died.</p><p>The mess Krag\u2019s minions had made of Hacksaw was impressive in its enthusiasm. Not that he minded. They\u2019d clean it up before they were finished feeding on his remains, licking every last drop of blood from the concrete floor.</p><p>Maybe he needed a rug to cover the stain. Of course that would last only until the next human failed him.</p><p>Though Hacksaw\u2019s failure hadn\u2019t been complete. The memory of the girl\u2019s death had been planted by a fucking Sanguinar, but after rummaging through Hacksaw\u2019s mind, the means to find her was also now clear.</p><p>The Sentinels would have no doubt hidden her already. Krag would have done the same thing. The trick was going to be drawing her out of hiding so he could find out what made her special\u2014why she appeared, glowing in his mind as if calling to him. Thanks to Hacksaw, he knew just how to do it.</p><p>Hope held on to Jodi\u2019s hand while Logan drove like a bat out of hell. Both Nicholas and Jodi were still unconscious, though Jodi had been making some noises that indicated she might start coming around. Nicholas wasn\u2019t so lucky. He was pale and way too still.</p><p>Hope tried to keep Jodi\u2019s head from sloshing around as Logan took the next hard turn. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Gerai house. We\u2019ll be safe here for now. We need a place to rest. And we need a place to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>His pale eyes met hers in the rearview mirror. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>Because he was focusing on not sending them flying off the road, Hope let it go. A few minutes later, they pulled up in front of a pristine home well off the main road. It was surrounded by trees, with so much land between it and every other home she couldn\u2019t even see any neighbors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll unlock the house and carry them inside. If you could see to lighting a fire, that would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used quite a bit of power tonight.\u201d He said it as if that answered her question.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll make some coffee, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Logan slipped out of the car and had the front door open in a few seconds. Hope waited until he came back for Jodi before she slipped inside and lit the fire. Everything was already laid out, ready to go. All she had to do was light the newspapers crumpled under some kindling.</p><p>By the time she had coffee brewing, Logan had settled Nicholas and Jodi in separate beds and was warming his hands by the fire.</p><p>Hope found the thermostat and kicked it up a couple of degrees, then went and sat on the couch. \u201cYou said we needed to talk.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn around when he spoke, but she could see by the rigid set of his shoulders that he wasn\u2019t pleased. \u201cI touched that man\u2019s mind. I saw what he\u2019s seen. I think I know where your friend Rory is. It\u2019s not good news.\u201d</p><p>Hope held back her worry, refusing to let it loose until she heard him out. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man, Leonard, is controlled by a Synestryn. I don\u2019t know where his nest is, but what I do know is that Leonard had recently seen a woman with dyed pink hair and bright pink high-tops. It could be someone else, but that seems a bit of a stretch.\u201d</p><p>Shock shielded Hope from that news, insulating her from the fear she knew would settle in at any moment. \u201cYou think he saw Rory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he was taking Jodi to wherever she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso likely.\u201d</p><p>For a second, she wished Logan hadn\u2019t interfered. If he hadn\u2019t, maybe they would have found Rory. Maybe. Then again, they could all have died, too.</p><p>Logan frowned as if reading her thoughts. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her. Nicholas and I will go after her as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s out of the question. Your safety is too important to risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yours isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He lifted a black brow. \u201cI have superpowers, and apart from your sudden bursts of strength, I\u2019m not aware of you having the same. Do you?\u201d</p><p>Hope almost mentioned her ability to see auras, but she wondered if Logan and his kind would want to study her or something. She couldn\u2019t afford to be locked away, kept from stopping whomever was stealing souls from the street. No one else seemed worried enough to look for them. She had to do it herself. She didn\u2019t have time for all the questions her ability would raise.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said, hoping she sounded convincing. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d</p><p>Logan pulled in a deep breath through his nose and eyed her skeptically. \u201cYou\u2019re hiding something from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, scrutinizing her. \u201cYou are. Which makes me intensely curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop worrying about me and tell me what we\u2019re going to do to get Rory and the others back.\u201d</p><p>A knowing smiled played about his lips, and the sudden desire to kiss him again had her breaking out in a sweat. Her dream of the two of them together came back hard and fast, making her thighs clench together in lust. She sat on her hands to keep them to herself and looked at a boring landscape painting on the far wall of the little house.</p><p>\u201cThere were other humans there, too. There\u2019s only one way for me to know if they are among the missing as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what way is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to let me see your thoughts, share your memories of them so I can compare those images to the ones I pulled from Leonard.\u201d</p><p>His eagerness was almost palpable, which made warning bells ring loud and clear. \u201cAssuming I let you do something like that, what\u2019s to stop you from poking around where you\u2019re not wanted to satisfy your intense curiosity?\u201d</p><p>His smile widened to victorious proportions. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d give me your word not to poke your brain into my business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear, I find you far too compelling to resist. I\u2019d never paint myself into such a corner. You\u2019re the one who raised my suspicions. You\u2019re going to have to live with the consequences of rousing my natural curiosity.\u201d</p><p>While Hope loved the idea of having him inside her again, sharing her thoughts as they had in her dream, she also wasn\u2019t sure just how much she wanted to reveal to him. She didn\u2019t want him seeing her as more of a freak than he already did. She didn\u2019t want anyone seeing that side of her.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll stick with the assumption that wherever Rory is, so are the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssumptions can be dangerous. Are you sure you don\u2019t want to reconsider?\u201d</p><p>She scooted past him and stood, putting a little distance between them in an effort to help her think clearly. \u201cWhile I appreciate you saving me, even your charm isn\u2019t enough to get me to tell you my secrets.\u201d</p><p>He rose, standing in front of her so she was right on eye level with his throat. \u201cAh. Then you do admit you have them.\u201d</p><p>For a single, crazy moment, she wanted to kiss him there, right over the steady beat pounding in his veins. \u201cI\u2019m a woman. Of course I do. That\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s mine to uncover those secrets.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas staggered into the living room, filling the wide doorway.</p><p>Logan took a long step back, looking like a kid caught stealing a cookie.</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s laser blue eyes glared in suspicion at Logan. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Hope suffered through a moment of confusion while she translated the macho-speak. Clearly, Nicholas didn\u2019t like the idea of her being close to Logan, and it appeared as though Logan agreed it was wrong as well.</p><p>The idea that two men would decide what was right or wrong regarding her made her furious. This was her life. She may not have known exactly how old she was, but she knew she was a grown woman, completely capable of making her own decisions.</p><p>She decided to let them know loud and clear she was in control of her own life.</p><p>Hope stepped closer to Logan. He backed away. She followed him until he was close to the fire with nowhere else to run.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>Logan lifted his hands to his sides so they were in plain view. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to know that, too,\u201d said Nicholas.</p><p>Hope looked at Logan\u2019s eyes, then back to his mouth. His lips were a dark red, full, beautiful. She wanted to kiss him again so much it made her shake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t,\u201d whispered Logan. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMustn\u2019t what?\u201d asked Nicholas.</p><p>Logan swallowed. \u201cThere are things you don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExplain them to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cI\u2019ll be the one to do the explaining. She\u2019s getting all sucked in by your pretty face and I can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your decision,\u201d said Hope.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not yours, either,\u201d said Logan. \u201cAny more than it is mine. Things are as they are and neither of us can alter that truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cShe\u2019s going to Dabyr. Tonight.\u201d</p><p>Hope whirled around and glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere but to a hospital with my friend.\u201d</p><p>Logan slipped out from behind her, putting the couch between them. She didn\u2019t understand his actions, but she didn\u2019t like the way he went cold whenever others were around.</p><p>He wanted her. She knew he did. She\u2019d seen proof of it more than once. She didn\u2019t understand why he kept avoiding her.</p><p>Unless he was ashamed to be attracted to her. Maybe vampires were too good for humans. Or whatever she was\u2014even they didn\u2019t seem to know for sure. What she did know was his rejection stung.</p><p>Good thing she had more important worries to distract her.</p> <p>\u201cI need to leave,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you do,\u201d said Nicholas.</p><p>Logan\u2019s lips thinned in anger. \u201cWould you prefer I stay with her? My attraction isn\u2019t exactly convenient for me, either. I\u2019d think you\u2019d be willing to keep me busy elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>The thrill that he admitted an attraction to her was steamrollered by his desire to avoid it. And her.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Whatever,\u201d said Hope. \u201cI\u2019m done dealing with you all. I\u2019m taking Jodi to a hospital. Will one of you take us? Or are you going to make me call a cab?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas was scowling at Logan, puckering his scars. Logan\u2019s face was smooth and stoic, but he was avoiding her gaze.</p><p>She reached for her cell phone only to find it missing, lost back in that alley where she\u2019d been attacked. \u201cIs there a phone in this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you somewhere safe,\u201d said Nicholas.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Jodi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJodi, too. She\u2019ll need to have her memories altered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only no, but hell no. No one is touching my friend\u2019s memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must,\u201d said Logan. \u201cAny Synestryn taint must be removed or demons could be drawn to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo kill her and eat her,\u201d added Nicholas, scowling. A bright plume of fiery anger exploded in his aura, drowning out the pain and flashes of silvery honor she\u2019d come to associate with him. \u201cThis is nonnegotiable. Logan cleans your friend\u2019s memories or she dies. Period.\u201d</p><p>Hope didn\u2019t know what to think. If Nicholas had been lying, she would have seen a hint of deception surrounding him. There had been none, which meant he was telling the truth, at least as he believed it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her to live like I have,\u201d she whispered, her eyes pleading with Logan.</p><p>His voice was gentle. \u201cIt won\u2019t be like that. I\u2019ll be careful. I\u2019ll make her think she went out drinking with friends and had a little too much. She\u2019ll wake up tomorrow and go on with her life. Safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t let that matter. I\u2019ll be as gentle as I can.\u201d</p><p>She needed a few minutes alone. These two men sucked all the oxygen out of a room. And she couldn\u2019t stand to watch the man she\u2019d grown to care about do something as despicable as erasing her friend\u2019s memories.</p><p>Hope pushed past Nicholas and went outside.</p><p>Logan had to lock his knees to keep from going after her. \u201cGo,\u201d he told Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to explain what\u2019s going on between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas ran a hand through his hair in frustration. \u201cI\u2019m used to women tripping over their tongues when you\u2019re around, but I\u2019ve never once seen you do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go. She\u2019s not even wearing a coat.\u201d</p><p>The Theronai stared at Logan for a long second. \u201cShe\u2019s not a Theronai, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe so, but that could simply be a case of wishful thinking.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas closed his eyes and let out a long breath, as if he\u2019d come to a hard decision. \u201cYou go and I\u2019ll watch Jodi. Hope trusts you, as foolish as that may be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround her, I don\u2019t trust myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019d hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go. Calm her down so we can gain her cooperation. It\u2019s the only way to ensure her safety in the long run.\u201d</p><p>Logan knew it was a mistake, that he was tempting himself with something he could never have. Still, his feet moved toward the door and carried him out into the night.</p><p>Finding Hope was easy. Even blinded, even without her blood flowing through him, he\u2019d be able to find her by scent alone. No other woman called to him like she did. It may have been a cruel twist of fate, but that didn\u2019t change how he felt.</p><p>She was sitting on the porch steps, hugging her knees, shivering.</p><p>Logan stripped out of his coat and draped it over her shoulders before moving away. He didn\u2019t dare stay within reach of her. Not because of what she might do, but because of what he wanted to do.</p><p>Cold air slid around him, but he barely felt it. Not with her this close. She seemed to drive the chill away by her mere presence.</p><p>\u201cWill you come back inside?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to distract the two of you from your plans to control our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Hope. We only want you to be safe.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Moonlight gleamed off her pale hair. \u201cThat man came after me for some reason. Maybe he knows who I am. What I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently it does to you. And Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis kind are desperate. It\u2019s his pain that makes him possessive. You can understand that, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just trying to manipulate me. Again.\u201d</p><p>She was right. He spent so much time manipulating others he barely even realized he was doing it. \u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. You don\u2019t really mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, Hope. Tell me how I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want Rory and the others found. I want the monsters who took them stopped. I want Jodi safe and happy. And I want my memories back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already working on the first two. The last will take more time, but it is possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that. You\u2019re just telling me what I want to hear so I\u2019ll play along.\u201d</p><p>Was she right? Was he fooling himself into thinking he could help her so he\u2019d feel less guilty over forever altering the course of her life?</p><p>\u201cWe could try now,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cTry what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccessing your memories again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He wanted this for her, but she was so skeptical right now. He needed her to let down her guard, and the only time she did that was when he got close enough to distract her and slip past her defenses.</p><p>\u201cCome, we\u2019ll get out of the wind and find some quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go inside. It\u2019s too . . . crowded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d He reached out his hands to her.</p><p>Hope looked at his hands, then back to his face. Her shoulders slumped on a sigh of defeat and she put her fingers in his.</p><p>They were cold, and the need to see her warm and safe brought out a dangerous, feral side of him.</p><p>He\u2019d kill to see to this woman\u2019s comfort. Or worse.</p><p>If the man she ended up with did not treat her right, Logan wouldn\u2019t hesitate to tear his mind to shreds until even her slightest whim was a compulsion he couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>It was the ultimate form of evil to take away someone\u2019s free will, to strip them of what made them human and destroy it. It was what the Synestryn did to their Dorjan. And yet if the options were to go against everything he held sacred or watch Hope suffer, he knew which he\u2019d choose. Without hesitation.</p><p>Logan shoved those bleak thoughts from his mind and led her to a nearby barn. The structure was showing its age. Some of the boards had rotted out near the ground, and the dingy white paint was peeling. The doors were unlocked. He turned on the lights so she could see, but only one was working. The bare bulb hung from a wire near the back, barely bright enough to illuminate all four corners.</p><p>The interior was empty but for a few sacks of grass seed, a lawn mower, and lawn furniture that had been stored for the winter. It smelled of gasoline and the hay that had once been stored here, but without the wind, it was definitely warmer than outside.</p><p>He unfolded a lounge chair, retrieved the thick cushions from their plastic storage bin, and made her a comfortable place to lie. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like this is a couch at a psychiatrist\u2019s office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does that make you feel?\u201d he joked.</p><p>A smile pulled at her soft lips, and a glow of satisfaction radiated from his core, warming him. He\u2019d made her smile. Surely that was as close as he\u2019d ever get to having the sun warm his skin, and if so, he\u2019d count himself lucky to have come this close.</p><p>Hope took his coat from her shoulders and handed it to him. He was sure she\u2019d meant to give it back, but as soon as she was settled, he draped the leather over her like a blanket.</p><p>He did not miss the shiver that coursed through her, though he couldn\u2019t tell whether it was from the cold, regaining the warmth of his coat, or from fear.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI want to. Something changed tonight as we were searching for Jodi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanged?\u201d</p><p>She frowned and shook her head. \u201cI felt a kind of soft spot in the barrier to my memories when something struck a chord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed together as if she wasn\u2019t going to tell him.</p><p>Logan sat down beside her and took her hand. There wasn\u2019t much space on the lounge chair, but that only gave him a reason to touch her, to press his thigh to hers. He knew their time together was drawing to a close, and he wanted to take from it what he could for as long as he could.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he urged her. \u201cIt could help.\u201d</p><p>She pulled in a deep breath, but when she spoke, she did not meet his gaze. Her amber eyes were fixed firmly on the opposite wall. \u201cI thought that if I remembered, we might know why Jodi was taken or where she\u2019d gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would that have helped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese things that have been happening\u2014the people that are going missing\u2014are all connected to me. None of the other shelters are suffering the same problem. Just ours. That could have connected to anyone at the shelter, but then Jodi was taken. She doesn\u2019t go there, which means that the common connection was me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cupped her chin and turned her head until she was looking at him. He needed her to see the truth in his eyes. \u201cThis is not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The choices these monsters make are theirs alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? For all we know, I worked with them. Hell, maybe I even ran the whole damn group.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s simply not possible. I would have felt their taint upon you, tasted it in your blood. All I taste in you is purity and light. You\u2019re a good person, Hope. Don\u2019t allow yourself to think otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet to say it. I really do want to believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do. I swear I\u2019m being honest.\u201d</p><p>She gave a small nod, though he wasn\u2019t sure if she was relenting or simply moving on. \u201cI may not have worked for them, but I\u2019m still the cause of all of this. Somehow. And there\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I might have allowed someone to take my memories. I might have even done it to myself.\u201d</p><p>Logan tried not to let any of his shock show through. He slid his hand down her arm until he was holding her chilly fingers within his own to warm them. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It just feels . . . right. I don\u2019t think my memory loss was due to trauma. I think it was done on purpose.\u201d</p><p>That changed everything. If someone had done this to her, there had to be a reason. And the list of reasons why someone would steal another\u2019s memory wasn\u2019t very long. Either they were protecting her or they were protecting themselves.</p><p>Logan was going to find out which one, because if it was the latter, things were much more desperate than even he had thought.</p><p>He leaned forward and his fingers settled lightly at her temple. Her skin was so soft and warm, he forgot why he was touching her for a brief moment. He could spend all night touching her, learning the different textures of her skin and the sounds she made as he stroked each one.</p> <p>No. That was not for him\u2014not outside of dreams. He couldn\u2019t allow himself to think like that. Down that path lay starvation.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes, Hope. I want you to relax and let me inside.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Tori tensed as the footsteps grew louder. She dragged herself out from under the bed and scurried under the covers to pretend she\u2019d been there all along.</p><p>People looked at her funny when she was under the bed, like she didn\u2019t belong there. It made them come back with more people to help her\u2014something she wanted to avoid. She didn\u2019t need people. All she needed was a plan. A good plan. One that would earn her the sight of Zillah\u2019s blood draining from his body.</p><p>Nika walked in with her grumpy boyfriend only a few steps behind her. Tori didn\u2019t like having them visit. She owed them her life for rescuing her, but she wished they\u2019d just leave her alone.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d said Nika as she sat on the edge of the bed.</p><p>Tori had grown to hate that word. Every time someone said they wanted to talk, it meant they wanted her to do something she didn\u2019t want.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, hoping to get this over with.</p><p>\u201cTynan thought of something we can do to help you.\u201d She pulled in a deep breath. Madoc laid his giant hand on her shoulder, making Tori flinch. Even the thought of a man touching her like that made her want to puke.</p><p>Tori shifted away from the pair, moving to the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cHe says that he can put you to sleep while he heals you. That way, you won\u2019t have to hurt. You can go to sleep and when you wake up, you\u2019ll be all better.\u201d</p><p>Liar! screamed a voice in her head. She had to fight back the urge to scream it at her sister.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to sleep.\u201d Zillah crawled into her dreams when she slept. She could feel his slimy touch on her thoughts, forcing her to remember the things he\u2019d done to her. She didn\u2019t want to remember, and if she was forced to sleep, she\u2019d be trapped there with him with no way to escape.</p><p>She\u2019d spent years as his prisoner. He wasn\u2019t stealing another second of her life.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re hurting so much,\u201d said Nika.</p><p>Anger swirled deep inside her, making her muscles clench against the need for violence. Her heart was pounding hard, driving infected blood through her body, readying it for action. She knotted her fingers together to keep from lashing out at her sister. \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone telling me how much I hurt. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so do I. We\u2019re linked, no matter how much you fight to keep me out.\u201d</p><p>Tori wrapped her arms around her knees. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in my head. I wish you\u2019d quit trying to put your nose in my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. You\u2019re my sister. I have to find a way to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen leave me alone. Quit coming here. Quit shoving your thoughts in mine. Just go away.\u201d</p><p>Nika rocked back as if Tori had hit her. It made Tori feel bad, but only for a second. Then all she felt was anger. The constant, pulsing anger she\u2019d grown so used to. It was always with her, growing every day. One day, she\u2019d kill Zillah and it would all go away, but until then, she needed that anger to keep her going\u2014to help her fight the pain of the poisonous blood flowing through her veins.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you,\u201d said Nika. \u201cI promised you that years ago, the night you were stolen. I meant it then and I still mean it now. You can\u2019t make me go away.\u201d</p><p>She could. She\u2019d learned lots of ways to kill in the years she\u2019d spent with the Synestryn. And when the rage inside her got bad enough, all she wanted was to lash out at whoever was nearby. She didn\u2019t care who it was or what happened to them. Andra knew it. So did Madoc. That was why they never let Nika come in here alone.</p><p>Tori looked at Madoc, fighting down that rage. She remembered the gift he\u2019d given her while she was still imprisoned\u2014the gift of sunshine. Because of that gift, she offered him one now. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see her again. If you love her, don\u2019t let her come back here.\u201d</p><p>Hope was as beautiful inside as she was out. Being inside her mind was like Logan imagined bathing in sunshine would be. Warm. Soft. Gentle. He could live here forever and never grow bored.</p><p>He slid along her thoughts with ease, but it was different from being inside a human. The connection he felt to her was stronger and took less effort to sustain. There were no convoluted paths of logic he had to overcome, or flittering distractions that led him in the wrong direction. With Hope, sharing the same mental space was easy.</p><p>Perhaps this was what it felt like when mated Theronai connected.</p><p>Before that thought could bloom into something dangerous, Logan pushed forward, heading right to where her amnesia began.</p><p>\u201cShow me this soft spot,\u201d he whispered to her, though whether his mouth moved, he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Hope wrapped around his consciousness to guide him, and the instant she did, everything else ceased to exist. He was surrounded by light and joy, bathed in it. Time no longer mattered. His body could have shriveled and died and he would not have mourned the loss. This place or feeling\u2014whatever it was\u2014was magic, pure, perfect magic.</p><p>\u201cDid you feel that?\u201d she asked him. Her voice swept through him, shimmering along his nerve endings as it passed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d was all he could manage.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never felt it before with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay close. It could be some kind of trick, like a booby trap.\u201d</p><p>Confusion flittered across him for a brief second. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause nothing that feels that good can be real. It must be some kind of trick.\u201d</p><p>Logan questioned her logic, but kept it to himself. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful. Show me.\u201d</p><p>Hope guided him along her thoughts, taking him with her on the chain of logic that had led her to the soft spot.</p><p>There. He sensed what she\u2019d felt earlier\u2014a kind of dent in an otherwise pristine plane of do-not-pass.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t there before,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt happened when I thought about how I might have allowed someone to take my memories. I can\u2019t imagine ever letting that happen, but this seems to be proof that I might have.\u201d</p><p>Logan prodded the spot and instantly felt a stab of pain vibrate through Hope. He pulled back, fighting against an instant flare of anger at himself. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>He was still connected to her mind, but his eyes opened so he could scan her body as well. She\u2019d pulled her knees up as if someone had punched her in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just a tender spot, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t touch it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want you to. I want you to see if this is a way into my memories.\u201d</p><p>The idea of causing her more pain repulsed him. She must have felt it, because in the next instant, she was stroking over his consciousness as if to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Logan. I don\u2019t care if it hurts. I need to know what I did to cause these people harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. Maybe I didn\u2019t do it on purpose. Maybe this is all about someone I know who\u2019s holding a grudge\u2014someone I can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>She could be right. If she recognized Krag, it could create another soft spot, or perhaps break through the one she\u2019d found.</p><p>He took the image from Leonard\u2019s mind\u2014the one of the Synestryn lord with scaly, hairless skin and lips that did not cover his pointed teeth\u2014and showed it to Hope.</p><p>She recoiled in revulsion, but there was no flash of recognition he could sense. \u201cHave you seen him before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSynestryn. He\u2019s the beast who ordered Leonard to hurt you, to abduct Jodi.\u201d</p><p>He felt her take the image deeper, dragging it inside her mind where she turned it over and ran it along the barrier to her past. There was no reaction, no dent formed.</p><p>Her sense of defeat hit him hard. His immediate reaction was to wipe it away\u2014to blunt the emotion artificially, but he doubted she\u2019d appreciate his help. Instead, he wrapped himself around her and offered her what reassurance he could.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to get back what you\u2019ve lost. I promise.\u201d The weight that settled over him as he gave his vow wasn\u2019t heavy. It was comforting. Given freely, without any thought of repayment, it reminded him of the man he used to be\u2014the one he wished he could be again.</p><p>That man would have been good enough for a woman like Hope.</p><p>\u201cI like the man you are now,\u201d she told him, her words fervent and heartfelt. \u201cThe fact that you wish you could do more counts for a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly enough. My weakness is shameful.\u201d</p><p>He felt her hand on his skin and pulled back into his body enough to revel in her touch. Until now, he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d draped his body over hers at some point in his effort to comfort her. His arms were wrapped around her tightly, and her legs were hanging from the sides of the lounge chair to allow room for his body between her thighs.</p><p>Instantly, his cock swelled and hardened, painful in its haste to be ready for her. Pressed against her belly like this, there was no way to mask her effect on him\u2014no way to hide his desire for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her golden eyes glowed with womanly need. \u201cYou aren\u2019t weak. It\u2019s not your fault that you don\u2019t have the strength to do what you want. Except when you take my blood.\u201d</p><p>The mere mention made his mouth water and his hips kick forward against his will. The smell of her skin was intoxicating, but it was the scent of her growing arousal that pushed him to the limit of control.</p><p>She tilted her head aside, stretching her elegant neck, tempting him. \u201cYou can do it again if you want. I like it. A lot.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s body clenched, his muscles knotted against the need for him to hold perfectly still. If he so much as breathed, he knew his self-control would give in and he\u2019d take what she offered. \u201cI cannot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel fine. You\u2019re not as hard on me as you think.\u201d She reached between their bodies and rubbed her palm over his erection. \u201cExcept here.\u201d</p><p>He pulled in a deep breath, hoping it would cool down the inferno raging inside him. She was so beautiful laid out like this, open and trusting. Her skin glowed in the dim light and the gold of her eyes seemed to brighten as they moved to his mouth.</p><p>She was going to kiss him. He could feel her muscles tensing to move, to lift her head forward toward his. Her lips parted and she pulled in the air that he breathed out. Heat swirled between them. He could feel it fighting back the chill surrounding them. Her pupils dilated and her tongue swept out to wet her bottom lip.</p><p>He needed to get up\u2014to push himself away from her. He gathered his power to shove himself back, not caring if he slammed into the rotting barn wall. He\u2019d take an injury over betraying her.</p><p>And if he took her, it would be a betrayal. She didn\u2019t realize that now, but once she was settled with the man meant for her, she\u2019d see that he\u2019d used her for his pleasure, that he knew there could never be anything more between them than a few shared moments of physical bliss.</p> <p>But after so many years of famine, he wanted the feast. He wanted to feel the slide of skin on skin, the damp heat of shivering lust as it overtook a woman. He wanted to hear her soft moans of pleasure and strive to make them louder. But most of all, he wanted to find a way to be closer to her, to make her feel good. Safe. Loved.</p><p>He could love a woman like Hope. Part of him already did, which was all the more reason to hold himself back.</p><p>She wrapped her hand around his nape and pulled him down, meeting him halfway. The touch of her lips to his was electric. Every rational thought in his head shorted out and in that space was the ravenous need to possess something he so desperately wanted.</p><p>Her tongue swept inside his mouth, playing along his teeth until she found one of his fangs. Her sigh of need filled his lungs, and he drank it in, greedy for more. His stomach tightened and his cock jerked against her belly, desperate to be closer.</p><p>He was lost, and while part of him screamed in defiance at his weakness, the rest of him was cheering in a roaring scream of encouragement.</p><p>Logan ripped the leather coat from between their bodies and kissed Hope back like she deserved. He shoved her shirt up and caressed the smooth skin over her stomach and ribs. She pushed him up, using more strength than he would have thought possible.</p> <p>Not that he\u2019d let her shove him away now. Not anymore.</p><p>He pulled his mouth from hers to tell her it was too late to change her mind, but from the flush of desire painting her cheeks, that wasn\u2019t what she had in mind. Instead, she stripped her shirt over her head and shed her bra, baring herself to him. Her eyes dared him to stop her from getting what she wanted.</p><p>Logan stared down at her, reveling in her beauty. She was exquisitely formed, perfectly curved. Her dream self did not do her justice. Her nipples were hard and cherry red. A pink flush spread down her neck over her chest. As he watched, she reached for the button on her jeans.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing this,\u201d she warned him, her tone fierce and demanding.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he found her assumption more amusing or alluring. Either way, he was along for the ride. He could barely speak, but he managed to push out a rough, \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Her smile of approval drove the breath from his body with the sheer power of her beauty. To possess something as perfect and potent as she was seemed too good to be true. His actions didn\u2019t merit such a reward and yet he was going to take it, nonetheless.</p><p>Her hands slid up his ribs, shoving his shirt up as they went. He stripped the fabric from his body, not wanting anything to get in the way of her touch.</p><p>Her nails dug into his skin, scraping just hard enough to send a shiver up his spine.</p> <p>\u201cThe jeans,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>He obliged, stripping hers off before seeing to his own.</p><p>She lounged, one leg dangling over the side of the chair. The slim lines of her body had a perfectness of symmetry he\u2019d never seen before in a human. Her hips flared just enough to fit his hands, before tapering to long, smooth legs. Faint tan lines marked her skin, and he stroked a finger over them, intrigued by the marks the sun had left upon her.</p><p>What he wouldn\u2019t give to lie in the sun with her and make love, drinking in its warmth.</p><p>It was a fantasy that could never be, but he found himself hoping despite all logic. After all, if Hope was here, sharing her body with him, then anything seemed possible.</p><p>He tossed another cushion onto the floor and draped his coat across it to form their bed. \u201cIf I take you on that flimsy thing, we\u2019re both going to end up on the ground, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She lifted a brow in challenge. \u201cTake me? That sounds awfully barbaric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt fits my mood, then.\u201d</p><p>She rose from the chair, naked and glorious. She didn\u2019t try to hide from his sight, or strike any artificial poses. She needed no such artifice. Hope was perfect as she was.</p><p>He took her hand and eased her to the cushion, ensuring her comfort before he perched along the edge. A chill roughened her arms, and before he considered the consequences, he rolled atop her to cover her body with his.</p><p>The skin on skin contact was too much sensation. It stole his breath and made his heart pound in his chest. His head spun at the feel of her hard little nipples and the slide of her legs along his own.</p><p>She speared her fingers through his hair and brought his head down for a kiss.</p><p>He\u2019d meant to be gentle. Slow and careful. But as soon as her lips touched his, thoughts vanished. The man in him gave way to the more feral part of him\u2014the baser part of him. A sweet wooing was no longer an option. He needed her. He needed to be inside her and drive as much pleasure from her body as she could stand. He needed to fill her up and claim her for his own so no other man would ever dare to touch her. Only him.</p><p>The thought gave him pause, but he brushed it aside, refusing to let anything come in the way of what she offered.</p><p>Logan pulled his mouth from hers. She tried to follow him up, but he had other ideas, other needs. He laid his hand across the center of her collarbone to hold her still while he kissed his way from her shoulder down to her breast. He took her nipple into his mouth, dragging his fangs across it in a way that made her gasp and lift toward him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed out, grabbing and holding his head in place. \u201cJust like that.\u201d</p><p>Logan suckled her hard, then eased up, swirling his tongue over her to ease away the sting. Every time his teeth grazed her, her body tightened in anticipation.</p><p>He knew what she wanted. He could feel her need shimmering between them. She wanted his bite and the pleasure it could bring.</p><p>He refused. He\u2019d already lost enough of himself coming this far. If he went any farther, he might never be able to return. And she would be the one who suffered\u2014something he simply could not allow.</p><p>Her fingernails bit into his scalp. She slid her ankle up his flank, wrapping her leg around the small of his back. The move opened her so that his manhood nudged the wet heat of her core. And then she started pulling, using her leg to urge him closer.</p><p>Against his will, his hips shifted, gliding the slippery tip of his cock along her folds. There was still time to turn back. Somewhere deep in his mind, part of him was screaming for him to stop this before it was too late.</p><p>She reached between them and wrapped her fingers around him, giving him a long, hard stroke. Her fingers slid over him, lining up their bodies. One hard tug from her leg and he slid a couple of inches inside her core.</p><p>There was no place he wanted to be more than right here, right now. Despite his reservations, the perfection of the two of them like this, joining together, was simply too much to deny.</p><p>Hope held her breath and became still. He reached out for her, searching for signs of pain. He brushed against her mind, intending only to seek out what was causing her distress, and too late realized the folly of that plan.</p><p>She was writhing with need. Her body ached to be filled. Lust was a tangible thing inside her, demanding and insistent. It gripped her belly and twisted, making her desperate. Her skin sizzled with sensation, each nerve ending pushed to its limits. And the emptiness churning within her reminded him all too keenly of what it was like to need blood. It was more than merely a want, and he could not stand her suffering.</p><p>Her body was tight, but he pushed forward, needing to fill the ache and ease her suffering. She was slick and hot, accepting each small thrust as he worked his way inside her sweet body.</p><p>She twisted beneath him, trying to help ease his way and join them more quickly. He held himself back only enough to prevent her any discomfort and refused to let her hurry him.</p><p>Finally, only when he was seated inside her, the tip of his erection nudging her womb, did she subside. The need was still there, but it had shifted, morphing into something else. Something darker and more taboo.</p><p>Taking her body was not nearly enough. She wanted him to take her blood as well.</p><p>The image of it burned bright in her thoughts as if she\u2019d spent hours fantasizing about it. Every detail was laid out before him, from the way his muscles clenched as he moved within her to her firm hold on his head as he fed from her throat.</p><p>Logan tried to pull back to rid himself of the tempting image, but it was with him now, part of him as much as her blood flowing through his veins was a part of him. Forever.</p><p>Her sheath clenched and he sucked in a breath. Stillness was no longer an option.</p><p>He pulled from her, feeling her slickness easing the way. Her body had accepted his invasion, making room for him to push deep without causing her pain.</p><p>Part of him still hovered inside her thoughts, gauging her reaction. It didn\u2019t take long for him to perfect his angle and technique to bring her the most pleasure with every stroke.</p><p>His nerve endings felt like they were glowing. Sweat formed on his back only to evaporate in the cool, dry air. Her nipples grazed his chest, sending zingers of sensation to the base of his shaft. Small muscles inside her quivered around his erection, making it hard for him to concentrate. He tried to keep his wits so he could bring her the most pleasure, but his own was too great to ignore.</p><p>With each thrust, he lost a little more sanity, a little more reason. All that mattered was the sound of her increasingly loud sighs and the hard, steady pace of their mating bodies.</p><p>Hope kissed him, taking his breath away with her enthusiasm. Her lips were swollen and wet from his mouth. The growing scent of her arousal made his head spin. She was close. He could feel it in the way her body was winding up, tightening with the impending explosion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan wanted nothing more than to give her the pleasure of climax and to feel that climax flutter along his cock as he filled her with his seed. Nothing else was important now. Only Hope.</p><p>He would give her anything she needed to see her fulfilled.</p><p>Anything? he heard her voice whisper within his mind. And the image of his mouth working at her throat while his hips worked to drive her higher flashed in his mind\u2019s eye, brilliant and clear and forbidden.</p><p>He opened his mouth to tell her that he couldn\u2019t, but her lips covered his, and her tongue thrust inside to flick across his fangs.</p> <p>She wanted it. The idea compelled her, consumed her.</p><p>Hope guided his head to her neck. The slender length arched, giving him unhindered access. Beneath her delicate skin, her pulse pounded hard and fast. Steady and strong.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t too weak. He would have sensed it if she had been. He didn\u2019t understand how that was possible considering how much he\u2019d fed from her, but it was true all the same.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d she whispered, breathless with anticipation. \u201cBite me. Just a little.\u201d</p><p>There was no little about this. If he bit her, he\u2019d lose control. He knew he would. He was nearly already at his limit just thinking about it.</p> <p>Her grip was strong. It forced his mouth against her skin. He couldn\u2019t help but kiss her. She was so smooth and soft. She tasted so good.</p><p>His fangs ached. His tongue felt swollen. There wasn\u2019t enough oxygen to fill his lungs as his body thrust, keeping up the pace she liked best\u2014one that had him fighting to stave off his own release for as long as possible. With each deep plunge, she quivered around him as if her body were trying to hold him inside.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to feel it all. Just once.\u201d</p><p>He could deny her nothing. Even if it was forbidden. Even if he knew he might never recover from the stain on his conscience.</p><p>His fangs grazed her skin. She let out a soft gasp and shivered.</p><p>He promised himself he\u2019d be careful. He wouldn\u2019t bite deep. Just enough to fulfill her fantasy.</p> <p>Logan took charge of her body, holding her tight so she couldn\u2019t thwart his plans to stay in control. Her sudden bursts of strength were unpredictable, and one of those could put all of them in danger.</p><p>It took only one spilled drop of blood to bring an entire nest of Synestryn down on them.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t spill any. He\u2019d swallow it all down, staying sealed to her throat until every trace of scent was licked clean.</p><p>Her hips bucked as she struggled to make him hurry. Her impatience shimmered in the air, but he wasn\u2019t going to let it alter his course.</p><p>Logan thrust deep, pinning her in place with his weight and his cock. He felt an answering quiver inside her and a hot rush of wetness as she neared climax.</p><p>She was close. One little nip would send her over the edge.</p><p>He stroked his fangs across her neck, sealed his lips against her skin, and bit down gently.</p><p>The taste of her blood hit his tongue and filled his senses. His mind was connected to hers, and because of that, he felt her searing spike of pleasure caused by his bite.</p> <p>Logan had been foolish to think he could control himself in this. It was too much sensation to control. Too much desire. Too much pleasure.</p><p>He bit deeper, needing to increase the flow of blood. A trickle would never do. He needed more. As much as he could get.</p><p>Her body shuddered as an orgasm swept through her. It shook her to her core and milked his erection as if trying to hurry his release. A feminine cry of completion echoed inside the barn\u2019s high walls. Heat poured from her until he was sure he\u2019d see steam rise from her body if he opened his eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He was too busy drinking her in, letting the strength of her climax fill him as it raced through her blood. There was power in this moment, more than he\u2019d ever thought possible. It was like drinking from one of the Athanasians, pure and perfect and laced with a reverent sort of magic.</p><p>His cock throbbed inside her, demanding to be heard. Until now, he\u2019d stayed still, pinning her in place. But that was no longer possible. He needed to move.</p><p>Logan stroked in and out, using some of his newfound power to speed his movements. Hope\u2019s climax had just eased, but he felt another building, her need swelling as the tempo of his thrusts and feeding sped.</p><p>Her hands had held his head in place, but they now slipped away as her arms went limp. Weakness filled her, but he wasn\u2019t done with her yet. He was going to wring one more searing burst of pleasure from her. Now.</p><p>He drank deep, tugging on her throat as he fed. Each tug coincided with the movement of his hips until she was careening over the edge again, screaming out her orgasm.</p><p>Logan lost control and let the climax have him. It crashed against him, choking the air from his body. His seed spurted deep, wringing another soft cry from Hope.</p><p>Her pulse slowed, became weaker.</p><p>As the last shivering wave of his orgasm passed, he realized just what he\u2019d done. He\u2019d nearly drained her dry.</p><p>Panic ricocheted in his chest. He healed the puncture wounds closed and cleaned away every drop of blood before he dared lift his mouth. He felt her mind touch his, offering him reassurance, but guilt weighed down on him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said as he lifted his head to look into her pale face.</p><p>She gave him a sleepy smile. \u201cDon\u2019t be. It was . . . perfect.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize what he\u2019d done. She was probably delirious.</p><p>Logan briefly considered feeding her some of his blood to strengthen her, but the risk of doing so was too great. His seed was inside her. If she drank his blood, she could conceive.</p><p>The idea of a child\u2014his child\u2014growing inside her was bittersweet. He would have loved the idea if he hadn\u2019t known how it would end for the child. All Sanguinar children, even half-breeds, had been cursed with the thirst for blood. Creating more mouths to feed was not just irresponsible, it was unforgivable.</p><p>So he did the only thing he could. He gathered up a burst of power and transferred it back into her, directing it to make new blood. Some fluids and some rest and she\u2019d recover.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI like that. Not nearly as much as the other way, but that\u2019s nice, too.\u201d</p><p>He was still joined to her. Still inside her, which made his betrayal seem even worse. \u201cWe need to get you inside where it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m warm here. With you.\u201d</p><p>Logan slid from her body and gathered up her clothes. He didn\u2019t bother with her undergarments, simply pulled her jeans and shirt on to keep her warm while he dressed himself. He loathed every second it took, but if Nicholas knew what he\u2019d just done, the consequences could be unpleasant.</p><p>He eased her limp body up enough to slip the sleeves of the coat over her arms.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop? You\u2019re harshing my buzz.\u201d</p><p>Logan blinked in incomprehension. \u201cYou\u2019re delirious.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cYou\u2019re just that good, baby.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her into his arms. She snuggled against his shoulder. \u201cThe real thing was so much better than my dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t speak of it,\u201d he warned her. \u201cNo one can know what we\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the frown in her voice. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me, Hope. Promise me you will not tell anyone what I did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I did some of that to you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, exasperation filling her tone. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He staggered under the weight of that promise for a step, knowing that not only had he violated her, he\u2019d also forced her to help him cover it up.</p><p>\u201cPut me down,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat is not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. Perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re treating me like I\u2019m dying. Will you just stop?\u201d</p><p>Logan did. They were halfway across the icy lawn between the barn and the house.</p><p>\u201cPut. Me. Down.\u201d</p><p>He did that, too, though he kept a careful hold on her arm in case she fainted.</p><p>Hope got right into his face, her eyes blazing. \u201cLook. We just had the most fantastic sex in history and you\u2019re acting like we murdered a litter of kittens. We did nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we did. You\u2019re meant for another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I get that you have some really antiquated ideas, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m playing along with them. I\u2019m not going to hook up with some guy\u2014not until you and I have had time to see if what we have together works.\u201d</p><p>Logan closed his eyes to block out the sight of her beautiful face. She was confused. Weak. He\u2019d caused those things by taking too much blood. No matter how much pleasure it had given her, he knew better. That was why his kind never mixed sex and blood. It was too easy to lose control.</p><p>Another minute or two and he could have killed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat we have is duty. That is all I can allow myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck duty. You\u2019ve been toting that burden around for too long. Let someone else have a turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way it works. All must help if we are to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me help you.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, unable to keep his eyes averted any longer. The sight of her was precious, a treasure to be cherished for as long as it lasted. \u201cI hope you will help us. But not like this. Not with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how?\u201d</p><p>He owed her the truth. \u201cEric is like you. His blood is rich and powerful. My hope is that the two of you will be happy together and have many children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his mouth suddenly dry. \u201cWe need the blood.\u201d</p><p>She stepped away from him. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you want me to sleep with this Eric guy and let him knock me up? You\u2019re telling me this while your semen is still inside me? That you want me to sleep with another man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He took a step toward her.</p><p>She held up her hands to ward him off. \u201cYou are out of your fucking mind. I\u2019m not going to be some baby factory so that you and your buddies have a nice, hot meal whenever you want one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. We\u2019re very careful in our efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful? Is that what you tell the women you\u2019ve done this to? Sorry, Mom, we\u2019re going to snack on your babies, but we\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I know is that I offered you my blood. Repeatedly. That\u2019s not enough for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it were.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in disbelief. \u201cThis is too messed up. I can\u2019t believe anyone could be so cold as to manipulate the lives of innocents for their blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have no choice. We\u2019re starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver thought about asking people first, rather than trying to trick them into it the way you did with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only mate those people who will be happy together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, do you go into their minds and brainwash them to make it happen? Are they just drooling fuckpuppets meant to squeeze out kids once a year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Hope. You\u2019re twisting it into something it\u2019s not. We go to great pains to make sure our subjects are happy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSubjects? Is that what I am to you? Some kind of lab rat?\u201d</p><p>Anger was gathering inside him, threatening a storm. \u201cI wish you were. I never would have been drawn to you, never would have lain with you.\u201d</p><p>She let out a scoffing bite of laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re even colder than I thought. Here I was, all moon-eyed, thinking I was falling in love with you. I had no idea of the man you really were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m not a man. You\u2019d do well to remember that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m out of here.\u201d She stormed off, but her anger supported her only so far. Her knees gave out and she started to crumple to the ground.</p><p>Logan caught her and pulled her against his body, hating the immediate reaction she caused. He\u2019d had her only moments ago and yet he was already aching to slide inside her again. He could smell the scent of their bodies mingling, becoming something darker and more intoxicating. The muskiness of his seed was deep within her, and any Sanguinar or Slayer who met her would know in an instant that she was his.</p><p>Not that she wanted to have anything to do with him. The way she was twisting the truth about made it seem ugly and sinister. Project Lullaby was nothing like that. It was necessary.</p><p>He needed her to see that. To know it. She didn\u2019t understand the kind of suffering they endured, because if she had, she wouldn\u2019t have been so quick to judge him. They didn\u2019t kill people. They worked themselves sick ensuring that their subjects were happy and healthy.</p><p>The scales were even. And soon, she would know it, too.</p> <p>Chapter 24</p><p>Logan\u2019s hold on Hope tightened and he pressed his hand to her temple. She could feel his anger vibrating through his body, but that was just too bad. She didn\u2019t have time for him or any of his tricks.</p><p>She tried to pull away but his grip was too tight. She willed one of those surges of adrenaline-induced strength to fill her, but nothing came. A second later, all thoughts of struggling evaporated.</p><p>A strong, solid presence filled her, and she recognized it easily. Logan.</p><p>Normally, she felt a gentleness surround him, but not now. His presence was draped with purpose, like a man on a mission.</p><p>\u201cFeel,\u201d he ordered.</p> <p>And she did. She was swept up in a wave of memories and sensations unlike anything she\u2019d ever felt before. There was hunger. Mountains of it. So much that it ate away at her sanity, making her cry out in agony. Her belly churned and nothing could fill it but ancient, powerful blood.</p><p>But there was none to be had. A hopeless desperation descended on her, driving strength from her limbs and the will to live from her soul. She was so hungry and yet there was no more food. There would never again be more food. She was going to die here, now, and it couldn\u2019t come soon enough.</p><p>Hope pleaded for death to take her, to end the relentless gnawing in her guts and the weakness that robbed her of the ability to do more than sit and stare, helpless and useless, while people around her died.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go on like this. What was the point of living if all that life had to offer was hunger and weakness and death?</p><p>And then she felt it, a faint stirring of hope, a dim light gleaming on the horizon of her suffering.</p><p>Blood. Rich, powerful blood. She could make it, grow it. It would take time. Centuries, perhaps, but for the first time in memory, there was a chance.</p><p>Hope reached for that chance, grabbing onto it with both hands. It slipped through her fingers, intangible and insubstantial. It flitted in her vision, teasing her as it darted around, never fully in sight.</p><p>But she could have it. She could have that blood. All she had to do was one little thing: Create families.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t sound so bad. Surely, she could find people who would love each other, people who belonged together, who would be happy together. The search would be hard, but the reward would be survival. She would hold each new life in her arms and cherish it for the blessing it was. It would never go hungry. It would never die of disease or sickness. She would be there, right by its side, seeing to its needs.</p><p>She had plenty of money, so that was no issue. None of her children would live in poverty or squalor. She\u2019d see to it that they got a good education and made a place for themselves in the world so that when the time came, they, too, could help create a new and precious life.</p><p>And while she knew she\u2019d have to take their blood to survive, she\u2019d be careful about it. She\u2019d screen them for disease and heal any injuries she found. She\u2019d imbue them with long lives so their cells would not age and die as a normal human\u2019s would. She\u2019d do everything in her power to see them happy.</p><p>All she needed in return was the power to help them\u2014the power only their blood could give her. It didn\u2019t seem too high a price to ask. After all, if she didn\u2019t do this, the dark things in the night would find them and eat them. If she wasn\u2019t strong, she couldn\u2019t keep them safe, and she desperately wanted to keep them safe.</p><p>As the idea sank in, she turned it around, looking at it from all sides. It didn\u2019t seem nearly so terrible as it had before. The faces of dozens of people filled her head\u2014all of them had been touched by the Sanguinar. They\u2019d been paired up; they\u2019d been fed on. None of them seemed to show any signs of abuse or neglect. They were . . . happy with the arrangement.</p><p>Who was she to say they weren\u2019t?</p><p>Hope felt Logan\u2019s presence release her, and with a little pang of regret, she let him go. The images he\u2019d shown her were still a part of her, as was the memory of that hunger. If he\u2019d endured that kind of torture, it was no wonder he\u2019d been desperate to find any means necessary to escape it.</p><p>But what if all that mental hocus pocus was just a lie? What if he\u2019d planted it to sway her opinion? \u201cI want to talk to them,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTalk to whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people you\u2019ve manipulated.\u201d</p><p>He flinched at her wording, but she didn\u2019t back down. She couldn\u2019t. If she let up even a little, she knew he\u2019d find a way to break through her defenses.</p><p>\u201cThe couple who was attacked the night we met. They were paired by me. Will that suffice?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, remembering how concerned the man had been for his wife. She\u2019d had no idea they were some of Logan\u2019s \u201csubjects.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out his phone and dialed. \u201cSteve, are you all well?\u201d He listened for a moment. \u201cGood, that\u2019s good.\u201d His eyes met Hope\u2019s. \u201cI was wondering if you had a moment to speak to someone for me. Just answer her questions with the truth, please.\u201d He paused. \u201cNo, your vow of secrecy does not apply to Hope. You may speak freely.\u201d</p><p>Logan handed her the phone. She put it to her ear, half expecting a trick. \u201cSteve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare blurt out her real question, which was whether he knew he\u2019d been manipulated. \u201cHow did you and your wife meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Logan set us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you be more specific?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cMy sister was dying. Car accident. Her brain was swelling and she was in a coma. Logan came into her room and said he\u2019d help in exchange for a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted me to meet Pam, though I didn\u2019t know her name at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find that odd?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I was kinda out of my head with worry. Nothing made any sense at the time. She was my kid sister. My responsibility. Mom and Dad were gone and I was the only one left to take care of her, but there was nothing I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was desperate. I thought it was worth a shot\u2014a hell of a lot better than watching my sister die.\u201d He pulled in a deep breath. \u201cSo I agreed. It was the first night Logan took my . . . you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He took my sister\u2019s, too. Whatever he did after that must have worked. The swelling went away. She woke up. She\u2019s a medical student now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Pam? What happened when you met her?\u201d</p><p>She could hear a smile creep into his voice and a distant quality filled it, like her presence on the line was suddenly unimportant. \u201cShe was my other half. A part of my soul I hadn\u2019t realized I lost.\u201d</p><p>A sense of jealousy filled Hope, but she ignored it. No sense in being jealous over something artificial. \u201cHow long have you been together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive years. Married three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have a baby on the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. A son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Logan order you to have children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The way he squawked the word made it sound like her question was ridiculous. \u201cOf course not. What the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he tell you that\u2019s why he put you together? So you could have babies and he could drink their blood, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, lady. I don\u2019t know who the hell you think you are, but Logan\u2019s not like that. He\u2019s a good man. He\u2019s nearly killed himself helping me twice now. I owe him everything, and I know without a doubt that when my son is here, Logan would do the same for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it? It\u2019s no big deal. Doesn\u2019t even hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to let him have your son\u2019s blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe minute he\u2019s old enough to handle it, you bet your ass I will. None of us have been sick a single day since we met Logan, and the one time I fell and broke my leg, he came right over and patched me up so I wouldn\u2019t miss any work. Sure, the whole magical thing is a little far-fetched, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, I don\u2019t know how a CAT scan works, either. It\u2019s all a mystery to me. Logan just happens to be better, faster, and a hell of a lot cheaper. I don\u2019t care what anyone says. He\u2019s a fucking superhero.\u201d</p><p>What could she say to that? Either Steve was being completely honest with her and he truly didn\u2019t mind the arrangement, or he was so brainwashed he didn\u2019t even know the truth.</p><p>Hope knew which one she thought was more likely. The man had been way too smooth to be reciting things he\u2019d been force fed.</p><p>Which meant she had a lot to think about. She didn\u2019t like Logan\u2019s tactics, but that didn\u2019t mean everyone hated them. Steve certainly had benefitted from Logan\u2019s interference in his life.</p><p>And she remembered how bright Steve\u2019s love for his wife had shone in his aura. That was not something that could be faked. His love was real. He was connected to his wife in a way Hope could only dream about.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t dream about it with this Eric guy. She\u2019d lied about falling in love with Logan. She wasn\u2019t falling. She\u2019d fallen. Past tense. She\u2019d thought that his manipulative ways would have kept it from happening, but they hadn\u2019t. If anything, the things he\u2019d done to others had only cemented her feelings.</p><p>Not only did Logan have to fight for every drop of blood, he also had to take care of every life he touched. On top of that, there were people like her whose mistrust probably didn\u2019t make his efforts any easier.</p><p>She opened her mouth to apologize when Nicholas burst out the front door, his face grim. \u201cYou need to come inside. We have a situation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan tensed beside her and took a protective step closer, scanning their surroundings.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Hope,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cThe shelter and your studio. They\u2019re both on fire.\u201d</p><p>Hope stared in horror at the TV screen. One side showed an image of her studio. Firefighters blasted it with thick jets of water, but it seemed to be doing little good. On the other side of the screen was the homeless shelter where a reporter stood out front.</p> <p>The reporter\u2019s words slid past her, not sinking in. All she saw were the flames rising up in the background as the fire crews worked to control the blaze. Huge plumes of black smoke billowed from the barred windows.</p><p>She scanned the surrounding crowd as the camera panned across the scene. She searched for a glimpse of Sister Olive or any of the regulars who visited. There was a growing group of people outside gawking, but she recognized none of them.</p><p>Fear weighed down on her, making it hard to breathe.</p><p>Logan\u2019s arm slid around her shoulders. She huddled against his side, waiting for someone to tell her this was all a mistake. \u201cWhere are the people who were inside?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas sent Logan a meaningful look\u2014one she didn\u2019t understand.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Sympathy filled Nicholas\u2019s gaze. \u201cThey don\u2019t know about your studio, but the reporter said the fire at the shelter was obviously arson. The doors were barricaded from the outside.\u201d</p><p>The significance of what he said sank in, freezing Hope from the inside out.</p><p>It was cold tonight. The shelter would have been full. All those people had been trapped inside. Along with Sister Olive.</p><p>Grief choked her. Her knees gave out. Logan\u2019s strong arm held her up, supporting her.</p><p>She struggled to regain her balance. She needed to be strong right now and figure out what had happened. She needed to go back and find out how many people had escaped\u2014broken the bars on the windows. Surely some of them had found a way out.</p> <p>Maybe even Sister Olive.</p><p>\u201cI need to leave,\u201d she announced, her voice sounding weak and hollow.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d said Logan. \u201cThat fire was set purposefully. We know a powerful Synestryn wants you. And while I tried to plant false memories in that Dorjan\u2019s head, it may have failed. They attacked your home as well as the shelter. I think it\u2019s more than possible that fire was meant to either kill you or force you to come out of hiding.\u201d</p><p>His words took longer than normal to sink in. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you won\u2019t take me back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither will I,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss, but our priority now has to be your safety.\u201d</p><p>Hope pulled away from Logan\u2019s hold and sank to the couch. Her knees were still weak. Her body was shaking. Ice coated her insides, numbing her from the pain she knew would hit at any moment.</p><p>She had to hold it together long enough to find out if Sister Olive was still alive. The woman had been like a mother to her. Hope couldn\u2019t simply sit around and wait to find out if she was still alive.</p> <p>What if she was injured? What if she needed Hope at her side, praying for her recovery?</p><p>Hope reached for her cell phone, before she remembered it was gone. She needed to call for a cab, but she didn\u2019t even know where she was.</p><p>Flashing lights, smoke, and flames filled the TV screen. A bright red banner scrolled across the bottom, mocking her inability to move forward as it did. She didn\u2019t know what to do next.</p><p>Sister Olive may be dead.</p><p>Grief crashed into her, making her sway. A low sound of mourning filled her ears. Hot tears slid down her cold cheeks, stinging as they passed.</p><p>Nothing was ever going to be the same again. Her whole world had gone up in flames and now she had nothing. No family. No home. No job. Everything had been stripped from her, laying her bare.</p><p>The air was too thin. She couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of it to fill her lungs. Her chest burned and she held herself as she rocked. The ice inside her had melted, and now she felt everything. All the fear and pain and grief. It slammed down on top of her, over and over, beating the life from her body.</p><p>Her mind struggled to make sense of things, to find some course of action that would help. But nothing came to her. There was nothing she could do to fix this. Her life was gone.</p><p>Again.</p><p>For the second time in less than thirty years, everything had been taken from her. She couldn\u2019t go through it again. She couldn\u2019t start from scratch and rebuild her life. She wasn\u2019t that strong.</p><p>If that Synestryn had meant to kill her in that fire, he\u2019d succeeded, because Hope was certain she wasn\u2019t going to survive. She wasn\u2019t even sure she wanted to try.</p><p>Hope\u2019s anguish assaulted Logan\u2019s senses. He could hear her heart race and her breath wheezing in and out of her lungs. The heavy scent of mourning flooded his nose, and the sight of her tears made something dark and violent writhe in his chest.</p><p>He had to do something.</p><p>Logan turned to Nicholas. \u201cDo not try to stop me,\u201d he told the Theronai.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEase her pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I stop that?\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t answer. Instead he gathered her trembling body in his arms and carried her back to one of the bedrooms. She didn\u2019t fight him. She didn\u2019t even seem to acknowledge his existence.</p><p>Nicholas was right on his heels. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re going to do, I\u2019m going to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I\u2019m not. She\u2019s my responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Logan whirled around, snarling at Nicholas. He tried to keep his voice quiet, but he managed only to sound more feral. \u201cHope is mine.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stopped in his tracks, looking stunned. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you act like this before. What\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman I care for is in pain.\u201d</p><p>A silent sob shook Hope\u2019s body, making Logan wish she\u2019d turn to him for comfort.</p><p>\u201cYou care for her? Since when do you care about anyone but yourself?\u201d</p><p>Logan restrained his anger long enough to lay Hope down on the bed. She curled into a ball, hugging herself. Every moment Nicholas delayed him was another moment of suffering for Hope.</p><p>That was simply unacceptable.</p><p>He gathered his power and grabbed Nicholas by the throat. He slammed the beefy man into the door frame. \u201cI care not what your opinion of me is. Hope is the one who matters here. She\u2019s in pain. I intend to ease her suffering. Back. The. Hell. Off.\u201d</p><p>Logan let go of Nicholas. The man\u2019s neck was red, but he didn\u2019t even rub away the sting. Instead, he filled the doorway, crossing his thick arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you alone with her when you\u2019re like this. Not unless you kill me.\u201d</p><p>Which he knew Logan would not do. His blood was far too valuable, as was his sword arm.</p><p>Logan was going to have to ease Hope with an audience, which was awkward, but necessary. He didn\u2019t want to waste even one more second on Nicholas.</p><p>Hope was facing away from them. Quiet sobs of pain shook her shoulders.</p><p>Logan sat next to her, shoving all emotion from his mind in preparation for what he was going to do. After several deep breaths, he laid his hand on her forehead and forced his blood to give up its stores of power.</p><p>He sought out her grief and gathered it up. It swarmed about him, stinging like a hundred wasps. The pain grew the longer he controlled the emotion, but he needed to accumulate all he could. He wouldn\u2019t have the will to do this twice.</p><p>Once he controlled her pain, he shoved it into himself, holding his breath as her emotions became his own.</p><p>A sense of loss so deep it would never heal split him open. His soul wept boiling tears of mourning that burned until he was sure the pain would kill him. Every empty part of him was filled with grief and loneliness.</p><p>Intellectually, he knew that these emotions were not his, but that made them no less real. Hope felt things deeply. More so than any other human he\u2019d ever known. Her sorrow invaded every part of her until her very cells were drowning in it.</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d survived feeling like this, even for a moment. He carried only a portion of her anguish and it was enough to drive him mad.</p><p>Normally, he would have adapted to the feelings, absorbed them, and transformed them into chemical and electrical signals that would fade in moments. But this was too much. He couldn\u2019t process it all. He didn\u2019t know how she could stand it.</p><p>He heard Nicholas\u2019s concerned voice, but couldn\u2019t make out the words. Not that they\u2019d matter. Nothing seemed to matter now except Hope.</p><p>Logan gathered her into his arms and held on tight. Her warmth sank into him, anchoring him in place.</p><p>He needed just a little more time to fight off these feelings. To let them dissipate. And then, when they had, he\u2019d go back to gather up more, despite the pain it caused him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of leaving her to suffer alone.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t like this situation. He didn\u2019t know what Logan was doing to the woman, but whatever it was, it was costing him dearly. The Sanguinar\u2019s skin had gone so pale it was nearly translucent. His body shook, and Nicholas could see Logan\u2019s flesh wasting away before his eyes. Muscles that had been there only moments ago were shrinking and fading, leaving the other man\u2019s clothing hanging on his frame.</p><p>He went to Logan\u2019s side and put his hand on his bony shoulder. \u201cYou need to stop.\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t seem to hear him. His grip on Hope was tight, his body curled around her almost possessively.</p><p>Or maybe not almost. The Sanguinar had claimed her. Backing up that claim was a different story entirely, and modern women tended to be a bit prickly about such things. Their independent streaks were wide and tender. Treading on one was risky.</p><p>Not that Nicholas wouldn\u2019t have done the same thing if he\u2019d thought Hope could save him. He would have. He would have done anything in his power to hold on to her. Just the way Logan was doing.</p><p>He heard the door to the Gerai house open. He put his hand on his sword and went to see who was there.</p><p>Tynan shut the front door behind him, gathering his coat about his lean body to ward off the chill. The Sanguinar was strikingly perfect in his appearance, with the kind of good looks that made women stare in lust-filled awe. Like all the Sanguinar, he had pale skin and eyes that had the ability to shed light when their emotions ran hot or they were using their magical mojo.</p><p>A Sanguinar with glowing eyes was a dangerous beast. Of course, even without the glowing eyes, Logan and Tynan\u2019s kind were not to be trusted. Unless it was to trust that they would do whatever benefitted them.</p><p>Which made Nicholas wonder what Logan stood to gain by easing Hope\u2019s pain. Perhaps her cooperation?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d asked Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Logan. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the bedroom. With a woman.\u201d</p><p>Only a faint flicker of surprise lifted Tynan\u2019s brow before he controlled his reaction and his face once again became impassive. \u201cI see. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t disturb them then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you probably should. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be too healthy for him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tynan hurried past Nicholas and down the hall until he found Logan. He watched for a moment before he went to the bed.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d said Tynan in such a forceful tone that Nicholas found himself freezing in place, not even daring to breathe for a second.</p><p>Logan growled. The quiet warning was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cYou must stop,\u201d repeated Tynan, this time with more force.</p> <p>Logan ignored him.</p><p>Tynan turned to Nicholas. \u201cStrike him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHit him. Hard. Disrupt his concentration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you wish. I would have thought you\u2019d enjoy the task.\u201d</p><p>There had been times when Nicholas would have bled for the chance to slap one of the Sanguinar, but not like this.</p><p>Tynan drew back his fist and slammed it into the side of Logan\u2019s face.</p><p>Logan was lying still one moment, and the next, he was flying at Tynan, claws and teeth bared, eyes glowing. The snarl on his face was a deadly warning, as was the hiss pouring from his mouth.</p><p>Nicholas yanked Tynan out of the way and took the brunt of Logan\u2019s attack. The Sanguinar\u2019s claws raked across his face, drawing blood, but Logan was no match for Nicholas\u2019s strength. He spun Logan around and tossed him to the floor. His head bounced off the wall and he stayed down.</p><p>Logan shook his head as if to clear it. Tynan knelt down by his side. \u201cAre you well?\u201d</p> <p>Logan nodded. The light had gone out of his eyes, leaving them the normal, pale silver color. He looked up at Nicholas. \u201cI apologize. I will repair the damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I will,\u201d said Tynan.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a scratch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne that is bleeding and will draw unwanted company.\u201d</p><p>The leech was right.</p><p>Nicholas stood still while Tynan worked his mojo, closing up the small wounds. As soon as the searing heat faded from his cheek, Nicholas went to wash away the blood. When he got back, they were all going to have a serious talk about what the hell had just happened.</p><p>Rory had managed to fight off the smaller monsters that had come for her, but she was no match for this one. It was huge\u2014easily three times her size. Its skin was covered in a slimy layer of filth, pulsing as if something was crawling beneath it. It stood upright; the lower half of its body was submerged. Above the waterline, it widened as it went up, getting bigger and thicker as it neared the ceiling. Its nostrils were above its eyes, leaving an odd, empty spot in the middle of its face. Fleshy lips protruded from its jaws, the bottom one sagging under its own weight.</p><p>Beyond the mottled gray lips, she could see the glint of teeth. Not that it needed those. The wicked claws extending from its flipperlike hands were more than enough to kill her.</p> <p>It regarded her with a kind of curiosity, blinking and sniffing as it neared.</p><p>Rory didn\u2019t think she could be any more afraid than she had been since she\u2019d been dumped down here, but this thing was proving her wrong. Her body found the strength to send a spurt of fear rocketing through her system.</p><p>She gripped her makeshift weapon harder, until the edges of it dug into her palm. She\u2019d sharpened the tip by rubbing it on the concrete walls, and now that tip was caked with the black blood of the things she\u2019d used it to kill.</p><p>As she looked at the two-foot length of metal, a bubble of nervous laughter rose up inside her. There was no way she could even get close enough to this thing to hit it without it being able to strike her first.</p><p>But as the thing glided closer to her, parting the dirty water, she realized it was going to make her test that theory.</p><p>A shrill whistle sounded from somewhere outside this room. The monster spun around and sank below the water, swimming out the door. Four thick tentacles broke the surface as it fled. It didn\u2019t have legs at all.</p><p>Rory had no idea what had happened, but she didn\u2019t question her good fortune. She was too busy trying to think of a way out. She couldn\u2019t be here when that thing came back. Her last attempt to crawl over the ceiling tiles had ended in disaster. The stairway was blocked by more monsters than she could possibly kill, and so far, she\u2019d found no other means of escape. No windows, no tunnels, just an endless stretch of concrete walls and cold, disgusting water.</p><p>She heard the slosh of that water as something came her way. She crouched into the corner and lifted her weapon.</p><p>One of the guards who\u2019d thrown her down here came into view. \u201cYou\u2019re still alive. Good. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>She tried to tell him to go to hell, but her mouth was too dry to speak. She hadn\u2019t been able to get back to the leaking water pipe at the far end of the building today, and she sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to drink the muck these things lived in.</p><p>He motioned for her to come. \u201cHurry. The food I gave them will hold their interest for only so long.\u201d</p><p>What choice did she have? There was no way out down here. At least if she went with him, she\u2019d have a fighting chance to escape. Or at least a chance to die warm and dry. Even that would be an improvement.</p><p>Rory hopped down from her perch. The cold water sucked the life from her and stole her breath. The guard grabbed her arm and practically hauled her through the sludge.</p><p>As they neared the stairway door, she saw a throbbing mass of twisted bodies fighting a few yards away. She didn\u2019t want to see what they were fighting over. All she cared about was getting out of here.</p><p>Her legs barely worked to push her up the steps. She was weak from dehydration, hunger, and exhaustion. There was no way she could run in her condition\u2014at least not without falling on her face.</p><p>Even her curse\u2014or her gift, as her grandma called it\u2014had quit working, which she counted in the pro column of situational accounting. At least without it, she didn\u2019t have to see the horrible things that were going on around her.</p><p>Funny. She\u2019d prayed to be released from her curse for years. She\u2019d spent the last two shadowing the only person in the world who had made her feel normal\u2014the only person who seemed to be able to block her visions. So either that person was here\u2014which seemed unlikely\u2014or the whole time, all she\u2019d had to do to get rid of the visions was to get captured, tossed into a den of monsters, starved, and to live in constant fear.</p><p>It was such an easy fix. She should have done it years ago. Or not.</p><p>Rory would have giggled at her situation had she had the energy. As it was, she was swaying on her feet, not even bothering to look for an opening to escape.</p><p>Stupid.</p><p>She gathered what little strength she had left and lifted her head. Standing in front of her was the asshole who\u2019d taken her hostage, the one who ran this place like some kind of freakish cult. He was surrounded by adoring humans, most of whom were covered in ragged bite marks that burned red with infection. The women were mostly naked, staring in rapt attention at the ugly guy on the throne.</p><p>\u201cKneel,\u201d he ordered her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather go back downstairs, fuckhead.\u201d Her voice was rough and dry, but she stayed on her feet and that was what mattered.</p><p>He waved a scaly, three-fingered hand and two guards dragged a woman forward. Her head was covered with a dirty pillowcase, which shifted with her rapid, frightened breathing.</p><p>They ripped the pillowcase off, revealing Sister Olive, the nun who ran the homeless shelter where Rory sometimes ate.</p><p>Shock shot through Rory like a stroke of lightning. It jolted her, stealing her breath and melting her in place.</p><p>The guards forced Sister Olive forward until she was standing at the foot of the asshole\u2019s throne. Her eyes were wide, but the set of her mouth was hard. She hadn\u2019t given up hope and she hadn\u2019t been broken like the other women here. Yet.</p><p>He reached out and wrapped his scaly fingers around Sister Olive\u2019s throat. There was a malicious gleam in his eyes, one that told how much he enjoyed Rory\u2019s shock. \u201cKneel, or I\u2019ll kill her.\u201d</p><p>Sister Olive closed her eyes and started praying. Quiet, fervent words spilled from her mouth as she called upon the God she believed in so deeply.</p><p>Rory had seen the woman\u2019s faith run through her actions. She\u2019d seen how kind and selfless Sister Olive had been. She\u2019d devoted her life to others, and now that life was in Rory\u2019s feeble hands.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t fight. She couldn\u2019t run. She couldn\u2019t even call upon her rebellious streak and lip off in the hopes that he\u2019d kill her. If she died, Sister Olive would suffer, and that was something Rory couldn\u2019t stand. She had to swallow her pride and do the right thing. Chances were it would be the last thing she ever did\u2014at least of her own free will.</p><p>Rory knelt.</p><p>\u201cYou know better,\u201d chided Tynan.</p><p>Logan was not in the mood for a lecture. \u201cShe was in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was foolish. A waste of power.\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t care. He couldn\u2019t stand to see Hope hurt like that, not if it was in his power to fix it. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you had blood to share. Grace\u2019s condition is getting worse and I need more power.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked away, focusing on the slim lines of Hope\u2019s back. She was resting peacefully now. He could hear the steady beat of her heart and her even breathing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I used much of it.\u201d</p><p>Tynan\u2019s mouth flattened in disapproval. \u201cYou squandered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She was grieving. Too much. It wasn\u2019t normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Tynan looked at her, and it was all Logan could do not to block sight of her with his body. \u201cIs she well now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Then I will feed from her myself.\u201d</p><p>Rage coated Logan\u2019s vision. It took over his body, compelling him to act. Hope\u2019s heavy grief still hung over him, but it faded in comparison to the ferocious need to kill.</p><p>The sound that came from Logan\u2019s throat was not normal. It was feral, vicious. \u201cI will kill you if you touch her.\u201d</p><p>Tynan tilted his head, unfazed by Logan\u2019s threat. \u201cIs that so? You seem too weak to do anything of the sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you. Don\u2019t test me.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas came back in, his face clean of blood. \u201cWhat the hell is going on here? I\u2019ve never seen you two act like this.\u201d</p><p>Tynan kept his eyes on Logan as he spoke. \u201cLogan has absorbed the human woman\u2019s emotions. It\u2019s making him cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsorbed her emotions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer grief,\u201d said Logan, hoping Nicholas would understand and take his side if they came to blows. Which was a definite possibility.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cSo that\u2019s what you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly dangerous,\u201d explained Tynan. \u201cAnd foolish. The woman would have healed on her own. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cShe was pretty upset. If Logan here helped her out, then good for him. Way to take one for the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat team?\u201d asked Tynan.</p><p>Nicholas rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a figure of speech. We\u2019re all on the same side here, right?\u201d</p><p>Tynan gave Logan a steady gaze. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. It\u2019s over now. It\u2019s done. Time to move on already.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe does have a point,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cThe power cannot be recovered now. I\u2019ll have to find a new source.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Hope. She\u2019s off-limits.\u201d</p><p>Tynan smiled as if Logan had told a joke. \u201cOff-limits?\u201d</p><p>Logan heard Hope\u2019s heartbeat speed up a second before her eyes opened. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked, her voice groggy.</p> <p>Nicholas lounged against the door frame, smirking. \u201cThese two were just having a pissing contest over you.\u201d</p><p>She pushed herself upright. \u201cReally?\u201d she asked looking at each of them. \u201cWho won?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d asked Logan, stepping over anything else Nicholas might say.</p><p>Hope rubbed her temples. \u201cI had the worst dream. There was a fire at my studio and the shelter. Everyone was locked inside.\u201d She swallowed twice before continuing. \u201cThe woman who took me in years ago died.\u201d</p><p>Logan sat down, needing to touch her. He used the gentlest voice he could. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it wasn\u2019t a dream.\u201d</p> <p>Her forehead wrinkled in confusion, and a moment later, sorrow overtook her expression as his words sank in. \u201cIt was real? Sister Olive is dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that,\u201d he offered. \u201cBut the fire was real.\u201d</p><p>Hope slid past him to stand. \u201cI need to get back and find her. See if she\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cThe fire was set on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen whoever set it will think I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe they did it to flush you out of hiding,\u201d said Logan.</p> <p>She looked at the trio of men gathered. \u201cThe closest thing I have to a mother may be dead and you\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t even go and find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a few calls,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cPerhaps we can learn of her fate without risking your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you,\u201d she shot at Tynan. \u201cWhy would you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your safety is of great importance to me. As is your well-being.\u201d</p><p>Logan cupped his hands over her shoulders. The slender lines of her body called to him, even through his hunger and fatigue. He wished everyone else would simply go away, evaporate into space so he could be alone with her.</p><p>His thumbs smoothed over her shirt. \u201cI trust him. Please, let him do this. If we can\u2019t find out about Sister Olive, then one of us will go investigate. But this will be quicker.\u201d</p><p>Hope nodded. Sadness radiated out from her, but it was no longer the gushing, unnatural grief that had been there before.</p><p>\u201cYou stay here and rest,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cI\u2019ll go make my calls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to help.\u201d She began to move forward, but Logan stopped her with his body.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need any help.\u201d Tynan would use his powers of persuasion over the phone to get the answers he needed. Hope would only get in the way.</p><p>Before she could argue further, Tynan left.</p><p>Nicholas shot Logan a meaningful look. \u201cAre you going to make it? You\u2019re looking a little pale. Even for you.\u201d</p><p>Logan was weak from his efforts, but that weakness was nothing new. \u201cGive Tynan your blood if you\u2019re willing to share. Grace won\u2019t survive without him.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nodded and left the room, shutting the door behind him. Whether he\u2019d meant to offer them privacy or he\u2019d done it in an effort to protect Hope from hearing any bad news, Logan wasn\u2019t sure. But he was glad of it all the same.</p><p>\u201cWho is Grace?\u201d asked Hope.</p><p>\u201cA human woman who sacrificed herself for the sake of another. She\u2019s not likely to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse to dwell on it. We\u2019ve had enough sadness for one night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas seemed worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you believe me if I said he\u2019s just a mother hen type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d A faint smile curved her lips, making him ache to kiss her again. He knew it was wrong, but that didn\u2019t stop him from wanting it anyway.</p><p>Logan smoothed her hair away from her face. The honey blond strands were tangled and damp from her tears. \u201cYou should rest. It\u2019s been a rough night for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, too. You need more blood. I can tell just by looking at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yours. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did something for me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that wasn\u2019t a dream, then neither were the feelings I had. I felt you inside me. I felt you hold me.\u201d</p><p>He wished he could hold her still, but every second he spent touching her was another betrayal. \u201cI\u2019m going to go check in with Tynan.\u201d</p><p>She pushed to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to do the same with Jodi. Is she awake yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but she\u2019s fine. We want her to sleep as much as possible to prevent her from forming more memories we might have to remove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019m not going to let you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pressed a finger to her lips to keep her from saying something she\u2019d have to take back later. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do whatever is best for her. You\u2019re her friend. I know you want that for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a right to her memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe also has a right to stay alive and not be haunted by the things that have happened to her. So far, I believe she\u2019s only seen a human, but if I\u2019m wrong, or if that was to change, I\u2019d have no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d have no choice but to stop you. Don\u2019t push me on this.\u201d</p><p>This argument was getting them nowhere. He\u2019d do what he must to save Jodi\u2019s life, and if that drove a wedge between him and Hope, then so be it. Anything that pushed her away from him was for the best, anyway, because he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d ever be able to walk away from her.</p><p>\u201cGo to her,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of time to argue with you over possibilities.\u201d</p><p>Hope left, her spine rigid. Logan found Tynan at the kitchen table, speaking on the phone. He waited until Tynan hung up.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d asked Logan.</p><p>\u201cThe human authorities know nothing yet. The fire burned hot and they haven\u2019t yet been able to get in to investigate for bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure they\u2019re not simply hiding the truth from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain. The police chief was easy enough to compel to give me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we don\u2019t know if Hope\u2019s Sister Olive survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tynan gave him a level look. \u201cDoes Nicholas know you\u2019ve slept with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour scents cling to each other. Along with the scent of sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBased on your reaction in there, you have not yet worked her out of your system.\u201d</p><p>He said it like she was some kind of toxin\u2014a malady to be remedied. That was not the case at all. Hope was no disease. She was a balm to his soul, comforting and infuriating in a way no other woman had ever been.</p><p>Logan loved her. There was no more denying it, and no matter who she ended up mated to, he believed he would continue to love her. \u201cI will do what is right for our people.\u201d</p><p>Tynan laid a hand on his shoulder. His fingers were cold, the chill sinking all the way through to Logan\u2019s skin. \u201cI know you will. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeping Grace alive has been taxing, but it\u2019s Tori who\u2019s taking up most of my strength. I have yet to find a way to filter her blood and I fear that if I don\u2019t find an answer soon, her sanity will be the first casualty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lasted so many years. Certainly a few more weeks is not too much for her to stand.\u201d</p><p>Tynan shook his head. His mouth flattened to a grim line. \u201cShe has dark, violent urges and they\u2019re not getting better with time. I think being inside Dabyr with its protective wards is somehow irritating the Synestryn infection, bringing it to the surface.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take her outside the walls. Zillah would find her within hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I also know that nothing I\u2019ve tried has worked. I\u2019m going to have to put her to sleep in the way of our people. Maybe if we find and kill Zillah, whatever influence he has over her will die with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you strong enough for that?\u201d</p><p>Tynan sighed. \u201cNot while Grace still lives. But I can\u2019t let her die, either. Without her, I have no clue what Torr might do. And as violent as Tori\u2019s urges are, I promise you that Torr would be much more destructive. He\u2019s losing leaves every day now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace can\u2019t save him. She\u2019s human, not Theronai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but if she dies, I fear that Torr\u2019s hope will die with her. I truly do not know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to save them both. And for that you need strength. Take some of mine. I don\u2019t have as much to offer as I should, but what I have is yours.\u201d Logan held out his arm.</p><p>Tynan didn\u2019t hesitate, which told Logan just how close to the end of his strength he was. His fangs sliced through Logan\u2019s skin, opening his vein. Tynan held his wrist tightly, making the transfer as fast as possible.</p><p>None of their kind enjoyed giving up power. The sooner it was over, the better it was for everyone.</p><p>A few seconds later, Logan felt his skin knit shut and Tynan pulled away. He frowned at Logan. \u201cYou said she was strongly blooded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sensed her cells within you, but they were as empty of power as a non-blooded human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Of course they\u2019re not. Without her blood I\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><p>Tynan\u2019s eyes lit, flaring for a brief moment. \u201cYou\u2019re right. They\u2019re not empty. They\u2019re . . . sleeping. I cannot wake them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that you can\u2019t access the power in her blood but I can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever run into this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The memory of Hope\u2019s bursts of strength and the odd glow of colors she saw came rushing back to Logan. \u201cCould it be some kind of Theronai power? You know how Helen has a gift for fire and Andra is adept at shields. Could her sleeping blood be some kind of gift meant to protect her from Synestryn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible. Does she bear the mark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d seen her body, and unless the ring-shaped birthmark of the Theronai was hidden, she did not bear it.</p><p>Tynan glanced over his shoulder, checked the doorway, and lowered his voice. \u201cWe must be very careful here. Very certain. Has she shown any signs of magical power?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cPhysical strength. And something else I can\u2019t name. It\u2019s like she has another sense; she can see things others cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI truly don\u2019t know what to think. It\u2019s like she\u2019s a mix we\u2019ve never seen before\u2014some kind of genetic anomaly or a mix of races.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could be part Slayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would certainly please Eric.\u201d</p><p>Logan bit back a bitter laugh. Eric didn\u2019t seem the type to be pleased about anything. \u201cIf we can prove it, Andreas will approve the match.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re content with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I am not. Even thinking about Hope with another man puts me in a killing mood. But I know what\u2019s at stake. I will do what\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s happily settled,\u201d Tynan assured him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough. Logan wanted her to be happy with him. It was selfish and juvenile, but it was his wish nonetheless. \u201cShe\u2019s not even going to meet a man of our choosing unless we find out what\u2019s going on. I promised her I\u2019d help her find where her missing friends had gone. Until I do that, her side of the bargain will not go into effect. We find these people or she\u2019ll never meet Eric.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think the fires are connected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about them that bothers me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Logan.</p><p>\u201cThe police chief said the fire department had never seen a fire burn this hot this fast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think it was of magical origin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>Logan wasn\u2019t naturally one to share more details than necessary, but he guessed this situation qualified. \u201cThere\u2019s a Synestryn lord after Hope. His name is Krag and he\u2019s got several humans under his thrall. He sent one after Hope. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if he has control of one of the demons who use fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s a Handler?\u201d asked Tynan.</p><p>Denial rose up hard and fast, blocking out even the thought. Those demons were as rare as they were deadly. They were smarter than most, armed with whips that could set fire to nearly anything. With their ability to control weaker demons, Handlers could raze entire towns in a single night, if left unchecked. He still remembered what they\u2019d done to Helen\u2019s home the night they\u2019d found her. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith fire like that, it could be a Handler, and if this Krag has sent one after her, its hounds will have her scent. They\u2019ve been to her home. She won\u2019t be safe anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Slick, oily fear rose up in Logan\u2019s throat, nearly choking him. He sprang from the table as he spoke. \u201cWe need to get both her and Jodi to Dabyr. Tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Krag after Jodi as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but she lives and works with Hope. If the Handler has Hope\u2019s scent, he also has Jodi\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go to Dabyr immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You take them both to Dabyr. I\u2019m covered in her scent. Nicholas and I can go in the opposite direction and try to throw them off the trail.\u201d</p><p>The front door burst open. \u201cIncoming!\u201d shouted Nicholas as he sprinted into the living room, sword drawn. \u201cThere\u2019s too many for me to fight. We need to run.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>Hope heard the commotion and shook Jodi\u2019s shoulder. Something was coming and they needed to run.</p> <p>Jodi\u2019s body was limp and unresponsive. Whatever Logan had done to her to make her sleep had worked too well.</p><p>The drop-dead beautiful man who\u2019d been here earlier walked in and picked up Jodi. \u201cCome with me. Now.\u201d</p><p>Hope didn\u2019t argue. She went where Jodi went.</p><p>They passed through the living room. Nicholas had his sword out. Logan was putting on the leather coat he\u2019d made love to her on only a little while ago. His jaw was tight and his eyes glowed with a feral light.</p><p>Hope reached for him as she passed. He stepped aside, refusing to look at her. \u201cGo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatch up? We have to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time to argue.\u201d Logan grabbed her arm and marched her toward the door, down the steps, and over the icy ground. In the distance, she saw shapes moving and flickering wisps of flames. They were surrounded by auras of black nothingness.</p><p>Fear slowed her feet, but Logan practically lifted her, hurrying her to the van. Despite the cold, her palms broke out in a nervous sweat and her heart raced.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he assured her. \u201cWe won\u2019t let them reach you.\u201d</p><p>Hope had seen him like this before\u2014all business, focused and calm. It wasn\u2019t a good sign of things to come.</p><p>Tynan set Jodi in the backseat of his van, leaving the door open for Hope. He went around and got in behind the wheel. Logan all but shoved Hope up into the van. \u201cStay with Tynan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she called after him as he jogged away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Tynan started the engine. Nicholas positioned himself between the barn and a sturdy oak tree. His sword gleamed under the moonlight.</p><p>Something small shot through the dark. Hope got only a tiny glimpse of it, but she swore it was surrounded by that same black aura as the monsters. It struck Logan, sending him falling back.</p><p>He\u2019d been hit by a projectile.</p><p>Synestryn closed in on Nicholas.</p><p>Logan let out a roar and grabbed at whatever had struck him. Something long and skinny, like the tail of a snake, wriggled in his grasp.</p><p>Whatever had hit him was . . . alive.</p><p>She had to help him. She couldn\u2019t leave him alone and prone while monsters closed in.</p><p>Hope yelled at Tynan, \u201cGo!\u201d and slammed the van door shut.</p><p>She sprinted over the ground to Logan\u2019s side. He\u2019d managed to dislodge the snake from his shoulder. He tossed it to the ground and Hope stomped on it.</p><p>Tynan\u2019s tires spit gravel as he shot down the long driveway.</p><p>Blood gleamed wetly on Logan\u2019s leather coat. It didn\u2019t have the metallic smell she was used to. It was sweeter than that, like honeysuckle. The urge to see if it tasted as sweet as it smelled swept through her and she had to grit her teeth to stop herself.</p><p>She pressed her hand to the wound to slow the bleeding. Logan\u2019s face was grim. \u201cYou should have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t leave you behind.\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet in one smooth, powerful motion. His injury had to hurt, but he showed no sign of pain.</p><p>Movement caught her eye. A pair of furry, rust-colored monsters were slinking toward them. While they vaguely resembled wolves, their jaws were too wide, showing off hundreds of triangular teeth, like a shark. There were burned-out holes where their eyes should have been, but their lack of sight didn\u2019t seem to impede them. Their nostrils flared as they sniffed the air, heading right toward her and Logan.</p><p>He grabbed her wrist, ripping her hand away from his wound, and pulled her toward Nicholas. Another two of those furry things were lunging at him, jaws snapping. Three more lay dead at his feet.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d ordered Logan as he positioned her between himself and Nicholas.</p><p>Blue-white light spilled from his eyes. He lifted his hand and more light erupted from his fingertips. It splashed out, flattening into a flat disc between them and the two approaching Synestryn.</p><p>The air shivered with electricity. It crackled through her hair and slid along her skin like a caress. She didn\u2019t know what he was doing, but it was beautiful and felt good. She could hear Nicholas fighting, sense his sudden movements in the shifting air, but she was too busy watching the light to care what he did.</p><p>Beyond that disc, she saw the flicker of flames. Something came out of the shadows, striding toward them. It was taller than a human with hairless, snow-white skin. It had no nose or lips, just openings in its skull. Wicked teeth dripped with saliva that ran down its chin to wet the rust-colored fur cloak it wore. Its legs were oddly jointed, bending the wrong way, making its movements jarring to watch. In one hand it held a whip made from something silver and in the other hand was a red-hot poker.</p><p>\u201cHandler,\u201d whispered Logan, his jaw clenched in concentration. \u201cStay still.\u201d</p><p>Hope did. Only her chest moved, sucking in huge gulping breaths of air that smelled of honeysuckle.</p><p>Her hand was wet with his blood\u2014blood she needed. She didn\u2019t understand why she needed it, but the urge to taste it was growing uncontrollably.</p><p>Her black, hidden past swelled inside her head, taunting her with its presence. She couldn\u2019t see it, but she could feel it, looming right there, so close she could almost touch it. If it got only a little closer, if she reached out just a fraction, it would be right there, in her grasp.</p><p>The blood. It was the scent of his blood that was tugging at her memories, making them roil to the surface.</p><p>Hope lifted her hand and covered her nose and mouth with it, sucking in the scent. Her head spun. She heard a roaring in her ears, like waves breaking against a cliff.</p><p>Her mouth was dry. She licked her lips and tasted something sweet. Logan\u2019s blood.</p><p>She waited for a feeling of revulsion to sweep over her, but it never came. His blood wasn\u2019t repulsive. It was powerful. She could feel it sweeping through her system, spreading out to become a part of her. She licked her lips again, her body wanting more of that power.</p><p>A faint flicker of a face appeared for a split second. It was a woman. She was stunningly beautiful, with silver hair falling down to her hips. She didn\u2019t have a single wrinkle, but Hope knew instantly that she was old. Ancient. Powerful.</p><p>Hope felt a sense of warmth at the memory. She\u2019d loved this woman. Trusted her. The feelings ran so deep and wide, Hope had no idea how she\u2019d ever managed to forget someone who was so obviously a huge part of her life.</p><p>But as soon as the flash was gone and the image faded, the feelings began to fade as well, melting like snowflakes over a flame.</p><p>Hope trembled with excitement. There was something there, and for the first time she\u2019d been able to touch it.</p><p>Light flared nearby, breaking her out of her stunned shock. That light was spewing from Logan\u2019s hand. She blinked, realizing that whatever Logan had done to shield them had failed.</p><p>He\u2019d told her not to move and she\u2019d moved.</p><p>The Handler looked right at her and lifted his whip to strike. It was made from fine links of chain and each one glowed white hot. Wisps of smoke rose up from the sinuous length, melting snow and ice wherever it touched.</p><p>The Handler\u2019s arm swept in a deadly arc, dragging the chain through the air. Hope froze in place, unable to move.</p><p>A pencil-thin beam of light slashed through the air, landing on the Handler\u2019s snow-white skin. It screamed in pain and reared back. The two furry demons snarled in rage, bared their sharklike teeth, reared back onto their hind legs, and lunged at Hope.</p><p>Krag felt the woman\u2019s presence explode in his mind. He saw her standing in the moonlight, her blond hair whipping around her face. Her mouth was open around a scream and her golden eyes glowed with fear.</p><p>She was beautiful. And she was his.</p><p>He sent out a silent command to the Handler nearest her, commanding him to take her hostage. The Handler tried to resist the compulsion, but his feeble mind was no match for Krag\u2019s powers. He\u2019d learned at the feet of his father. There wasn\u2019t a lesser Synestryn alive who could defy him.</p><p>Krag\u2019s vision of the woman faded, but he could still feel her this time, as if a light inside her had been switched on and he could see it glowing across the miles.</p><p>Wherever she went, he would now be able to find her. Forever.</p><p>Logan shoved Hope out of the way of the charging demons. They rammed into the barn wall, yelping as they struck.</p><p>The move threw him out of position, earning him a searing lash from the Handler\u2019s whip. It burned right through his coat and jeans and blistered his skin. The pain crushed the breath from his body and made his vision waver. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan pushed Hope behind him, putting her back to the barn. Nicholas was on their right, fighting off another pair of demons. Logan could smell the Theronai\u2019s blood, proving that at least one of them had landed a strike.</p><p>The Handler lifted his whip again. It burned through a thin branch overhead. The branch fell at Logan\u2019s feet, the severed end still smoldering. He grabbed it up and swung at the Handler. His injured shoulder and thigh burned. He\u2019d stopped the bleeding, but the pain was sucking up his strength, making him weak.</p><p>His blow missed and the Handler\u2019s whip wrapped around the branch, slicing through it in three places. The burning chunks of wood fell, useless.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d he called. He used one hand to maneuver Hope so she was between him and Nicholas.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost there.\u201d</p><p>A ragged yelp of pain rose up and Logan hoped it was the sound of a dying Synestryn.</p><p>Logan gathered his power and sent another burst of light streaking toward the Handler. The beam landed on his face. He shrieked and jerked back, growling through his bare teeth.</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s sword appeared, gleaming in the moonlight. With one strike, he severed a paw from one of the demons. The one next to it turned its burned-out eyes onto its brother and attacked.</p><p>The two rolled away in a snarling ball of rust-colored fur.</p> <p>The Handler backed up, out of melee range\u2014out of reach of Nicholas\u2019s blade. The demon lifted his whip. Nicholas charged. Only one of the two furry demons lived, and it pounced over the ground, lunging for Nicholas\u2019s throat.</p><p>The chain slashed out, striking a thick limb overhead. It wrapped around the tree, sizzling and popping as it burned through the heavy wood.</p><p>The limb started to fall. Logan pushed Hope back out of the way. He reached for Nicholas, but there was no more time. The branch fell, slamming both men to the ground.</p><p>Logan heard the unmistakable sound of bone breaking. He was too stunned to figure out whose it was. He was hurting all over, from whatever had tried to burrow into his shoulder, and the deep burn on his thigh. Add to that the crushing weight of the branch and his whole world was pain.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d he screamed at Hope.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see her. His body was pinned in place so that he couldn\u2019t lift his head. He didn\u2019t think she\u2019d been under the branch when it fell. Maybe she could get away.</p> <p>A feral cry of rage filled the icy air. That was Hope\u2019s voice, roughened with a battle cry. She was still alive.</p><p>One of the rust-colored beasts flew across the sky, landing out of his line of sight. Nicholas shoved at the branch. Pain exploded in Logan\u2019s hip, but he ignored it and helped Nicholas push.</p><p>The branch rocked but did not move.</p><p>The Handler stepped up onto the branch. Nicholas cried out in pain and swiped at the Handler\u2019s legs with his sword. The angle was awkward and he missed. The Handler snapped his chain whip, wrapping it around Nicholas\u2019s blade.</p><p>Nicholas jerked his arm back, trying to pull the Handler off balance. Logan smelled burning flesh and saw smoke rising from the sword\u2019s hilt.</p><p>Nicholas refused to let go. To give up his sword to a Synestryn could cause his entire life\u2019s work to be undone. A Theronai would die before he let that happen, and from the looks of it, that was exactly where this situation was heading.</p><p>The Handler stepped over them toward where Logan thought Hope was. His whip slithered away from Nicholas\u2019s blade, but the damage was done. The back of his hand was blistered, some of the flesh charred black. Logan could only imagine what the man\u2019s palm looked like.</p><p>Hope\u2019s terrified scream filled Logan\u2019s ears. Then suddenly, it was cut off.</p> <p>The Handler came back into view. Hope was draped over his shoulder. She was struggling weakly, her head hanging down over his back.</p><p>He stepped back onto the log, crushing them beneath it. Bone grated against bone, sending his nerve endings into a frenzy of agony. Logan strangled on a cry of pain.</p><p>Hope met his gaze. Her focus seemed off, but she was looking at his face. \u201cLogan,\u201d she whispered, reaching for him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t reach her hand. He couldn\u2019t touch her. The Synestryn was dragging her away and there was nothing he could do to stop it.</p><p>The Handler let out a shrill whistle, and the remaining demon came to heel.</p><p>His whip stuck out from his belt, looped in a neat bundle. As he stepped over the branch, Hope grabbed it and tossed it back over the branch. The wood started to smoke as the chain sank through it, burning its way down.</p><p>It was going to take only a few seconds to burn through. Then Logan could push the branch away and take Hope back.</p><p>And then the Handler broke into a run, sprinting away on its oddly jointed legs. It ran faster than Logan could have thought possible, disappearing into a stand of evergreens a few yards away.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d ordered Logan.</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Panic spread through Logan\u2019s blood, thickening it until his heart had to struggle for each beat. The chain burned so slowly it was maddening. Logan shoved with all his strength, needing to go after Hope.</p><p>Finally, the chain burned through and the section of branch holding Logan down became moveable. He pushed it up and slid out from under it. As soon as the weight was gone, the extent of his injuries became clear.</p><p>His pelvis was broken. So was one of his legs.</p><p>There was no time to do this gently, so he jerked the bones into place and knitted them together as fast as possible. It felt like someone had taken a blowtorch to his bones, but they fused together, leaving him panting and sweating.</p><p>He levered himself up and leaned over to check on Nicholas. He was unconscious. Now that Logan was closer, he could smell the man\u2019s blood being driven away by the wind.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t get them out of here, more demons would descend upon them and Logan was too weak to fight them off.</p><p>He stood, holding himself still while the dizziness passed, then reached down and lifted the burned end of the branch. He pivoted it off Nicholas.</p><p>The smell of blood grew. Logan wasted no time debating what he had to do. He knelt down beside Nicholas and lifted his arm to feed.</p><p>Blood flowed weakly into his mouth. He sent his senses out, sliding through Nicholas\u2019s veins until he found the openings. He closed them systematically, healing the worst ones first. It took only a few seconds to finish, but every one took Hope farther away from him.</p><p>He could still find her. Her blood was within him. He\u2019d always be able to find her. He simply wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d find her in time.</p><p>The need to run after her pounded at him, but he couldn\u2019t leave Nicholas here to die. There was no time to clean him up, so he dumped him onto the backseat of his SUV and got behind the wheel.</p><p>Logan dialed Dabyr. One of the Gerai answered.</p><p>\u201cI need help. Locate Nicholas\u2019s vehicle and send every Theronai in the area.\u201d</p><p>The woman on the other end of the line sounded young, but she responded to the emergency with a calm, even voice. \u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m tracking you now. Morgan is in your area. I\u2019ll guide him to you.\u201d</p><p>Logan hung up and focused on his driving\u2014on taking the roads that most closely corresponded to the path the Handler was taking overland.</p><p>The sun would be up soon and he\u2019d have to go into hiding. He had to find her before then. He\u2019d seen the things Synestryn had done to young women. That couldn\u2019t happen to Hope. He had to find a way to stop it. Before the sun rose and Hope was lost.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>Paul and Andra left for some emergency. Jackie had gone back to Dabyr with a pair of heavily armed Gerai. Baby Samson slept the whole way, waking only when she pulled him from his car seat.</p><p>His eyes opened, showing signs of the demon who\u2019d fathered him, but it was the only hint she could find that he wasn\u2019t fully human.</p><p>Jackie carried him inside, heading straight for her suite. She\u2019d already talked to Joseph, who had grudgingly allowed her to bring him here. She wasn\u2019t sure what these men thought an infant would do, but they all seemed to think he was like the others\u2014the children that had been born more Synestryn than human.</p><p>She\u2019d seen those things, and knew firsthand that Samson was different. He had no teeth or claws. He had no scales, no tentacles, no extra limbs. He was no threat and she was going to prove it.</p><p>Both Gerai followed behind her, lugging in the purchases she\u2019d asked them to make along the way. They needed a car seat for the ride, and while they were at it, she had them buy a few clothes and other essentials.</p><p>They laid everything inside her suite and left just as Joseph arrived at her door. He looked at the infant sitting quietly in the carrier, then back to her. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be? A baby can\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIain said you were attacked.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment rose in her cheeks. \u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cCan I see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim. You can see him so long as you don\u2019t call him an it.\u201d</p><p>Joseph crossed to the carrier and crouched beside it, moving as if he were nearing a box of live snakes.</p><p>\u201cSamson\u2019s not going to hurt you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Joseph lifted a brow and looked up at her. \u201cSamson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mother is dead. He needed a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Samson.\u201d Joseph unfastened the clips and eased the baby from the carrier. His big hands wrapped around him, making Samson look tiny and fragile. \u201cWhat do you propose we do with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of him. He\u2019s innocent. He deserves a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think it\u2019s a good idea to have a part-demon child running around, playing with all the humans?\u201d</p><p>Sadness made her limbs feel heavy. She slumped onto the couch. \u201cChances are he won\u2019t live that long. The human-looking babies never do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there are more like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere. Three that I know of. All of them died within a day or two of birth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you saw this? With your own eyes?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unable to speak past the lump of regret and pain in her throat.</p><p>Joseph carefully set the baby down and buckled the straps to hold him in place. He sat on the chair across from her, leaving plenty of distance between them. She was sure it wasn\u2019t an accident.</p><p>His voice was low and gentle. \u201cJackie, are you sure you want to put yourself through that again? Watching another baby die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t want to!\u201d she shouted, unable to contain the sudden roar of anger that erupted inside her.</p><p>Samson jumped and let out a squeal of fear.</p><p>Jackie gathered her emotions and got them back under control as she gathered up Samson in her arms. She jiggled him until he calmed down.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will help, but we\u2019ll get Tynan to look him over and see if there\u2019s anything that can be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sun,\u201d she said. \u201cHe needs to spend time in the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it combats whatever part of him is Synestryn. He doesn\u2019t seem to like it, but I think it might help him survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll make sure to mention that to Tynan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to insist that you let me place him with a family\u2014people who can watch out for him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can watch out for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can barely watch out for yourself.

You nearly shot Iain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was going to kill a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Synestryn.\u201d</p><p>Jackie held Samson out, forcing Joseph to look at him. \u201cDoes he look like a demon to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mother was human. Doesn\u2019t that count for something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt does, but I can\u2019t have him here. It\u2019s too great a risk. If he changes suddenly, he could attack someone. We have no way of knowing what might happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a baby!\u201d</p><p>Joseph grabbed her shoulders. She held Samson close to her chest, shielding him.</p><p>Joseph\u2019s grip lightened, and she could feel his ring humming through her shirt. His mouth was tight and he split his attention between her, the ring, and Samson.</p><p>\u201cListen to me. The people here are my responsibility. I will not risk them. Samson is a risk\u2014an unknown quantity. We need to put him somewhere where we can care for him and make sure that what we hope is true is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if it\u2019s not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss that with you now. We\u2019ll deal with the situation as it changes, but my decision is final. I\u2019ll place Samson in the home of a Gerai couple and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take him away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not yours. But you are one of our own\u2014a Theronai\u2014and like it or not, you have to abide by the rules like everyone else. It\u2019s the only way to keep everyone safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he goes, so do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t force you to stay. But you can\u2019t stay with Samson, either. You\u2019re already too attached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he needs someone, but it doesn\u2019t have to be you. It\u2019s not going to be you. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t understand any of this. She didn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d been taken captive two years ago. She didn\u2019t understand why they hurt all those young girls. She didn\u2019t understand why Samson\u2019s mother had to die, but most of all she didn\u2019t understand why she hadn\u2019t. Why had she survived when so many others had died?</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t let Samson be one more wasted life.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t kill him,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. But I will promise you that we will do everything in our power to see that he grows up safe, happy, and healthy. So long as he doesn\u2019t try to hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>She felt the weight of his vow settle over her, calming her nerves. \u201cHe won\u2019t. He\u2019s innocent. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I truly do.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hands for the baby. Jackie didn\u2019t want to let go, but every second she spent with him made it harder for her to give him up. If she didn\u2019t let him take Samson now, she might never be able to let go.</p><p>Jackie kissed his head and looked him in the eye. \u201cI know you\u2019re a good boy. You show everyone the truth, okay?\u201d</p><p>Samson blinked his pale blue eyes. There was no sign that he was anything but a normal, human boy and she prayed it would stay that way.</p><p>Joseph took the baby and buckled him into the carrier. He picked it up. \u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing. I know it\u2019s hard, but the right thing usually is.\u201d</p><p>Jackie hoped like hell he was right, because if he wasn\u2019t and Samson suffered, Joseph would as well. She\u2019d make sure of it.</p><p>Hope woke up. She was lying on a cold cement floor, shivering. She lifted her head, but her eyes had trouble focusing more than a foot or two away. Dizziness slammed into her, so she focused on taking slow, deep breaths. When she opened her eyes again, she saw a dark stain on the floor beneath her. Blood. Lots of it. There were layers, some older than others.</p><p>She struggled through her confusion, trying to figure out where she was.</p><p>Her situation came rushing back to her. The fight. Logan and Nicholas pinned under the tree branch. The pale, disgusting demon had grabbed her. The moment of strength she\u2019d felt when she\u2019d flung that furry wolf monster had disappeared, leaving her weak and shaking. She\u2019d barely been able to dislodge the fiery whip, leaving Logan at least a hope of escaping.</p><p>The ringing in her ears started to fade and she began to hear more than her own rapid heartbeat. There were voices nearby, but her eyes couldn\u2019t see more than blurry shapes surrounded by strange auras. The colors swirling around these people were dull, muted. Thick black tendrils wound through them, cutting off even the faintest flicker of hope before it could grow.</p><p>Slowly, her vision cleared, allowing her to see a group of mostly naked women sitting around a large black hole of nothingness. The aura of a powerful Synestryn.</p><p>That nothingness rose and came toward her, parting the group of women as he passed.</p><p>Hope shoved herself upright, but she was too weak to stand. She craned her neck up, staring at one of the most disgusting things she\u2019d ever seen. He had patchy skin that was part human, part reptile. His teeth looked like they\u2019d been filed to points. He had only three fingers on each hand, and they were tipped with thick, yellow claws. Maliciousness hung in his aura like a trophy, adding festering spots to the evil blackness that surrounded him.</p><p>He stared down at her, his posture screaming victorious arrogance. \u201cYou\u2019re awake. Just in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d she asked, her voice weaker than she would have liked.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Krag, but you will call me Master.\u201d</p><p>She forced out a harsh laugh. \u201cWow. Been watching a lot of B movies lately?\u201d</p><p>He jerked her to her feet, bringing her up to his face, so close she could smell rotting meat on his breath. \u201cYou will kneel before me. You will worship me. I am the master of all that you see, and you are in my sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall see.\u201d</p><p>His touch made her stomach roil in protest. His claws dug into the tender skin under her arm.</p><p>The desire to fight him off raged through her, but she was so weak, she could barely keep her knees from buckling. She wasn\u2019t sure what was wrong with her, but whatever it was, she had to get over it. Now.</p><p>Her head became too heavy to hold up and it slumped limply toward her chest.</p><p>\u201cNone of that now,\u201d said Krag. \u201cI want you awake and alert for what\u2019s next.\u201d</p><p>Whatever it was, Hope was certain she wanted no part in it. This monster was rotten from the core out, infecting everyone near him with the same malignance.</p><p>She was not going to let him do to her whatever it was he\u2019d done to these women. She was going to escape and take as many of these people with her as she could. Right after she was able to stand up under her own power.</p><p>His scaly, reptilian fingers cupped her chin, shoving her head up. Her eyes struggled to focus across the dimly lit space. The building was huge\u2014larger than she could see. Steel I beams supported the ceiling, which was easily twenty feet up. Large, industrial lights hung down, but they were off. The only light in the space came from dozens of candles scattered throughout. They sat on defunct workbenches and conveyor belts. Several giant wooden spools had been set up to act as tables. They were covered in pounds of melted wax and hundreds of spent candles.</p><p>Based on the dusty machinery and air-powered tools hanging above rows of benches, Hope guessed that this place had once been a factory of some kind.</p><p>Sitting in the middle of all of it was an ornate throne that looked like a movie prop. It was painted a gaudy gold and set up on a raised platform. Flanking it were wrought iron candelabras that were as tall as she was. Blood red candles burned bright, casting a wavering glow over the dozen or so women lounging on the chilly concrete floor.</p><p>Her first thought was that he could have at least given his harem a few pillows or something.</p><p>Beyond the throne she was able to make out vague shapes slinking around in the shadows. Some of them appeared human, but her eyes were too fuzzy to tell for sure. What she did know was that some of them were definitely not human. Their eerie green eyes, black auras, and glow-in-the-dark yellow saliva gave them away.</p><p>Part of her was scared out of her mind, but the rest of her was taking everything in, searching for a way out of this mess.</p><p>\u201cNice place,\u201d she quipped. \u201cCould use a woman\u2019s touch though.\u201d</p><p>Krag smiled, baring his fetid teeth. \u201cSave your touch for my cock.\u201d</p><p>That got through her sense of detachment. Just the thought of him looking at her in a sexual way made her stomach churn. \u201cPardon me while I throw up on your cloven hooves.\u201d</p><p>He shook her hard, jarring her teeth. \u201cYou will learn obedience. So will our children.\u201d</p><p>Children?</p><p>Hope shrank away from that thought, unable to process it. There was no way she\u2019d let him touch her like that. She\u2019d die first, even if she had to take her own life.</p><p>\u201cAh. Now I know how to reach you,\u201d he said. \u201cGood.\u201d He looked toward the shadows and ordered, \u201cBring them out.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, a man who appeared human walked away and came back with two more people. Their hands were bound behind their backs and their clothes were dirty and torn. There was something familiar about them, but in the darkness, with them a hundred feet away, she couldn\u2019t tell who they were.</p><p>Hope squinted, trying to make them out. Finally, her eyes cleared up enough that she could see them. Rory\u2019s pink hair was brown with filth, but her pretty face was unmistakable. As was Sister Olive\u2019s.</p><p>The floor seemed to evaporate. Hope\u2019s legs gave way in shock. Her head pounded. Sweat broke out over her skin.</p><p>This monster had her friends, her sweet, innocent friends. There would be no limits to what a monster like Krag would do to them. A sense of bleak, hopeless despair washed over her. There was nothing she wouldn\u2019t do to save them, which meant only one thing.</p><p>Krag had won.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>Logan pushed the vehicle to travel as fast as he dared over the backcountry roads.</p><p>Nicholas let out a stifled noise of pain, but Logan heard it anyway. He couldn\u2019t imagine how much the Theronai had to be suffering right now with his horrible burns.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could aid you,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he hissed. \u201cJust find Hope.\u201d</p><p>If Nicholas was in any shape to drive, Logan may have been able to help him, but his sword was still seared inside his grip, and based on the rate at which his heart was beating, his ability to focus on the road would have been dangerously limited.</p><p>\u201cI will help you as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, man. Just drive. I\u2019ll call for backup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they reach us in time?\u201d asked Logan, knowing Nicholas had access to the location of all Sentinel vehicles on his phone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re spread pretty thin. I\u2019m calling Joseph now to get him and any other men there to hop on the chopper.\u201d</p><p>The invisible pull Hope had on him seemed to be getting stronger, which meant they were getting closer. He guessed she\u2019d stopped moving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan could feel sunrise creeping up on him. Already there was a faint gray glow in the sky warning him of the approaching danger. He couldn\u2019t drive any faster or they\u2019d slide off the road. At least there was no traffic to impede their progress.</p><p>He took the next exit, hoping it would bring him closer to Hope\u2019s location. He had no idea which way the roads would go once he left the highway. He\u2019d have to slow down, but he hoped that what he lost in speed he\u2019d make up in distance by taking a more direct route.</p><p>They sped through a small town that was still sleeping. Past that was where he felt Hope the strongest, north of them. He barely noticed the buildings, nor did he care. His whole focus was on that faint connection he had to the woman he loved.</p><p>Just the thought of seeing her again, of smelling her skin and feeling her warmth, was enough to calm his nerves. He would find her. And once he did, he\u2019d find a way to save her, help or not.</p> <p>Nicholas groaned quietly, followed by a speeding of his pulse. He was used to pain, but this was different. The physical damage done to his body tonight was great. Logan hadn\u2019t healed any of it but the bleeding.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much good I\u2019m going to be in a fight,\u201d said Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll heal you as soon as we find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I like that idea, I think you might be better off just taking my blood and going after her solo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m covered in blood. They\u2019ll smell me as soon as we get close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou carry spare clothes, do you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing. We\u2019ll toss your bloody clothes out as a distraction. It will draw them away from Hope\u2019s location, giving us time to free her and get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m digging the positive thinking thing you\u2019ve got going here. Most of your kind would have jumped on my offer of blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of my kind don\u2019t need your sword to free the woman they\u2014\u201d He stopped himself before he said something he\u2019d regret.</p> <p>\u201cThe woman they what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou misheard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit I did. You love her. No shame in that.\u201d</p><p>No shame in love, perhaps, but certainly there was shame in choosing a woman over his duty to his people. Hope didn\u2019t need his love. There were others who could love her better than he. Thinking otherwise would simply make him a selfish, reckless fool. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t say that if you thought she was one of your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but she\u2019s not. She\u2019s yours. Anyone with eyes could see it in the way she looks at you.\u201d</p><p>Logan wanted that to be true. Part of him wanted to believe that there was something real between them, but the rest of him knew it didn\u2019t matter how she felt. They couldn\u2019t be together. He couldn\u2019t put his own selfish needs above the survival of his people. No matter how much he loved her.</p><p>Regret burned hot in his gut, making his words come out clipped and angry. \u201cWe will not speak of this again. We need to concentrate on getting her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Have it your way. If you\u2019ve got a plan, I\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p> <p>They were getting closer. The SUV sailed over some railroad tracks and suddenly, he could feel Hope on his left. He\u2019d just passed her.</p><p>Logan kept going another mile before he pulled over. He turned around in his seat and looked at Nicholas. The man was pale and sweating. His right hand was blackened around the hilt of his weapon, red and blistered everywhere else. Repairing that damage wasn\u2019t going to be easy.</p><p>\u201cGive me your left arm,\u201d he told the Theronai.</p><p>Nicholas offered up his wrist. Logan shoved his coat up, baring his vein.</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath,\u201d said Logan as he brought the other man\u2019s wrist to his mouth. \u201cThis is going to hurt.\u201d</p><p>Logan was getting closer. Hope could feel that familiar sunlight warmth he caused glowing along her skin.</p><p>She silently screamed for him to stay away, pleading with him not to come here. There were too many monsters here, too many humans under Krag\u2019s control. They would hurt him, use him against her, and then they\u2019d kill him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being the cause of his pain and death. She wanted him alive and happy, healing people and sticking his nose into their business.</p><p>What about all the happy couples he had yet to help create? If he came here, those people may never meet each other, may never fall in love.</p><p>Krag dragged her across the concrete floor, mostly carrying her. Hope\u2019s legs still weren\u2019t working right, and she was starting to wonder if the pounding in her skull was due to an injury she\u2019d sustained while being brought here.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember much about the trip\u2014just the cold and being jostled so hard she thought her teeth would fall out. The creature who\u2019d carried her had no regard for her comfort. He ran inhumanly fast, sloshing her about as he leapt over any obstacle in his path.</p><p>Maybe she had a concussion from all the jarring her brain had suffered. That would explain a lot.</p><p>For some reason, believing that made her feel better. A concussion was normal. Human. There was nothing magical about it. She just had to grit her teeth and get through this. So what if her movements were clumsy and her vision sucked? She\u2019d get better. She just had to hold herself together long enough to regain her strength and get out of this mess.</p><p>Krag had no idea that she got those odd bursts of power. She\u2019d bide her time and use it against him when he thought her weak.</p><p>Maybe if she killed him, all of these poor people under his control would snap out of it.</p><p>He let go of her arm and she slumped to the floor, unable to hold herself up. He grabbed a fistful of her hair and craned her neck back.</p><p>Sister Olive stood there, tears running down her sooty cheeks. Fuzzy strands of hair had worked their way free of her bun, and her clothing was singed in spots. Her mouth was moving in quiet prayer.</p><p>Rory stood next to her, the set of her jaw defiant. She glared at Krag. Her dark eyes glittered with the promise of vengeance. The muscles in her arms shifted as she tested the strength of her bonds.</p><p>Krag let go of Hope, and reached out to stroke Rory\u2019s face. She bit him. He jerked his scaly hand back, and she spit onto the floor.</p><p>Black blood leaked from the bite wound. Krag held his three-fingered hand close to his body and struck her across the face with the other hand. Her head whipped around so hard Hope cried out for her friend, worried he\u2019d broken Rory\u2019s neck.</p><p>That noise was a mistake.</p><p>Krag turned around slowly, a grin showing off sharp, pointed teeth. \u201cYou do care for the humans. Excellent. That will make this so much more enjoyable.\u201d</p><p>Anger and fear collided inside her, mashing together in an ugly, rancid pile in her stomach. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou warning me? You seem to lack an understanding of who, exactly, is in control. I shall educate you.\u201d</p><p>Hope could feel the malevolence surrounding him. She could see it swirling within the bleak nothingness of his aura, like rotten spots of decay. Before he even moved, she realized that the lesson he was about to teach her would be horrible. Irrevocable.</p><p>She tried to grab his leg to stop him, but he was already gone, too far away for her to reach.</p><p>Krag snatched Sister Olive from the hand of the human who held her, grabbed her bun, jerked her head back, and bit her neck, tearing into delicate flesh.</p><p>Sister Olive let out a strangled yell before falling deathly silent. The only sounds Hope could hear were the frenetic pounding of her heart and the sickening gulping sounds of that monster stealing Sister Olive\u2019s life.</p><p>Hope shoved herself to her feet and lurched for him. She was weak and her knees buckled as soon as she gained her feet. She slammed down into the concrete, hitting so hard her skin split against her kneecaps.</p><p>She didn\u2019t feel the blow. She was a hollow shell, with room for nothing but fear and rage.</p><p>Hope crawled over the floor, scurrying to do something\u2014anything\u2014to stop him. She grabbed his ankle, digging her fingernails into his skin.</p><p>He kicked her away, sending her skidding a few feet. She hit her head on a steel I beam. Her vision faltered for a moment and when it cleared, she saw Krag release Sister Olive\u2019s lifeless body.</p><p>The nun\u2019s face was fixed in horror. The skin of her throat was ravaged and bloody, and the rest of her was pale.</p><p>He\u2019d drained all of Sister Olive\u2019s blood. It had taken only a few seconds. A moment ago, she\u2019d been alive, with a fighting chance at survival, and now she was . . . gone.</p><p>Hope stared in shock, waiting to wake up and have this nightmare end. This wasn\u2019t the way things were supposed to be. She was supposed to fight back, defeat the villain, save the day. That was the way it went in movies.</p><p>This was definitely no movie. The woman Hope loved like a mother was dead. Forever. And this time there was no question whether she\u2019d survived. The proof of her death was staring Hope in the face, slicing at her, trying to penetrate the thick fog of shock that surrounded her.</p><p>Hope was lifted up by strong hands. Not Krag\u2019s, but someone else\u2019s. She didn\u2019t care whose.</p><p>Krag stood in front of her, only inches from Rory. Sister Olive\u2019s blood coated his chin and ran down his neck to wet his shirt. His teeth were stained by it.</p><p>He grabbed Rory\u2019s hair and jerked her head back, displaying her neck at an obscene angle. Rory grunted in pain and struggled to get away, but her efforts were futile. She was bound, and even if she hadn\u2019t been, she was no match for Krag\u2019s strength.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to issue another warning?\u201d he asked with an eerie calm, as if he already knew the answer. \u201cShall I kill her as well?\u201d</p><p>He would. There was no question in Hope\u2019s mind as to his earnestness. He wasn\u2019t a man. He had no soul. He was a demon.</p><p>And for some reason, he wanted Hope.</p><p>Rory was young. She had her whole life ahead of her and, perhaps even more important, she had a past. Hope didn\u2019t. Jodi and Sister Olive were the only two people who might miss her, and now Sister Olive was dead. Even Logan wouldn\u2019t really notice she was gone after a while. He\u2019d made it clear that he\u2019d planned to fix her up with some other man. That wasn\u2019t the action of someone who loved her.</p><p>If Hope didn\u2019t cooperate, Jodi could die, too. Krag had already managed to find her once. He could do it again. And even if he couldn\u2019t, Rory was here now. She would suffer. Maybe even die as Sister Olive had.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Hope. \u201cDon\u2019t kill her. Please.\u201d</p><p>Krag eased up and set his black, soulless gaze on Hope. \u201cPromise to obey me.\u201d</p><p>There was power in a bargain. She\u2019d felt it when she\u2019d promised Logan to meet Eric if he helped her find her missing friends. Now that their path had led her here, she could feel that bargain pushing her, making her worry more and more about whether she was going to be able to uphold her end. She didn\u2019t know if it worked both ways, but as weak as she was, it was worth a shot.</p><p>Hope chose her words carefully. \u201cIf you let Rory go and never harm her again, I\u2019ll cooperate so long as no one else gets hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe goes nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s clear you intend to kill her, in which case you\u2019ll have no one left for leverage.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His nostrils flared in anger. \u201cI\u2019ll kill her slowly. I\u2019ll make you watch her suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be dead either way,\u201d said Rory.</p><p>Krag jerked her head, making her gasp in pain. \u201cShut up! You are an animal. Meat.\u201d</p><p>False bravado was hard in the face of evil like him, but Hope didn\u2019t know what else to do. Logan was getting closer, and unless he had an army with him\u2014one he wouldn\u2019t have had time to gather\u2014once he was here, he was going to be another pawn for Krag to use against her.</p> <p>Hope squared her shoulders, carefully keeping her gaze away from Sister Olive\u2019s body. She shoved as much strength as she could into her words. \u201cLet Rory go or you\u2019ll never get what you want.\u201d</p><p>Krag released her and stalked over to loom over Hope. \u201cAre you saying you\u2019ll give me what I want? Unquestioning obedience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt anyone. You can never make me do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said, confidence dripping from his words like the bloody saliva from his teeth. \u201cBut I accept your bargain. The meat will go free and you will be mine.\u201d</p><p>A crushing weight slammed down onto her, driving the breath from her lungs. She didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d done to her, but she wasn\u2019t going to live through it for long. She sucked in a wheezing breath. Dark spots formed in her vision. Krag jerked her to her feet.</p> <p>He bent over her. His stench made her gag. She couldn\u2019t breathe. She felt his hot breath hit her neck and a moment later, all she felt was pain as his teeth ripped into her skin.</p><p>Searing cold slid through her veins, burning them as some kind of toxin sped through her. Her heart slowed. Sweat broke out over her limbs and she started to shake.</p><p>Krag shoved her head back until her spine felt like it would snap. With a deep growl of anger, he pulled back, his teeth coated in her blood.</p><p>Revulsion shook her to her soul and her stomach heaved. Hunger twisted his face, and she knew that while he may have been able to stop himself this time, the next time he might not.</p><p>Hope couldn\u2019t face the thought of dying by his hands like that. Her blood was Logan\u2019s. Letting this monster have even a drop felt like a deep betrayal. Not that she could stop him from doing it again.</p><p>Rory was led away by a human. She was screaming something Hope couldn\u2019t hear over the roar of her own heartbeat.</p> <p>Dizziness weighed her down. Krag\u2019s horrible face filled her field of vision. He was smiling, pleased with himself.</p><p>He lifted his hand and placed his reptilian fingers on her temple. A cold, searing pain whipped through her head, like being stabbed with knives made of ice.</p><p>Dark, twisted images flickered through her thoughts. Sinister, alien impulses invaded her. The urge to hunt and kill surged inside her, making her legs twitch with the need to run. Her senses sharpened until she could hear the heartbeats of every creature nearby. The pumping rush of blood through their veins made her mouth water and her hands flex in preparation for digging her nails into their flesh. Hunger bore down on her, hollowing out her insides until the need for blood writhed inside her, demanding to be appeased.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she heard Krag whisper over her thoughts. \u201cMy vicious, hungry bride.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>Logan was close. He could feel Hope, smell a faint hint of her skin on the breeze.</p><p>She was inside the run-down factory across the street. He\u2019d circled it, making sure he\u2019d pinpointed her location before wasting time breaking in.</p><p>Nicholas was in bad shape. Logan had managed to patch the worst of his injuries, but the blood he\u2019d needed to take had left Nicholas drained and weak\u2014too weak to stand, much less fight. The warrior was sweating and shaking, but Logan thought he\u2019d at least saved the man\u2019s hand from amputation. It was a long way from usable, but was the best he could do under the circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go in there alone,\u201d said Nicholas, his voice trembling with fatigue.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice. Sunrise is coming soon. I can\u2019t wait for reinforcements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul and Andra are on their way. So are others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t be here soon enough. There\u2019s no end to the damage Krag could cause in the time it would take them to get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to go in alone and die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to scout out the situation. If there\u2019s an opportunity for me to grab her and run, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a fighter,\u201d said Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cFor her I am. I\u2019d do anything for her. Be anything for her.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nodded. \u201cKeep your phone with you. I\u2019ll be able to track your movements.\u201d</p><p>Logan made sure it was silenced, then shoved it into his jeans pocket. He found a spare sword stashed in back with the rest of Nicholas\u2019s supplies. It wasn\u2019t a Theronai blade. It wasn\u2019t imbued with any magic he could sense. It was common and simple, but it was better than nothing\u2014certainly better than relying on what little power he had left in his blood.</p><p>\u201cI plan to go in from the west. This close to sunrise I\u2019ll probably only have human guards to contend with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill them.\u201d</p><p>He could. His vow to protect humans ended where the threat to Hope began. \u201cKilling them would draw too much attention. I have better ways to dispatch them.\u201d</p><p>Logan made sure the engine was running and Nicholas had some bottled water nearby. If Hope made it out without him, at least she\u2019d have a way of getting free.</p><p>Once the sun was up, Logan was trapped indoors with the Synestryn until sunset. Assuming he lived that long.</p><p>Logan slipped around the building to the back. He smelled dozens of Synestryn nearby, within the building. There had to be a way in and out for them\u2014one that probably involved a simple hole through the steel siding.</p><p>Instead of a hole, he found a dock door partially open, the entrance covered with heavy rubber flaps. The stink of demons clung to the area and there were trails of mud, blood, and filth staining the concrete below.</p><p>He held his breath and listened. The sky had lightened to a pale gray, signaling dawn. His instincts screamed at him to rush inside and escape the sun, but haste now could get him killed.</p><p>Logan parted the rubber flaps with the tip of his sword. A few feet away from the opening was a tall stack of wooden crates\u2014likely a screen against any possible rays of sunlight that might filter in. He saw no signs of demons or humans. He could smell them, he could even hear the heartbeat of at least two humans nearby, but that was all.</p><p>He eased himself up and through the opening. He crouched behind the crates, listening for signs of guards. After a few seconds, he was able to locate those heartbeats. They were on the other side of the crates. Definitely human.</p><p>Logan shielded himself from sight and scratched on the wood.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d asked one of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>A man came around the wall of crates, squinting into the darkness. Silently, he urged the man forward.</p><p>He was young, maybe twenty-five. His clothes were dirty and his hair hadn\u2019t been cut in months. He was too thin, as if he\u2019d simply forgotten to eat. Ragged bite marks marred his throat where he\u2019d been fed on by demons.</p><p>The question was, did he contain any of their blood? If so, feeding from him would only weaken Logan further. But if the man was blooded and his blood was clean, he could give Logan the strength he needed to help rescue Hope.</p><p>Logan scratched again, luring the man forward. Two steps later, he was in reach.</p><p>Logan dropped the shield and caught the man\u2019s gaze. Pale light spilled out over the young man\u2019s face, accentuating the gaunt hollows under his cheeks.</p><p>The other guard\u2019s heartbeat picked up. \u201cJeff?\u201d</p><p>Logan held the man still and silent while he willed him into a deep sleep.</p><p>The second guard came around the crates. This one was bigger, healthier. He had only one bite mark on his neck and it was recent. He hadn\u2019t been here long. Perhaps not long enough to become infected.</p><p>Logan was visible, and as soon as the man saw Jeff lying at his feet, he pulled in a breath to raise the alarm.</p><p>Logan was at his side in an instant, cutting off that scream with a tight grip on his throat. Panic hammered inside the man\u2019s chest, giving him added strength.</p><p>Before it was too late, Logan took hold of the human\u2019s mind and control over his body. Inside the man was screaming, but outside he was still and compliant.</p><p>Logan scored a small cut on his neck and breathed deeply.</p><p>He was blooded. Clean of Synestryn infection. He would do nicely.</p><p>Logan bit deep and sucked the man\u2019s blood into himself. There wasn\u2019t much power here to be had, but every little bit would help.</p><p>He took enough to render the guard unconscious, then eased him to the ground next to Jeff. The two of them would remain here for hours.</p><p>Logan shielded himself from sight again and eased around the wall of crates. There was a brief maze of twists and turns, but with every step he drew closer to Hope.</p><p>Someone approached from around the next turn. Logan stood still and held his breath.</p><p>A woman rounded the corner and came to an abrupt stop. She was wearing a strip of dirty lace wrapped around her hips and nothing else. Her skin was pale, streaked with red from infection. Puffy bite marks covered her neck, arms, and breasts. The smell of rotting skin nearly gagged him.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe master knows you came for the woman.\u201d</p><p>Logan said nothing, refusing to reveal his presence.</p><p>She jerked, then stiffened, and her eyes turned black and her lips curled back from her teeth. \u201cShow yourself, leech,\u201d she hissed in a voice not her own. \u201cWe shall bargain for your woman.\u201d</p><p>Someone else was controlling her. Krag.</p><p>Logan hesitated. The woman\u2019s eyes cleared and she shook herself. Tears slid down her dirty cheeks. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t defy him. He\u2019ll kill her.\u201d</p><p>Logan couldn\u2019t let that happen. He released the shield. \u201cWhat do you want in return for her freedom?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s mouth stretched obscenely around a grin. Her eyes blackened and that hissing voice vibrated out of her mouth. \u201cYour blood. All of it.\u201d</p><p>Logan had expected no less. He was more than willing to trade his life for Hope\u2019s, but he had to be careful that his sacrifice wasn\u2019t in vain. All he really needed to do was buy enough time for the Theronai to arrive, kill Krag, and release himself from any bargain he made. Of course, staying alive that long was going to be difficult.</p><p>The woman doubled over, coughing, and spat blood onto the floor. It was too dark to be fully human blood. She\u2019d been tainted, the same way Hacksaw had.</p><p>When she spoke, her words were slow and halting, her breath wheezing out of her lungs. Black swirled in her eyes, and Logan could sense some kind of internal struggle going on within the woman. Krag was controlling her\u2014using her to communicate\u2014and she didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Her mouth opened as if someone had pried it. \u201cSurrender yourself and I will free the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnharmed,\u201d demanded Logan. \u201cShe goes free before you take so much as a drop of my blood.\u201d</p><p>The woman shuddered and clenched her head between her hands. \u201cAgreed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVow it. Make it binding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . promise,\u201d she whispered, and crumpled to the ground.</p><p>Logan nodded, bracing himself for the weight of their bargain. It slammed down into him, rocking him back on his feet. He stumbled for a moment before finally regaining his balance.</p><p>The woman stood up, turned, and walked away, her movements rigid and artificial, like a puppet.</p> <p>Logan followed her, keeping his sword at the ready. Krag would look for a way out of their bargain. He could have one of his minions attack and kill Logan, freeing him from his promise to release Hope. Logan could not trust this demon beyond the letter of their vow.</p><p>The woman led him to an open area full of Dorjan and demons. Candles lit the space, circling a gaudy throne on a raised platform. Krag sat atop that throne. Kneeling at his feet was Hope.</p><p>Her head was in his lap, and he stroked her hair, petting her like a dog. A dazed look filled her golden eyes as she stared off into space. There was a raw, angry bite wound on her neck, and two burn marks the size of Krag\u2019s fingerprints on her temple.</p><p>Krag had already damaged her, taken her blood, altered her mind.</p><p>Rage boiled from a deep, hidden recess in Logan\u2019s soul. He hadn\u2019t promised not to kill Krag, only that the demon could have his blood in exchange for Hope\u2019s release. The first chance he got, he was going to rip that monster\u2019s head from his neck, even if he had to do it with his bare hands.</p> <p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d Logan ordered.</p><p>Krag snapped his fingers, and the woman who\u2019d escorted Logan hurried over to Hope\u2019s side. She pulled Hope to her feet, helping her stand. Hope trembled, her whole body shaking as she gained her balance.</p><p>Whatever Krag had done to her had damaged her enough she hadn\u2019t even noticed Logan\u2019s presence.</p><p>Krag stood from his throne and walked over to the pair of women. He grabbed the head of the woman who had served as his messenger and twisted it until her neck broke.</p><p>The woman fell to the ground.</p><p>\u201cI guess her bargain with you no longer applies,\u201d he said, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cShe spoke on your behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you only assumed she did. You know what they say about assumptions.\u201d Krag\u2019s hand twitched in a small motion.</p><p>Synestryn slid out from the shadows, closing in on Logan. They were all shapes and sizes, from ones he could stomp under his boot, to powerfully built, canine-shaped creatures, to a couple who walked upright and looked startlingly human.</p><p>Logan lifted his sword. He slashed at them as they came within range, but there were too many. They came at him from all sides.</p><p>Something bit his leg, stinging him with poison. Another one stuck him from behind, ripping his skin open. The smell of his blood drove them into a frenzy. His sword was ripped away and hard, strong hands took control of his arms. He lashed out with his booted feet, but no matter how many he sent flying, there were more to take their place.</p><p>Tiny, serrated teeth sank into his flesh. He felt their poison setting in fast, weakening him.</p><p>Logan searched for sight of Hope. He knew he wasn\u2019t strong enough to survive this much poison.</p><p>He\u2019d failed her.</p> <p>Chapter 30</p><p>Inside, Hope was screaming, struggling for control of her body. But it didn\u2019t listen to her. It did exactly what Krag wanted. And right now, he wanted her to watch Logan die.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d he shouted, parting the sea of black nothingness surrounding Logan. \u201cSecure him over there.\u201d</p><p>Krag stroked her back, and she wasn\u2019t even in control of herself enough to shiver in revulsion at his touch. Somehow, he\u2019d bypassed her free will and she had no idea how to get it back.</p><p>Logan was taped to a steel beam. His shirt had been slashed in so many places, it hung in tatters on his body. His blood leaked from dozens of bite and claw wounds; the honeysuckle scent cleansed the stench of this place.</p><p>Hope sucked in a deep breath, and somehow it helped reconnect her mind and body for an instant. Her hand twitched, clenching into a fist. She hid it quickly, refusing to let Krag know he wasn\u2019t in complete control.</p><p>He left her side and grabbed up a cup from the arm of his throne. It was silver, the stem formed by a trio of women holding the cup in their outstretched arms. He pulled a dagger from his belt and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cTake it,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Hope did. Her hand moved toward the handle and there was nothing she could do to stop it. She knew what came next. She could see it in the evil plumes of excited anticipation swirling in his aura. He was going to make her use that dagger on Logan.</p><p>I won\u2019t hurt him, her mind screamed. Her mouth said nothing.</p><p>The metal was cold. She gripped it so hard it bit into her skin. The point was wickedly sharp, and a long groove ran down the length of the blade.</p><p>Krag dragged her over to Logan. She tried to fight, but whatever he\u2019d done to her was strong\u2014too strong for her to resist.</p><p>One reptilian finger pointed to a spot on his neck halfway between Logan\u2019s ear and his shoulder. \u201cThere, I think. Not too deep, now. We don\u2019t want him bleeding out right away.\u201d</p><p>Hope\u2019s hand lifted. The dagger shone in the candlelight, trembling with her frantic efforts to fight Krag\u2019s will. The tip moved to Logan\u2019s neck, hovering above the skin.</p><p>\u201cFight him,\u201d said Logan as his pale eyes met hers. \u201cYou\u2019re stronger than he is.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t. Her hand kept inching closer, that wicked blade moving closer to his skin.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine now,\u201d said Krag. \u201cWe had a deal and now she\u2019s a good, obedient toy.\u201d</p><p>No. Hope wasn\u2019t. She could never do anything to hurt Logan. She loved him.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d whispered Logan, his voice growing weaker by the second.</p><p>His confession of love swelled inside her, giving her the strength to fight. The blade\u2019s progress stopped. She was shaking hard enough she wasn\u2019t sure how she stayed on her feet, but at least she wasn\u2019t hurting Logan.</p><p>Krag leaned down next to Logan\u2019s ear. \u201cShe\u2019s mine now. Her blood is rich\u2014rich enough I bet she\u2019ll be able to bear my children. I want you to imagine that while you die. Imagine me fucking the woman you love.\u201d</p><p>Hope\u2019s stomach heaved. Like hell that would happen. She\u2019d die before she let him touch her like that.</p><p>Krag turned to her and let out a bellow of rage. \u201cDo it!\u201d he commanded.</p><p>A grating whine screeched through her mind and she felt the weight of the promise she\u2019d given him bearing down on her again. Her head pounded. The room spun. She couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cDo it!\u201d came Krag\u2019s imperious voice again.</p><p>Her hand moved. She screamed inside, but no sound came out. The tip of the blade touched Logan\u2019s skin. He sucked in a breath, but didn\u2019t look away from her. Not even when she pushed harder and cut him open.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. Not your fault,\u201d whispered Logan.</p><p>But it was. She\u2019d made a deal with the devil, and now Logan was the one to pay the price for her stupidity.</p><p>Krag let out a satisfied laugh and pressed his cup under the wound. Blood flowed freely into the cup for a few seconds before the wound shut.</p><p>Hope watched it close before her eyes and let out a relieved breath. He was still strong enough to heal himself.</p><p>Krag raised his cup to Logan. \u201cHeal yourself all you like. The longer you last, the more fun we\u2019ll have.\u201d He stroked Hope\u2019s hair. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, my pet?\u201d</p><p>He wanted her to answer. She could feel that answer bubbling up inside her, but she clenched her teeth around it, refusing to let it free.</p><p>Krag sipped from the cup casually, as if it weren\u2019t Logan\u2019s life filling it. \u201cI asked you a question. I demand an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck . . . you,\u201d she shoved out past the grating compulsion in her head. He would not control her. She needed to be free to act and get both herself and Logan out of here.</p><p>Krag slapped her across the face, sending her flying to the floor. Logan\u2019s feet were in her field of vision. She was close enough to touch him. Maybe even undo his bonds.</p><p>But where would he go? The sun was up. She could feel it rising, giving her strength to fight Krag\u2019s hold on her. She didn\u2019t understand how she knew it\u2014the whole building was dark, all the windows blacked out with thick layers of paint\u2014but she did.</p><p>She tasted blood and realized her teeth had cut her lip. She wiped it away and heard a faint groan coming from Logan. She looked up and saw his eyes focused on her hand, a hungry light spilling down across her skin.</p><p>Her blood. If she could give him her blood, he\u2019d be strong enough to free them both.</p><p>Hope sat there on the cold floor, her mind spinning with some way to trick Krag into letting her get close enough to feed Logan.</p><p>She reached up and grabbed Logan\u2019s legs, using his body to pull herself up to her feet. She pressed against him, feeling the heat of his skin. His tattered shirt was stained with blood, and this close, she could see the poisonous effects of the bites they\u2019d inflicted on him. Red streaks spread out from the wounds, just beneath his skin.</p><p>This was all her fault. If she hadn\u2019t been captured and forced Logan to come here to save her, he\u2019d still be safe and sound. She couldn\u2019t regret loving him. She couldn\u2019t even regret meeting him. He\u2019d turned her world upside down, but without him, she\u2019d still be living a lie, pretending the world was no more than what she saw on the surface.</p><p>Most of what she\u2019d seen was ugly and cruel, but not Logan. He was beautiful and selfless and noble. He spent his life helping others find the kind of happiness he himself could never have. It was sad, but there was a beauty in what he did\u2014what he was forced to do to manage inside such an ugly world. Rather than stealing life, he helped create it.</p><p>Krag\u2019s hold on her mind urged her to move away. She heard his command ringing in her head, pounding at her skull to obey.</p><p>She refused.</p><p>She brought her wrist to Logan\u2019s mouth. She didn\u2019t need to tell him what to do and he wasted no time in biting through her skin.</p><p>Pleasure streaked up her arm and settled in her chest. She could no longer feel Krag\u2019s pull on her. She was free of his presence, for a few brief, peaceful seconds.</p><p>Her body flew backward. She landed inside a pile of women. One of them cried out in pain.</p><p>Krag had ripped her away from Logan and was now stalking toward her, his black eyes wide with fury. \u201cYou feed only me. Your blood is mine.\u201d</p><p>He reached down and grabbed her by the throat, jerking her up to her feet. He shook her, making her body flail in the air.</p><p>Pain shot down her spine until her legs went numb. He picked up the dagger and dragged her over the floor until she was at Logan\u2019s feet.</p><p>He ripped open Logan\u2019s tattered shirt and plunged the dagger into his chest.</p><p>Logan\u2019s cry of pain echoed off the high ceiling. His body tensed and the tendons in his neck stood out in his agony.</p><p>Hope stared in shock, unable to process what had just happened. Logan wasn\u2019t even supposed to be here. How could this be happening?</p><p>Krag yanked out the knife, and a bright river of blood ran down Logan\u2019s chest.</p><p>Panic crushed the breath from her lungs. Logan was dying. Because she\u2019d tried to save him.</p><p>A wounded sound rose from her lips, full of anguish and grief. \u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have defied me,\u201d said Krag, pulling her up by her hair.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stand. She couldn\u2019t even feel her legs. Everything had gone numb.</p><p>\u201cNow take back what you gave him,\u201d the monster ordered her, then shoved her face against Logan\u2019s chest.</p><p>Blood wet her cheeks, her lips. The sweet, calming scent of it rose up, comforting her and ridding her of her shock.</p> <p>She was going to kill Krag for taking Logan away from her. She was going to make him suffer and feed him to the demons.</p><p>From the shadows, she heard a chorus of hungry growls. Eerie green eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cDrink,\u201d he demanded, jerking on her hair.</p><p>A heavy wheezing sound echoed inside Logan\u2019s chest. His lung had been punctured.</p><p>Krag grabbed her face with his reptilian hand and pried her jaws apart. Logan\u2019s blood hit her tongue, but instead of being repulsed by it, she felt something else.</p> <p>It was like the pieces of a giant puzzle had suddenly clicked into place. Something within her\u2014something hidden and asleep\u2014woke up and pulled in a deep breath. It stretched and unfurled itself inside her, growing until she was sure she\u2019d burst under the strain.</p><p>Power soaked into her cells, changing them. The numbness in her legs disappeared. The crack in one of her vertebra that she hadn\u2019t even known was there healed up. The wound on her neck closed; the infection that had begun to spread was eradicated. She could see it happening in her mind even as she felt it in her body.</p><p>And then the wall around her memories began to crumble. Things she\u2019d never been able to touch were there, waiting for her to remember.</p><p>She saw strange places and faces. The sky burned a bright orange and there were two suns blazing on the horizon. There were no buildings here, no roads. A cluster of rough cabins stood under a canopy of giant trees. The leaves were bluish and so shiny they looked almost metallic. She looked down and found a nut lying on the ground. It was different from any she\u2019d ever seen before, but she somehow still recognized it. An instant later, an old woman with a smooth face that hid her years handed that nut back to Hope. Her name had been burned into it\u2014a token of remembrance so she wouldn\u2019t feel so empty in her new life. If she had a name, she had people who loved her enough to give her one.</p><p>Hope had held on to that thought as she\u2019d allowed that woman to build the wall and hide all those memories from her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what any of this meant\u2014whether it was real or some kind of hallucination caused by Logan\u2019s blood. What she did know was that she was going to get them out of this. She wasn\u2019t going to find her past now only to lose it to some asshole demon.</p> <p>Hope lifted her head. She pressed her hand to Logan\u2019s wound, following instincts she hadn\u2019t even known she had.</p><p>His flesh closed up under her touch. His eyes flared in surprise he quickly hid. She could hear his heartbeat now, faint but steady. He kept his head down, but she could hear a slight tearing sound behind him as he freed himself from the tape.</p><p>Krag stared at her, eyes narrowed in suspicion. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>His power over her dissipated like smoke on the wind. Her mind was her own and he couldn\u2019t touch it. Not anymore.</p><p>Krag\u2019s demons closed in around them, forming a circle of fangs and teeth and claws. She didn\u2019t know how she was going to fight them all off.</p><p>Logan broke free and flew at Krag, knocking the demon to the floor. He was thin, his ribs showing clearly beneath his skin. And he was still wounded\u2014covered in festering bite marks. There was no way he was strong enough to defeat Krag.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d shouted Logan.</p><p>Hope couldn\u2019t. She knew it would be a death sentence for Logan if she did. He needed her help.</p> <p>Frantically, she searched for a way to fight off the encroaching monsters. They were only a few feet away now, and she had the distinct impression that once Krag was dead, no one would control them.</p><p>Hope grabbed Logan\u2019s shirt and used a candle to light it on fire. She tossed it toward one hideous beast that was getting too close for comfort, and then picked up the dagger.</p><p>Krag roared, letting out an inhuman sound of pain. Logan stumbled back, holding a black, slimy mass in his fist. Krag\u2019s heart.</p><p>The demon twitched, bleeding onto the floor.</p><p>The group of women who had sat still and silent through this whole ordeal began to cry and scream.</p><p>The circle of Synestryn tightened.</p><p>Hope grabbed Logan\u2019s arm to hold him up. \u201cWe need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold them off,\u201d panted Logan. \u201cYou run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fight them off. I can only slow them down. And I can\u2019t go in the sun with you. Another Warden will come and kill everything in sight.\u201d</p><p>Hope looked up at the painted windows.</p><p>Logan saw her do it and said, \u201cWe might not make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see a choice.\u201d</p><p>A demon lunged at Logan and he kicked it back into the group. \u201cDo it. Fast.\u201d</p><p>Hope gathered up all the strength she could and hurled the dagger at one of the high windows. It shattered, letting sunlight and fresh air spill in.</p><p>Demons hissed, cringing back from the light.</p><p>A shaft of light hit the concrete directly to their left. Logan stepped into it and pulled Hope in for a tight hug.</p><p>The air vibrated until she could feel it in her chest. Searing brightness filled the room, blinding her for a moment.</p><p>She held on to Logan\u2019s body, hiding her face in the crook of his neck.</p><p>The sound of wind chimes and breaking glass exploded around them. Demons screamed.</p><p>Something warm and soft surrounded her. She opened her eyes to see the bluish light of one of Logan\u2019s shields. It spread out over them and the sobbing women who were staring in shock at the slaughter.</p><p>The Warden\u2019s swords slashed through the air, hitting something with every strike. Black blood rained down over them only to roll off of Logan\u2019s shield.</p><p>Hope felt his body shaking as he grew weaker. The urge to feed him swelled inside her, forcing her to act. She pulled his head down to her throat, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be able to resist.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. One arm tightened around her while he pierced her skin and drank.</p><p>The fight no longer mattered. The abused, broken women winked out of existence. The Warden and the demons and the rain of black blood became inconsequential. All she cared about, all she could feel was Logan\u2019s mouth tugging on her throat, his tongue stroking her skin and his body growing stronger as he held her.</p><p>It ended too soon. His mouth pulled away and she sagged in his hold, unwilling to step back away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe now,\u201d he whispered into her ear.</p><p>Safe? Hope looked up. The Warden had made quick work of the demons, and what it hadn\u2019t killed, the sun had left smoking in ashy piles. The women were huddled together nearby, safely inside Logan\u2019s shield. At some point, he\u2019d moved her into the shadows, leaving that glowing beam of sunshine.</p><p>One of the steel walls of the building was buckled in. A truck had rammed into it, breaking it open from the outside. A tall woman in black leather stood next to a man with a sword. Her hand was raised, and a few feet away, floating inside a giant, translucent bubble was the Warden.</p><p>\u201cCover your ears,\u201d shouted the woman.</p><p>Logan\u2019s hands came down over her ears an instant before an enormous boom shattered the Warden into pretty shards of crystal.</p><p>\u201cClear,\u201d yelled the woman.</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d said Logan a bit too loudly, as though he couldn\u2019t hear himself.</p><p>\u201cHandy friends.\u201d</p><p>The woman tossed Logan a metallic survival blanket folded into a neat rectangle. \u201cCover up. Nicholas is waiting outside with the pink-haired girl.\u201d</p><p>Rory.</p><p>Relief weakened Hope for a moment, but she suffered through that weakness, thankful that her friend had been spared.</p><p>Unlike Sister Olive.</p><p>The nun\u2019s body was where Krag had dropped it, staring up into the sunlight. Grief choked Hope and she had to swallow twice to ease the tightness in her throat. \u201cI have to take care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will. We won\u2019t leave her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead and get out of the sun. I\u2019ll take care of her,\u201d said Hope. It was only fitting, since Sister Olive had taken care of her all these years.</p><p>Logan touched her face, so gently it brought tears to her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone. My friends will care for you.\u201d His tone sounded suspiciously like a farewell.</p><p>\u201cWill you come find me after sunset?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI cannot. One of the others will take you to Eric. He\u2019ll make you happy.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his arm to keep him from walking away. \u201cI don\u2019t want Eric. I want you.\u201d</p><p>His gaze roamed her face as if memorizing it. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJust . . . don\u2019t.\u201d And then he turned and walked away, huddling inside the metallic blanket and out of sight.</p><p>Hope stood there, letting the chaos pass around her. He\u2019d said he loved her. It hadn\u2019t been a lie. She would have seen that kind of deception flare in his aura.</p><p>Sadly, love wasn\u2019t as important to him as duty. And because she loved him, she had to let him do what was going to make him happy. Being with her wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>Not even the heavy lethargy of midday could lull Logan to sleep. It had been three days since he\u2019d slept, three days since he\u2019d last seen Hope.</p><p>Tynan had taken over her care, ensuring she didn\u2019t ovulate while Logan\u2019s blood was still pumping through her system. Tynan had also seen to her placement in Project Lullaby. He and Alexander had arranged for her meeting with Eric.</p><p>Reportedly, she\u2019d tried to kill him with a butter knife.</p><p>Tynan said he had another man in mind for her\u2014one a bit more refined and less barbaric. Whomever the man was, Logan hoped he knew how lucky he was.</p><p>Logan rose from his bed, washed, dressed, and went upstairs to find something to occupy his thoughts.</p><p>Hope was probably already with this man, starting her new life with him. Forgetting all about Logan and the time they\u2019d shared.</p><p>Jealousy twisted inside him, grating against his already raw nerves. It was unfortunate that jealousy would get them no closer to discovering why the power in Hope\u2019s blood seemed to cling to Logan\u2019s cells. None of the other Sanguinar had been able to extract any power from the blood he\u2019d offered them, and they needed to determine if this was a new development.</p><p>If so, their job of finding rich blood sources was going to become much more difficult, since no one Sanguinar could dependably identify a source.</p><p>He went to Tynan\u2019s lab, hoping to offer his services in some way. The need to be of use and end his heartache gave him a sense of urgency he couldn\u2019t contain, but he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being around people right now. His mood was too bleak and grating. With all the tragedy that had struck them recently, Logan dared not spread around his negative thoughts for fear of the consequences on the humans here at Dabyr.</p><p>The humans who\u2019d been Krag\u2019s captives had been sorted out and dealt with appropriately. Those who were not Dorjan and had not been with him long had their memories erased. Those whose minds couldn\u2019t be cleansed were residing here at Dabyr, picking up the pieces of their shattered lives. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The few Dorjan whose minds were too infected to ever be free again were housed below Dabyr in the prison cells where they would live out the rest of their artificially brief lives. Most of them would be mad within a month. He\u2019d never known a captured Dorjan to last more than a year before their bodies simply gave out. For them, death was a blessing that couldn\u2019t come too soon.</p><p>Jodi was safe, living with her parents while the photography studio was rebuilt. Rory had disappeared, probably back onto the streets.</p><p>Now that the homeless shelter was gone, Logan wondered where she\u2019d sleep.</p><p>An idea began to form in his mind, taking wing and offering him a small blanket of solace. He may never again be able to see Hope, but he knew exactly how to honor her memory.</p> <p>Tynan let him into the lab, set out some samples of blood for him to study, and left.</p><p>It was Hope\u2019s blood on those slides. Logan could smell her fragile scent filling his head. He tried to convince himself that never seeing her again was the best. For both of them. The lie left him feeling restless and edgy.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t concentrate on his work. He kept staring into the microscope, searching Hope\u2019s blood for something that wasn\u2019t there\u2014a way he could have her in his life. Forever.</p><p>Tynan came back into the lab, and instantly, Logan knew he\u2019d been with her. Hope\u2019s scent clung to him. She\u2019d been afraid.</p><p>Logan shoved his chair back and faced Tynan, teeth bared. \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. She\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p><p>Tynan let out a heavy sigh. \u201cI found another match for her. He\u2019s here at Dabyr. She wasn\u2019t sure things would work out as I promised, so she was a bit apprehensive. It\u2019s perfectly natural\u2014nothing for you to worry about.\u201d</p><p>But he would. He knew he would. He\u2019d worry about her welfare every second of every day for the rest of his life.</p> <p>How could he not when he loved her so desperately? And how could he remain here, under this roof, knowing she was here as well? With another man.</p><p>Logan\u2019s body was an angry, alien beast. He lurched up from his seat, knocking the microscope to the floor.</p><p>\u201cEither let me remove your memories of the woman or go home,\u201d ordered Tynan, his tone final. \u201cI can\u2019t work around you when you\u2019re like this.\u201d</p><p>Rage made his limbs shake. \u201cYou will never take my memories of her away. They are all I have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen leave. I cannot tolerate your destructive tendencies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to keep busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead a book. Watch TV. Just please leave me to work in peace.\u201d</p><p>Tynan was right. As fevered as Logan\u2019s emotions were right now, he feared what he might do. If he didn\u2019t keep to himself, someone might get hurt. It was best he stayed isolated until he had better control over himself. Assuming he ever would.</p> <p>He went back to his suite to pack. He had to leave this place, hole up in a Gerai house for a while.</p><p>He stopped in the hall at his doorway. Hope\u2019s scent lingered in the air, as if she\u2019d passed this way.</p><p>His heart raced and he hardened in a fast rush. He never should have lain with her. While it had been exquisite, he now knew exactly what he was missing\u2014what some other man would now share with her. He\u2019d never again feel the silky glide of her skin, or hear the soft sighs of her pleasure. He\u2019d never again smell the mingling of their scents, melding together so perfectly. He\u2019d never again taste her kisses or the heated salt of her skin. Never again taste her blood or feel the heady rush of power she gave him.</p><p>It was too much to bear. He\u2019d lost too much to ever recover fully. Time would ease the pain, but the hole she\u2019d left inside him would forever bleed at her loss.</p><p>Logan swiped his key card and went inside his suite.</p><p>Hope was there, sitting on his couch. She froze when she saw him, her eyes going wide with surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked. This was some kind of cruel joke. Someone had let her in so he\u2019d have to suffer her loss all over again. Whoever that was would pay dearly.</p><p>\u201cTynan said my choices were to stay here with my memories or leave without them. He said I could share this suite with a roommate. I was waiting to meet her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer? He told me he\u2019d found someone for you.\u201d</p><p>She stood slowly, her movements graceful and sinuous. She was so beautiful his gaze was fixed, soaking in her loveliness.</p><p>Logan remembered every curve of her body. He remembered how she felt under his hand, the way she sucked in a breath and bit her bottom lip when he found her most sensitive spots, like the one at her nape and the small of her back.</p><p>His blood heated and he took a few steps to his left so that the recliner hid his erection. It was his shame that he couldn\u2019t control himself around her, but it seemed beyond his ability.</p><p>She cocked her head to the side, unknowingly drawing attention to her neck. Her pulse beat there, strong and sure, and for the first time in three days, a knot of anxiety loosened up inside Logan\u2019s chest. She was safe. Whole. At his side, where he wanted her most.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying he was trying to fix me up with another guy?\u201d she asked, irritation plain in her tone. \u201cAfter that chauvinistic asshole Eric, I\u2019m never trusting a Sanguinar\u2019s opinion in men again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d He trailed off, at a loss for how to respond. Of course Tynan would try to find her another mate. Whether he\u2019d told her that was another story. \u201cThis is my suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live here?\u201d she asked, taking a small step toward him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugged at one corner of her mouth. \u201cDid you know Tynan told me I could live here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think about the idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdea?\u201d</p><p>She came closer, skirting around the chair that he was using to shield his erection from her. \u201cThe idea of me staying here. Sleeping here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping? Here?\u201d His mind couldn\u2019t quite grasp the concept. Why would Tynan have sent her here? He said he\u2019d found a good match for her. That match couldn\u2019t be Logan. He couldn\u2019t give her children.</p><p>\u201cYes. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>Lack of oxygen made it hard to think. She\u2019d been asking him something that he was sure was going to lead to Hope in his bed.</p><p>Ah, yes. Her staying here in his suite. Tynan had told her to stay here.</p><p>Did he mind? He\u2019d never wanted anything more in his life. \u201cNo. Of course you\u2019re welcome in my home.\u201d That answer was going to cost him dearly as soon as she left. And she would. Logan could not allow himself any fantasies to the contrary. Hope\u2019s blood was powerful and his people needed her and her children, even if it took them ten years to find a man she accepted as suitable.</p><p>The other corner of her mouth turned up, her smile becoming victorious. She reached up and looped her arms around his neck. After so many days without it, her touch was a balm to his skin.</p><p>He shivered against the sheer pleasure of her skin on his, closing his eyes to revel in the moment.</p><p>Logan\u2019s phone rang. He fumbled for it like a lifeline, knowing that ringing had kept him from doing something disgraceful.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s there, I presume,\u201d said Tynan, his tone smug.</p><p>\u201cYes. Why? Why would you do this to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we both know that the root of a good match is happiness. You love her. Make her happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive her children. I know. We\u2019ll make do. For now, enjoy her. Make her happy. You both deserve it. Besides, I can\u2019t have her trying to kill anyone else. It\u2019s not good for business.\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d never expected to be freed from his duty, free to love Hope the way he wanted to.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d said Tynan in the face of Logan\u2019s silence. Then he hung up.</p><p>Hope took his phone, powered it off, and tossed it onto the chair. \u201cWe have some things to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left me. I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Truly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you loved me. Did you mean it?\u201d</p><p>He touched her face. He couldn\u2019t stand not to feel her skin against his fingertips for even one more second. \u201cI did. I do. With all of my heart, such as it is.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her hand to his chest. \u201cI like your heart, such as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know your duty is important to you, and I respect that. But Tynan said it doesn\u2019t have to get in the way of us. Is that true? Because if it\u2019s not, I\u2019ll walk away right now and never bother you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he hurried to say. \u201cDon\u2019t go. My duty is to my people, but perhaps that duty is best served by showing them that they, too, can find happiness like I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>Hope nodded. \u201cGood, because there\u2019s something I want to show you\u2014something Tynan doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She pulled his head down until his forehead touched hers. She placed his fingertips on her temples and covered them with her own hands. \u201cMy amnesia. It\u2019s gone. I know who I am now and where I came from.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s head flooded with images of a beautiful, alien place. Twin suns burned bright and the air was thick with moisture, making lush plants bloom all around. This wasn\u2019t Earth. It wasn\u2019t Athanasia. It was someplace new.</p><p>\u201cTemprocia,\u201d she whispered against his thoughts. \u201cI was born here. Raised here.\u201d</p><p>The image of a stunningly beautiful woman filled his head. She was ancient, but he wasn\u2019t sure how he knew that. There were no signs of her age on her face, just a wisdom in her eyes and a confidence in her carriage.</p><p>\u201cShe sent me here. To save you, to save the humans. She knows the Solarc cursed you and that you\u2019re dying. She knows your kind can never feel the sun, so she sent me to be your sunshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d he asked, unsure if he\u2019d said the words aloud or not.</p><p>\u201cLike you. Or at least like you should have been if the Solarc hadn\u2019t cursed you. She said it wasn\u2019t your fault, and that no child should have to pay for a decision their parents made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know about that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI know that your father raped your mother and the Solarc banished you and cursed you to live in eternal darkness because of it. That\u2019s why a Warden comes every time sunlight touches your skin. It\u2019s the Solarc\u2019s way of punishing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just my father. It was the fathers of all Sanguinar\u2014powerful human men who invaded Athanasia, abducted women, and raped them. It was a premeditated act\u2014one for which my grandfather the Solarc never forgave them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should have punished them, not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat better way to punish a father than to harm his child?\u201d said Logan.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still suffering for that mistake. Hundreds of years later.\u201d</p><p>Not anymore. He wasn\u2019t going to let the sins of his father ruin even one more day of his life. He had Hope now, and that was all the sunshine he\u2019d ever need. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Tyler building. There\u2019s a Sentinel Stone in the basement. I was sent through that, alone.\u201d</p><p>A Sentinel Stone left unattended? That could not stand. \u201cWe must go there and retrieve it, bring it to Dabyr where it can be guarded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will. Later. It\u2019s been there a long time. It can wait there a while longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre there more like you?\u201d asked Logan.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. If there are, they won\u2019t know who they are. Their memories would have been stripped away to protect them from attack, the way mine were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did allow your memories to be taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was the only way to come here and fulfill my duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what duty is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe same as yours,\u201d she said. \u201cFighting the Synestryn. Protecting the humans.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in a long time, Logan did not feel nearly so alone. He had Hope, which was more than he deserved.</p><p>He had to find a way to give his brothers the same gift she\u2019d given him\u2014the hope that his life would not always be one of pain and hunger. Surely, if there were others like her, there had to be some way to locate them.</p><p>\u201cIs there any way we can identify these people?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Hope shrugged. \u201cI see auras\u2014colors surrounding people that tell me about them. Maybe others like me see them, too.\u201d</p><p>That explained the halos of color he\u2019d seen while in her mind. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to help us find them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either. But I remember growing up with others like me\u2014all different ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the Sentinel Stone in the Tyler building holds the key. We should go and investigate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will. Tomorrow. Tonight, there\u2019s something I need to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Logan.\u201d She went up on tiptoe and kissed him, her lips soft and warm against his.</p><p>All thought of duty or responsibility fled, leaving Hope and her love for him burning bright at the center of his world. She was his refuge, his heart, and for as long as he held her in his arms, his life would be complete and perfect. </p> </body></html>"]
