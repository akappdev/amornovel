He felt tourists were missing out, because these summer mornings were beautiful, retaining the night\u2019s chill, while the days were often blazing.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the street was called Main Street. Sometimes, when the wind picked up, tumbleweeds actually swept down the street, along with little clouds of dust. The tourists loved it\u2014except on the few rainy days that turned the dirt road into a mud slide, which clearly explained the raised wooden sidewalks of the 1880s.</p> <p>The entire town was built of wood; only a few of the newer dwellings on the outskirts were brick or concrete. When Lily was built, lumber had been the easiest material to acquire, so everything was made of wood. Even the jail.</p><p>It was probably a miracle that Lily had never burned to the ground. But, small and barren though it might be, the town was a survivor. Just naming it Lily had been a piece of optimism, but when Joseph Miller had first come in hopes of finding gold way back in the 1850s, he\u2019d named the place for his grandmother\u2014not because she\u2019d been beautiful or sweet, but because the Irishwoman had been blessed with the greatest tenacity he\u2019d ever known, according to his memoir.</p><p>And Lily, Arizona, was a town that had held on tenaciously through good and bad, fair times and foul.</p><p>Sloan looked down the broad dusty road that had been preserved. Lily had almost been a ghost town, in the truly deserted sense; at one time, in the early 1900s, only three places of business had remained open, and since one had been the sheriff\u2019s office and jail, there\u2019d really just been two mercantile establishments, both hanging on by a thread. Those two had been the Paris Saloon and the theater, the Gilded Lily. Of course, staying afloat at that time in this dry Western town off the beaten track, on the road between Tucson and Tombstone, was a struggle, and the Gilded Lily had offered pretty tawdry entertainment in the guise of theater. Clearly, the place had been successful.</p><p>And because miners, ranchers, opportunists and downright outlaws enjoyed the services of the main saloon across the street and the bar in the theater, the jail did a booming business, as well.</p> <p>Today, there weren\u2019t many shoot-outs. There weren\u2019t even many drunken brawls. It was strange to be sheriff back here after being with the Houston, Texas, police force. And strange to be head of a six-man\u2014including one woman\u2014force when he\u2019d previously worked with hundreds of fellow officers.</p><p>But he\u2019d come back to be with his grandfather when they\u2019d first found out about his illness, and then stayed with him, tended to him, while the cancer slowly killed him. And now...</p><p>Now, he didn\u2019t have the heart to leave again.</p><p>Ah, yes, here he was in Lily, Arizona, taking care of not-so-major crime!</p><p>And that, he reminded himself, was why he\u2019d left the new sheriff\u2019s office down the highway and come into the tourist end of town. There was another report from the old sheriff\u2019s office and jail, which was now being operated as a restaurant and bed-and-breakfast, known, naturally, as the Old Jail. It was featured on all the \u201chaunted\u201d shows that continually played on cable stations. Another \u201ctheft\u201d had occurred.</p><p>The nineteenth-century office and jail sat next to the Gilded Lily, while the Paris Saloon and the old stables were across the street. While it was small in comparison to major tourist destinations like Tombstone, Lily had made something of a comeback. The other side of the saloon, in an old barbershop, had become a state-of-the-art salon and spa, and next to it, in the old general store, was a place called Desert Diamonds\u2014a souvenir shop that also boasted a pizza parlor, ice cream and a barista stand. It was also a small museum. Grant Winston, proprietor, had been around since practically the Dark Ages and he displayed his old newspapers and artifacts in a special climate-controlled room in the back.</p> <p>Main Street was hopping as a tourist destination. The old stables offered horseback riding, day tours and haunted night tours. They\u2019d even arranged a few Styrofoam \u201crelics\u201d out in the desert to heighten the pleasure.</p><p>Shaking his head at the marvels of modern commerce, Sloan paused for a minute.</p><p>A breeze had picked up suddenly, and a large clump of sagebrush went skidding down the road before him. He was struck by the feeling that something was about to change\u2014that dark forces were coming to life in Lily, Arizona.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help grinning at his ridiculous feeling that the sudden chill in the air and the sweep of sagebrush could be a forewarning of some kind of evil.</p><p>He opened the door of the bed-and-breakfast. The old sheriff\u2019s desk was now the check-in counter, and the deputy\u2019s desk held a sign that read Concierge.</p><p>Because, of course, in Lily, Arizona, you needed a concierge.</p><p>But the concierge did double duty, working the morning coffee and continental breakfast station that was laid out in the old gun room and pitching in when the gun room turned into a restaurant. The food wasn\u2019t bad and there was often a need for reservations, since the room held only six tables.</p><p>\u201cSheriff, thank God you\u2019re here!\u201d</p> <p>Mike Addison, owner and manager of the Old Jail, was at the sheriff\u2019s desk. He stood quickly when Sloan walked in.</p><p>\u201cI came right over, Mike,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe couple in Room One! You know, Hardy\u2019s cell,\u201d Mike said dramatically. \u201cThey were robbed last night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey woke up this morning\u2014and their wallets had been stolen. I wouldn\u2019t believe it myself, Sloan, if they weren\u2019t such fine people and if they weren\u2019t so honestly upset. The husband says they were over at the Gilded Lily, they saw the show, had one nightcap and came back. As you know, only our guests have keys to the front and the cells. I swear, I can\u2019t figure out how someone could have gotten into their room!\u201d</p><p>Mike was in his thirties, tall, lean and earnest. He\u2019d come out from Boston, having been a lover of all the Old West movies he\u2019d seen growing up, thanks to cable channels. He\u2019d bought the jail from old \u201cCoot\u201d Stevens, who\u2019d first turned it into a B and B. Mike had worked hard to maintain its historic aspects and make it a nice place to stay. While the rooms were extremely small\u2014they\u2019d started out as cells, after all\u2014they featured beds with luxurious mattresses, exceptional air-conditioning and tales of the outlaws who\u2019d lived and died in the area, some in the cells and some at the scaffolding on Main Street.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cThe breakfast room. I offered to spike their morning coffee, they were so upset. Jerry and Lucinda Broling.\u201d</p><p>Sloan nodded and went in. The walls were covered with various weapons and rifles dating from the early 1800s to the 1960s. The tables were stained wood, which gave the place atmosphere and was easy to clean.</p><p>The young couple in question certainly looked dejected enough as they sat at the table, heads bowed and shoulders slumped. They appeared to be in their late twenties. Jerry Broling glanced up with hope in his eyes as Sloan entered. \u201cIt\u2019s the sheriff, honey. He\u2019ll do something. Everything will be fine, you\u2019ll see!\u201d he said.</p><p>Lucinda, a blonde with cornflower-blue eyes, smiled tremulously. She\u2019d been crying.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do? Sloan Trent,\u201d he said, introducing himself. \u201cSo, you think you were robbed during the night. In your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to be!\u201d Lucinda insisted. \u201cWe went to the show\u2014it\u2019s very funny, by the way\u2014and afterward we stopped at the bar in the Gilded Lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had Kahlua and cream,\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>\u201cI had Tia Maria. You had Kahlua and cream.\u201d Obviously, the robbery had made them both irritable.</p><p>\u201cNeither of us drank a lot,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cWe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t been drinking at all,\u201d Lucinda broke in. \u201cJerry was draining a few beers in the saloon during the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even slightly buzzed.\u201d Jerry\u2019s tone was hard.</p><p>Lucinda waved a hand in the air. \u201cI paid for the drinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the last time you saw your wallets?\u201d Sloan asked. \u201cAt the saloon and the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine never came out of my pocket. It should\u2019ve been in my jeans this morning,\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>Lucinda waved a hand in the air. \u201cI\u2019d been using my credit card. Jerry hadn\u2019t paid for anything all day. His might have been anywhere. But I know that my wallet was in my purse when I went to bed.\u201d</p><p>Sloan nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI understand you were in Room One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already searched it,\u201d Jerry told him.</p><p>\u201cWe even pulled the mattress up,\u201d Lucinda said.</p><p>\u201cDid you ask at the Gilded Lily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re not open this early, are they?\u201d Jerry asked.</p><p>\u201cNot for business, but they have rehearsals, meetings... The costumer goes in to sew up rips and tears and so on.\u201d</p><p>Mike was at the door. \u201cI called. Spoke to Henri Coque. They\u2019re up and about, working down in the old storage room digging up more wigs. He went up to the bar area and searched through everything. Couldn\u2019t find any credit cards. Talked to everyone he could, but no one handed in a lost wallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you were in Trey Hardy\u2019s cell,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>They nodded. \u201cExcuse me. I\u2019ll give the place a search, too, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>The couple looked at him doubtfully. \u201cSheriff, there\u2019s a thief in this town,\u201d Lucinda said.</p><p>\u201cA low-down, no-account pickpocket!\u201d Jerry muttered.</p><p>\u201cStop trying to sound like some Old West bank robber,\u201d Lucinda groaned.</p><p>\u201cLucinda\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sloan left the squabbling couple, passed through the barred wooden door to the cells and walked down the length of the hallway. The door to Room One, the Trey Hardy cell, was open.</p><p>Hardy had been a true character in his day. A Confederate cavalry lieutenant who had lost everything during the Civil War, he\u2019d started robbing banks. He was a hero to some back in Missouri\u2014just like Jesse James. He\u2019d stolen from the carpetbaggers to give back to the citizens. He\u2019d been dashing and handsome, and when things had gotten hot for him in Missouri, he\u2019d gone farther. But in Lily he came up against another ex-Confederate, Sheriff Brendan Fogerty. Fogerty felt that the war was over, and ex-Reb or not, Hardy wasn\u2019t stealing from the citizens of Lily, Arizona. He\u2019d taken Hardy in after winning a fistfight on Main Street. Hardy had promised to come willingly if Fogerty bested him. To a cheering crowd, he had turned himself in when Fogerty had pinned him. Sadly, unknown to Fogerty, his deputy, Aaron Munson, had a long-standing beef with anyone who\u2019d fought against the Union. Before Hardy could be brought to trial, Munson shot Hardy down in his cell, only to be dragged out to the street and lynched himself by a furious mob enamored of the handsome Hardy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While Munson haunted Main Street, Hardy was said to haunt the jail and the cell where he had died.</p><p>The doors to the cells were wooden with barred windows. They were entered with large jail keys that had to be returned\u2014lest the guest be charged a hefty fee. In the age of the plastic slot card, the Old Jail was a holdout. But entering a cell with a big jail key held greater charm.</p><p>The door wasn\u2019t locked, so Sloan stepped inside. The couple had done a pretty thorough job of searching. Drawers were still open and the mattress lay crookedly on the bed.</p> <p>Sloan turned back to make sure he hadn\u2019t been followed. There was a security camera in the hall but he knew that was just for show; Mike never remembered to change the tape. He seldom had trouble. Guests seemed to love talking about the shadowy apparitions they\u2019d seen in the halls or the \u201ccold spots\u201d that had moved into the room, et cetera, that went with staying at such a place. He walked to the dresser; it was heavy. A wide-screen TV sat on it, along with the bust of an Indian chief.</p><p>Sloan waited a minute, then shook his head, said quietly, \u201cGive it up. Return the wallets.\u201d</p><p>He heard the rasp of something against the wall. Turning, he saw that that there were two wallets on the floor. They might have been wedged behind the dresser and wall\u2014and fallen when he tugged at the dresser.</p><p>He picked them up and headed to the door, then looked back into the room. \u201cYou know, Hardy, shadows in the night, cool. Your few ghostly appearances\u2014great. But quit with the money, the keys and the wallets, huh? All these people think you\u2019re the next best thing to Jesse James. Don\u2019t go ruining your wonderful reputation.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Sloan thought he saw him. Hardy seemed to be standing there, still wearing a gray jacket and a sweeping gray hat with a plume, a cross between a Western outlaw and a disenfranchised soldier. He had a neatly clipped golden beard and his eyes were bright. He saluted Sloan.</p> <p>Shaking his head, Sloan walked back to the breakfast room and set the wallets on the table.</p><p>The couple gaped at him incredulously. \u201cThey were wedged behind the dresser,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d Lucinda gushed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, man, thanks!\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>\u201cCheck them, make sure everything\u2019s in them,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cYou said you searched everywhere!\u201d Lucinda accused Jerry.</p> <p>\u201cHey, you were in the room, too!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d barely finished speaking when they heard it.</p><p>The sound was terrible; it seemed to come from the earth itself. It was a scream\u2014one that might have been piercing except that it was muffled.</p><p>It came again and again...</p><p>\u201cWhat the f\u2014\u201d Jerry began, leaping to his feet.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Lucinda cried, trembling.</p><p>Even Sloan felt as if ice trickled down his spine.</p><p>And then he realized the source of the scream. There was nothing unearthly about it. It was simply coming from the basement of the theater next door.</p> <p>Sloan strode quickly from the Old Jail and down the few steps to the swinging, slatted doors that led into the Gilded Lily. He saw the long bar and the rows of seating to the side of it and the stage at the far end.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he called out, seeing no signs of life.</p><p>He hurried behind the bar to the stairs that went down to the basement and storm cellar, now a depository for over a hundred and fifty years\u2019 worth of costumes, props, scenery and other old theater paraphernalia.</p><p>He heard the scream again as he rushed down the steps.</p><p>The muted light blinded him for a moment. The basement was divided into a main room and three side rooms, separated by foundation walls.</p><p>He blinked and adjusted his vision. A woman stood alone at the back of the main basement room. She held an old burlap cover that had apparently protected shelves holding wigged mannequin heads. She was young, blonde and pretty, and he recognized Valerie Mystro, the current ingenue in residence at the Gilded Lily Theater Company.</p><p>\u201cValerie!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear him when he called her name. She was staring in horror at something on the shelf.</p><p>Sloan strode over to her and took her by the shoulders. She looked at him blankly, as if not seeing him at first.</p><p>\u201cValerie!\u201d</p><p>She trembled. \u201cSloan!\u201d she said, and swallowed.</p><p>\u201cValerie, what is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She lifted a shaky finger and pointed at the row of old carved wooden wig heads.</p><p>They were creepy, Sloan agreed. Each had been painted with a face. Some pouted, some just stared, some seemed to laugh. A few of the newer heads were made of plastic or Styrofoam.</p><p>And at the end of the row...</p><p>There was one that bore a dark curly wig tied with a red ribbon. Dark curls fell over the forehead.</p><p>But the head wasn\u2019t carved from wood. Nor was it plastic or Styrofoam.</p><p>It was a human skull, a skull stuck on a wooden spike. The jawbone had fallen and lay on the ledge.</p><p>That made it appear as if the skull itself was screaming.</p><p>As if evil was indeed alive in the world and had come to Lily, Arizona.</p><p>1</p><p>Jane Everett was entranced.</p><p>She\u2019d been to a ghost town or two in her day, but never a functioning ghost town.</p><p>But then, of course, Lily, Arizona, had never really been a ghost town because it had never been completely deserted. It had just fallen by the wayside. It had seen good times\u2014when the mines yielded silver and there\u2019d been a hint of gold, as well, and the saloons and merchants had flourished\u2014and it had seen bad times when the mines ran dry. Still, it had the look of either a ghost town or the set of a Western movie. The main street had raised wooden sidewalks and an unpaved dirt street. Muddy when it rained, she was certain, but that was seldom in this area.</p><p>The car her boss, Special Agent Logan Raintree, had hired to bring her to town let her out in front of the Gilded Lily, where she\u2019d be staying. The driver had set her bag on the wooden sidewalk, but she waited a minute before going in, enjoying a long view of the street.</p><p>There were a number of tourists around. She heard laughter from across the street and saw that a group of children had come from a shop called Desert Diamonds and were happily licking away at ice cream cones. Farther down, a guide was leading several riders out of the stables; she could hear his voice as he began to tell them the history of the town.</p><p>But the theater itself was where she was heading so she turned and studied it for a moment. Someone had taken pains to preserve rather than renovate, and the place appeared grand\u2014if grand was the right word. Well, maybe grand in a rustic way. The carved wooden fence that wound around the roof was painted with an array of lilies and the name of the theater; hanging over the fence and held in place with old chain were signs advertising the current production, The Perils of Poor Little Paulina. Actors\u2019 names were listed in smaller print beneath the title. She knew the show was a parody of the serialized Perils of Pauline that had been popular in the early part of the twentieth century.</p><p>No neon here, she thought, smiling. They were far from Broadway.</p><p>She\u2019d read that the Gilded Lily had hosted many fine performers over the years. The theater had been established at a time when someone had longed to bring a little eastern \u201cclass\u201d to the rugged West; naturally, the results had been somewhat mixed.</p><p>As she stood on the street looking up at the edifice, a man came flying out the latticed doors. Tall and square as a wrestler, clean-shaven and bald with dark eyes and white-winged brows, he bustled with energy. \u201cJane? Jane Everett? From the FBI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. Hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Lily, Arizona,\u201d he said enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019m Henri Coque, artistic director of the theater for about a year now and, I might add, director of the current production, The Perils of Poor Little Paulina. We\u2019re delighted to have you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be here,\u201d she responded. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful place. Who wouldn\u2019t want to come to a charming, Western, almost ghost town?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, especially since I\u2019m the mayor here, as well as the artistic director. Lily itself is small. Let me get your bag, and I\u2019ll show you around the theater and take you to your room. I hope you\u2019re all right with staying here. Someone suggested one of the chain hotels up the highway, but everyone else thought you\u2019d enjoy the Gilded Lily more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to be here,\u201d Jane assured him. \u201cI can stay at a chain hotel anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She was happy. They\u2019d been between cases when Logan had heard from an old friend of his\u2014a Texas cop, now an Arizona sheriff\u2014that a skull had appeared mysteriously in the storage cellar of a historic theater. It had sounded fascinating to her and she\u2019d agreed to come out here. The local coroner\u2019s office had deemed the skull to be over a hundred years old and had determined that handing it over to the FBI was justified, so that perhaps the deceased could be identified and given a proper burial. Like most law enforcement agencies, the police here were busy with current cases that demanded answers for the living.</p><p>The skull, she knew, was no longer at the theater. She would work at the new sheriff\u2019s office on the highway, but she was intrigued by the opportunity to spend time at the historic theater, learn the history of it and, of course, see where the skull was found.</p><p>That was the confusion\u2014and the mystery. No one remembered seeing the skull wearing the wig before. Granted, the theater had been holding shows forever; it had never closed down. And people had been using the various wigs down there forever, too. From her briefing notes, Jane knew that everyone working at the theater and involved with it had denied ever seeing the skull, with or without a wig. It seemed obvious that someone had been playing a prank, but Jane wasn\u2019t sure how identifying the person behind the skull\u2014given that he or she had been dead over a hundred years\u2014would help discover who\u2019d put it on the rack.</p><p>The sheriff, Sloan Trent, had wanted to send the skull off to the Smithsonian or the FBI lab, but the mayor had insisted it should stay in Lily until an identification had been made. So, Sloan had requested help from his old friend, Logan Raintree, head of Jane\u2019s Texas Krewe unit of the FBI teams of paranormal investigators known as the Krewe of Hunters. And that had led to Logan\u2019s asking Jane, whose specialty was forensic art, to come here. The medical examiner who\u2019d seen the skull believed it was the skull of a woman and he had estimated that she\u2019d been dead for a hundred to a hundred and fifty years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome, Ms.\u2014or, I guess it\u2019s Agent\u2014Everett!\u201d Henri said, pushing open the slatted doors and escorting her into the Gilded Lily. \u201cJennie! Come meet our forensic artist!\u201d</p><p>Jane tried to take in the room while a slender woman wearing a flowered cotton dress came out from behind the long bar behind some tables to the left. The Gilded Lily, she quickly saw, was the real deal. She felt as if she\u2019d stepped back in time. Of course, her first case with her Krewe\u2014the second of three units\u2014had been in her own hometown of San Antonio and had actually centered on an old saloon. But the Gilded Lily was a theater and a saloon or bar, and like nothing she\u2019d ever seen before. The front tables were ready for poker players, with period furniture that was painstakingly rehabbed. To the right of the entry, an open pathway led to the theater. Rich red velvet drapes, separating the bar area from the stage and audience section, were drawn back with golden cords. The theater chairs weren\u2019t what she would\u2019ve expected. The original owners had aimed for an East Coast ambience, so they, too, were covered in red velvet. The stage, beyond the audience chairs, was broad and deep, allowing for large casts and complicated sets. She saw what appeared to be a real stagecoach on stage right and, over on stage left, reaching from the apron back stage rear, were railroad tracks.</p><p>\u201cHello, welcome!\u201d</p> <p>The woman who\u2019d been behind the bar came around to the entry, smiling as she greeted Jane. She thrust out her a hand and there was steel in her grip. \u201cI\u2019m Jennie Layton, stage mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStage mother?\u201d Jane asked, smiling.</p><p>Jennie laughed. \u201cStage manager. But they call me stage mother\u2014with affection, I hope. I take care of our actors...and just about everything else!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, come now! I do my share of the work,\u201d Henri protested.</p><p>Jennie smiled. \u201cAt night, we have three bartenders, four servers and a barback. And we have housekeepers who come in, too, but as far as full-time employees go, well, it\u2019s Henri and me. And we\u2019re delighted you agreed to stay here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought the theater history might help you in identifying the woman,\u201d Henri said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. That makes sense. And it\u2019s beautiful and unique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily is unique! And the Gilded Lily is the jewel in her crown,\u201d Henri said proudly.</p><p>\u201cWell, come on up. We have you in the Sage McCormick suite,\u201d Jennie told her, beaming.</p><p>The name was familiar to Jane from her reading. \u201cSage McCormick was an actress in the late 1800s, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll our rooms are now named for famous actors or actresses who came out West to play at the Gilded Lily,\u201d Henri said. \u201cSage, yes\u2014she was one of the finest. She was in Antigone and Macbeth and starred in a few other plays out here. She was involved in a wonderful and lascivious scandal, too\u2014absolutely a divine woman.\u201d He seemed delighted with the shocking behavior of the Gilded Lily\u2019s old star. \u201cI\u2019ll get your bag.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Jane said, but Henri had grabbed it already.</p><p>\u201cTut, tut,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may be a very capable agent, Ms. Everett, but here in Lily...a gent is a gent!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you, then,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>Jennie showed the way up the curving staircase. The landing led to a balcony in a horseshoe shape. Jane looked down at the bar over a carved wooden railing, then followed Jennie to the room at the far end of the horseshoe. This room probably afforded the most privacy, as there was only one neighbor.</p><p>\u201cThe Sage McCormick suite,\u201d Jennie said, opening the door with a flourish.</p><p>It was a charming room. The bed was covered with a quilt\u2014flowers on white\u2014and the drapes were a filmy white with a crimson underlay.</p><p>\u201cThose doors are for your outdoor balcony. It overlooks the side street but also gives you a view of the main street, although obstructed, I admit,\u201d Jennie said.</p><p>\u201cAnd the dressing room through here...\u201d Henri entered with her bag, throwing open a door at the rear of the spacious room. \u201cIt\u2019s still a dressing room, with a lovely new bath. Nothing was really undone. The first bathrooms were put in during the 1910s. We\u2019ve just updated. And, you\u2019ll note, this one retains a dressing table and these old wooden armoires. Aren\u2019t they gorgeous?\u201d</p> <p>They were. The matching armoires were oak, with the symbols of comedy and tragedy carved on each side and on the doors. \u201cThey were a gift to Sage when she was here,\u201d Henri said reverently. \u201cA patron of the arts was so delighted that he had these made for her!\u201d</p><p>Jane peeked beyond. The bathroom was recently updated and had a tiled shower and whirlpool bath. The color scheme throughout was crimson and white with black edging.</p><p>\u201cThis is really lovely. Thank you,\u201d Jane said again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our best suite!\u201d Henri gestured expansively around him.</p><p>\u201cHow come neither of you are in here?\u201d Jane asked, smiling. \u201cAnd what about your stars? I don\u2019t want to put anyone out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cOur \u2018stars\u2019 tend to be superstitious. They\u2019re in the other rooms on this level.\u201d With a quick grin she added, \u201cAnd Henri and I are quite happy in our own rooms...\u201d</p><p>Jane waited for her to say more.</p><p>Henri spoke instead. \u201cSage McCormick...\u201d His voice trailed off. \u201cWell, theater folk are a superstitious bunch. I mean, you know about her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a little,\u201d Jane said. \u201cShe disappeared, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom this room,\u201d Jennie explained. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of speculation. Some people believe she was a laudanum addict, and that she wandered off and met with a bad end at the hands of outlaws or Indians. Laudanum was used like candy back then. Lord knows how many people died from overusing it. Like today\u2019s over-the-counter pills. Too much and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some people believe she simply left Lily with her new love\u2014supposedly she intended to elope\u2014and changed her identity,\u201d Henri said impatiently. \u201cPrior to that, she\u2019d met and married a local man and they had a child together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? But she still kept her room at the Gilded Lily?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. She was the star.\u201d Henri spoke as if this was all that needed to be said.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, the last time anyone reported seeing her was when she retired to this room after a performance,\u201d Henri went on.</p><p>\u201cHer esteemed rendition of Antigone!\u201d Jennie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the husband? Was he a suspect?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cHer husband was downstairs in the bar, waiting for her. He was with a group of local ranchers and businessmen. One of her costars went up to get her, and Sage was gone. Just...gone. No one could find her, and she was never seen again,\u201d Jennie told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear! You\u2019re not superstitious, are you?\u201d Henri asked. \u201cI understood that you\u2019re a forensic artist but a law enforcement official, too.\u201d</p><p>Jane nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, settle in, then. And, please, when you\u2019re ready, come on down. We\u2019ll be in the theater\u2014I\u2019ll be giving notes on last night\u2019s performance. Join us whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to interrupt a rehearsal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you won\u2019t be interrupting. The show is going well. We opened a few weeks ago, but I have to keep my actors off the streets, you know? You\u2019ll get to meet the cast, although the crew won\u2019t be there. This is for the performers. As Jennie mentioned, the cast lives at the Gilded Lily while performing, so you\u2019ll meet your neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jane said, and glanced at her watch. \u201cSheriff Trent is supposed to be picking me up. I\u2019ll be down in a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! And here\u2019s your key,\u201d Henri said, producing an old metal key. \u201cThe only people here are the cast and crew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd bartenders and servers and a zillion other people who\u2019ve come to see the show or have a drink,\u201d Jennie added drily. \u201cUse your key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Jane promised.</p><p>Henri and Jennie left the room. Jane closed the door behind them and stood still, gazing around. \u201cHello?\u201d she said softly. \u201cIf you\u2019re here, I look forward to meeting you, Sage. What a beautiful name, by the way.\u201d</p><p>There was no response to her words. She shrugged, opened her bag and began to take out her clothing, going into the dressing room to hang her things in one of the armoires. She placed her makeup bag on the dressing table there, walked into the bathroom and washed her face. Back in the bedroom, she set up her laptop on the breakfast table near the balcony. Never sure if a place would have Wi-Fi, she always brought her own connector.</p><p>Jane decided she needed to know more about Sage McCormick, and keyed in the name. She was astounded by the number of entries that appeared before her eyes. She went to one of the encyclopedia sites, assuming she\u2019d find more truth than scandal there.</p><p>Jane read through the information: Sage had been born in New York City, and despite her society\u2019s scorn for actresses and her excellent family lineage, she\u2019d always wanted to act. To that end, she\u2019d left a magnificent mansion near Central Park to pursue the stage. She\u2019d sold the place when she became the last surviving member of her family. Apparently aware that her choice of profession would brand her as wanton, she lived up to the image, marrying one of her costars and then divorcing him for the embrace of a stagehand. She flouted convention\u2014but was known to be kind to everyone around her. She had been twenty-five when she\u2019d come out to the Gilded Lily in 1870. By that point, she\u2019d already appeared in numerous plays in New York, Chicago and Boston. Critics and audiences alike had adored her. In Lily, she\u2019d instantly fallen in love with local entrepreneur Alexander Cahill, married him almost immediately\u2014and acted her way through the pregnancy that had resulted in the birth of her only child, Lily Cahill. On the night of May 1, 1872, after a performance of Antigone, Sage had gone to her room at the Gilded Lily Theater and disappeared from history. It was presumed that she\u2019d left her husband and child to escape with a new lover, an outlaw known as Red Marston, as Red disappeared that same evening and was never seen in Lily again, nor did any reports of him ever appear elsewhere. Her contemporaries believed that the pair had fled to Mexico to begin their lives anew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Jane murmured aloud. \u201cSo, Sage, did you run across the border and live happily ever after?\u201d</p><p>She heard the old-fashioned clock on the dresser tick and nothing else. And she remembered that she\u2019d promised to go downstairs. The sheriff was due to pick her up in thirty minutes, so if she was going to meet the cast, she needed to move.</p><p>Running into the dressing room, she ran her brush through her hair, then hurried out. As she opened the door to exit into the hall, she was startled to see a slim, older woman standing there with a tray in her hands. The tray held a small plug-in coffeepot, and little packs of coffee, tea, creamers and sugar.</p> <p>\u201cHello!\u201d the woman said. She looked at Jane as though terrified.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Jane Everett. Come on in, and thank you.\u201d</p><p>The woman swallowed. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014I... Please don\u2019t make me go in that room!\u201d she said.</p><p>Jane tried not to smile. \u201cLet me take that, then. It\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to come in.\u201d</p><p>The woman pressed the tray into Jane\u2019s arms, looking vastly relieved. Jane brought it in and set it on the dresser. She\u2019d find a plug in the morning.</p> <p>When she turned around, the woman was still standing there. She wore a blue dress and apron and had to be one of the housekeepers.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jane said again.</p><p>Suddenly, the woman stuck out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie Coburn. If you need anything, just ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElsie, nice to meet you,\u201d Jane said, shaking her hand. She couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cHow did this room get so clean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Elsie blushed and glanced down. \u201cI make the two girls clean this room. They do it together. They\u2019re okay as long as they don\u2019t work alone. Bess was in here one day and the door slammed on her and none of us could open it. Then it opened on its own, so...well, we don\u2019t have to clean it that often, you know? No one stays in this room. One of those ghost shows brought a cast and crew in here and the producer was going to stay in the room all night but he ran out.... People don\u2019t stay in that room. They just don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, I\u2019m sorry that my coming here caused distress.\u201d</p> <p>Elsie shook her head. \u201cNo, no, we\u2019re happy to have you. If you don\u2019t mind...please don\u2019t mention that you had to bring your own tray in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Jane assured her. \u201cWhy did the producer of the ghost show run out in the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said she was standing over his bed, that she touched him, that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe? You mean Sage McCormick?\u201d</p><p>Elsie nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut what made him think she wanted to hurt him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Elsie was obviously mystified.</p><p>Jane smiled. \u201cI thought ghost shows tried to prove that places were haunted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis whole town is haunted. Bad things, really bad things, have happened over the years. The ghost-show people got all kinds of readings on their instruments. And the Old Jail next door! People leave there, too, even though they don\u2019t get their money back if they do. This place is...it\u2019s scary, Agent Everett. Very scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you live and work here,\u201d Jane said gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from here, and I don\u2019t tease the ghosts. I respect them. They\u2019re on Main Street, and they\u2019re all around. I keep my eyes glued to where I\u2019m going, and that\u2019s it. I do my work and I go home, and if I hear a noise, I go the other way.\u201d She rubbed her hands on her apron. \u201cWell, a pleasure to meet you. And we\u2019re glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. And don\u2019t worry about cleaning the room\u2014no one has to clean it while I\u2019m here. I\u2019ll just ask you to bring me fresh towels every couple of days. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Elsie looked as if she might kiss her.</p><p>She nodded vigorously. \u201cThank you, miss. Thank you. I mean, thank you, Agent Everett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane is fine.\u201d</p><p>Flushing, Elsie said, \u201cJane.\u201d She turned and disappeared down the hall, heading for the stairs. Jane closed her door, locking it behind her as she\u2019d been told to do.</p><p>When Sloan arrived at the Gilded Lily, the servers had yet to come in for the night. He had to knock on the doors\u2014the solid doors behind the latticed ones that had been preserved to give the place its old-time appearance\u2014to gain entry. The bar didn\u2019t open until five.</p><p>Jennie let him in, smiling as she did. Jennie was always in a good mood. \u201cSloan, hi. You\u2019re here for Jane?\u201d</p><p>So...Agent Everett was already on a first-name basis with people at the Gilded Lily. But then again, was she like most agents, or was she an artist\u2014with the credentials to work on FBI cases? He gave himself a mental kick; even though he\u2019d made the call to Logan that had brought her to town, Sloan wasn\u2019t pleased about her being here, but he wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>Yes, he needed to find out who the skull belonged to. But logically, in his opinion at least, the skull should have been sent off to a lab where such things were done or to the experts at a museum. In the end\u2014after arguing with Henri Coque about procedure\u2014Sloan had been the one to call Logan to ask for a forensic artist and Logan had sent her. He\u2019d trusted Logan to send him a good artist, but he was also aware that Logan was a different kind of lawman.</p><p>Sloan was, too.</p><p>He and Logan had shared secrets that they hadn\u2019t let on to others. Working cases together, they\u2019d both had occasion to follow leads because they\u2019d spoken to the dead.</p><p>Sloan didn\u2019t walk around interacting with spirits all the time. But there\u2019d been occasions... He and Logan had recognized the ability in each other. And they\u2019d been good partners.</p><p>True, he sometimes argued that the dead he saw were his particular form of talking to himself. And while it might seem that talking to the dead should solve everything, it didn\u2019t work that way. But now Logan wasn\u2019t a Ranger anymore; he was a fed. And he was the head of a unit. A special unit that was informally called the Texas Krewe.</p><p>Jane Everett was part of that Krewe. Did that mean she shared Logan\u2019s secrets? Or that she knew about Sloan? He doubted it. Logan never spoke to anyone about anyone else\u2019s business. But, somehow, Jane Everett made him uneasy.</p><p>Was he worried that she was only an artist\u2014and not really much of a law enforcement agent?</p><p>Or was he worried that she was an artist and an agent and might find him incompetent?</p><p>He\u2019d just had an odd feeling that they needed to get the skull out of Lily. It was almost as if the skull could be a catalyst for bad things to come.</p><p>Ridiculous, he told himself. Still, he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>But he\u2019d been the one to call Logan Raintree.</p><p>In keeping with what Sloan knew about his old friend, he wasn\u2019t surprised, when he\u2019d looked up his recent work, that Logan\u2019s Krewe worked with strange, supernatural cases.</p><p>In fact, it was one reason he\u2019d decided to approach him.</p><p>Because there\u2019s more to this than meets the eye and it may be important\u2014but do I really want to know? he asked himself. He\u2019d called Logan because he wondered if they might need help from the dead while not wanting it to be true.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m here for Agent Everett,\u201d he told Jennie.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cast is down by the stage apron. She\u2019s been meeting them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Thankfully, there weren\u2019t any other pressing issues in Lily at the moment.</p><p>He followed Jennie into the theater.</p><p>The group had gathered around the stage. Valerie Mystro, who had found the skull, was leaning casually against the show\u2019s hero, Cy Tyburn, a tall, blond, all-American-looking actor from Kansas. Alice Horton, dark-haired, dark-eyed, sultry and buxom, the show\u2019s vamp, was seated on the stage next to Brian Highsmith. Brian was dark-haired, as well; his green eyes bright against the near-black of his hair. Smiling, he appeared to be totally nonevil, although he played the show\u2019s villain. Henri looked happy, standing in front of the newcomer, Jane Everett, who was seated next to Alice.</p><p>Even in the group of beautiful twenty-to-thirty-year-old actors, Jane Everett stood out. She was seated, so he couldn\u2019t judge her height, and she was wearing a typical pantsuit\u2014one he might expect to see on a working federal agent. The slight bulge was apparent at her rib cage; she was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying her weapon, which was probably just as regulation as her black pantsuit and white shirt. But she wore her hair loose and it was a striking shade, the deepest auburn he\u2019d ever seen. And when she looked up at his arrival, he saw that she had the most unusual eyes he had ever seen, as well. They were amber. Not brown. Not hazel. Amber.</p><p>As he entered, she stood. Whatever they\u2019d been discussing, they\u2019d all gone quiet as he walked in.</p><p>\u201cSloan! We\u2019ve just met Jane,\u201d Valerie said happily. She giggled. \u201cI told her how terrified I was when I found the skull, but then, she\u2019s an FBI agent\u2014I\u2019m sure she would have behaved perfectly normally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. A skull can startle anyone,\u201d Jane Everett said.</p><p>\u201cOh, you haven\u2019t met yet!\u201d Valerie said. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you. Agent Jane Everett, meet our town\u2019s sheriff, Sloan Trent. Sloan, this is Agent Everett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jane, please,\u201d Jane said, standing to shake his hand. She was on the tall side, he noted. Probably about five-nine, since she was wearing neat low pumps and seemed about five-ten or so against his six-three frame. She had a beautiful face, absolutely elegant and classical. He imagined that once they were gone, the show\u2019s leading ladies would be discussing her...assets. She appeared to be lean and trim, but even in her regulation attire, she seemed to have the curves to suggest a well-honed body.</p><p>So this was the artist Logan had sent to sketch his skull?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t his skull, he reminded himself. But the skull had belonged to a living, breathing human being and it was part of his town\u2019s history. As far as he knew, anyway. And if it wasn\u2019t\u2014if Jane Everett\u2019s rendering of the long-dead woman couldn\u2019t be identified\u2014someone had dug it up from somewhere to play a gruesome prank on the show\u2019s cast or crew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It just should have gone to Washington or a museum, he thought again.</p><p>He understood why Henri had insisted it stay in Lily. He wanted to know who\u2019d gotten hold of the skull\u2014and who\u2019d put it in the basement storage room of the Gilded Lily.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Sloan Trent,\u201d he said, accepting her hand and nodding to the others in acknowledgment. They all greeted him in turn, either as Sloan or as Sheriff\u2014as if that was his given name. There wasn\u2019t a lot of formality in Lily.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here to take you to our offices. We have a room prepared for you to work in. I hope you\u2019ll find everything you need.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI bring most of my own supplies,\u201d she said, patting the black case she carried over her shoulder. \u201cWe should be fine. Thank you, Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, Agent Everett. You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>There was a chorus of \u201clovely to meet you\u201d and \u201cnice to make your acquaintance\u201d and other cordial statements as they left the stage area and headed out, along with \u201cSee you later, Sloan!\u201d</p> <p>He led the way to his SUV\u2014then hesitated. He\u2019d been raised to open doors for ladies, but wasn\u2019t sure what the protocol was with an agent. He decided he\u2019d be damned if he was going to change. He opened the passenger door. She thanked him as she slid in.</p><p>An awkward silence followed as he drove down Main Street, then along the paved road that passed by a smattering of houses and ranches on small plots, and finally larger tracts as he traveled the six miles from the heart of Lily to the modern \u201cdowntown\u201d area of town.</p><p>She broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cSo, Logan said he sometimes worked with you in Texas. But you\u2019re from Lily?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really remarkable,\u201d she said. Her voice seemed strained; she was obviously trying to be pleasant and cheerful. \u201cThe town, I mean\u2014not that you\u2019re from it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable in its preservation, I suppose. Tombstone is similar, but far better-known. The gunfight at the O.K. Corral and all that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had our share of outlaws, but none that caught the American imagination like Wyatt Earp and his brothers. Of course, Wyatt Earp wrote books that fostered the popular conception of the Old West.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but Lily has the Gilded Lily,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Tombstone has the Birdcage.\u201d He glanced her way. \u201cBut the Gilded Lily has never been closed. It\u2019s been an operating theater since it first opened. And while the Birdcage had its \u2018cages\u2019 or \u2018cribs\u2019 in balconies so its ladies of the night could entertain during performances, the Gilded Lily pretended to be a totally legitimate theater. The working ladies only entertained clients in their rooms upstairs\u2014and that was to keep from losing clientele to the saloon and \u2018entertainment\u2019 center across the street. Of course, the Gilded Lily tried for a higher class of clientele,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cConvenient where they placed the Old Jail. Right next to the Gilded Lily...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin shouting distance,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnd across the street from the saloon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way, you could walk prisoners into a cell within a few hundred feet,\u201d he said. He glanced at her. \u201cYou\u2019re from Texas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cSan Antonio,\u201d she added. \u201cThough I did work with different agencies around the state until I joined Logan\u2019s Krewe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always wanted to be an artist?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI was always drawing,\u201d she said.</p><p>They\u2019d reached the sheriff\u2019s office. He pulled into the lot in front.</p><p>The office wasn\u2019t really that small\u2014not when you considered the size of the town. The building had been constructed in the 1930s by someone who\u2019d evidently been to Toledo, Spain, and fallen in love with the medieval architecture. There was a tower on either front corner, and the roof was tile while the exterior was brick. The parking lot held room for at least twenty cars\u2014someone had been optimistic about the growth of Lily. To the left, where the offices were located, were a bank, a coffee house, a Mexican restaurant and an Italian restaurant. To the right was an Asian restaurant and a Brazilian steak house, along with the area\u2019s mall\u2014an enclosure of about eight shops. Lily could proudly say that there were three national chain stores among them.</p><p>The biggest excitement in town had occurred when they\u2019d acquired one of the country\u2019s largest burger chains, which had chosen to locate in the mall. Keeping offices in old adobe homes or the occasional professional building were a few lawyers, accountants, doctors and decorators. The high school was just half a mile back toward the old town.</p><p>\u201cNot such a small place,\u201d she said cheerfully as he parked and they exited the car.</p><p>\u201cSmall enough that the skull should have been sent to a lab,\u201d Sloan murmured.</p><p>He realized that his antagonism toward her became apparent with his careless words when she made a barely perceptible movement, stiffening. She stood by the car, looking at him, and he saw the hardness that came into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really proficient at what I do, Sheriff. You don\u2019t need to worry that my work will be lacking in any way.\u201d</p><p>He could have said something to try to smooth her ruffled feathers; he didn\u2019t. He just shrugged. \u201cSince this isn\u2019t a new murder, I\u2019m sure your work will be more than sufficient.\u201d</p><p>He felt the chill of her eyes. \u201cSheriff, I will certainly try very hard to do work that\u2019s sufficient.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to make matters worse. On the other hand, he could hardly have been more rude. Once again, an explanation or an apology might seem lame, so he indicated the door and said, \u201cThat didn\u2019t come out the way I meant it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re excellent at what you do. Come in and meet the staff\u2014all two of the rest of our day crew.\u201d</p><p>She turned, not waiting for him, and entered through the front door.</p><p>Deputy Betty Ivy was on duty at the desk when they came in. Again, someone had been overoptimistic about the growth of Lily. There were three offices for senior law officials, but since they only had six law officials all told\u2014three on days, three at night, reduced to two at various hours to avoid overtime\u2014one office was usually empty. Betty often manned the front desk during the day. Lamont Atkins, an easygoing man in his mid-forties who managed to maintain more control with a quiet voice than any swaggering might accomplish, also worked the day shift. Lamont started his day by touring around in town; he liked to show that the sheriff\u2019s department was ever-vigilant. Chet Morgan rounded out his day crew.</p><p>As they walked in, Jane Everett breezed right up and introduced herself to Betty with professional charm before Sloan could make the introductions. From his office behind the entry, Chet Morgan rose and came out to join them by the front desk, grinning and friendly as he met Jane.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve set up the skull in the interrogation room,\u201d Betty said, standing. \u201cI\u2019ve got a scanner in there, camera connected to the computer, sketch pad... I\u2019ve watched a few forensic programs, so I thought you might want to take a lot of pictures and do whatever you do to get that 3-D image thing going. I mean, the computer has a camera, but I wasn\u2019t sure how you\u2019d move it around to get the right angles, so...well, anything you need, we\u2019ll do our best to get for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect, thank you. Actually, more than perfect. I have my own instruments for measurements. I\u2019ll probably do what I call an imagination sketch today\u2014just what I see from the skull,\u201d Jane told her. \u201cIt\u2019s late, and I\u2019ve come in from the D.C. area, so I\u2019m little travel-weary. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll start with the measurements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m intrigued to see your work!\u201d Betty said enthusiastically.</p><p>Betty was a good woman\u2014and a good deputy. When he\u2019d come back to Lily, Sloan had been surprised that she hadn\u2019t wanted the job of sheriff herself. A widow with two grown children, she\u2019d worked for the department most of her adult life. But she hadn\u2019t wanted the responsibility of being sheriff. She had iron-gray hair, cheerful blue eyes and a way of handling the occasional drunk or kid working on a misspent youth with unshakeable stoicism and a calm demeanor. She had the ability to convince both drunks and adolescents that they weren\u2019t going anywhere\u2014they\u2019d pay the price for their transgressions before a judge and no fast-talking lawyer was getting them out of the clink that night. Sloan had told her that being sheriff of Lily wasn\u2019t really a matter of heavy responsibility but Betty had said, \u201cOh, Sloan, small towns can still have big problems. I like being a deputy. You run for sheriff. I\u2019ll vote for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Everett\u2014Agent Everett!\u201d Chet said, quickly correcting himself. \u201cAnything you need, you let me know!\u201d</p><p>Chet was only twenty-six. He was staring at Jane Everett as if Marilyn Monroe had risen from the grave and floated into their offices. He was as good and solid a deputy as Betty, just...young. Tall, a bit awkward, Chet had served in the military as a sharpshooter before returning to Lily\u2014and a parade in his honor. Lily was small; the return of a serviceman was an occasion to be celebrated.</p><p>\u201cAgent, come with me, if you will,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cI\u2019ll show you your workroom. And the skull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, show her the kitchen and where to find coffee, too, huh?\u201d Betty said, frowning at Sloan before turning to smile at Jane again. \u201cWe\u2019ve got sodas, coffee, snacks, you name it. Kitchen\u2019s the first door on the left down that hall and you help yourself to anything. Oh, and you have an intercom in there. If you need me for anything, just push the button and call me.\u201d</p><p>Jane thanked Betty and Chet and followed Sloan down the hall. He opened the door to Interrogation Room A. They also had Interrogation Rooms B and C, but they\u2019d never actually used A to interrogate anyone, much less B or C.</p><p>He opened the door and turned on the lights. There was a desk with a computer and they\u2019d also set up a graphic arts easel with a large sketch pad for their guest. As she\u2019d said, Betty had supplied their guest with a camera, computer, scanner, tracing paper, \u201ctissue markers,\u201d wire and mortician\u2019s wax. The skull itself had been set in the middle of a conference table in the center of the room; it was on a stand, minus the wig and with a few adjustments. Sloan hadn\u2019t known much about reconstructing a lifelike image from a skull, but Betty had done some research and had some help from a professor friend in Tucson. The skull had been angled to the best of the professor\u2019s ability at a \u201cFrankfurt plane,\u201d or the anatomical position of the skull as it naturally sat on the body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The jawbone, disarticulated, lay in front of it, just as it had when it was found.</p><p>Jane seemed to have eyes for nothing but the skull. She walked right up to it, studied it for a moment and then picked up the jaw, testing the jagged lines that connected it.</p><p>\u201cThe M.E. was right,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s very old.\u201d She glanced at Sloan. \u201cIf this was someone who\u2019d died more recently, the structure would have more integrity. The years gone by create these soft spots. If you pressed too hard along one of these lines, it could just fall apart. I would agree that it\u2019s the skull of a woman\u2014probably in her late twenties or early thirties, judging by the fusion of the bones. She took good care of her teeth, since there\u2019s very little decay.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment, she closed her eyes. She seemed to be in a trance; she looked like a medium standing there, as if she could communicate with the bone.</p><p>Irritated, he cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She turned to look at him, and she seemed equally irritated. \u201cSheriff, you are, after all, the sheriff. A very busy man. I\u2019m sure I can find my own way around the office. I\u2019ll help myself to coffee...if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe change to the night crew at five,\u201d he told her. \u201cPlease wrap up your work for the day by then. I\u2019ll get you back to the Gilded Lily and then pick you up in the morning, about 8:00 a.m.\u2014if that works for you.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cYes, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He left her and returned to his office, the one directly behind Betty\u2019s desk. There were several folders waiting for him. He picked up the first\u2014the arrest report for Arty Johnson. Arty was an old-timer with a penchant for drinking too much. He\u2019d wind up banned from the Gilded Lily and the saloon, but he was really a decent guy, and he\u2019d quickly work his way back into the good graces of the management. Last week, Arty had gotten a little carried away and joined the cast onstage at the Gilded Lily. Henri Coque, incensed at the time, had demanded that he be arrested. Arty had slept it off in one of the five cells, and then Sloan had driven him home. Arty had rued his behavior all the way.</p><p>He set the file aside. Hopefully, Henri wouldn\u2019t press charges.</p><p>He picked up the next file, shaking his head. Jimmy Hough, local high-school senior and football star, was in the cells now. His father owned a beefalo farm; the meat hadn\u2019t become as popular in the east as they\u2019d expected, but Caleb Hough still made a fortune selling his hybrid meat. Jimmy had taken his father\u2019s Maserati out for a spin and crashed into Connie Larson\u2019s Honda. When he was picked up, he\u2019d been as high as a kite\u2014not even Lily, Arizona, escaped the drugs that continued to ravage schools.</p><p>Logan decided this was a good time to type up reports.</p><p>An hour passed as he dealt with paperwork. Then he became aware of a commotion out front. He looked up. Caleb Hough was accosting Betty, reaming her out for putting his son\u2019s future at risk.</p> <p>Sloan got up and went out to meet the big man. Caleb wore his wealth as if it were clothing. Maybe that was what happened to self-made men, at least in areas like this, where the population was sparse.</p><p>\u201cTrent!\u201d Hough bellowed as Sloan walked out. \u201cYou had the audacity to order your deputy McArthur to keep my kid in jail overnight. It was just a fender bender! Jimmy has a future\u2014he\u2019s a star! He\u2019s being scouted by colleges across the country. If my boy has a record\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHough, I had my deputy keep your boy in here when he was picked up because he was three sheets to the wind. I would think you\u2019d want him learning something about accountability. No, he\u2019s not a bad kid, and I don\u2019t want to see him with a record. I didn\u2019t just throw him in and forget him, either. I asked Doc Levin in to check on him. I also had a good conversation with him and with Connie Larson. Jimmy didn\u2019t leave the scene, and he was concerned about hitting Connie. I kept him overnight because, for one, he needed to sober up. Two, he needed a lesson. I let him out this morning, since Connie doesn\u2019t want charges pressed and there were no witnesses, and I believe that he\u2019s a good kid. However...he knows I\u2019m watching him now, even if you aren\u2019t. I warned him that if he takes one step in the wrong direction, I\u2019ll throw the book at him. He\u2019s charged with careless driving. Now, get the hell out of here before I charge you with something.\u201d</p><p>Hough scowled at him furiously. \u201cWho do you think you\u2019re talking to? Who do you think you are, putting in your two cents on how to raise my boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be a boy in a year, Caleb. He\u2019ll be of legal age\u2014and if he doesn\u2019t learn his lessons now, he\u2019ll face some real problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the end of this!\u201d Hough warned him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope it is. For your son\u2019s sake,\u201d Sloan told him.</p><p>Hough seemed about to explode. But he turned on his heel and stalked out. Sloan followed him to the door and saw Jimmy Hough standing in front, looking as if he wanted to crawl into a hole. His father walked up to him and slammed the back of his head. Sloan reached for the door but felt Betty\u2019s hand on his arm.</p> <p>\u201cLet it go. The kid\u2019s okay. Maybe he\u2019ll survive the old man,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>He nodded and went back to his office. Betty followed him. \u201cHe is pretty powerful, you know, with all his money. Maybe you don\u2019t want to be enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf money can buy this office, Betty, I don\u2019t want it,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to cause you trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have charged the kid with a DUI,\u201d Sloan muttered. \u201cI didn\u2019t because Jimmy was so remorseful and no one was hurt\u2014and because I figured he did deserve a second chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there were no witnesses,\u201d Betty reminded him. \u201cAnd Connie\u2019s not going to file charges.\u201d</p><p>As they spoke, the door opened and he saw that Declan McCarthy, his senior-ranking night deputy, had arrived. It was time for the shift change.</p><p>He shoved his folders into a desk drawer, anxious to leave. \u201cLet\u2019s call it a day, Betty. Declan is here.\u201d</p><p>Declan came in cheerfully. He\u2019d started off working as an officer in Detroit. He frequently said that he found Lily, Arizona, to be like a little piece of hot, dry heaven.</p><p>Betty went out to report on the day, but there wasn\u2019t much. Sloan closed his computer and went to retrieve Jane Everett.</p><p>He knocked on the door before opening it. She was sitting in front of the easel and had just finished a drawing.</p><p>Sloan paused, staring at the rendering she\u2019d done. It was only a sketch, but she\u2019d done a remarkable job of capturing life. The woman on the page seemed vibrant\u2014on the verge of speaking. Jane had her hair tucked in a bun, a few tendrils escaping to fall over her forehead. She wore a secretive smile as if she held some tidbit of information that she might be convinced to share with others.</p><p>The oddest thing was that he sensed something familiar about her....</p><p>\u201cSheriff? Ready to go?\u201d she asked briskly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re already done?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo\u2014well, yes and no. I attached the jaw and did some of the easier work. That\u2019s my preliminary, a bit of a guesstimate. This is what you might call a special science, because it\u2019s a combination of science and art. It\u2019s two-dimensional. You take photographs, feed them into the computer, fill in the tissue-depth approximations for race, age and sex and get a computer mock-up. In the sketch, I worked with images of the skull, using printouts and tracing paper, and this is what I came up with. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll start with the tissue markers\u2014build in the most likely muscle and tissue depths measurements, and begin physically reconstructing. This is just my first imagining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty remarkable,\u201d he said. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the image she\u2019d created. He gave himself a mental shake. \u201cYes, I\u2019m ready when you are.\u201d</p><p>Jane picked up the coffee cup she\u2019d apparently gotten from the kitchen, collected her bag and moved toward the door. She stopped. He was still in the doorway, he realized, staring at the drawing she\u2019d done, wondering why he felt he knew the woman in the drawing.</p><p>\u201cSheriff?\u201d</p><p>He stepped aside. She exited the room ahead of him, and he heard water running as she washed her coffee mug. He was still gazing at her rendering of a woman\u2019s face.</p><p>He made himself turn away and leave.</p><p>Back in the front office, he introduced Jane to Declan McCarthy, Scotty Carter, the night man on the desk, and Vince Grainger. Now she\u2019d met his entire department.</p><p>Once outside, he again opened her car door, before he walked around to his own.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak. He didn\u2019t try to make small talk.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t dislodge the mental image he now had of a living, breathing woman.</p><p>Except that she was long dead.</p><p>And nothing remained of her except her skull.</p><p>2</p><p>The Gilded Lily\u2019s bar and restaurant was open for business when Sloan Trent dropped Jane off. The inner doors that had been locked earlier were now wide-open, and the slatted doors invited travelers to enter\u2014just as they had for over a hundred years. Jane walked in, quickly noting there was no one around that she\u2019d already met. She was assuming the actors she\u2019d encountered that morning were getting into costume or makeup or perhaps finishing dinner somewhere else. In any event, she didn\u2019t recognize a single person in the bar.</p><p>A waitress in a prairie costume, her hair covered by a bonnet, greeted her as she came in. \u201cDinner, miss? Or did you just wish to sit at the bar?\u201d</p><p>Jane smiled. \u201cNeither. I\u2019m going upstairs. I\u2019m staying here for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d The young woman smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Liz. You\u2019re the artist. Welcome. If you want to eat, call down to the bar. We can run something up if you want privacy. And if not, well, come on down! I know you\u2019re here to work on a project, but you should take some time to see the place. Desert Diamonds across the street has great books and weird little treasures. The spa is terrific. The Old Jail is a neat place to stay\u2014really scary. I live in town, but I rented a room there once. Oh, and you have to get down to the basement in the Gilded Lily. Henri took me through once.\u201d She paused and laughed. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t need to do anything to set it up as a haunted attraction! They have old wig stands with painted and carved faces that can totally creep you out and a room filled with old film and theater stuff. Mannequins and wooden cutouts. Some of the mannequins were dressmakers\u2019 dummies. Some were theatrical displays and some were movie props. One of the directors in the 1950s had Hollywood connections and started collecting them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSounds like a museum,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cIt could be!\u201d Liz told her. \u201cThe theater is a treasure trove of history. And, honestly, the food here is good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I can\u2019t wait to see it all\u2014and I\u2019ll be down in a bit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>Jane headed for the stairs. She needed a few minutes to gather her composure before returning into public again. There were times when federal agents didn\u2019t get along well with the local law and yet, in her experience, everyone just wanted a solution to the crime. She was surprised by the simmering hostility that seemed to lie beneath the sheriff\u2019s not-entirely-cordial exterior. So, he thought they should have packed up the skull and sent it off. Fine. Turned out it wasn\u2019t his call. The mayor had wanted to hang on to it.</p><p>On the other hand, she and Trent had Texas in common. It wasn\u2019t as if she hadn\u2019t dealt with a few rugged macho-man cowboy types in Texas, but Sloan Trent personified every aspect of that image. Physically and in his attitude and manner. He was six-three or so, broad-shouldered, with the kind of ruggedly sculpted face that instantly made him larger than life.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to behave as though he\u2019d been burdened with an adolescent.</p><p>Add to that the fact that he\u2019d worked with Logan, so surely he knew that the Krewe units were different. That they were called in when it seemed a sixth sense, an awareness of the unusual, was needed. Even within their own branch of the FBI\u2014although they were respected for their record of solving cases\u2014they were often known as ghost-busters.</p> <p>They could live with it. They knew that many of their fellow agents looked at them with a certain amount of awe, as well.</p><p>Maybe that was Sheriff Trent\u2019s problem. Maybe he thought she\u2019d create an image and then insist on a s\u00e9ance or something to put their dead woman to rest.</p><p>Actually, the whole situation was annoying. Because, like it or not, she found him extremely attractive\u2014and she worked with a lot of extremely attractive men. She gritted her teeth; she hated the fact that she was drawn to him and that, despite all common sense, she found him compelling on many levels.</p><p>Sexual among them.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be here that long!\u201d she told herself. She was a federal agent with a good reputation. She wasn\u2019t naive and she wasn\u2019t going to accept unprofessional behavior from anyone, attractive or not.</p><p>When she entered her room and closed the door, she said aloud, \u201cSo, the sheriff is an ass. I\u2019ve put up with worse.\u201d</p> <p>She was startled when her hairbrush came flying out of the dressing room and nearly smacked her in the head.</p><p>Her regulation weapon was holstered and she instantly drew, flicking off the safety. She walked cautiously into the dressing room but there was no one there and nothing else was out of place. She walked into the bathroom, but again, saw nothing.</p><p>Returning to the bedroom, she holstered her weapon. \u201cInteresting,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI assume you\u2019re Sage McCormick, although, of course, I could be wrong. If I said anything that offended you, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll keep my opinions to myself.\u201d</p><p>The room yielded nothing.</p><p>She kicked off her shoes, removed her jacket and holster and plopped down on the bed. It had been a long day of travel, since she\u2019d started off at the crack of dawn, East Coast time. She was tired. She lay there for a few minutes with her eyes half-open, wary now of the room. But nothing else happened. Finally, she decided she wanted a shower, and if she was going to have a shower and get something to eat, she needed to rise before she fell asleep and found herself waking, starved, at three or four in the morning.</p><p>She placed her gun and holster in the bedside drawer, went through her closet for fresh clothing and hurried into the bathroom. The whirlpool was tempting, but it would send her right to sleep and she had to switch time zones. Instead, she got into the shower and emerged ten minutes later, feeling nicely refreshed.</p><p>Still in the bathroom, she dried off, then wrapped the towel around herself and looked in the mirror. It was solidly misted from the steam. But as she picked up a facecloth to clear it, she paused. An eerie sensation swept over her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone.</p> <p>And as she stood there, writing appeared in the mist.</p><p>BEWARE</p><p>She froze. She\u2019d long accepted that there was a thin veil between life and death and that restless spirits could linger behind for any number of reasons. And yet, despite everything, despite every Krewe case she\u2019d worked and those she\u2019d been involved with for the San Antonio police, she still felt a moment\u2019s primal fear. Her heart thudded. Her breath caught.</p><p>The writing began again.</p><p>TRICKSTER</p><p>\u201cBeware of a trickster,\u201d she said, exhaling as she did. \u201cWho is the trickster?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>But, this time, she wasn\u2019t to be answered. \u201cTalk to me, please. If there\u2019s something I should know...\u201d</p><p>No more writing appeared in the mist on the mirror.</p><p>She didn\u2019t touch it. She brushed her teeth and looked again. Nothing more than the two words she\u2019d already seen.</p><p>She left the bathroom, closing the door so the mist would remain awhile longer, and dressed in casual clothes for the evening to come. She debated staying in the room, but by the time she\u2019d brushed her hair, the fog had cleared in the bathroom mirror and no other incidents had occurred.</p><p>Jane figured she\u2019d go downstairs for dinner. She stood in the middle of the room. \u201cI know you\u2019re here,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you have something to tell me, please do.\u201d</p><p>No objects flew, the air didn\u2019t grow cold, nothing happened at all.</p><p>And still, Jane was certain that she was being watched. And judged.</p><p>She made her way downstairs, and when she reached the lower level, she noticed that the velvet curtains were drawn and that laughter was coming from the theater section of the Gilded Lily. She turned and saw that there were still a few diners at the tables and a mix of locals and tourists at the bar; she assumed the locals were the men in work wear rather than the designer jeans and denim shirts or T-shirts and cutoffs the tourists tended to wear. Women, of course, were harder to peg. Several wore casual dresses and others were in pants or jeans and T-shirts.</p><p>She sat at a table that she thought must be in Liz\u2019s station, since she was delivering food to a family at a nearby table. She was right. As she studied the menu, Liz breezed by with a smile. \u201cHi, glad you came down! Okay,\u201d she said, lowering her voice, \u201cI don\u2019t suggest the fish. We have farm-raised tilapia and it\u2019s kind of blah. Are you a vegetarian? We do a cheese and broccoli risotto that\u2019s absolutely delicious. But, hey, we\u2019re in meat country. The beefalo is pretty darned good, either as a steak or in a burger. And then, of course, there\u2019s Tex-Mex. We have excellent fajitas, tacos, burritos...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe risotto sounds great,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cOh, you are a vegetarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jane shook her head. \u201cIt just sounds good for tonight.\u201d</p><p>Liz was going to give her the full list of wine choices to complement her meal but Jane didn\u2019t think she wanted her perceptions dulled in the least that night. \u201cI\u2019ll have an iced tea, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing!\u201d Liz said. \u201cBe right back. Oh, take a peek at the show if you like\u2014just slip through the curtain. We\u2019ve all been told that you have free rein of the place and to make you as happy as we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really nice. Thank you,\u201d Jane told her.</p><p>Liz grinned and hurried off, and Jane decided to check out the show. As she stepped through the divide in the curtain, she saw that there was a full house and moved to the side to hover in the background.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, oh, no! What shall I do, what shall I do?\u201d Valerie Mystro was crying out as Jane entered. Valerie was tied to the train tracks on the stage, struggling against the ropes that held her there while a train whistle sounded in the background.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, my heart, I\u2019m coming!\u201d Cy Tyburn cried in return. He\u2019d been tied to the old stagecoach across from the tracks.</p><p>\u201cSave her! Save her!\u201d someone from the audience called out enthusiastically.</p><p>Cy stopped and looked at the audience, arching his brows. \u201cWell, duh!\u201d he said, bringing a rise of laughter from the crowd.</p><p>Jane laughed herself as he tried to drag the stagecoach toward Valerie.</p><p>\u201cThe knife!\u201d Valerie shrieked.</p><p>\u201cThe knife?\u201d Cy asked.</p><p>\u201cThe one strapped to your ankle, idiot!\u201d someone yelled from the audience.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah...yeah!\u201d Cy said.</p><p>The play was ridiculous, Jane could see, but tremendous fun, and the audience seemed to love it. Cy cut himself loose, then ran over and freed Valerie as the audience urged him on.</p><p>Valerie spoke loving words of appreciation, while he gazed into her eyes adoringly. The two ran offstage together just as a train pulled out from behind the curtains. Alice, in full vamp mode, was standing in the front of the locomotive, hissing as she saw that she\u2019d lost her victims. The audience booed her until she stepped down, played with them, telling them she was really a good girl caught in terrible circumstances. Then she launched into a musical number in which she told the audience why everyone should love a vamp. Watching, Jane smiled. It was a cute show, suitable for all ages. The physical humor had broad appeal and the sets were impressive.</p><p>She felt a tap on her shoulder. Liz had come in to get her.</p><p>\u201cTake your time, but your food is on the table,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cAnd,\u201d she whispered, \u201call hell breaks loose when the show lets out!\u201d</p><p>Jane whispered a thank-you and watched a few more minutes of the show. As Alice\u2019s musical number ended, Cy Tyburn, naive and innocent hero, came back onstage. He tried to warn Alice about the evil machinations of the villain, Brian Highsmith, and Alice listened with wide-eyed adoration. They shared the number \u201cYou Make a Bad Girl Even Better at Being Badder.\u201d</p><p>It was clever, and Jane decided that the next night she\u2019d make a point of seeing the whole show. She quietly left the theater and returned to her table. A metal cover had been placed over her plate to keep her meal warm and, as she lifted it, she glanced at the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A woman was standing on the upper landing, her hand resting on the stair rail. She was dressed in late-Victorian attire, in a dark green travel suit with a slight bustle and a tailored jacket over a high-buttoned blouse. A green hat was worn at an artistic angle, her dark hair neatly tied at her nape. Her facial structure was elegant, handsome. She stared down at Jane, and for a moment, Jane thought she was an employee who worked in the bar or food area\u2014or perhaps sold tickets or souvenirs. But as she watched Jane, she raised her hand from the rail, adjusted a glove and slowly faded away, her eyes on Jane all the while.</p><p>Sage McCormick? Jane wondered. And if so, what had happened to her?</p><p>Judging by the way the woman had stared at her, Jane wasn\u2019t at all certain that Sage\u2014if that was indeed who it was\u2014liked her or felt happy to have her there.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t ponder the question long. She felt a real presence nearby and turned.</p><p>Sheriff Trent was back. She glanced up at him, thinking again that he fit his Western town very well. He had the rugged good looks of a cowboy, a frontiersman. She was disturbed at feeling her heart rate increase as he stood before her; she was afraid she was going to blush. But, like it or not, he was a very attractive man, masculine, rugged, exuding casual confidence.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, indicating the seat across from her.</p><p>\u201cTables are at a premium right now,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe show\u2019s almost over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose it would be a neighborly thing to do, refusing you a chair,\u201d Jane said. Sloan Trent had made it fairly evident that he didn\u2019t approve of her any more than the ghost seemed to.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like staying here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve only had a few hours. But the room is both historic and lovely, the employees and the theater people all seem very pleasant, and I\u2019m about to judge the food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, please, eat!\u201d he urged. \u201cLiz.\u201d He greeted the waitress who\u2019d seen him and she came over.</p><p>\u201cSloan, nice to see you!\u201d Liz said with her natural warmth and enthusiasm. \u201cWhat would you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever our guest is having. It looks good,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d Liz nodded and moved away.</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess you really were desperate for a chair\u2014since you don\u2019t seem to want me in this town,\u201d Jane said lightly.</p><p>He grinned at that and shrugged. \u201cHave I been an ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I would say so. Especially since you\u2019re the one who called Logan and asked if he knew a forensic artist he could recommend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s nothing personal. And yes, I called Logan. I wanted the skull sent out, say, to the Smithsonian or something. But when Henri, as mayor, said no...\u201d Sloan shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand Henri Coque\u2019s motivations. I\u2019m worried that he wants to use a dead woman\u2019s skull as a tourist attraction, a ghost story...a fabrication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just clinging to history,\u201d Jane suggested.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a notion that he can create some kind of great romantic story that will make the theater and the town even more appealing. You know, hit up the travel sites and magazines and so on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that really such a bad thing?\u201d Jane asked.</p> <p>Liz delivered an iced tea to Sloan and he thanked her. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just think that there are labs better situated to deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my brief, I read that no one has any idea how the skull got where it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Henri is always saying that one day he\u2019ll get all the \u2018treasures\u2019 in the basement organized. Some of the things down there really are priceless. Old cutouts for advertising and promo, dressmakers\u2019 dummies, mannequins\u2014some are wire, some are wooden, some are cardboard. Some are junk and some are certainly collector\u2019s items. The problem is, it\u2019s such a hodgepodge, the actors seldom go down there. Now, the wigs are used, but they hadn\u2019t been in about a year. What happened was that the show was about to open and Valerie\u2019s wig had been damaged, so she went to see what else they had down there until it could be fixed. But...if she hadn\u2019t needed a wig, the skull could have sat there for weeks or months or who knows how much longer. They hadn\u2019t been touched in ages, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was powder residue on it so I assume you tested for prints?\u201d Jane asked. \u201cOr was it just seen as an act of mischief\u2014not really worth investigating\u2014since no real crime was committed? At least, not a current crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMischief, but the kind of mischief that infuriated Henri. Yes, we tested for prints and found none. It had been wiped clean. I mean, there weren\u2019t even prints from way back when. Nothing at all. Someone wore gloves and knew enough to wipe it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re thinking maybe it was someone who\u2019d been in law enforcement?\u201d Jane asked skeptically.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo! I was thinking someone who\u2019s seen a cop or forensic show at some time during his or her life\u2014and that\u2019s practically everyone. The woman\u2019s been dead for over a hundred years, so as you said, we\u2019re not looking at current crime. Also, Henri wants to exploit the skull\u2014great for tourism. I also think he wants to know who it belonged to. That might help him figure out who put a wig on the skull, and he wants to know that so he can fire his or her ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe whoever did it had to be an actor or crew member or Gilded Lily employee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like the place is locked up tight all the time. It\u2019s unlikely that anyone not associated with the theater would have wandered in with a skull in hand to hide it under a wig in the basement,\u201d he told her, shrugging. \u201cSo, yes, it had to be someone already here, someone trying to cause trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like...a trickster,\u201d Jane murmured.</p><p>\u201cA trickster?\u201d Sloan asked, looking at her curiously. \u201cYes, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, beware tricksters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, just thinking out loud,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly a good...joke when you consider that the skull once belonged to someone living and breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe after so many years that didn\u2019t matter much to whoever put it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you investigating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did investigate,\u201d Sloan replied. \u201cLike I said, we dusted for prints. We checked out the basement area. Naturally, we did a thorough search. We wanted to make sure there were no more bones down there. But whoever messed around with the skull wiped it clean, and prints in the basement would mean little because everyone goes down there from time to time. Not necessarily for a wig, but there are boxes of fabric, costumes pieces, props, you name it. So, other than me questioning the cast, crew and staff, there wasn\u2019t all that far we could go. Everyone here denied ever seeing the skull before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re at a dead end, if you\u2019ll forgive the pun. And I understand that Henri Coque might want to know who put the skull there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2014other than the person who put it there, of course\u2014wants to know who did it. Who the trickster, as you called him, might have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone with a warped sense of humor, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Sloan frowned at her. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Logan let you come here. Don\u2019t you and your group usually deal with felonies, serial killers, major crime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how could he spare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an artist. You needed an artist. If something major occurs, he\u2019ll call me back in. Frankly, I\u2019m surprised myself. You don\u2019t want me here, for whatever reason, but you called Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I explained that,\u201d he said, a little testily. \u201cI know Logan. I trust him. If we had to have someone in here, I\u2019d prefer to go with a professional sent by someone I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower struggle!\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Henri is a politician, I\u2019m just a lawman. But I wanted it done right.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cHenri wanted to call in a local artist who does landscapes, caricatures and the like. When I suggested calling a friend who could recommend a legitimate forensic artist, we came to a compromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo, I wound up with a member of Logan\u2019s own Krewe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t offer an opinion as to whether that was what he\u2019d wanted or not. He knew Logan, so he had to know something about their Krewes. She\u2019d already guessed as much. But he didn\u2019t ask the questions they usually got. Questions like \u201cAren\u2019t you known as the bureau\u2019s \u2018ghost-busters\u2019?\u201d Or \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be off chasing ghosts somewhere?\u201d Or one of her personal favorites: \u201cDid the ghost do it? Or was it the butler? Or the butler\u2019s ghost? Ha-ha!\u201d</p><p>Yes, he had to realize that Krewe units were considered \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cspecific.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t ask her another question. Liz arrived with his meal and they both began to eat, concentrating on their food. After a while, the silence grew awkward, even though there seemed to be an expectant quality in the very air between them. He was definitely way too attractive, and the sexual draw she felt toward him made her uneasy.</p><p>Jane felt that she had to speak. \u201cYou were close to Logan?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLogan didn\u2019t tell you anything about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that you were a friend he knew from Texas, and you needed a forensic artist here in Lily. He gave me a short brief on the situation, on the Gilded Lily and the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe worked well together. I was with the police force in Houston. He was a Ranger, which, of course, you know. We met when we ended up combining forces to capture a spree killer who was making his way through the state,\u201d Sloan told her. \u201cThat was before Logan joined the bureau. But I take it you worked with him before then, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I wasn\u2019t with any agency. I was brought in whenever a forensic artist was needed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, when you were a little girl, you knew you wanted to grow up and do facial reconstructions for law enforcement?\u201d he asked. There was a curl to his lip. He did have a sense of humor.</p><p>\u201cI started off the usual way. I was into nudes,\u201d she said drily.</p><p>He gave her a full-fledged smile at that. \u201cSorry. I guess I did ask that rather caustically.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI always drew, and I had a flair for faces. When I was in college, one of my professors was asked to help with a reconstruction on a burn victim. I was fascinated by his ability to take a skull and return it to life through the image he created. I didn\u2019t go right into forensics, though. I graduated, and then apprenticed on an anthropological dig in Mexico. And...well, Texas is a big state. I helped various departments fairly frequently. Logan was approached by a man named Jackson Crow, who managed the first Krewe, and I was called in. We worked a sad and gritty case in San Antonio, and next thing I knew, I was in the academy at Quantico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife does take us along unexpected paths sometimes,\u201d he said. He sounded far more open than he\u2019d been earlier in the day.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed disturbed by my sketch,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t put my finger on it, but your sketch reminded me of someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point it\u2019s not really accurate, you know. It\u2019s just the way I work. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll have measurements, do a second sketch and begin to build up the face. With what we know and what we can guess, that should give us a better sense of a person\u2019s appearance. Some of it remains guesswork, of course, but you\u2019ll have more of a likeness when I\u2019m done. But you can\u2019t know the woman. The skull is over a hundred years old. If it was from someone more recently dead, it wouldn\u2019t be as delicate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t been around for a hundred-plus years,\u201d he said with a slight laugh.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I understand you\u2019ve been in law enforcement for quite a while. Did you always want to be a cop?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re from here. However, you started your career in Texas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to Texas A &amp; M University and then into the academy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left Houston to come back here,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cMy parents died when I was a kid. I was raised by my grandfather. He was dying. I came home to be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. He had a good life and lived well. Didn\u2019t deserve to die the way he did, but then no one does. The cancer was brutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you stayed here in Lily,\u201d she said.</p><p>He had a rueful smile that could almost be described as charming. \u201cWell,\u201d he mused slowly. \u201cI took the job of sheriff. Right now they\u2019d be stretching to find someone to take my place. I have deputies who\u2019ll be up to it soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill...Houston, Texas. Lily, Arizona. You must\u2019ve become accustomed to dealing with gangs, murder...you name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily is a change,\u201d he agreed. \u201cIn a way, a damned nice change. Back in the very early days\u2014the Civil War and after\u2014you had a fair share of bar brawls, shoot-\u2019em-ups and rancher-outlaw entanglements. Then, a decade or two after the war, there were men working the silver mines out in the caverns. Those were rough days. There was a sheriff way back\u2014but no real sheriff\u2019s department, and the sheriff had to be an ex-outlaw himself to handle the trigger-happy gunfighters out here. Now, of course, we have our small-town department and the larger county department. The towns had their own sheriffs back then and county help amounted to praying that the militia might be on hand or the regular military if things went really badly. But then the outlaw days pretty much petered out in the twenties. We had a few more modern bank-robber types pass through in the thirties. In the forties, when a lot of local men went off to war, the town almost closed down. Now...\u201d He paused with a shrug. \u201cNow, we get a few bar brawls, a few fender benders, occasionally a domestic situation. But Lily\u2019s a safe place. We have law-abiding citizens and tourists for the most part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you stay because you love Lily, you love the peace and tranquility or...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr I burned out in Houston?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to burn out in Houston,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cBut no, I didn\u2019t burn out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were friends with Logan and worked with him, you were probably pretty intense as a cop,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cIntense? I think it\u2019s a requirement. Anyway, I liked working in Houston. And I don\u2019t mind being the sheriff in Lily. There is a lot here that\u2019s good. I like the history, and the fact that my family\u2019s from this area. Anyway, who knows what the future will hold?\u201d</p><p>The velvet curtains were drawn back by an usher as they spoke; people surged out of the theater area and into the bar.</p><p>\u201cTime for me to go,\u201d Logan said, rising. He dug into his pocket and left a large bill on the table. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up in the morning. Eight-thirty? We have a car you can use while you\u2019re here if you want, but it\u2019s down at the sheriff\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll build up the skull tomorrow, get a more realistic look at measurements and have a more accurate image of soft-tissue depth, at least,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should see the show while you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did watch a few minutes of it before you arrived. It\u2019s really cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatch the haunted hayride, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun. Maybe I will.\u201d</p><p>People were spilling out of the theater. He glanced at the crowd and grimaced. \u201cKind of a long day. I\u2019m out of here. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>He made a quick escape, and Jane soon realized why. It had been a full house and forty or fifty people were milling in the bar. It seemed a nice crowd; the show made people laugh and put them in a pleasant mood. Some people were going across the street to the saloon\u2014too crowded at the Gilded Lily. She could see that the theater was good for all the businesses in the area. It brought those who then stayed at the Old Jail or other local bed-and-breakfast places or hotels and it brought people to shop and visit restaurants and use the stables.</p><p>Liz came sailing by to ask her if she wanted anything else before the crowd got crazy. Jane said no.</p><p>\u201cI told you, you\u2019re totally on the house,\u201d Liz said, looking at the money.</p><p>\u201cSloan left that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man!\u201d Liz groaned. \u201cHe always tips way too much. Well, Lily is his town, and he tries to make sure we all do well here. Wish he\u2019d stay around!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to stay in Lily?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>Liz shook her head. \u201cNo. Not forever, anyway. He\u2019s popular here. He\u2019s a man\u2019s man, you know?\u201d She laughed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t smoke, but I could\u2019ve seen him as the Marlboro Man, sexy and rugged and good-looking. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a very attractive man,\u201d she replied, trying to sound noncommittal.</p><p>\u201cBe still, my heart!\u201d Liz said, and then laughed again. \u201cOh, well. You sure you don\u2019t want anything else\u2014more tea, some coffee or maybe decaf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m fine, thank you. I\u2019m going to call it a night.\u201d She reached for her purse; her food might be free, but she wasn\u2019t letting a server work for nothing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare leave money. Next time, you can give me a tip if you want. Sloan tipped enough for five tables,\u201d Liz told her. \u201cSeriously, don\u2019t you put down a dime!\u201d</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t want to insult the woman and she was afraid that insisting might just do so. \u201cAll right, thank you. But, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time!\u201d Liz said.</p><p>Liz moved on, efficiently taking orders from the crowd now seeking chairs and bar stools.</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t see Henri Coque, Jennie or any of the actors yet\u2014just the people who\u2019d been in the audience. She headed for the stairs. She glanced around to see if the slightest hint of an apparition might appear; none did. She was convinced, however, that she\u2019d seen the image of a woman there earlier.</p><p>The ghost in her room? The spirit of Sage McCormick?</p><p>And had Sage been busy in the bedroom while she was gone?</p><p>Jane turned the key in her lock, opened her door, flipped on the light and looked around. Nothing seemed to have changed in the room. \u201cHello,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>The shout came from the hall. Startled, Jane swung around. Brian Highsmith was opening the door to the room beside hers. \u201cYou all right, Jane? Were you expecting to greet the resident ghost? If you\u2019re worried, I can check out the room for you.\u201d</p><p>Brian was serious; he seemed worried that she might be frightened, even though he knew she was an FBI agent.</p><p>\u201cJust because you know how to use a gun,\u201d he said, walking down the hall toward her, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean you might not be afraid of the theater\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian, I\u2019m pretty sure every old building has a reputation for being haunted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is Lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, it is.\u201d</p><p>He paused, looking a little disappointed. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. This town...well, it saw a lot of violence. The whole place is haunted, inside and out. Are you positive you don\u2019t want me to check that there\u2019s nothing\u2014no one\u2014in your room?\u201d He leaned against the wall, presenting her with a come-on smile. Was he trying to use this as a pickup line? Did he think she\u2019d ask him to protect her, so he could offer to sleep by her side?</p><p>He was dark and handsome, and although he played the villain, he had a pretty-boy flair to him. She was disturbed to realize she was comparing him to Sloan Trent. Trent was far more seductive, even in his awkward courtesy when he\u2019d pondered opening a door for her. She liked his looks, but she was still debating his reversal, from hostility to polite and genial conversation this evening. Well, he\u2019d wanted a seat to have dinner. It could be as simple as that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Brian, thanks. I had my door locked. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid of ghosts?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot tonight. I\u2019m too tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really should take the haunted hayride trip tomorrow night,\u201d he advised. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear about all the ghosts haunting this town. Pretty scary.\u201d</p><p>It was the second time she\u2019d been told she should try out that particular Lily attraction. Maybe she would. She\u2019d enjoy learning more about the history of the town.</p><p>She smiled at Brian. He was young and earnest\u2014if a bit too persistent. \u201cAnd yet,\u201d she said, \u201cyou seem to be okay. As do the other actors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re not sleeping in her room,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take my chances tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need me, just holler. I\u2019ll be here in a second,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut I\u2019m quite tired. Traveling all day, you know. I\u2019m sure the room is empty\u2014and that I\u2019ll go right to sleep. A lot of people believe Sage ran away to Mexico, right? If so, she\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but don\u2019t forget. Just scream if you need me. Some people don\u2019t believe she ran off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d she promised solemnly.</p><p>With a reluctant nod, he returned to his room down the hall as Jane entered hers and closed the door.</p> <p>She\u2019d much rather deal with a ghost than a young would-be lothario.</p><p>She leaned against the door for a moment, and then moved away, quickly turning to lock it.</p><p>Experience had taught her. The living were usually far more dangerous than the dead.</p><p>Usually...</p><p>3</p><p>Sloan\u2019s house wasn\u2019t but a mile down Main Street where it crossed Arizona Highway 101. Although it was in the countryside, it was also within walking distance of the Gilded Lily. Only two properties sat between him and the old town. One belonged to Silvia Mills\u2014eighty-eight and spry\u2014and the second belonged to Mike Addison, who now owned the old sheriff\u2019s office and jail bed-and-breakfast. Mike was seldom at his property; his ranch overseer was a good man of mixed Mexican, American and Indian descent, Barry Garcia. Neither Mike nor Silvia ever had any trouble at their properties.</p><p>Sloan\u2019s house was ranch-style and had been built in the 1860s, first as a one-room log structure, and then gradually, as the years had gone by, as a far larger home. The front door still opened into the main section of the house, a parlor with leather and wood furniture, Indian artifacts, a stone fireplace and a stone counter that separated it from the kitchen. Beyond that was a screened-in porch with a pool; to the left were two bedrooms and to the right was a master suite. It was a comfortable home and had always been in his family. Wherever he chose to go in the future, he\u2019d hang on to the house. Johnny Bearclaw, an Apache who\u2019d come to help his grandfather before Sloan made it home, still lived here. Johnny\u2019s wife had died of cancer and he had no children; running Sloan\u2019s property and working with the horses seemed to be a good life for him. He had an apartment above the barn, which was about an acre back on the land. He looked after the house and grounds and the two buckskin quarter horses Sloan kept, Kanga and Roo.</p><p>It was late. Sloan had been out far longer than he\u2019d expected, not thinking he\u2019d actually stop by the Gilded Lily for dinner. But as he\u2019d driven through town from the sheriff\u2019s office, the theater had beckoned him\u2014mainly because he was fascinated by their visiting artist.</p> <p>And he did have to eat. That was a fact. He knew he\u2019d been rude, so maybe taking a few minutes to be...not rude would be a smart idea. He reminded himself that Logan would never have sent him his own Krewe member if she weren\u2019t good. He\u2019d gone to Logan because they both knew there were forces in the world that weren\u2019t obvious, that weren\u2019t necessarily seen by everyone. Logan had sent him Jane, therefore Jane was good.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t good that bothered him.</p><p>It was the fear that finding the skull was all some kind of catalyst, that something evil had begun\u2014or come to the surface\u2014when the skull was found. Dread had been building within him and he\u2019d sensed it, felt it in the air, almost smelled it...but been unable to pin it down.</p><p>Maybe that was why he\u2019d wanted the damned skull out of town!</p><p>They weren\u2019t dealing with a current tragedy, accident or murder. Whatever had happened to the living, breathing person they now sought to identify, it had happened way before they could make an arrest or bring any responsible party to justice. So why his concern?</p><p>He didn\u2019t know.</p><p>He walked into the kitchen and opened his refrigerator. For a moment he froze, brought to full attention as something plopped onto the counter next to him.</p><p>He refrained from pulling his gun and smiled to himself, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cCougar. Where were you? Sleeping on top of the fridge?\u201d</p><p>He stroked the pitch-black cat with the huge gold eyes that sidled up to him.</p><p>\u201cSorry, how inconsiderate of me. I\u2019ve eaten, you haven\u2019t. Hang on, okay?\u201d</p><p>Sloan found the cat\u2019s bowl, which was shoved up against the cabinets beneath the sink, and filled it with cat food, then checked the automatic water dispenser he had for his pet. It was still almost full.</p><p>\u201cYou needed sustenance and that comes first. I was just going for a beer.\u201d</p><p>The cat meowed; he was darned loud for a cat. Very talkative. He\u2019d found Sloan, rather than the other way around. One day, he\u2019d been on the doorstep and Sloan had taken him in. The fliers he\u2019d posted around town hadn\u2019t produced an owner, nor had the ad he\u2019d placed in the paper. Cougar had become his. He was huge, maybe part Persian or Maine coon, and he deserved the name \u201cCougar.\u201d</p><p>Once the cat was cared for, Sloan pulled a beer from the refrigerator and went back to the parlor.</p><p>He eased into one of the two plush leather chairs that sat in front of the fire, although tonight he didn\u2019t have a fire going. He closed his eyes for a minute; when he opened them again, he saw that he wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>The man who sat next to him was ageless. His hair was long and dark and barely graying. He wore jeans, a calico shirt and a cowboy hat. His facial structure was fine and proud, his expression stoic at all times.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Johnny Bearclaw. Johnny never entered without knocking.</p><p>It was the \u201cvisitor\u201d he\u2019d first met when his grandfather was dying. Longman. In talking, he\u2019d learned that Longman had ridden with Cochise and had been his great-great grandfather on his mother\u2019s side. He had come for his grandson, Sloan\u2019s grandfather\u2014and to see that his great-great grandson learned how to help the living cross the great plain to the great lands beyond.</p><p>Only, when Sloan\u2019s grandfather had died and crossed the plain, Longman had not. He chose to remain behind and torment Sloan. At least that was how Sloan saw it.</p><p>He managed to keep from groaning out loud. He held his silence, waiting for the spirit of his ancestor to speak.</p><p>Longman didn\u2019t say anything for a while. He stared at the hearth as if a fire was crackling.</p><p>\u201cEvening,\u201d Sloan said at last, raising his beer to Longman, who nodded gravely, then continued to stare as if deep in thought, mesmerized by dancing flames that weren\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cAn artist is doing a rendering of the woman whose skull was discovered up at the theater,\u201d Sloan began. \u201cShe\u2019s a very good artist.\u201d She was. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I feel I\u2019ve seen the woman in her drawing, and it bothers me. But that\u2019s impossible.\u201d He didn\u2019t add that he was bothered by Jane Everett, as well. She could be all business, and yet courteous at the same time. She\u2019d clearly gone through all the right training. She was truly stunning and he had to admit he was attracted to her in a way that was definitely physical but much more. Maybe it had to do with how she moved and spoke, or the depth of passion and care that seemed to lie beneath the surface.</p><p>He was worried about her. Again, he didn\u2019t know why. She was no doubt proficient at protecting herself.</p><p>Longman looked at him. \u201cAnd?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd...and that\u2019s it. Oh, there\u2019s the usual. Caleb Hough is acting like an idiot over his son being arrested. The kid is okay, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m worried.\u201d He didn\u2019t say that Hough wasn\u2019t his major concern at the moment; it was Jane Everett. Strip away the FBI appearance, the tailored business attire, and Jane Everett looked as if she could be a model for an elegant line of lingerie.</p><p>That didn\u2019t explain why he was afraid for her. In fact, there was no reason for anyone to be afraid in Lily. The town had kids who drank too much and a few adults, like Caleb Hough, who thought they were money kings. There weren\u2019t even any high school gangs in Lily and, for the most part, Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanics and old Euro-Americans\u2014everyone\u2014got along just fine.</p><p>Longman turned back to the hearth. \u201cWhen you feel the wind, my boy, it means it is blowing from somewhere. Remember that. Too often, we forget that we need to pay heed to the sights and sounds that tease the air. If you feel wind, Sloan, then you must look for the storm, for surely it is coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA storm? To Lily? When?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cA storm, a change, a shake-up. The ground is always quiet before the earth erupts. First, men feel a rumble, and if they don\u2019t heed the warning, they fall through the cracks.\u201d</p><p>Great. Really great. All he needed was a cryptic ancestor. Longman was on his mother\u2019s side. His dad\u2019s people had been a no-nonsense mix of English and Norwegian. But, of course, this land had been in his mother\u2019s family for generations. Longman was his mother\u2019s great-grandfather, and it was her father who\u2019d raised him. This house was on old Apache land, it was natural, he supposed, that his last full-blooded Apache ancestor should come to his parlor to watch invisible flames.</p><p>Then, of course, his dad\u2019s family had its share of the unusual, as well. The bad, the good\u2014and those who\u2019d just disappeared into thin air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As if reading his mind, the specter of his dead great-great grandfather looked at him thoughtfully. \u201cYou think you\u2019ve seen the woman in the picture because you have. You\u2019ve seen pictures of her many times\u2014even old photographs. In fact, those pictures have been seen by everyone in Lily. You believe they found the skull of Sage McCormick, your father\u2019s great-grandmother.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it had been in his mind. Of course!</p><p>\u201cYou knew her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI often saw her perform from the back of the theater. I was allowed in. We were tolerated in Lily\u2014my people, I mean. When the wars still raged and Native peoples were rounded up, many of us were part of the community here. I remember when Sage McCormick came to Lily. I remember her presence onstage. I remember her laughter, and that she was kind. I remember when she fell in love with your father\u2019s great-grandfather, and I remember her daughter, your father\u2019s grandmother, as she grew up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cI knew the picture because I\u2019d seen the woman Jane depicted dozens of times. She\u2019s my great-great grandmother. And I\u2019ve avoided acknowledging this\u2014because I never wanted to know how she died. It\u2019s the distant past now, but I guess the stories always made me want to believe she went to Mexico and lived happily ever after in a world where she could be herself.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAnd if there is a ghost in her room at the Gilded Lily, I wanted to believe that it wasn\u2019t her\u2014or that she returned there after her death. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>There was no answer. Sloan looked over at the chair. Longman was gone.</p><p>Maybe he had never been there. Sloan didn\u2019t know. He had never known if he created spirits with whom he could earnestly debate the dilemmas in his own mind or if they actually existed.</p><p>But now...</p> <p>Cougar, still in the kitchen, suddenly let out a screech. The cat was almost as good as a watchdog. Sloan jumped to his feet. He headed straight to the kitchen and saw that the cat was standing by the door to the screened-in porch, his back arched.</p><p>Sloan strode across to the door, set his hand at his waist over his gun, and yanked the door open.</p><p>No one there.</p><p>He looked out at the far stretches of his property. Sparse trees grew here and there, low and scraggly. His land stretched out in back until it came to a row of foothills that skirted the mesa where Lily was situated. To the left, he saw the stables and the paddocks, and all seemed quiet. A light burned upstairs in Johnny Bearclaw\u2019s apartment. He heard one of the horses whinny.</p><p>He had ten acres\u2014a big enough spread if someone wanted to hide there.</p><p>He walked out to the stables, turning on lights as he entered. Kanga and Roo whinnied again as he approached their stalls, stepping up to the gates to receive attention. Sloan patted the horses, speaking to them softly. Kanga was almost twenty, and she was as friendly as a dog and loved human interaction. Roo was \u201cthe young un,\u201d at twelve. He was Kanga\u2019s only offspring, bred from Fierce Fire, an award-winning running quarter. Sloan wasn\u2019t much on rodeos, but occasionally he brought Roo out to show. He didn\u2019t enter competitions, but Roo could turn on a dime, and Sloan liked to let him strut his stuff now and then.</p> <p>The horses didn\u2019t seem skittish. Then again, they did like human contact and Sloan had enough visitors out here that they wouldn\u2019t be skittish if they\u2019d heard someone walking around the yard.</p><p>Maybe the cat had seen demons that haunted his feline mind.</p><p>As he stood by the stalls, his cell phone rang. He answered it quickly.</p><p>\u201cHey, you down there?\u201d Johnny Bearclaw asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me, Johnny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou been there awhile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just came out. The cat was freaking out over some noise or other,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cI was about to come down,\u201d Johnny announced.</p> <p>\u201cYou heard something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounded as if the horses were a little restless. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>Sixty seconds didn\u2019t pass before Johnny came hurrying down the steps from the overhead apartment. He wasn\u2019t a tall man; he stood maybe five-ten, but he was barrel chested and had broad shoulders and huge hands. Johnny could tenderly serve a dying man soup\u2014or tackle the meanest bronco. His dark eyes were narrowed as he said, \u201cOddest thing. I just had the feeling someone was around. Strange as hell. Then heard Kanga there neighing and stomping. I saw the light spill out over the paddocks and called you. Does anything seem to be amiss?\u201d</p><p>Sloan shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s take a look around for the hell of it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould\u2019ve been a coyote who thought better of it. \u2019Course, we don\u2019t have any chickens around here, anyway. A coyote would have figured that out pretty fast,\u201d Johnny said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll split up. I\u2019ll go east, and you take the west,\u201d Sloan told him.</p><p>Some brush on either side separated Sloan\u2019s property from his neighbors, but like him, his neighbors had paddocks and stables; they all put up picket fences in front of their homes, but they didn\u2019t bother with gates. No one cared if someone rode over someone else\u2019s land.</p><p>That meant there wasn\u2019t far to go and not many places to look.</p><p>Sloan met Johnny at the rear of the stables. \u201cIf someone was snooping around, they\u2019re not here now,\u201d Johnny said. \u201cMy money is on a coyote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d Sloan looked off into the night. Behind them, the foothills were purple in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course, if anyone was around here and they knew the place and wanted to disappear...\u201d Johnny began.</p><p>\u201cThey could just head out back behind the hills,\u201d Sloan finished.</p><p>\u201cNot much there now but desolation,\u201d Johnny said. \u201cThe old mine entrances were blown out with dynamite years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoyote,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cThanks, Johnny. Get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you, too, Sloan. Everything going all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat artist come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, very good. Well, see you tomorrow, Johnny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, bring her on out. The horses could use some more exercise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d Sloan agreed.</p><p>He waved good-night to Johnny and returned to the house. He seldom set the alarm, but he did that night.</p><p>When he lay down to sleep, he felt a thump at the foot of the bed. He smiled. There was nothing unearthly about that thump; it was Cougar, settling down for the night.</p><p>He wondered why he still felt so disturbed. He\u2019d probably had a hunch from the beginning that the skull might have belonged to Sage McCormick. The story had seemed off to him\u2014women might leave their husbands, but from what he\u2019d read about Sage, she wasn\u2019t the type to walk out on a child.</p><p>Still, she had been dead for a hundred years.</p><p>But, like Henri, he was concerned. Why had the skull shown up now? Where had it been?</p><p>And where was the rest of Sage McCormick?</p><p>He thought that when he slept he might be plagued with dreams of the late 1800s\u2014dreams in which outlaws rode down Main Street in a cloud of dust and flying sagebrush. Or that he\u2019d dream of the Gilded Lily, a dream in which Sage McCormick took the stage, belted out a musical number...and then demanded that he find the rest of her body.</p><p>He didn\u2019t dream anything of the kind.</p><p>Instead, he saw Longman seated cross-legged on the top of a sand-swept dune. Jane Everett stood next to him. She wasn\u2019t in her bureau suit; she wore a long white gown that might\u2019ve been appropriate in the late 1800s or in a show...like The Perils of Poor Little Paulina. Her hair was flowing around her face and shoulders, caught in the same breeze that swept the white gown around her body. She was listening intently to Longman. Sloan wanted to tell her that Longman wasn\u2019t real, that he was a ghost or a figment of his\u2014Sloan\u2019s\u2014imagination. He was a small portion of all that had made up Sloan\u2019s past, a man he\u2019d heard about from his family, one who was wise and careful and ready to face the world with his slow wisdom, whatever the world might bring.</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t know that, couldn\u2019t know it, and yet her features were both troubled and animated as the two conversed. She needed to find something out, and it seemed she believed Longman would help her.</p><p>She continued to stand next to Longman, heedless of herself, of her environment.</p><p>Sloan was mounted on Kanga, far below them, and as he watched, a shadow composed of desert sand began to sweep out of the earth and form a barrier between him and the other two, Jane and Longman. It grew darker as it rose in a frenzy\u2014and it seemed to form the image of a man as it whirled closer and closer to where Longman sat and Jane stood. He shouted out in warning but they didn\u2019t hear him. He spurred Kanga, but no matter how hard he rode, the danger moved ahead of him. He had to reach them before the swirling dark shadow enveloped them....</p><p>He woke with a start. He was sweating as he lay there, as if his physical exertion had been real.</p><p>Sloan looked around his darkened room. Nothing had changed. The cat, curled at his feet, stared at him with his wide eyes.</p><p>Sloan glanced at the clock on his bedside table and saw that only minutes had passed since he\u2019d gone to bed. Wonderful\u2014he was dreaming about a woman who\u2019d come to town for a few days. Granted, the population here was small. But...</p><p>She would be an unusual and striking woman regardless of where she was. He would\u2019ve found her intriguing and sensual, and his libido would have been piqued anywhere he might have met her. He just hadn\u2019t admitted it yet.</p><p>With a groan, he threw his head back on the pillow. He was dreaming about Jane Everett. He would\u2019ve expected a great dream about hot sex on a balmy beach. But no, he was dreaming about dark forces swirling around, ready to engulf them all.</p><p>It was going to be a long night.</p><p>As usual when she went online, Jane found herself browsing far longer than she\u2019d intended. She discovered that she had a ton of email waiting for her.</p><p>One was from Logan. Everything okay out there? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yes, fine. I\u2019ll finish up in a few more days, she typed. She went on to describe the town of Lily, and the people she\u2019d met. She refrained from saying much about his friend, the sheriff. At the end she added, Anything on the rise? Do I need to be back sooner?</p><p>She shut down the computer; if there\u2019d been an emergency, Logan would have called her.</p><p>She rose, stretched and looked around the room. Nothing in it had changed, nothing had moved and she hadn\u2019t heard even a creak in the old floorboards around her. The clock on the mantel told her she\u2019d managed to spend several hours on the computer.</p> <p>Too easy to do.</p><p>She stood and walked into the dressing room and then the bathroom.</p><p>The mirror was clear; no words remained, not even the hint of a smudge.</p><p>Jane slid out of her clothing and into a pair of pajamas that consisted of a tank top and loose trousers. She pulled the bedcovers down and noticed that a blanket lay on the trunk at the foot of the bed. It didn\u2019t seem cold in the room so she left it where it was. The bed stretched out invitingly. She hadn\u2019t lied when she\u2019d told Brian how tired she was.</p><p>When she lay down to sleep, she hesitated for just a minute.</p> <p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAnd I apologize for anything I might have said about Sheriff Trent. He seems upset about what\u2019s going on. I believe he\u2019s a decent human being.\u201d</p><p>Once again, nothing moved or changed in the room. Jane closed her eyes and wondered if she\u2019d stay awake all through the night, waiting to see if something was going to happen.</p><p>She tossed and turned and half woke in the wee hours of the morning, feeling a chill. She was too tired to actually get up and do anything about it. She thought about the blanket, but she couldn\u2019t make herself move.</p><p>Moments later, she felt warm again and fell into a deep and peaceful sleep.</p><p>The alarm on her phone went off at 7:00 a.m.</p><p>She woke up. Light was filtering through the drapes and she lay there luxuriously for a few minutes, surprised that she\u2019d slept so well.</p> <p>Rising, she showered, brushed her teeth and dressed in a black pantsuit, a blue shirt, her holster and gun and jacket.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she picked up her computer bag and supply box that she looked back at the bed.</p><p>The blanket lay there, neatly stretched out over the bedspread. The blanket that had been on the trunk.</p><p>The blanket she hadn\u2019t reached for because she\u2019d been too tired to move.</p><p>She must have moved. She must have retrieved it in her sleep.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help shivering. Yes, even knowing that some remained behind in spirit when death had claimed their earthly forms, she could still feel that eerie sense of disquiet, of fear.</p><p>But she\u2019d learned long ago to accept it.</p> <p>And really...</p><p>What a nice gesture.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cThank you so much. I was cold, and you made me warm, and I had a great sleep.\u201d</p><p>There was no response, but she hadn\u2019t expected one. Yet as she walked to the door, a rush of cold air swept by her. If felt as if something, someone, was hurrying through the dressing room.</p><p>She started to follow. As she did, there was a knock at her door.</p><p>She glanced at her watch; she was late. Wonderful. Sheriff Trent had felt compelled to come up and make sure she was ready.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute!\u201d she called.</p><p>She followed the draft that had seemed to touch her and walked into the dressing room.</p><p>This time, there was no steam coming from the bathroom. She didn\u2019t need to go that far.</p><p>There was a message on the mirror at the dressing table. It was written in her lipstick; it looked as if it had been written in blood.</p><p>TELL THEM THE TRUTH</p><p>Puzzled rather than scared, she ignored the chill that seemed to touch her.</p><p>The truth about what?</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know the truth,\u201d she said.</p><p>She watched as the tube of lipstick she\u2019d left out on the table began to float in the air and write out more letters.</p><p>YOU WILL</p><p>BEWARE</p><p>TRICKSTER</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d a woman\u2019s voice called from outside her room. So not Sloan, after all.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d she said.</p><p>She hurried to open the door and found Alice Horton. In jeans, a tank top and sneakers\u2014her hair scooped up into a ponytail\u2014Alice looked way more like the girl next door than she did a wicked vamp. But, of course, she was an actress, and she seemed to be pretty good. She could probably play just about any character.</p><p>\u201cHey, Alice,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks. I thought I\u2019d come up and get you. Jennie talked Sloan into having a cup of coffee, but he\u2019s getting a little restless,\u201d Alice told her.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m on my way. Give me one second.\u201d</p><p>Jane left the door open and went back for her purse and bag; she hesitated and dashed into the bathroom, anxious to see if there was another message.</p><p>There was.</p><p>HELP PLEASE HELP US</p><p>As he drove to the station, Sloan was smiling to himself. He didn\u2019t realize his passenger had noticed until she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s so amusing, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>He glanced her way quickly, glad of the dark glasses that hid his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re grinning from ear to ear,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Jane let out a sigh of aggravation. \u201cCome on, now you have to tell me what you were thinking. It\u2019s only fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst I should tell you I\u2019m not rude or macho or politically incorrect\u2014most of the time.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOkay, I believe you. But now I know there\u2019s a really politically incorrect thought running through your head, so you have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, well...you\u2019re not what I was expecting. Not what I figured you\u2019d, um, look like. Being a Krewe member and all...\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me think of a TV show. Like those crime shows where the medical examiner is a beautiful woman who whispers gentle things to her corpses. You know, like, \u2018You poor, poor baby, what did they do to you?\u2019 Or a crime show where the detectives are dressed by Versace or some other designer.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him as if she were about to explode.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be offensive, Agent Everett. It was a compliment,\u201d he insisted. \u201cYou\u2019re just\u2014I mean, you must be a little aware that you\u2019re...beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at the road ahead, a slight smile playing on her lips. \u201cWell, that part of your statement is quite charming, so thank you. But I don\u2019t whisper sweet nothings to corpses,\u201d she assured him. \u201cAnd I only wish I had a wardrobe by Versace.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess, even if we know better\u2014and I do\u2014we all expect a forensic artist to be an old man like Dr. Bunsen Honeydew from the Muppets or... I\u2019m not helping myself here, am I?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me try again. Agent Everett, you look very nice today.\u201d</p><p>Her smile still teased at her lips as she turned to him. \u201cHmm. Does that mean I looked like hell yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just...hey, sorry. I told you! I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d</p><p>Her smile became an honest laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I prefer to avoid stereotypes\u2014as an artist and a law enforcement officer. But you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Sheriff. You. Spend much time at the rodeo? Or, wait\u2014walking down Main Street for a quick-draw contest with a bad guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know, you look the part. Rugged Western hero. Gunslinger. Tough guy.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSo I\u2019m a stereotype?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you definitely could be. But...are you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to answer; they\u2019d arrived at the sheriff\u2019s office. But even as he exited the car, Deputy Chet Morgan came hurrying out of the office. \u201cHeidi Murphy just called, and she sounded pretty hysterical. She took a group out on a trail ride and they found a body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA body? Did she call 9-1-1 for an ambulance?\u201d Sloan asked quickly.</p><p>\u201cShe did, and an ambulance is on its way out. But Heidi was insistent that there\u2019s no need. Says the corpse is practically mummified and that she knows dead from alive. I was going to head out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it, Chet. Why don\u2019t you hold down the fort with Betty and Agent Everett,\u201d Sloan told him.</p><p>Mummified? Were remains from the past showing up all over the place?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to ride with you on this, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>She was wearing her sunglasses and her perfect face was stoic. Sloan thought of the dream that had plagued him the night before.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better if you stay here, get your work done.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have an argument and she knew it as well as he did. She was a federal agent on loan, and a body in the desert was his territory. He\u2019d be calling in the county coroner, and if someone had been killed recently, the state police would probably come in on it, too. But...she was a fed.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I understand. But I\u2019d really like to ride along on this,\u201d she said.</p><p>He wished she hadn\u2019t been so polite, that the tone of her voice hadn\u2019t shown her complete respect for her position\u2014and his.</p><p>The dream had been ridiculous. Brought on by the fact that he\u2019d been back home too long without meeting a woman who really appealed to him. So, just because he was afraid for her, and because he was so attracted to her, he was about to be a jerk.</p><p>He checked himself. \u201cSure. If you wish. Chet, where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re by that replica Apache village. She was working with a second guide, Terence McCloud, and she\u2019s having him take the tour on back. She\u2019ll be waiting for you. And I\u2019ll warn you\u2014she\u2019s freaking out. She didn\u2019t want to hang out by a corpse.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>He started back to the car without saying anything to Jane.</p><p>She followed him, slipping into the passenger seat as he held the door.</p> <p>Once in the car, he turned to her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a ride-along. It really means ride. The trail area where Heidi found the corpse is out back from where my home is. We\u2019ll drive to my place and get the horses. You ride, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He hoped she\u2019d say no.</p><p>\u201cYes, I ride.\u201d</p><p>Of course she did.</p><p>He called Johnny Bearclaw as he drove, asking him to saddle Kanga and Roo.</p> <p>\u201cKanga and Roo?\u201d Jane asked as he rang off.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t name them,\u201d he said. \u201cMy grandfather got them from an old friend years ago. Kanga is a mare, Roo is her colt. They\u2019re good horses,\u201d he said briefly.</p><p>They were good horses. Despite that, over the years, one or the other of the two had lost a rider\u2014they could turn so sharply. They never hurt anyone; riders just slid off.</p><p>He wondered if he was hoping she\u2019d take a tumble...and not be able to come with him.</p><p>At his property, he walked around the house and straight to the stables, where Johnny had both horses saddled and ready to go.</p><p>Sloan introduced Johnny and Jane. They were cordial to each other, and Johnny smiled, honestly happy to meet Jane. She was easy and relaxed, and Sloan was forced to admit that he was the only one who seemed to be awkward with her.</p> <p>She admired Kanga and Roo and, naturally, Johnny was pleased.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get moving,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cI\u2019ll take Roo. Johnny, give Jane a hand up, will you?\u201d</p><p>The horses were both seventeen hands tall. He swung up on Roo, leaving Jane to ride his beautiful grande dame. She tended to be a slightly smoother ride. Roo sometimes thought he was still a colt.</p><p>Jane politely accepted Johnny\u2019s hand but straddled Kanga with agility. She knew how to ride, just as she\u2019d said.</p><p>He kneed Roo, and they started off at a long, smooth lope to the rear of his property and onto the trails beyond that led through the foothills. She followed easily at his pace. A half mile into the ride, through desert, rocks and scraggly brush, they connected with the standard trail the stables used for their rides.</p><p>They passed one of the entrances to the old silver mines, then the Old Trading Post set up by the stables, where no one actually worked but a few vending machines could be found, and finally reached the Apache village the stables had created as a halfway point on the ride. Although the Apache had never lived in this little array of tepees, they\u2019d set up some placards that accurately described life for Natives of the area; they\u2019d also been hired to fashion the tepees and fireplaces, drying racks and weapon stands that formed the village.</p><p>He saw Heidi sitting forlornly on a rock near the placard that gave a history of Geronimo. She held her horse\u2019s reins loosely and looked as if she was on the verge of tears.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here! Thank God! Oh, Sloan, you\u2019re here!\u201d she said, rising. Heidi was thirty-three, thin and athletic with short-cropped blond hair and dark brown eyes. An excellent rider, she often borrowed Roo when she entered barrel-racing competitions. Although Sloan had no interest in being part of a rodeo, he didn\u2019t mind lending Heidi his horses. She was calm, assured and competent, not to mention friendly and garrulous\u2014a great tour guide. She didn\u2019t own the stables or the tour company, but she did the managing and scheduling.</p> <p>He dismounted, aware that Jane was doing the same behind him.</p><p>\u201cHeidi, you called 9-1-1? Where\u2019s the body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re right in the middle of no-road-ville. I\u2019m assuming the med techs are coming by horse-drawn wagon. But I told them\u2014oh, they were being ridiculous. They kept telling me to try emergency procedures, artificial respiration. Sloan, he\u2019s dead. I mean, dead. I am not putting my lips on a corpse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeidi, they weren\u2019t here. Their job is to save lives,\u201d Sloan told her. \u201cWhere\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver here, Sloan,\u201d she interrupted, walking around behind another pile of rocks. She glanced back at Jane. \u201cUh, hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Agent Everett,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, nice to meet you. You\u2019re the artist, right? You make faces out of skulls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>Sloan had reached the corpse. He stopped, staring at it incredulously.</p><p>As Heidi had reported, the corpse was just about mummified. Brown leathery skin stretched so tightly over the skull and bones that it seemed like an eerie caricature. A dusty old hat sat on the corpse, which was propped up against a rock almost as if he\u2019d sat down to take a nap\u2014and never awakened. He was dressed in dust-covered pants, an old shirt and a vest; it appeared that he\u2019d been buried beneath the sand for years and dug up to sit on the trail.</p><p>\u201cSee! And they wanted me to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation! Gross! He\u2019s\u2014I mean, he\u2019s real, right?\u201d</p><p>Sloan hunkered down to study the corpse more closely. Jane knelt beside him, studying the dead man in silence.</p><p>\u201cThe clothing is certainly old. Handmade, I think,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert on this, but it does look like the cloth is incredibly fragile\u2014almost disintegrating\u2014and that this man has been dead for years....\u201d</p><p>Right. He might well have died around the time Sage McCormick disappeared\u2014only to appear again in Lily as a skull more than a hundred years later. What the hell was going on here? Another macabre joke? Or were these dead showing up for a different reason?</p><p>\u201cWho would do this?\u201d Heidi demanded. \u201cWho would dig up this poor guy and put him here? It\u2019s so creepy! I can\u2019t believe I stayed here waiting for you. I thought...I was so afraid he\u2019d move. I never could have stayed if it was night!\u201d</p><p>Sloan took a pen from his pocket and gingerly touched a darkened spot on the shirt. It was difficult to see clearly, but it seemed that the corpse had taken a slug in the chest.</p><p>\u201cPoor fellow was shot a hell of a long time ago,\u201d Jane noted.</p><p>Sloan felt a vibration and heard the rumbling of the horse-drawn wagon as it arrived on the scene. Two emergency techs jumped out of the covered wagon that was kept at the stables for emergencies in the desert. They could also bring helicopters, but most often, the wagon made its way to the desert. He knew many of the county techs but not all, and he didn\u2019t know these two.</p><p>Sloan stood. The men approached, both of them staring at the corpse.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the older one said.</p><p>\u201cI told you I couldn\u2019t revive him!\u201d Heidi said.</p><p>\u201cThis is a waste of time for us,\u201d the younger man said. He looked at Sloan. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I mean...well, this is unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did no one believe me when I said dead, dead as a doornail?\u201d Heidi asked.</p><p>\u201cHeidi, sometimes people think they\u2019ve found a dead person when people are unconscious or in a coma. We always try to hope for life first,\u201d Sloan said. He introduced himself and Jane, and the med techs did the same.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what protocol is here,\u201d the older man, who\u2019d introduced himself as Gavin Bendle, said. \u201cI get the feeling this guy\u2019s been dug up as some kind of a joke. I almost feel as if...we should just rebury him here. No muss, no fuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say bring him to the medical examiner\u2019s office. They can make the call there,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cYou\u2019ve already got the wagon out. I\u2019m sure historians and anthropologists will want to examine the corpse before...before he\u2019s reburied, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Lily,\u201d the younger man, Joe Rodriguez, murmured.</p><p>Sloan laughed. \u201cRight. And the town has no morgue. Our dead go to the county.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I go back?\u201d Heidi asked hopefully.</p><p>No one answered her. They were all staring at the corpse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid to try to move it,\u201d Joe admitted.</p><p>\u201cMight break,\u201d Gavin agreed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should get some kind of scientist out here,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could go back?\u201d Heidi asked again.</p><p>Sloan turned to Heidi. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll get a formal statement from you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA formal statement?\u201d Heidi repeated. \u201cI took out a trail ride. I saw this corpse sitting here. I called it in. That\u2019s my formal statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pointing,\u201d Jane said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cSee how his hand is lying there? It looks as if someone arranged him so his fingers are pointing...in that direction,\u201d she said.</p><p>She rose, walking in the direction in which the fingers pointed.</p><p>Sloan followed her. He didn\u2019t see anything at first. Neither did Jane. She seemed perplexed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s definitely pointing this way,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe tepee,\u201d Sloan suggested. The tepee that stood a few feet from him was real; it just hadn\u2019t ever been lived in by an Apache. Sloan ducked down and entered. There were cold ashes where a central fire would have burned. Indian blankets were rolled against the sides, and old cooking utensils had been set up as if ready for use.</p><p>It took a moment for his eyes to adjust. Then Sloan realized he was breathing in a scent he\u2019d learned all too well over the years.</p><p>The scent of death.</p><p>He walked toward one of the blankets and tugged at it.</p><p>A corpse rolled out.</p><p>He felt Jane behind him. She didn\u2019t scream, but behind her, Heidi let out a terrified yelp. \u201cOh, my God! It\u2019s another dead man!\u201d</p><p>Gavin and Joe came in behind her.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Heidi said. \u201cOh, God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fresh one,\u201d Gavin muttered.</p><p>And so it was.</p><p>They had an old corpse....</p><p>Pointing the way to a new one.</p><p>What the hell was going on in Lily?</p><p>4</p><p>Sloan pulled out his penlight to examine the man and try to determine who he might be and how he\u2019d died. He didn\u2019t want to disturb the corpse any more than he needed to, until the medical examiner arrived.</p><p>The corpse was dressed in dirty denim jeans and a cotton shirt. He was wearing work boots, and Sloan noted that his hands and nails were dirty, as if he\u2019d been doing manual labor. He judged him to be about forty years of age, but he\u2019d never seen him before. At first, the cause of death wasn\u2019t apparent. Then Sloan noted that the red on the blanket was deeper because of the blood that had escaped from a bullet hole in the back of the man\u2019s head. He dug into his pocket for the gloves he hadn\u2019t needed yet in Lily but carried anyway because of his days in Houston. He checked the man\u2019s pockets, but he wasn\u2019t carrying a wallet or any form of identification. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Heidi was standing there, hyperventilating.</p> <p>\u201cHeidi, you don\u2019t need to be here. Gavin, can you and Joe take the old corpse back to town and over to the county morgue and then get a medical examiner out here for me\u2014and a crime-scene unit? Jane, can you get Heidi back to the stables? You can use the patrol car to return to the office. Looks like I\u2019ll be out here for a few more hours.\u201d</p><p>Jane nodded. \u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cHeidi?\u201d</p><p>But Heidi didn\u2019t seem to hear.</p><p>\u201cI knew him! I knew him. I knew him, oh, God, I knew him!\u201d Heidi cried.</p><p>Sloan rose and took her by the shoulders. \u201cHeidi, calm down.\u201d He led her out of the tepee. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, um...his name was Jay. Jay something. He stayed at the Old Jail the other night. He was alone. He came and took the trail ride. Alone. His name\u2019ll be on a form back at the stables. Everybody has to sign a form before they get on one of the horses. He was just a tourist, I\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d</p><p>Gavin and Joe walked behind Sloan. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the old corpse back and send out the investigators,\u201d Joe said dully.</p><p>Sloan nodded. He was still looking at Heidi. \u201cSo you took him on a trail ride. The usual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, it was three days ago. I took him on a night ride. No, wait. He went on two trail rides. He went during the day and then again at night. Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeidi, let\u2019s go back to the stables,\u201d Jane said. She glanced at Sloan, evidently realizing that the biggest help she could offer was taking Heidi off his hands. She put an arm around her. \u201cCome on now. Are you going to be able to ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer horse knows this trail and the way back to the stables better than I know my way around my own house,\u201d Sloan said.</p> <p>\u201cCall if you need me,\u201d Jane told him. \u201cHeidi, come on.\u201d</p><p>Sloan watched her go, berating himself. He\u2019d actually wanted her to be an incompetent rider; he guessed that for some reason he\u2019d wanted her to do badly at something.</p><p>Now he was grateful. She was a well-trained federal agent. She also happened to be a beautiful one.</p><p>He walked over to where Gavin and Joe had managed to slide a board beneath their century-old mummified corpse and lift it into the wagon, apparently causing no harm to the remains.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get crews out here as fast as we can,\u201d Joe promised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>He watched as they crawled in the wagon and Joe picked up the reins. Jane helped Heidi onto her bay, mounted Kanga smoothly and turned to wave to him.</p><p>He lifted his hand. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, though he doubted she could hear him.</p> <p>But she nodded. He didn\u2019t hear her, either, but he thought she said, \u201cSee you tonight.\u201d</p><p>When they were gone, he returned to the area of the tepee. Unfortunately, they\u2019d all done a lot of tracking around before they\u2019d realized they had a current murder on their hands.</p><p>Sloan inspected the area carefully. In the end, he decided they hadn\u2019t messed up any tracks or caused the crime scene any real harm.</p><p>The dead man\u2014Jay, whatever his last name might be\u2014had been forced to his knees, Sloan surmised. He\u2019d been shot, execution-style, right where he\u2019d knelt. The blanket had soaked up most of the blood.</p><p>Why the hell would anyone take a casual tourist out to the desert and execute him?</p><p>\u201cBecause, son, he wasn\u2019t a casual tourist,\u201d he heard.</p><p>He turned around. Longman was with him. He seldom saw Longman except in his own house.</p><p>Sloan nodded.</p><p>\u201cI will wait with you,\u201d Longman told him.</p><p>He smiled, glad that Longman hadn\u2019t decided to reveal himself to Heidi. Poor Heidi would\u2019ve had a heart attack and he might have had another corpse on his hands.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. He pulled out his phone and called the office, telling Chet to get down to the stables and the Old Jail and find out everything he could about the dead man they knew only as Jay.</p><p>And then he waited.</p><p>Soon enough, he heard the whir of a copter.</p><p>He closed his eyes and remembered the strange feeling he\u2019d had the day he\u2019d gone to the Old Jail over the stolen wallets.</p><p>He remembered the change in the air.</p><p>The skull in the theater basement.</p><p>And he remembered his dream.</p><p>The dark cloud of evil wasn\u2019t coming his way.</p><p>It was already here.</p><p>Heidi might have been in shock for a few minutes, but riding back to the stables, she talked nonstop. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. Just horrible. That poor man! Shot dead. He was nice\u2014and he actually tipped after the ride. So he comes here on vacation and he winds up dead in the desert. That\u2019s so horrible. Oh, Lord, I thought an old corpse was horrible. A new one is so much worse. I wonder who the old corpse is? You know, not much happens in Lily. Seriously, thank God we\u2019re not that far from Tucson in one direction and Phoenix in the other, because we\u2019re pretty dead these days. Oh, God, not dead! That\u2019s not what I meant. I mean...there were all kinds of murders way back in the day. Right after the Civil War and into the era of all the cowboys and miners. Back then, I think it was a couple of killings a week. But that was the wild, wild west, you know?\u201d</p><p>Jane knew. It was just that her own mind was racing and she was only half paying attention to Heidi, which didn\u2019t seem to matter.</p><p>\u201cWe had our famous outlaws\u2014sheriffs, deputies and outlaws. Trey Hardy was the big one around here. He robbed banks after the Civil War. He was a Reb and when the war was over, his family had nothing, but he was like a Robin Hood\u2014giving money and food to everyone around him. Except, of course, robbing banks is illegal. He was finally taken into custody by Sheriff Brendan Fogerty. Problem was, his deputy, Aaron Munson, hated Hardy\u2014although I don\u2019t think he really knew him\u2014and he murdered Hardy in his cell. But people loved Hardy, and they were furious, so they wound up lynching Aaron Munson right in front of the jail on Main Street. So Hardy\u2019s supposed to haunt his old jail cell, just like Munson\u2019s supposed to haunt the street. Oh! Wow! What if we found Trey Hardy\u2019s body? Or Munson\u2019s? No, wait, that can\u2019t be. They\u2019re buried up on Dead Horse Hill, in the graveyard there. Unless someone dug them up. But Hardy supposedly wore parts of an old Rebel cavalry lieutenant\u2019s uniform. And Munson...he\u2019d probably be in a deputy\u2019s uniform. No, wait, maybe they didn\u2019t have them back then....\u201d</p><p>Jane could have turned to Heidi and said that, yes, ghosts seemed to be teeming in Lily, Arizona. And that was probably true, but what could the ghosts have to do with a man being shot in the desert? And what was the point of scaring Heidi even more than she already was?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so calm!\u201d Heidi said, admiration brimming in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSad to say, I\u2019ve seen a few corpses,\u201d Jane told her. And sadder to say, I\u2019ve had conversations with some.</p><p>\u201cNothing happens here\u2014nothing! And now a skull, an old corpse and a new corpse!\u201d Heidi marveled.</p><p>Thankfully, they reached the stables soon after that. And with almost perfect timing, her phone rang. It was Sloan; he\u2019d called to make sure they\u2019d gotten back without incident.</p><p>She assured him that they had. \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA crime-scene unit is out here, and I have Betty and Chet on finding out who our dead man is, where he came from and how he might\u2019ve gotten himself shot in the desert,\u201d Sloan explained. \u201cOur old corpse, as Heidi calls him, is on his way to the county morgue. If you\u2019re up to it, take the patrol car back to the station and work on the skull.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at that.</p><p>If she was up to it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in town. I\u2019ll clean up, grab something to eat, then head over to your place to get the car and go back to the office. It\u2019s still early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Like I said, I have a car for you. It\u2019s at the office, so once you\u2019re there, you can leave whenever you want. I\u2019ll give Johnny Bearclaw a call and tell him you\u2019ll need my backup keys. Oh, and thank you for dealing with Heidi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. She was traumatized. I can well imagine. I remember the first time I saw a corpse. Don\u2019t you remember what it was like?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet a minute. \u201cThere\u2019ve been so many now. Anyway, thanks.\u201d</p><p>His voice seemed to wrap around her. Impatiently she gritted her teeth as they ended the call. It was better to think of him as a jerk. She didn\u2019t need a one-night affair with cowboy.</p><p>Or maybe she did. Work had consumed her since the Krewe had come together. She\u2019d had a life. Once.</p><p>She shook her head. They were dealing with the dead\u2014not just the \u201cold\u201d dead, but the \u201cnew\u201d dead.</p><p>And she was daydreaming about sex....</p><p>She walked toward Heidi, who was watering her bay. \u201cHeidi, can I leave Kanga here? I\u2019ll be back in an hour or so, then I\u2019ll ride her over to Sloan\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. She\u2019ll be fine here,\u201d Heidi said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She left Heidi and walked across the street. The door to the theater was open, although it was still early. When she went in, she found Valerie Mystro behind the bar making herself a cup of coffee at the espresso machine.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Valerie said, turning around and hurrying to the bar when she saw Jane. \u201cI heard someone was murdered out in the desert. How horrible! I don\u2019t think I ever met the man, but I heard that he was here in town. That\u2019s so scary\u2014almost as scary as finding the skull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know all of this already? I just got back with Heidi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, this is a small town, remember? I was across the street at the saloon earlier, having lunch with Alice and Brian. And the people who\u2019d been on the ride came in and told us about the weird mummified man they\u2019d seen. And then Terence came in because they were closing the stables for the rest of the day. And Chet\u2014Sloan\u2019s deputy\u2014had just been at the stables to get the information on the dead man. Seriously, Jane, this is a small town. If you sneeze, everyone knows about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so strange! I\u2019m from Philadelphia. There\u2019s something going on there all the time. But when you\u2019re in a small place like this, well\u2014it\u2019s different. And this is scary. Of course, in a way, the whole place is scary.\u201d She glanced around and lowered her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can stay in that room upstairs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice room.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI like staying there. In fact, I want to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s haunted. I know that for a fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded with assurance. \u201cI actually think Henri put you in there on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he hoped he\u2019d scare me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you don\u2019t scare easily, do you?\u201d Valerie asked her. \u201cBut you should be scared.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? What has this ghost done?\u201d</p><p>Valerie was shocked. Her pretty face wrinkled in confusion. \u201cDone? Well, it\u2019s a ghost, for one. But I tell you, people have run out of that room. They say Sage McCormick shows up in the middle of the night, looking at them. They wake up\u2014and there she is, watching them sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never hurt anyone, has she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...I\u2019m sure she has. Indirectly. She makes them nervous wrecks and then they trip and fall and... People are weird! Some come here because they want to see her, but she scared the producer of a ghost show right out of here. And over at the Old Jail, Trey Hardy is still there, you know. He moves people\u2019s things around. And he just plain scares them, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not afraid to stay at the theater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one died in my room or became overly attached to it.\u201d Valerie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThis is horrible timing. Silverfest is next weekend. The money it brings in helps keep the town going for the whole year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens at Silverfest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone dresses up in old frontier wear. We have a horse parade down Main Street, we perform all day and night as our characters. All the kids in town and half the adults dress up, too. And down by Sloan\u2019s property there\u2019s a rodeo. Oh, and we have a shoot-out on Main Street. It\u2019s fun, and brings in a ton of money.\u201d She paused. \u201cToo bad it isn\u2019t Goldfest, but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s Silverfest. They found way more silver than they did gold. And there was the gold heist, so I guess we don\u2019t celebrate gold.\u201d</p><p>She suddenly seemed to remember her coffee. \u201cWant some coffee? This machine is great. American, caffe latte, cappuccino and mochaccino!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Actually, I could use something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. Sloan came for you so early. We have a refrigerator with sandwich meat, if you want, or I\u2019ll run across the street with you. There\u2019s pizza, there\u2019s the saloon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sandwich will be fine. I\u2019m going to have to get back to work,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cLet me make it for you. Salami, ham or turkey? And do you like cheese?\u201d</p><p>While Valerie rummaged around under the bar, Alice joined them and then so did Brian and Ty, all talking about the two corpses.</p> <p>A minute later, Henri Coque joined them, as well.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want a sandwich; he walked around the bar and poured himself a large Scotch.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he said, gulping down the shot. \u201cWho\u2019s digging up old corpses\u2014and why? And why shoot a tourist?\u201d He shook his head with disgust, then sighed. \u201cI guess people can be ghoulish. Maybe these corpses will make us more popular this Silverfest. Let us pray!\u201d He lifted his glass to the beautiful nineteenth-century, oval-framed portrait of a woman over the bar. \u201cTo you, my love! May we prosper, despite chaos! What is the world coming to here in Lily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr going back to?\u201d Valerie asked, shivering.</p><p>Jane frowned and studied the painting. There was a sharp similarity between it and the sketch she\u2019d drawn.</p><p>She frowned, looking at Henri.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Sage McCormick?\u201d she asked, but she already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cOur beautiful ghost!\u201d he said reverently. \u201cYes, indeed, that is Sage McCormick!\u201d</p><p>Jane studied the old painting. It portrayed the woman she\u2019d seen on the landing. Sage McCormick had rich dark curls that surrounded her face. Her eyes were large and gray, framed by rich lashes. Her lips were generous and curled into a secretive smile. She did, indeed, have the look of a queen\u2014a sweeping, emoting drama queen. And yet...there was something about her eyes. She would have done well in their modern world, Jane thought. She was a bit of a wild child, a rebel. A woman before her time.</p><p>\u201cAh, Sage! Bless this place!\u201d Henri said, overemoting himself. \u201cMay you help us prosper, indeed, because we cannot let this theater fail, can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least it\u2019s a slow week,\u201d Dr. Arthur Cuthbert, one of the county medical examiners, told Sloan. \u201cI have a died-at-home-alone octogenarian on my schedule and that\u2019s it. I can keep the old fellow on ice awhile longer. My diener\u2014assistant\u2014is just cleaning up our tourist, Mr.\u2014\u201d he paused, checking his notes \u201c\u2014Mr. Jay Berman. However, I\u2019m willing to bet he died from a .45 caliber to the back of the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks likely,\u201d Sloan said. He hadn\u2019t worked with Cuthbert before, and he wasn\u2019t sure of a medical examiner who made quick suppositions. What seemed obvious... Well, things weren\u2019t always what they seemed. He might be judging too hastily, though, he told himself.</p><p>Whoa, there, Sloan. Getting testy these days.</p><p>However, Detective Liam Newsome with the county joined him at the autopsy. He\u2019d arrived at the crime scene when the forensic units were finishing up. Newsome was a decent cop, an oddly thin little man with sharp eyes and a sharper mind. They\u2019d worked a hit-and-run on the town line when Sloan had first returned to Lily.</p><p>When the three of them headed into the autopsy, Sloan\u2019s opinion of Cuthbert began to change. Cuthbert was precise, speaking to him and Detective Newsome and into a recorder all the while. Their dead man, Berman, had been approximately five-eleven and two hundred pounds. He had suffered no defensive wounds, which seemed consistent with the fact that he\u2019d probably been kneeling. His attacker had likely walked behind him and pulled the trigger almost point-blank, judging by the powder burns. When he was done with the initial work, Cuthbert told Sloan he\u2019d have the stomach contents analyzed, which would help narrow down the time of death. His informed guess was between two and four in the morning. When the lab reports came back, he\u2019d send all the information to both Sloan and Liam at their respective departments.</p><p>\u201cSo, our tourist came to Lily and was shot execution-style,\u201d Newsome said as they exited the morgue together. \u201cYou ever seen anything like that before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in Lily.\u201d Sloan had seen the style of killing, but that had been when he was dealing with known drug lords and their minions and in a big city rather than a little town where it seemed everyone knew everyone. Even the tourists. He pulled out his phone, looking at the information Betty had sent. \u201cMy deputies traced his identity\u2014he\u2019d given the management his credit card at the Old Jail and at the stables\u2014and they\u2019ve been checking his movements since he got to town. He\u2019s from New York. Flew out to Tucson and drove to Lily late last week after picking up a rental car at the airport. He said he was on his own and just loved all the stories he\u2019d heard about the Old West. He went to the show one night and took a couple tours with the stables. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got at the moment. Appears he was friendly with everyone he met and seemed like a regular guy on vacation. I\u2019ll start making further inquiries, try to find out if anyone got anything more from him.\u201d</p><p>Newsome nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll work on the home angle. Maybe he was running from New York. Maybe his killer was never in Lily. Any word on the rental car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Betty called the rental agency. No tracking device on his car. It was a new Nissan XTerra. Silver-gray.\u201d Sloan looked down at the page and gave Newsome the license number.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a trace on it,\u201d Newsome said.</p><p>Sloan nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll start with our locals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see if he had family or friends\u2014acquaintances\u2014in New York who might\u2019ve known if he had a different reason for coming out here. You had any trouble with drugs lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than the usual. Kids, mostly,\u201d Sloan told him.</p><p>The two parted ways at the morgue. Sloan headed back to his office, stopping at Old Town first.</p><p>Mike Addison was at the desk in the Old Jail. He already knew about everything that had happened in the desert.</p><p>The fact that news traveled like wildfire in a small town had its good points; he didn\u2019t have to explain what he needed to know.</p><p>\u201cSloan, don\u2019t it just beat all?\u201d Mike asked him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear about this. That Jay seemed like an all-right guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about him, Mike. Tell me everything he said and did while he was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I don\u2019t room with my guests!\u201d Mike said. \u201cHe checked in, and he talked to me about things to do in town. I told him to see the show and take tours from the stables. If he didn\u2019t ride, he could do the haunted hayride at night. He was really a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was he out here on his own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid he was a history buff, that he\u2019d read all about Arizona and Lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did he stay?\u201d Sloan asked. \u201cWhich room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can imagine. A guy like that.\u201d</p><p>Sloan prayed for patience. \u201cMike, I don\u2019t want to imagine. Just tell me which room he stayed in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Trey Hardy cell. He was the guest in that cell right before the young couple who lost their wallets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he checked out?\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s see. It\u2019s Tuesday now.... He came in last Tuesday night, checked out Thursday morning. Our young couple got here Friday afternoon\u2014and, well, you know about Saturday. Their wallets disappeared, they freaked out and left that day after you found the wallets. No one stayed there on Saturday night. They were supposed to be there another few days. I have it booked again starting Thursday night. Everything in and near town is booked as of Thursday. The Silverfest activities start on Friday, so folks will be coming in big numbers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me have the key, Mike. I want to take another look in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you go!\u201d Mike handed him the key.</p><p>Sloan went to the Trey Hardy cell. Nothing looked any different than it had when he\u2019d been in there a few days ago to search for the wallets that had \u201cdisappeared.\u201d</p> <p>He sat on the bed. Mike\u2019s housekeeping staff was good; the cell was immaculate. He wasn\u2019t sure what he thought he\u2019d find in the cell but he began to go through the drawers. They were empty\u2014except for a King James version of the Bible.</p><p>He sat back down on the bed, wondering what Jay Berman could have been up to that had gotten him executed out in the desert.</p><p>It was while he was sitting there that the door to the tiny bathroom suddenly flew open. \u201cSo, Hardy, there is something I\u2019m missing, huh?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He figured that one day the ghost would actually make an appearance. He never knew if he imagined the vague image he sometimes saw or if it was real. Longman always appeared as a solid entity to him. He\u2019d never been sure if he was crazy or not; he\u2019d decided he\u2019d consider himself functional, if crazy, and learn to live with what he either did or didn\u2019t see.</p><p>But now, it seemed that whether a ghost or his mind was suggesting it, he needed to investigate the small bathroom that had been built into the cell.</p> <p>Shower, sink and toilet were almost on top of one another. The tile floor was clean and the wastebasket under the sink had been emptied. A mirror hung over the sink and a small cabinet, which had been nailed over the toilet, held the usual tiny containers of lotion, shampoo, conditioner and soap.</p><p>And a tissue box.</p><p>Sloan picked up the box. There were remnants of a piece of paper beneath it. Apparently, someone had set a note there to keep it from falling into the sink. Somehow, it had gotten damp and ripped, leaving behind the little corner of paper.</p><p>All that remained were a few blurred words. He frowned as he studied them.</p><p>DES DIA</p><p>It could only mean one place. Desert Diamonds. And it might not mean anything at all; Mike might have told Jay Berman that Desert Diamonds was where he could go to have pizza, coffee or buy souvenirs.</p> <p>He looked into the mirror and froze. To his astonishment, he saw more than his own reflection there. For a moment, it was as if someone stood behind him, looking into the mirror, as well, meeting his eyes.</p><p>It was Trey Hardy, his plumed hat set jauntily on his head. He looked at Sloan grimly and nodded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>He disappeared, fading away until he was nothing but a memory.</p><p>Or a sure sign of insanity.</p><p>It was late in the day when Jane finally returned Kanga to Sloan\u2019s stable and took the patrol car back to the station. Betty was just about to leave.</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d she said, pausing to greet her before walking out. \u201cHow\u2019s the work going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe work\u2014oh, it\u2019s going very well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish I knew more about what you do!\u201d Betty said enthusiastically. \u201cIt\u2019s science and it\u2019s art!\u201d</p><p>Jane smiled. \u201cI\u2019m lucky. I love my job. The form of the human skull shapes the face, but it\u2019s the soft tissue that really creates the unique appearance of each human being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow accurate can you be? When did people learn how to do this?\u201d Betty asked.</p><p>\u201cPretty accurate. A lot is in the hands of the artist, especially where coloring comes into play, though nationality or ethnic background can often be determined by the skull. There was a French anatomist named Paul Broca who was the first to use scientific methods to create images of the living from the dead, showing the relationship between the bone and the soft parts. That was in the late 1800s,\u201d Jane told Betty. \u201cThis is probably more than you wanted to know, so stop me if I\u2019m boring you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fascinated. I didn\u2019t know any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you asked for it! Anyway, Broca defined the differences between different ethnic groups. Then there was a German anatomist, Hermann Welcker, who went on to measure the soft tissue in male cadavers and found nine \u2018median points\u2019 from which to work. All this was then enhanced by a Swiss anatomist, Wilhelm His, who worked with cadavers and used the nine median points and six lateral points to further the ability to re-create the appearance of life when nothing\u2019s left but bone. As you can tell, I love it. And thanks to technology, what we can do grows all the time. Scientists and artists have worked together through the years to identify remains when all other hope of identification is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really important,\u201d Betty said. She cocked her head to one side. \u201cSo, you\u2019re an artist. Are you an agent, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m an agent. Anyone in a Krewe\u2014part of the FBI\u2019s behavioral sciences group\u2014has to go through the academy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Betty said. \u201cI love to see other women in law enforcement. Can you shoot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairly decently, yes,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>That made Betty smile. \u201cWell, you\u2019re a wonderful asset to have here. I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re usually a great place. And you got here for one of our very rare episodes of violence. Murder,\u201d she added softly.</p><p>\u201cBad things can happen anywhere. But that doesn\u2019t make the town bad.\u201d</p><p>Betty smiled again, obviously pleased at the compliment. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Bad things\u2014that\u2019s just life, huh? I\u2019m so glad that you\u2019re enjoying your time here.\u201d She gave an easy shrug. \u201cWell, I\u2019m off. The night crew is on.\u201d She winked. \u201cNot as good as the day crew, but they\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Jane laughed, waving as Betty went to her car.</p><p>Jane put Sloan\u2019s keys in his desk, got the keys to the little Kia that had been rented for her use and then spent a few hours working with the soft-tissue markers on the skull. After about two hours, however, she felt she\u2019d have to pick up again the next day. She was just too tired to concentrate and she didn\u2019t want to read a measurement wrong. True, the measurements were averages that had been determined through the years by many different anatomists and scientists. But every face was unique, something artists needed to remember as they worked, always letting the skull itself be the guide.</p><p>The problem now, of course, was that she was pretty sure she was looking at the earthly remains of Sage McCormick. Or part of them, at any rate. She\u2019d seen the painting, and she\u2019d seen her sketch. That was definitely going to influence her. But did that really matter? She\u2019d done the two-dimensional drawing before she\u2019d seen the painting above the bar and learned it was Sage McCormick.</p><p>She surveyed her work so far. Not much. The skull and markers by themselves did very little to form a human face.</p><p>Before leaving, she paused to look at the sketch she\u2019d created the day before. The woman she\u2019d depicted based on the skull had been beautiful. Of course, she\u2019d given her the sparkle in her eyes and the look of friendly mischief that seemed to radiate from her smile.</p><p>Sage McCormick. It was the same expression she had in the painting. Maybe, Jane told herself, she\u2019d been subconsciously aware of the painting when she\u2019d checked in. But she didn\u2019t think so; she hadn\u2019t really seen it until she was sitting there today with Valerie and Henri.</p><p>Sloan Trent had seemed startled by the image\u2014disturbed by it, even. But then, he\u2019d seemed disturbed by Jane herself at the time, so she hadn\u2019t gotten an explanation from him.</p><p>She covered her work with a muslin cloth. She was almost done with it and would start the buildup with clay to produce muscle structure the following day. She left the interrogation room and walked to the front. Now that the sheriff\u2019s office had a murder to deal with, she doubted there\u2019d be much interest in what she was doing.</p><p>Tired, Jane glanced at her watch and saw that it was past nine. When she reached the front office, she was pleasantly greeted by Scotty Carter, who was at the desk. He was the youngest of the crew here, she thought; he appeared to be about twenty-five, with a facial structure that suggested a Native American background.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, Agent Everett? If you need anything, you let us know, okay? We try not to interrupt you when we know you\u2019re working,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been fine, thank you,\u201d she said, equally polite. \u201cDid you hear from the sheriff?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The deputy nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s in town now. Sloan won\u2019t be taking any time off now that we\u2019ve had a murder here. Things like that don\u2019t happen in Lily very often. Well, I mean, it used to\u2014the streets ran red with blood, as they say\u2014but that was more than a century ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you learned anything about the dead man?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Scotty hesitated, looking up at her with dark brown eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing murder investigation, you know. Although,\u201d he added, frowning, \u201cyou are a federal agent....\u201d</p><p>Jane smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You don\u2019t need to tell me anything. I\u2019ll just ask how things are going when I see the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got your car keys, right? You going to be okay getting around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>Outside, the town seemed exceptionally quiet. The stars overhead had never looked brighter, but she realized that was partly because there was little air pollution. As she pulled onto the road to town, she thought that just as the stars had never looked brighter, the road had never seemed as dark. It wasn\u2019t a long drive, and as she neared town, the darkness seemed to break in a pool of misty light\u2014all the light shimmering from the theater and the saloon and the curio store, Desert Diamonds. She parked behind the theater in the paved lot.</p><p>As she walked around to the dirt road in front, she heard laughter and conversation. Murder in Lily or not, the show, as shows traditionally must, had gone on.</p><p>It had apparently concluded, since there were people spilling out onto the street, on their way to the saloon or to Desert Diamonds for pizza. That afternoon she\u2019d learned that the saloon stayed open until 1:00 a.m., while Desert Diamonds closed at eleven, staying open to catch the late-night snackers and souvenir-shoppers who might be leaving the theater. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Coming around the Old Jail, Jane paused. A man was standing in the road as people walked past and around him; he was staring at her. He wore a Confederate jacket, old-fashioned cotton trousers and a plumed cavalry hat. He had long curling hair beneath the hat, and she thought he might be an actor who\u2019d come in to work with the theater ensemble.</p><p>But even as she returned his stare, she saw someone brush by without noticing him. Someone else passed by\u2014walking right through him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t real. Or he was real, just not really there.</p> <p>She hurried toward him, sensing that he was curious about her\u2014or curious about the fact that she\u2019d seen him. But when she reached the street, he was gone, as if he\u2019d been absorbed into the crowd.</p><p>Then she saw him enter Desert Diamonds. She followed.</p><p>That afternoon she\u2019d grabbed a cold drink at the little pizza parlor in the front corner of the establishment but she hadn\u2019t taken time to explore because she\u2019d wanted to bring Sloan\u2019s horse back to his stable and get to the sheriff\u2019s office.</p><p>Now she looked around. The coffee shop was to the right, the pizza parlor to the left. The ice cream parlor was in back, and in between, she saw every kind of souvenir that could be imagined in an old frontier town. Kids\u2019 bow-and-arrow sets, badges, tour books, maps, stuffed toy horses, cows, bulls, buffalo, armadillos, snakes and more\u2014filled the many shelves and covered the tables.</p><p>Jane started walking up and down the aisles, trying to figure out where her ghost had gone, but she didn\u2019t see him\u2014just the endless supply of souvenirs. Shot glasses, mugs, cactus juice, hot sauce and kitchen utensils crowded one aisle. T-shirts, towels and spaghetti-strap dresses another. She\u2019d gone down three rows when she was startled to run straight into Sloan.</p> <p>He instinctively set his hands on her shoulders to steady her.</p><p>\u201cLooking for a killer in the T-shirt section?\u201d she asked, surprised that she felt a little awkward.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re shopping for shot glasses that say \u2018Lily, Arizona\u2019?\u201d</p><p>No, I followed a ghost, she thought.</p><p>Jane shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a curio shop. I was curious. And excuse me, but I was there when you found a corpse this morning. Sorry, two corpses. So, yes\u2014I\u2019m really curious. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExploring the possibilities,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He studied her face, then shrugged. \u201cLook, it\u2019s late. I haven\u2019t eaten in a while\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither have I,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>He had the grace to smile. \u201cWell, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, exaggerating his drawl, \u201cI just gotta get outta town for a while. I\u2019m heading to my place. Come on out if you wish and I\u2019ll fill you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I remember how to get there. It\u2019s pretty easy around here with only one road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! You\u2019d have to come back here to drop me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has been a murder, you know,\u201d he reminded her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a federal agent,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf so, I drive.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cFine. Stay up all night driving me around.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged again. She saw that he had two books in his hands and he stopped by the clerk to pay for them before they left, assuring the clerk\u2014who, of course, knew about the desert corpses\u2014that they were on it, and he didn\u2019t believe anyone else was in danger, but that, of course, they should all be careful and stay in groups to be safe.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d he said when they were in his patrol car, \u201cwhy were you prowling around the shop at this time of night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just finished work for the day.\u201d</p><p>He paused, frowning. \u201cYou went in to work on the skull after getting Heidi home, getting Kanga back to the stables and...and after this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I guess I forgot,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cOut of sight, out of mind.\u201d</p><p>Gazing ahead at the road, he smiled at that.</p><p>\u201cSo why were you shopping for tourist books in your own town?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cOur victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I came in to see Grant Winston\u2014the old guy who owns Desert Diamonds. Jay Berman, the victim in the desert, bought the same two books I\u2019ve just purchased. Seems he was big on Lily\u2019s history. All he talked to anyone about was the old legends. Apparently, a few locals, including Caleb Hough, have been in buying the same books. Anyway, right now, I\u2019m trying to learn whether Jay Berman was looking for something out here. Something the history or the old legends might help me figure out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are lots of legends\u2014and a lot of pretty violent history,\u201d Jane said. \u201cSo far, I\u2019ve heard about Sage McCormick. Who disappeared.\u201d She turned to face him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m also sure you think the sketch I did of our skull suggests it belonged to Sage McCormick.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tensed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why does that bother you so much?\u201d</p><p>He let out a sigh. \u201cI guess it shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it does.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at her. \u201cRemember, Agent Everett, I\u2019m a man from these here parts,\u201d he said, exaggerating his accent once again. \u201cSage McCormick was my great-great grandmother. Not that I knew her, or that my parents did. Call me sentimental, but I still don\u2019t like to think she might have been viciously murdered\u2014and that her body is scattered all over the place!\u201d</p><p>He swung his eyes back to the empty road, but he was aware of her shocked reaction. Which quickly turned into a nod of understanding.</p><p>\u201cThat explains a great deal,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask what.</p><p>5</p><p>It was difficult to believe he\u2019d just met Jane Everett, or that it could be this easy to sit at his house with her, discussing the case. She\u2019d spent a few minutes stroking Cougar and, naturally, the cat had reveled in the attention.</p><p>Johnny Bearclaw had left pulled pork in the oven and a salad in the refrigerator; there\u2019d been plenty for two. When they\u2019d finished cleaning up, they sat at the table together and he went on to tell her everything he knew about their victim.</p><p>\u201cJay Berman didn\u2019t have any relatives in New York. He took off from Oklahoma twenty years ago and never looked back. Both parents are dead now and his only family\u2019s estranged. He had no rap sheet in New York, but he didn\u2019t seem to have any friends, either, which makes me think he was lucky\u2014he just never got caught. He worked part-time as a mechanic in a shop and lived in a studio up past Harlem. It\u2019s not possible to support yourself in New York City with only the money from a part-time job. No one that any of the New York authorities managed to track down seemed to know anything about him, so I suspect he moved in the underworld. Petty theft, that kind of thing. He had a legitimate Social Security number and paid taxes. But other than that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo some guy who didn\u2019t have any friends in New York came on vacation to Lily, Arizona, and wound up being shot in the back of the head,\u201d Jane said thoughtfully. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She was leafing through the books he\u2019d purchased at Desert Diamonds.</p><p>\u201cHe was looking for something,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s speculation on my part, but I\u2019m willing to bet he was. And I\u2019m trying to find out what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Desert Diamonds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese books are replica editions. The Great Gold Heist is actually a compilation by a historian in the 1890s who put together a book composed of newspaper reports on the disappearance of a stagecoach carrying gold\u2014right around the time Sage disappeared. The second is written by Brendan Fogerty, the sheriff in the town when all this was going on. Certain incidents, although they occurred about the same time, weren\u2019t believed to be connected in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, it\u2019s interesting. Sage disappears, the gold disappears\u2014and they weren\u2019t connected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSage disappeared two weeks before the gold did. And while she was known for her Bohemian lifestyle, she was never suspected of being a gold thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming people went out to look for the missing stagecoach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did. They never found the gold, the stagecoach and horses, the driver or the two armed guards hired to watch over it. No wreckage, no bodies\u2014nothing,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sage disappeared two weeks before,\u201d Jane repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the man she supposedly left with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed Marston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he was considered a shady character. But he disappeared\u2014or took off\u2014at the same time. He was apparently good-looking and he had the reputation of being a womanizer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould they have hidden out for those two weeks\u2014waiting for the stagecoach to leave?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Anything could have happened. This was back in the 1870s. We have a few records, and plenty of oral legends. But they\u2019re pretty much supposition because people were making assumptions back then just as they do now.\u201d</p><p>Jane yawned. She seemed suddenly startled, looking out to the living room area.</p><p>He looked, too. Longman was in his chair by the fire.</p><p>Sloan glanced sharply at Jane, but she\u2019d already returned to the book.</p><p>He felt something cold slip over him as he watched her.</p><p>Logan Raintree\u2019s unit was known for its unusual cases.</p><p>Did they really search for ghosts?</p><p>And find them?</p><p>She stood up. \u201cI guess I should get back. Especially if we\u2019re going to be worth anything in the morning.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move; instead her frowned at her. \u201cYou see him, don\u2019t you?\u201d he demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s true\u2014you and your team do paranormal investigations!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re a legitimate unit.

Her voice was thin.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAll this time...I\u2019ve wondered if he\u2019s in my mind. But you just saw him.

People think they hear something or a shadow moves in the night\u2014and they\u2019re out of there.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cHave you seen her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure. I\u2019ve seen...I\u2019ve seen a woman standing on the stairs. At any rate, I thought she was there. And in my room...things do move.\u201d She smiled. \u201cActually, I think she might be there. I was angry, I went in and I said that the sheriff was an ass and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I was an ass\u2014out loud?\u201d he broke in.</p><p>She raised one shoulder. \u201cSorry. Yes. You had acted like an ass. I mean, after all, you were Logan\u2019s friend, Logan sent me here and you were a jerk.\u201d</p><p>Sloan kept his expression noncommittal. \u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brush flew at me.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help smiling and he wondered if it could be true\u2014that Sage McCormick was watching out for him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any special talents?\u201d he asked Jane. \u201cCan you make contact with her?\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated, looking at him. \u201cSloan, they choose to make contact with us. We can let them know we\u2019re open to it, but... I really have to get some sleep,\u201d she finished softly.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAll right. Let me get you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve just driven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man\u2019s just been killed in this town. You shouldn\u2019t do anything to put yourself at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can shoot. I\u2019m not the best, but I\u2019m pretty good.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, reaching for his keys. \u201cI can shoot, too. But I plan on being extremely careful until we find out exactly what happened to Jay Berman.\u201d</p><p>He found it was difficult driving her back. Not the driving\u2014the sitting next to her. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the fact that she\u2019d seen Longman.</p><p>She had surely seen others. Including Sage. Maybe. She knew, she understood...</p><p>He wanted to keep a distance between them, build a wall that kept him from having to recognize how different that made them.</p><p>And yet he was equally drawn to Jane Everett. To her scent, the quickness of her smile, the incredible color of her eyes. Big mistake, he told himself. She was only here to create a likeness based on a skull.</p><p>Which now seemed moot. He knew they\u2019d found Sage McCormick.</p><p>When they arrived at the theater, she opened her door as he opened his. He waited as she came around the car to where he stood by the driver\u2019s seat. She didn\u2019t speak for a moment.</p><p>\u201cSloan...she wrote to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wrote to me. Sage McCormick wrote to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sent you a letter?\u201d he asked skeptically.</p><p>Jane shook her head. \u201cNo, I took a shower, and she wrote in the mist on the mirror. She said beware and trickster. And she wants me to tell you the truth about something, but I have no idea what. Maybe she wants you to know that it\u2019s her skull. She\u2019s been cryptic, to say the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was writing on your mirror\u2014writing in the shower mist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure it was Sage McCormick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think someone came into your room? The...trickster, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m careful about locking doors. I may not have come from law enforcement like some members of my team, but I learned a lot and saw a lot,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m very careful,\u201d she said again.</p><p>He was silent. It was strange to think that a woman who had become both famous and infamous could be sending messages from the grave.</p><p>Stranger still when he was related to her...</p><p>Was this real? Or were the Krewe of Hunter units a little unbalanced?</p><p>How could he ask that question when he talked to Longman, and when he\u2019d finally seen Trey Hardy at the jail today?</p><p>He kept his voice level. \u201cWell, see what else you can get her to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said tersely. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Then he added, \u201cGo right to the station, okay?\u201d</p><p>Jane rolled her eyes. \u201cSloan, I hardly think this killer is going to wait for me to order pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take care. This killer will know you\u2019re an FBI agent,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>She nodded, then turned and started to leave.</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d he said, calling her back.</p><p>She paused, and he walked over to her. \u201cPlease, tell me whatever goes on, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. If you share with me, too. This is your town. You\u2019ll know what I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She studied him with those gold eyes, and he felt the life in them. He wanted to reach out, to touch her. He wished that they\u2019d met at a bowling alley, in a country bar...hell, online. He wished there hadn\u2019t been a murder and that they were talking about ghosts and solving mysteries because they both saw what others didn\u2019t.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes. I will...with you.\u201d He felt a rueful smile tug at his lips. \u201cEven though you\u2019re just here as an artist.\u201d</p><p>She smiled slowly in return. \u201cGood night, Sheriff,\u201d she said.</p><p>She left him then. He felt uneasy as he watched her go inside. The theater was safe, he told himself. There might be a few ghosts running around, but ghosts didn\u2019t shoot people. She was staying in a place with six actors, a theater \u201cmother\u201d and a director. Housekeepers arrived at the crack of dawn and bartenders didn\u2019t leave until just a few hours before the housekeeping staff showed up. She was safer here than...well, with him, really.</p><p>He returned to his car to make the drive back to his house.</p><p>It was late when he got home but he went out and checked on the horses and his property. Everything seemed to be in order.</p><p>When he went to bed, he was afraid he wouldn\u2019t sleep. When he began to sleep, he was afraid he\u2019d dream. Something was happening in Lily. He\u2019d sensed it the day he\u2019d gone to the Old Jail in search of wallets. And now he felt it more strongly than ever.</p><p>There were a few hangers-on at the bar when Jane returned, but she didn\u2019t see any cast members she knew, and the waiters and waitresses had gone home for the night. She didn\u2019t know the young man behind the bar and she was actually glad; she was eager to escape to her room and get some sleep.</p><p>The theater seemed quiet as she walked up the stairs.</p><p>In her room, everything was as she\u2019d left it. She washed her face, prepared for bed and curled up under the covers. She smiled in the darkness, thinking that at least she now understood why a brush had come flying at her.</p><p>She lay awake, wondering what could have happened in the past. Sage McCormick had married a local man, had a child with him\u2014and been suspected of having an affair and running off with that man. Yet her husband had been in the bar below when she disappeared. It didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>The fact remained: she had disappeared and so had Red Marston.</p><p>And two weeks later, a stagecoach bearing gold had, too.</p><p>Now, Sage\u2019s skull had turned up in the basement of the theater, another man\u2019s body had been unearthed from the sand\u2014and a tourist had been murdered. How did it all connect?</p><p>The questions whirled in her mind and, finally, she drifted off to sleep.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what woke her; she only knew that she opened her eyes and saw a woman standing over her.</p><p>It was Sage. She knew her face now. She had drawn it, and she\u2019d seen the similarities between her drawing and the painting over the bar.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>The woman straightened without speaking. She beckoned to Jane. Jane stood. Sage McCormick moved to the door.</p><p>Jane was dressed in a long cotton T-shirt gown. She wasn\u2019t sure whether she should dress quickly. She decided against it. She didn\u2019t want to lose the ghost, so she\u2019d venture out barefoot and in a long T-shirt.</p><p>There was a chill in the air, and Jane shivered. It was about 4:00 a.m., she thought\u2014just that time when the bartenders had finished cleaning and setting up for the next day. They\u2019d left and the housekeepers had yet to arrive. She wished she\u2019d grabbed a sweater.</p><p>The ghost sailed along the upper level hallway, heading for the stairs. Jane followed her down the steps and then into the theater.</p><p>Sage McCormick walked down to the dimly lit stage, stepped onto it, then turned and waited. Jane continued to follow her.</p><p>Sage led her back to the stage wings and the dressing rooms beyond. Here, it was even darker, as there were only a few emergency lights left on during the night. She could barely see Sage, but the ghost was still leading her forward.</p><p>Jane hadn\u2019t been back here before; she had no idea where she was or where the ghost was trying to take her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The apparition seemed to be upset, looking grim and agitated as she stood at a door. She floated through it and then reappeared, waiting for Jane.</p><p>Jane opened the door. It was one of the dressing rooms.</p><p>The ghost walked to the rear of the small, crowded room.</p> <p>Jane wished her nightly specter had told her it was going to be so dark and that she\u2019d need a flashlight. She couldn\u2019t understand what Sage was doing. There was a table covered with jars and tubes of makeup and several hanging racks filled with costumes. She had to push back the costumes to reach the place where Sage was standing. As she made her way through, her hair caught on a button and she had to untangle it.</p><p>She stopped where Sage was, almost on top of the dressing table. Because the ghost was insistent, she went down on her knees and inspected the floor.</p><p>At first, she saw nothing. Just old wood, so weathered that the planks seemed to blend into one another. Looking more closely, she realized that beneath the dressing table, there was something that wasn\u2019t quite right. She ran her fingers over the floor and under the table. What had appeared to be a dark spot shielded by the costume rack and the dressing table was a metal ring.</p><p>Made of tarnished bronze, it had probably been long hidden by the position of the rack and the dressing table. The latter had no doubt stood in place for decades; the feet had worn small indentations in the floor. She gave the table a shove, moving it just a couple of inches but revealing the brass ring more clearly\u2014and an area that, when carefully traced, proved not to be a stretch of wood planking.</p><p>Jane looked up at the ghost, who nodded gravely, and then back down at the loop. She slid her fingers over the flooring around it and saw that it had to be a knob or a pull and that it opened a trapdoor of some kind. She tugged at the metal ring but couldn\u2019t get it to give.</p> <p>As she worked at it, she heard a noise from the bar area of the theater. She wasn\u2019t sure why it disturbed her; there were a number of other people in the building. The scraping sound had an odd, surreptitious quality. As she looked up at the ghost, the apparition of Sage McCormick faded away.</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t like being where she was. She hadn\u2019t dressed\u2014and she hadn\u2019t brought her gun.</p><p>She held still for several more minutes and listened. Nothing. Then she was sure she heard a faint noise\u2014as if something was being dragged across the floor.</p><p>Jane crept silently from the dressing room and tiptoed back to the wings, across the stage and down the side aisle until she reached the point where the red velvet curtains were drawn back. She stayed there, glad that her eyes had adjusted to the darkness and the pale glow of the emergency lights. She used the curtain as a shield and looked out to the dining room. No one was there.</p><p>Had she imagined it? All of it? The ghost who\u2019d come to her room and the sound from the dining area?</p><p>No, she\u2019d heard something.</p> <p>Certain that whoever or whatever it was had gone, she stepped out. She moved quietly through the room, telling herself that perhaps someone had merely needed a glass of water. Or someone who couldn\u2019t sleep had come down to get a snack from the refrigerator behind the bar. She still felt uneasy. But a quick run through the bar and the dining room showed her that she was right. No one was there\u2014not then, at any rate.</p><p>The kitchen was immediately behind the bar. There was a large oven in the center, two stoves on either side, two large refrigerators, a freezer and two workstations. All were clean and shining, waiting for the next day\u2019s business.</p><p>She left the kitchen and returned to the bar area. As she did, she heard someone fitting a key into the lock on the outer door.</p><p>The housekeeping staff was here.</p><p>She turned and raced up the stairs, slipping into her room just as the outer door opened.</p><p>She leaned against her own door, breathing hard.</p><p>Then she heard another door closing somewhere down the hallway.</p><p>Whose?</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t tell. She went back to bed, hoping for a few more hours of sleep.</p><p>Sage did not come again that night. Jane closed her eyes and wondered what lay beneath the trapdoor in the dressing room. Tomorrow, she would tell Sloan what had happened. They would get Henri\u2019s permission to see what was beneath the floor.</p><p>It took a while for her to sleep, but at last she did.</p><p>She woke a few hours later and saw that it was 8:00 a.m. It wasn\u2019t as though she was on a schedule; she now had a car. She could drive herself down to the station. She supposed, with a sense of wry humor, that she didn\u2019t want to look like a slacker. She wanted Sheriff Sloan Trent\u2019s respect. And she wanted him to like her. She liked him. She more than liked him. She felt a sweet rush of fever when she was near him, the urge to reach over and stroke his hair, run her fingers down his cheek, explore the movement of his muscles....</p><p>It had been years since she\u2019d felt so attracted to a man. And now was not the time to feel this way. She loved her work. And she was here for just a short while....</p><p>Crazy. This was crazy. Even time itself seemed crazy. Maybe that was it; she\u2019d barely arrived and so much had already happened. Not only that, so much had happened between the two of them....</p><p>She walked into the bathroom to start off with a shower. She stepped in, turning the water up to a nice hot level. She leaned against the tile, looking down\u2014and stared incredulously.</p><p>Something red was mingling with the water and going down the drain.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>And it was coming from her feet.</p><p>Sloan rode Roo out to the replica Apache village along the trail.</p><p>Crime-scene tape still roped off the tepee where Jay Berman had been found. Sloan sank down and inspected the site; the crime-scene unit had been thorough. They were good at what they did, Sloan knew, so he didn\u2019t know what he could find. There certainly weren\u2019t going to be any useful prints, so he was really hoping, more than anything else, that he might figure out where Berman had been before his murder.</p><p>He rose, thinking about their present location and what was nearby. He wasn\u2019t even sure how the victim\u2014and his killer\u2014had gotten out here.</p><p>They\u2019d probably ridden. He made a mental note to ask about Ray Berman\u2019s clothing, although the report would contain any of the information they needed on trace evidence. But if they had ridden here, had they come together?</p><p>Why come here at all?</p><p>There was nothing at the Apache village that could relate to the past; it had been created as an educational site. Yes, it had been created by Apaches, but that was only a few years ago. Before that, it had been a patch of sand with a few rocks and scrub and cacti.</p><p>He walked out of the tepee. Someone had dug up a body from the past\u2014and murdered Berman. Why? Why leave the old body to be seen and Berman back in the tepee? To torment the police? Or someone else?</p><p>He stood outside looking around. Then he mounted Roo and rode around the village, studying his surroundings.</p><p>Not far back on the trail was the sealed entrance to an old silver mine. No one even knew where the one vein of gold had been found, and the silver had long ago run out.</p><p>Berman\u2019s killing, the nature of it, was something you might expect in a big city, where mob, drug and gang violence existed.</p><p>He\u2019d been from the city. One of the biggest cities in the world.</p><p>Sloan rode back to the sealed entrance to the silver mine. Dismounting, he moved to the entrance. Years ago, to prevent the unwary from going inside to explore and dying in a cave-in, the entrance had been dynamited shut.</p><p>Walking over, he inspected it. At first, all the rocks in front seemed to be as solidly in place as ever. He continued to poke at them and test them.</p><p>At the far right of the rock pile, he found a loose boulder. He shifted it\u2014and it rolled free.</p><p>He stared into the darkness, wondering if the rock had just worked its way loose with time or if someone had been using the cavern for illicit purposes.</p><p>But what?</p><p>Silver and gold were part of the past. Lily survived on tourism now. Ranches dotted the area, but everyone needed the tourists.</p><p>As he stood there, his phone rang. It was Jane.</p><p>He felt a rush of heat as he heard her voice.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sheriff, you coming into the office anytime soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m coming in. I asked Betty to let you know I\u2019d be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out at the crime scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot directly.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have found something, but I\u2019d rather not pursue it until I talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? What did you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the station. And maybe nothing. I\u2019ll explain when I see you. Meanwhile, I thought I\u2019d work while I waited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>He wedged the boulder back where it had been. He would need light to go farther into the old tunnel. He was rather fond of living, so he wasn\u2019t exploring until he had one of his deputies with him\u2014and until his whole crew knew where he was and what he was doing.</p><p>Before mounting up, he looked around again. Someone was running around the desert with a gun and executing people. Well, only one so far, but that could be just the beginning...</p><p>He wasn\u2019t letting anyone take him that way.</p><p>Right now, he was damned certain that he was alone.</p><p>He rode home and took the car into the station, anxious now to see Jane and learn what she had discovered.</p><p>No, he realized.</p><p>He was anxious to see her.</p><p>By the time Sloan arrived, Jane had placed half of her clay \u201cmuscle\u201d strips over the wooden depth-marker pegs she\u2019d attached to the skull. When she heard him come in, she covered the skull\u2014remembering that it had belonged to his great-great grandmother. He grimaced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sheriff. I can take it,\u201d he told her. But he didn\u2019t wait for her to move the cloth. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She got up to close the door he\u2019d left open.</p><p>\u201cI saw Sage last night,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He looked at her and arched his brows slowly. She wondered if he thought she might have imagined a sighting\u2014because last night they\u2019d spoken about the dead they saw. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI woke up because she was standing over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the supposed \u2018ghost expedition\u2019 guy said when he ran out,\u201d Sloan told her.</p><p>His voice was level. She still couldn\u2019t tell if he was skeptical.</p> <p>\u201cShe led me out of the room. It was late, in between the bar closing and the day staff coming in,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>He was watching her with a deep frown but didn\u2019t say anything so she went on. \u201cI followed her down to the theater and into one of the dressing rooms. She wanted me to see that there\u2019s a trapdoor in the flooring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was under the trapdoor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t budge it, and then...then I left because I thought I heard someone in the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere was no one there, and then I just ran back up to the bedroom because the staff was coming in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you want me to ask Henri Coque about opening the hatch in the dressing room,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes. I mean, I shouldn\u2019t even know it\u2019s there. I\u2019m a guest. I have no business being in that part of the theater at all.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI guess I need a reason to prowl around the dressing rooms,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a little more....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I woke up and showered...there was blood on my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cut yourself?\u201d he asked in a thick voice.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t have any cuts\u2014not even a scratch. So, somewhere I walked, there was...blood. And when I heard those sounds, it was like something being dragged. But I didn\u2019t see anything at all, so I don\u2019t know if I imagined it. And I was in the kitchen, so it could\u2019ve been blood from meat they used or...\u201d She stopped, shaking her head again in disgust. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure it was blood. It had rinsed down the drain before I realized I\u2019d tracked it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let me call Newsome and check in with my deputies, then we\u2019ll head back to the theater,\u201d he said.</p><p>He left, and she figured she had about fifteen minutes so she could get another few strips placed on the skull. She went back to work and was concentrating so fully that she didn\u2019t hear him when he returned. He must have been watching her for a while.</p><p>\u201cMuscles make the face,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAnd soft tissue. The mouth is such a major part of a person\u2019s expression, but working with eyes and nose can give us a good idea of that person\u2019s appearance and demeanor. A skull can tell you about a person\u2019s health and development, too. The reconstruction done on the skull of Robert the Bruce clearly showed the leprosy he suffered before his death. And the skull of King Midas revealed that he\u2019d had his head bound as a child to create a longer vault\u2014something considered noble or beautiful at the time.\u201d She dusted her hands on her work jacket and covered the skull again. She\u2019d been rambling on about her work.</p><p>But, to her surprise, he didn\u2019t refer to anything she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cWhat you did was really dangerous,\u201d he told her instead.</p> <p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night. You took off in the middle of the night to follow a ghost. You were barefoot, so I\u2019m assuming you were still in your pajamas. And you didn\u2019t bring your Glock.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never mentioned that she carried a Glock, which she did\u2014a Glock 23. A .40 caliber handgun with a magazine that allowed her seventeen bullets. He\u2019d assumed it either because the Glock 23 was a common weapon among law enforcement personnel\u2014or he hadn\u2019t assumed it at all; he\u2019d seen it beneath her jacket. But he\u2019d homed right in on what she\u2019d done the night before.</p><p>\u201cSloan, there are a number of people in that building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they were sound asleep. If they weren\u2019t, they should have been. The cast seems to be a decent group of people\u2014but someone in there probably dug up that skull somewhere...and used a mummified dead man to point the way to a recent murder victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave my room again without my weapon,\u201d she promised him.</p><p>He turned and left the room. She quickly threw on her coat and hurried into the kitchen to wash her hands.</p><p>As he drove, he was thoughtful. \u201cSo, you were in the shower, and you noticed blood going down the drain.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI thought I\u2019d stepped on something and cut myself and hadn\u2019t realized it. But the blood wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cI suspect traces of it could be found. And the housekeeper is afraid of my room. I told her not to worry about it, just to bring me clean towels now and then. So, I must have tracked it into bed and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019ll be on the sheets,\u201d Sloan finished.</p><p>They neared town and he braked, sliding to the side of the road, surprising her. She looked into the yard where they\u2019d stopped. A handsome young man in his late teens was helping an older woman into a house with groceries.</p><p>\u201cI need just a minute.\u201d Sloan was frowning slightly as he surveyed the teen and the slim, gray-haired older woman.</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jane got out and stood by the car. The older woman had gone into the house; the young man had a bag in his arms.</p><p>\u201cJimmy,\u201d Sloan called.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sheriff,\u201d the teen said, waiting. He smiled at Jane and nodded politely.</p><p>\u201cGiving a hand here, I see,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>The teen blushed. \u201cI, uh, came over here to apologize. I did hit Miss Larson\u2019s car the other night. I figured the least I could do was a bit of hauling around for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father know you\u2019re here?\u201d Sloan asked him.</p><p>Jimmy looked uncomfortable. \u201cThis was just something I felt I should do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>The older woman came back out. She waved to Sloan. \u201cHello, Sheriff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Connie. You take care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, thank you! Young Jimmy here helped me get in a week\u2019s worth of groceries. Tomorrow, a lot of mayhem will be coming down on us, what with Silverfest on our doorstep,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cNow, I won\u2019t have to venture out into the crowds. I can see the parades and such from my rooftop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, Connie. Enjoy,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>Jane lifted a hand and waved to her. She waved in return.</p><p>\u201cJimmy Hough,\u201d Sloan explained, getting back in the car. \u201cKid smacked the older woman\u2019s car with his dad\u2019s Maserati the other day. He\u2019s actually a decent kid\u2014well, he\u2019d been drinking and I\u2019m not sure what else, but he leaped out of the car to run around and check on Connie Larson. I had him taken in for the night, and his father, Caleb, had a fit. He was in the office to threaten me. I would\u2019ve thought he\u2019d want Jimmy to learn a lesson\u2014before he killed himself or someone else. I went easier than I could have on Jimmy, not because of his father, but because of him. Like I said, he\u2019s a decent kid and I honestly think he learned that you can\u2019t drive when you\u2019re impaired. I was really glad to see that, of his own volition, he came over to Connie\u2019s place to see if he could help her.\u201d</p><p>Jane grinned. \u201cSo, the father is a blowhard jerk. And the kid seems to be turning out okay, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He still seemed worried.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cBelieve it or not, I doubt his father would be pleased. Caleb Hough has a big beefalo ranch about a mile or so past my property. He\u2019s one of those people who feels entitled. He\u2019d think his kid was a pansy\u2014a word I\u2019ve heard him use\u2014for helping the woman just because he nicked what Caleb would call her \u2018shit\u2019 car.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a minute; she could tell he liked the kid\u2014if not the father.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like he\u2019s about to graduate. He\u2019ll grow up and make his own decisions about the kind of man he wants to be.\u201d</p><p>Sloan nodded. A moment later, they pulled into town.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to say to get into the dressing room?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t figured it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! This is your town, these are your friends. I waited for you because the plan was that you\u2019d figure out how we\u2019d get down there. I can\u2019t say a ghost led me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I was pretty sure the plan was to get me involved because you couldn\u2019t get it open last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith time, I could\u2019ve managed. You\u2019re missing the point\u2014on purpose, I suspect.\u201d She glared at him. \u201cSo do you have a plan?\u201d</p><p>His grin deepened. She felt a sizzle of fire; he really could assault the senses with that smile of his.</p><p>\u201cI kind of have a plan,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get some lunch and come up with a plan. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t serve lunch at the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can make sandwiches, can\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, while we\u2019re having our sandwiches, we\u2019ll come up with a plan. It\u2019ll be easier to do that if we\u2019re in there, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just say you want to check out the dressing rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think someone will ask why? Of course, I could tell them all that you seem to be friends with the ghost of my great-great grandmother,\u201d Sloan suggested, ignoring Jane\u2019s groan.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have lunch\u2014and come up with a plan.\u201d</p><p>Sloan grinned. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what I said?\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>Jane exited quickly as Sloan parked the car. If she didn\u2019t move fast enough, he\u2019d be around to open her car door. It was nice, but not necessary every time.</p><p>They entered the theater and she blinked a minute, letting her eyes adjust after the bright sunlight.</p><p>Alice Horton, dark hair swept back in a ponytail, in sweats, as unvamplike as could be, was digging in the refrigerator. She looked up and greeted them with \u201cHey, Jane. Sheriff. Any news on the murder?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re investigating,\u201d Sloan said. He walked through to the bar. \u201cBut a man has to eat.\u201d</p><p>As he came up next to Alice, Jane noted that she wasn\u2019t the only woman who seemed to flush when he was around. Alice was enough of an actress to behave casually, but Jane got a glimpse of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSalami?\u201d Alice asked him. \u201cOh, Jane, how about you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSalami. Do you have cheese, tomatoes, maybe lettuce and mayo?\u201d Sloan was saying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll eat anything,\u201d Jane assured Alice.</p><p>Alice plopped paper plates and the various makings on the bar.</p><p>\u201cWe can do an assembly line if you want,\u201d Jane offered. \u201cMake lunch for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Alice said. \u201cI\u2019ll throw some bottles of water up here and we\u2019ll make a few extra sandwiches. I know Valerie is coming down, maybe someone else.\u201d She seemed pleased that Jane took a seat at the bar while she stood behind it with Sloan. They got a system going\u2014Jane put out the bread and spread the mayo, Sloan added the meat and cheese, and Alice finished up with lettuce and tomato slices and cut the sandwiches in half.</p> <p>\u201cIs anything going on this afternoon?\u201d Sloan asked. \u201cRehearsal for the shows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRehearsal? Today?\u201d Alice said, shaking her head and rolling her eyes. \u201cOh, yeah. But not for the show. We\u2019re going to take our act out on the street for a trial run with the locals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour act?\u201d Jane echoed.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s the yearly arrival of the lemmings,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, I mean that appreciatively. We get huge crowds. By the weekend, Silverfest will be crazy. There\u2019ll be \u2018settlers\u2019 selling all kinds of things\u2014some antiques, some reproductions, you know, Old West clothing, weapons, belts, buckles, dresses, plus corn cakes, barbecue and beans. Oh, yes, and silver jewelry, of course. Turquoise. A lot of Native American art. We all play a part out there, taking on the roles of old settlers.\u201d She paused to grin mischievously. \u201cSloan gets in on it. He plays Trey Hardy sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always had a soft spot for Hardy,\u201d Sloan admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that deal?\u201d Jane asked. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about him from Heidi. He was sort of a Robin Hood character, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHardy had been a lieutenant in the Confederate cavalry,\u201d Alice explained. \u201cHe held up trains and stagecoaches, but he\u2019d give to whoever needed it\u2014whites, newly freed slaves, Native Americans. He was finally caught by our local sheriff, Brendan Fogerty, who seemed to like him, too. It was just that he had to bring him in. We had a traveling circuit judge back then, and\u2014do you know this part of the story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of it. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I think Fogerty thought he might face his charges and get off\u2014since no one would act as a witness against him. But the deputy at the time, Aaron Munson, had a thing about Hardy. When he was on duty alone, he shot Hardy in his cell. Pumped him full of bullets while he was in there like a caged rat. Well, someone saw him and Munson wound up being dragged out onto Main Street and lynched by the crowd. It was sad all the way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember hearing that,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cHardy haunts the jail, Munson haunts Main Street,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t go to the Old Jail alone, and I don\u2019t hang around the street at night, either,\u201d Alice said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cWas he killed before or after the stagecoach disappeared?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout a month before. It must have been a strange time for Lily,\u201d Alice said. \u201cFirst, Hardy\u2019s shot down, then Munson is lynched\u2014and four weeks later, Sage McCormick up and disappears, along with Red Marston.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey disappeared on the same night, didn\u2019t they?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. According to local legend,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>Alice smiled at him affectionately. \u201cPoor Sloan! His great-great grandmother was the scarlet woman of the age! But, boy, according to everything I\u2019ve read, she was a brilliant actress. She could go from comedy to drama in the blink of an eye. They said her performances could make the toughest cowboy weep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think she did run off with Marston,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Alice looked at Sloan and then Jane. \u201cDid you finish with the skull? Do you think it belonged to Sage McCormick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible. I haven\u2019t finished, but I have done a two-dimensional sketch. Seems like it just might have been Sage.\u201d She glanced reproachfully at Sloan. Apparently most people in town knew about his ancestry\u2014something he might have shared with her from the get-go.</p><p>Alice shivered. \u201cSo, maybe she has been haunting the theater. But if she was murdered, who killed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho killed who?\u201d Valerie Mystro asked. They all turned around as they heard her voice; she was coming down the stairs.</p><p>Alice said, \u201cThe skull you found might have been Sage McCormick\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Valerie shivered. \u201cThat was soooo creepy!\u201d she said, taking a seat at the bar. \u201cI mean\u2014soooo creepy! But I guess she might\u2019ve been buried around here somewhere. Under the floorboards. Oh, but...she disappeared after a performance. I wonder how and where she was killed, and where the body was hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago!\u201d came a booming voice from the theater. It was Henri Coque, heading toward them from behind the curtains, a notepad in his hand. He looked at Sloan. \u201cWe have a man who\u2019s just been murdered in town. That\u2019s what matters. How\u2019s it going, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenri, we\u2019re doing our best,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cWith all these people coming to town, it\u2019s a problem, Sloan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working a few different angles, Henri. And the county detectives are on it, too. So, hopefully, we\u2019ll find the truth and the killer soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in time.\u201d Henri was somber. \u201cAll the people flooding in tomorrow... I called the guy at the county, your Detective Newsome. He told me we can reopen the trail rides and the haunted hayride. That\u2019ll be something for the crowd at night\u2014going out where a murder was just committed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could go under the circumstances,\u201d Alice said. \u201cI mean, old mysteries and murders and shoot-outs are fun. New murders are scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, there\u2019ll be crowds who will want to go,\u201d Henri said, almost wearily. \u201cSloan, why are you hanging around here when there\u2019s a murder to be solved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEating lunch on your tab, Mr. Mayor,\u201d Sloan told him.</p><p>Henri grinned. \u201cAll right, fine. Eat your lunch. By the way, are you going to dress up as Hardy for us this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenri, you just said I have a murder to solve,\u201d Sloan began.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you can solve it in costume, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho dresses up as Sage McCormick?\u201d Jane asked, trying to take a bit of the heat off Sloan.</p><p>Henri turned and looked her up and down. \u201cHmm. We don\u2019t usually have a Sage because I can\u2019t get either of these two chickenhearts to play her. But, Agent Everett, you would do us a tremendous honor if you\u2019d take on the role. After all, you\u2019re a federal agent and not a clucking little bird like my divas here,\u201d he said, glancing from Alice to Valerie.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sage haunts this theater. I\u2019m not getting her mad at me!\u201d Valerie said.</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d Alice agreed.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Seriously, you wouldn\u2019t have to stop your work. You could be in costume when you\u2019re here on Main Street. Or you could dress up all day, and then, whenever you\u2019re on Main Street, we\u2019d have a Sage McCormick,\u201d Henri said.</p><p>\u201cWhat a great idea.\u201d Sloan smiled pleasantly as he leaned on the bar.</p><p>So much for saving his ass, she decided.</p><p>\u201cWow. That would be cool, Jane,\u201d Alice said.</p><p>\u201cReally. You could be mysterious\u2014around sometimes and not around other times,\u201d Valerie chimed in.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a costume,\u201d Jane protested.</p><p>Henri lifted his hands. \u201cCome on! We\u2019re a theater troupe. We have tons of costumes. We even have costumes that were actually worn by Sage McCormick. Of course,\u201d he added. \u201cThose are really museum pieces now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie, you and Jane are about the same size,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d Valerie said. \u201cI have several costumes\u2014not just for the show we\u2019re doing now, but other shows, too. A number of them are late Victorian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take your things....\u201d Jane demurred.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t mine. They belong to the theater,\u201d Valerie said. \u201cCome on. If you have a minute, I\u2019ll take you to the dressing rooms.\u201d</p><p>Jane started and looked at Sloan. She realized that, as he\u2019d hoped, a plan had arisen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come down with you, see what\u2019s there. We\u2019ll need our costumes for tomorrow, so we might as well take care of this now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll both do it!\u201d Henri clapped his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s delightful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, then. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Valerie said.</p><p>Alice stuffed the last of her sandwich in her mouth and washed it down with water. \u201cHold on. I\u2019m coming, too.\u201d</p><p>They left the bar and entered the theater, walking down the aisle and over to the wings and then the area behind the stage, where the dressing rooms were situated against the back wall.</p><p>As they paused at Valerie\u2019s door, Sloan looked at her.</p><p>She recognized his silent question. This one?</p><p>She shook her head, indicating with a movement of her chin that she\u2019d been in the room next door.</p><p>But they went inside Valerie\u2019s, and she rummaged through the racks of period clothing. Jane waited for Sloan to take the lead.</p><p>He did. \u201cI was just thinking.... Alice, you\u2019re a little taller than Valerie. I guess it doesn\u2019t have to be exact, but Jane is taller than both of you. Maybe something you have in your dressing room would fit better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d Alice said, \u201cand if not, we have more in the basement. In storage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept I\u2019m not going down there,\u201d Valerie insisted.</p><p>\u201cSomething here should work,\u201d Henri said.</p> <p>\u201cMight as well try my stuff first,\u201d Alice said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s true. We didn\u2019t take Jane\u2019s height into consideration.\u201d</p><p>They moved into the next room. As Jane went through the costumes, Alice perched on her dressing-table chair and Valerie leaned against a prop box. Henri seemed interested in her possible choice of costume.</p><p>\u201cThe blue! That\u2019s a copy of Sage\u2019s costume from The Heiress. That would be great!\u201d he said.</p><p>While Jane pulled out the costume and oohed and ahhed over it, Sloan walked to the back of the room.</p><p>\u201cHey, Henri,\u201d he called, kneeling down. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Henri joined him. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s a big brass pull on the floorboard, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a trapdoor. Where does it lead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it could only lead to the basement\u2014or to more floorboards,\u201d Alice said.</p><p>\u201cDo not open it!\u201d Valerie shrieked. \u201cNot if it leads to the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve been a cubby where the old actors and actresses stuffed their valuables,\u201d Alice suggested.</p><p>\u201cOr it might\u2019ve been for extra costume pieces, accessories, stuff like that,\u201d Jane murmured.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>Jane had never thought of herself as a weakling, so she was glad to see that, at first, it seemed to be sealed tight. But Sloan levered himself against it and pulled harder\u2014and the trapdoor opened.</p><p>It didn\u2019t lead to the basement. It led to a dark compartment. Something seemed to glimmer.</p><p>Sloan pulled out a flashlight and pointed it down into the hole that was about two feet deep.</p><p>Valerie let out a scream. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to open anything that might lead to the basement!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014that\u2019s not the basement,\u201d Alice said.</p><p>\u201cThose are bones!\u201d Valerie wailed. \u201cI\u2019m getting out of here. No, no, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not going anywhere alone. Oh! Lord, what\u2019s happening in Lily?\u201d</p><p>Sloan looked at her. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Valerie. They\u2019ve been here for a very long time. You can see that the fabric\u2014the dress\u2014is nearly decayed. It looks as if a body was left here and it decayed and...it must have smelled like hell. I wonder why someone didn\u2019t find it back then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, how horrible,\u201d Valerie said.</p><p>Henri was down on his knees, horrified as he stared into the hole.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s found it recently,\u201d he said, a catch in his throat.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Alice asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause this body is lacking something it should have,\u201d Henri said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Valerie demanded.</p><p>\u201cHer head,\u201d Jane said softly.</p><p>It did seem most likely that someone\u2014playing a trick on the cast at the theater\u2014had found the space beneath the floor, taken out the skull and set it on a wig stand. Despite the fact that he knew the bones had to be as old as the mummified remains discovered in the desert, Sloan called in the county medical examiner to retrieve them.</p><p>Alice moved into Valerie\u2019s dressing room for the time being. She\u2019d switch with either Brian or Cy after Silverfest had come and gone.</p><p>Once the hoopla over the bones had ended, the afternoon was wearing on and Henri, though pensive, was also eager to get his cast out onto the street to start entertaining the locals.</p><p>At three o\u2019clock, Sloan and Jane were finally able to leave the Gilded Lily. \u201cWant to go exploring?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cSure. Where? But should I be working on the skull? I just worry that I\u2019m not accomplishing what you wanted out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I know the skull belonged to Sage. And now I\u2019m virtually certain we have the rest of her. As soon as that\u2019s confirmed, I\u2019ll plan a proper burial for her. We have our own version of Boot Hill here\u2014except ours is called Dead Horse Hill. I would like to see that she\u2019s buried and I think that\u2019s an appropriate place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll still finish,\u201d Jane told him. \u201cWhat are we exploring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old silver mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the entrances were all sealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I. But I went by the mine entrance off the trail today and it has a few loose boulders. I hadn\u2019t brought a flashlight or anything with me, and I didn\u2019t want to go into an old mine shaft with no one knowing what I was up to. Of course, I had my phone, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re both in the mine, who will know where we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohnny Bearclaw,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cI trust him with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t trust your own officers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. But I\u2019m not sure anymore that I want everyone finding out what I suspect until I\u2019ve had a chance to prove it.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m game.\u201d She turned to him; he didn\u2019t dare do more than glance at her. The gold of her eyes could be too hypnotic. \u201cAnd I\u2019m armed, I\u2019m fully dressed and I\u2019m wearing shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said before, that was rather a foolish thing you did last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t followed the ghost when she beckoned, we might not know what she\u2019s wanted us to know all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was stupid,\u201d he said decisively. He was being argumentative, but he still had the feeling that something had changed, that a dark cloud remained above them.</p><p>\u201cLike going into a long-closed mine shaft?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go in. In fact, maybe you should stay outside and wait for me.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d reached his house by then. He\u2019d already called Johnny so the horses were ready. He noticed that Johnny had one of Mike Addison\u2019s mares in the paddock and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s Lucy doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case I have to come bail you out,\u201d Johnny told him.</p><p>\u201cHopefully, you\u2019re not going to have to bail me out,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>Johnny offered him a shrug and a wry grimace. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to lose Agent Everett out there. You, you\u2019re going to do what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know where Ms. Everett is,\u201d Sloan agreed. \u201cWhat did you tell Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just that you were taking Kanga and Roo and I might want to ride later,\u201d Johnny explained.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I do,\u201d Johnny said. He smiled, but there was a seriousness in his expression. Sloan wondered about the other night when the cat had hissed as if something was near. He hadn\u2019t seen anything on the property, but they did have coyotes in the area. And yet he wondered if someone had been through his place. He\u2019d consider it paranoia\u2014except that a man had been murdered.</p><p>He led the way, with Jane behind him, breaking into a canter over the clearer ground and slowing Roo when they reached the rockier area of foothills and outcrops. She followed him wordlessly until they got to the old mine entrance.</p><p>He dismounted and she did the same. She walked over, waiting while he moved the loose boulder he\u2019d found earlier. She played the flashlight he\u2019d given her over the black gaping hole he created.</p><p>\u201cSee anything?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cA hole,\u201d she said.</p><p>He crawled through, not wanting to dislodge more than the one boulder. If someone was doing something in the old tunnel or shaft and wasn\u2019t there now, he didn\u2019t want that person knowing the entry had been discovered.</p><p>When he was inside, he turned to help Jane, but she was agile and had already come through. They both trained their lights on the old shaft. He checked the sides, where rock was crumbled from the explosion. Shifting his light, he saw that the center of the shaft was clear. Had it been like that when it caved in\u2014or had someone been clearing it?</p><p>Jane was behind him as he carefully moved forward. They went about fifteen feet before they had to crawl through another pile of rubble. Past that, they found a second clear stretch. A few feet later, they came across a large room. There, part of the floor had been dug up; pointing his light down, Sloan saw something dazzling. He crouched down and searched for the source.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cDust,\u201d he said. \u201cGold dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was this mine closed down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears ago. The 1920s, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas the gold been here that long?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Look for signs that someone\u2019s been in here. I can\u2019t find prints, because the stone is so uneven....\u201d</p><p>She walked around the perimeter. \u201cI think I\u2019ve found what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, and shone his light toward her.</p><p>It was a plastic water bottle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they made these in the 1920s,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded. He wasn\u2019t sure what anyone was doing here\u2014other than maybe conducting some kind of illegal trade. He doubted the person or persons in question had found the cache of gold\u2014although he had no idea why there was gold dust scattered near the entrance.</p><p>He pulled a small listening device out of his pocket and looked around for a rock with a little crevice.</p><p>\u201cHow long will that last?\u201d Jane asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s motion-activated and the battery will last twelve to twenty-four hours when it\u2019s active,\u201d he told her. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get out before the wrong person comes along and realizes that we\u2019re in here.\u201d</p><p>They crawled back out. When they were once again standing in the late-afternoon sun again, he looked at Jane and laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rude,\u201d she chastised. \u201cEspecially from a man who looks like he\u2019s been mud-wrestling with pygmies.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sobered only slightly. Jane was covered in dust; even her eyelashes were a smoky taupe shade. Her auburn hair was almost gray.</p><p>\u201cCome on. You really should see yourself,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYep. And you really should see yourself!\u201d</p> <p>They both mounted up. \u201cLet\u2019s hope we don\u2019t meet up with anyone!\u201d Jane muttered.</p><p>\u201cThe trail rides don\u2019t start until tomorrow, so we should be okay,\u201d he said.</p><p>Johnny was waiting for them when they returned. He looked them both up and down.</p><p>\u201cNice. May I suggest showers? And you might want to hurry. Chet\u2019s coming by with some reports from Detective Newsome at county.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d he asked Jane.</p> <p>\u201cYes, thanks, although my clothes will still be covered with this stuff. Remind me next time we\u2019re going to crawl through tunnels not to wear a cotton suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a washer and dryer,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. Chet won\u2019t stay, I\u2019m sure, but I do have to get you back to town.\u201d</p><p>They left Johnny whistling as he tended to the horses. \u201cStrange,\u201d he told Jane. \u201cThe other night, I was convinced someone was on my property. I didn\u2019t find anything\u2014but my place is the most direct route when you\u2019re riding through to the trail. There\u2019s that little gap between those rocky hills once you\u2019re off the property line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think whoever murdered Jay Berman went through your property?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe question is still why? Is someone selling illegal drugs? Smuggling illegal aliens? Trying to reopen the silver mine? Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe the gold from the heist was hidden in the mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d thought of that\u2014except the mine wasn\u2019t closed down until almost forty years later. So I can\u2019t figure out what anyone\u2019s doing in there. For one thing, it\u2019s dangerous. The integrity of the caverns must have been destroyed when the entry was dynamited.\u201d</p><p>Inside the house he directed her to the master suite. \u201cEverything you need should be in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cNot to worry, Agent Everett. That suite was my grandfather\u2019s, I never moved over from the other side of the house. Check in the closet. You\u2019ll find soap, shampoo, towels, robes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrepared for guests, are you?\u201d she asked tartly.</p><p>He grinned at that. \u201cNot the way you seem to be thinking,\u201d he said, catching the fire in her gold eyes. \u201cWe cleaned out his rooms when he died. Johnny would make someone a terrific mother, though. He thinks the house should always be well supplied. He lives in the eternal belief that I will one day continue the family line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll be sure to thank Johnny.\u201d</p><p>She walked down the hallway to the master suite; when the door was closed, Sloan saw Longman seated by the fire.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let that one go,\u201d Longman said.</p><p>\u201cHow can I hold on to something I don\u2019t have?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>Longman looked at him. \u201cWhen did you stop going after what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a federal agent,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWorks out of Washington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can be a sheriff anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you intend to stay here forever, then?\u201d Longman asked him. \u201cHome isn\u2019t a place. Home is with the people who make your life.\u201d</p><p>Sloan shook his head and walked to the other side of the house, where there were two bedrooms. Cougar was curled up on his bed. He didn\u2019t bother to lift his head when Sloan came in. Apparently, it was one of the sixteen hours of the day the cat considered nap time.</p><p>Sloan stripped off his sand-encrusted clothing and stepped into the shower, scrubbing the grit from his hair and skin and simply indulging in the strong spray of water. Then he remembered that Chet was coming by and he emerged, dried and got dressed. The door to the master suite was still closed; he imagined that his federal agent was enjoying the heat and steam, just as he had....</p><p>He\u2019d barely returned to the living room when he heard Chet\u2019s car drive in. He opened the door as his young deputy entered the house, carrying a file. \u201cSo you found the whole body, huh?\u201d Chet asked, and Sloan realized that as far as Chet knew, he\u2019d spent most of the afternoon at the theater while the medical examiner removed the bones of Sage McCormick.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re assuming.\u201d Of course, there was no proof yet, but the skeleton almost had to be hers....</p><p>\u201cI think you can feel pretty sure,\u201d Chet said cheerfully. \u201cDNA testing will prove who she was\u2014that she\u2019s Sage McCormick, your ancestor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Chet. Anyone go through this?\u201d Sloan asked, taking the file.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. So far, they haven\u2019t found the rental car. The bullet was pretty degraded because it went through the hard part of the skull, but it was .45 caliber. It\u2019s a nightmare for the crime-scene guys, since dozens of people go through that tepee every day, so sorting anything out is going to be tough for them. They have some hair and some fibers, but...those could belong to the guides or to a bunch of tourists. No luck tracing anyone who knew anything about the man coming here. He hopes you\u2019re having better luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Chet. I\u2019m going through the books the man bought. Hopefully, that will give us some clue.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have said exactly why he wasn\u2019t telling his own deputy that he\u2019d been crawling around the mine. He trusted Chet and Betty and his entire department. But just for now, he wanted to investigate on his own. Or with Jane.</p><p>Maybe I shouldn\u2019t even be investigating, he told himself.</p><p>Chet never knew that Jane was in the house; he was gone before she came out at last in one of his grandfather\u2019s beautiful old Native American robes. It was too big for her but she\u2019d tied it around her waist and she seemed comfortable, walking out in bare feet with her hair slick and clean and clinging to her face and neck. She carried her clothing, neatly folded. \u201cTell me where your laundry is, and I\u2019ll manage to get the dust out of these before we head back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right off the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She seemed at ease, but he realized he wasn\u2019t. The thought that wouldn\u2019t leave his mind was that she was naked beneath the robe.</p><p>He went into the kitchen and rummaged in the refrigerator. Johnny had left him a meat loaf. There was a bowl of fruit to go with it, and a note about how long to nuke the food. He took it out and put it in the microwave.</p><p>Jane reappeared, smiling wryly as she watched him. \u201cDo you like cooking?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind it. Problem is, my hours are usually long. Johnny\u2019s a decent cook, as well as the best property manager I\u2019ve ever known. He\u2019d been with my grandfather since I was a teenager, the best friend someone could have. We respect each other, we look after each other. It\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is good,\u201d she agreed. She pointed at the folder he\u2019d set on the counter. \u201cSo Chet came by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what Detective Newsome has?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Not much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be sharing with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to, as soon as I have something to share. You hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, crawling around in abandoned mine shafts does whet the appetite,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s meat loaf, but don\u2019t be too disheartened\u2014Johnny makes a hell of a meat loaf.\u201d</p><p>They ate, and she swore it was the best meat loaf she\u2019d ever tasted. He explained that it was slightly different because of Johnny\u2019s gift with seasoning and because it was made with pork and beefalo. \u201cEmu is popular around here too,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it ever caught on the way people hoped, but we still have some big ranches around here.\u201d</p><p>When they\u2019d finished eating, he found himself staring at her. He also saw her staring at him.</p><p>Her clothes must be ready by now. They\u2019d eaten, and it had been a long day; he could take her back to town.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t offer and she didn\u2019t say she needed to go. Their silence should have grown uncomfortable. It didn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t sure which of them smiled first, but then they both were and their smiles deepened.</p><p>\u201cI guess I should ask if you\u2019re in a relationship,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPretty obvious, I think. You see me living here alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I saw the way Alice looked at you today. And then I noticed that Valerie got that touch of awe in her eyes. Of course, you came to her rescue when she discovered the skull, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ve missed those looks.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down and her lashes swept her cheeks for a moment. Then she raised her eyes again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me if I\u2019m in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that because you don\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I don\u2019t believe you\u2019d be here now, speaking to me like this, if you were,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a compliment,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s true, although I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed that many people look at you with appreciation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with appreciation, of course\u2014unless it turns obnoxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I\u2019m going to suggest you were involved not too long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while now. Since I joined the Krewe,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe was intimidated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was. And you?\u201d</p><p>It was such an easy conversation. With every word he felt her voice as if it were a caress. He thought she could arouse him to a greater hunger with words than another woman, naked and twisting and writhing before him.</p><p>\u201cIt ended when I left Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t ask her to. I was coming home to take care of someone who was dying. There are different kinds of intimacy. I guess we didn\u2019t have enough of the right kind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jane nodded, gazing down at her hands. When she looked up, her smile was slightly crooked, incredibly sensual, and her eyes were like the golden fire of a sunrise.</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose one of us should make the first move....\u201d</p><p>7</p> <p>In a thousand years, Jane would never have thought that becoming intimate with someone she\u2019d known a matter of days could be so effortless and natural.</p><p>Yes, one of them had needed to make a move, but ever since they\u2019d sat down together, they\u2019d both been making moves. And after she spoke, he stood, and she must have stood, as well, because she was suddenly in his arms.</p><p>She wondered just when she\u2019d known that she had desperately wanted that moment to come, and she wondered what made one person so desirable to another. Was it the unique, underlying scent of each human being? The way a mind worked, the sound of a voice, the way one person could reach out to someone else...?</p><p>Then all thought left her mind. She felt his fierce heat as he drew her close and as his lips touched hers. For a moment, that first kiss was almost frantic, as if they both feared they had seconds and nothing more, and every taste and sensation had to be seized.</p><p>And then it eased into something that was slow and seductive, the feel of his mouth, his tongue a harbinger of everything about him that suddenly seemed necessary for life itself.</p> <p>When they broke apart, his lips were mere inches from hers, and he whispered softly, \u201cNot that this isn\u2019t my house, and not that I have a multitude of neighbors close by, but...\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and she was almost afraid it was a stupid smile, she felt so deliciously giddy. Then he gathered her up into his arms, and that was easy and natural, too, although he paused and said softly, \u201cMay I? Agents of the law can be very finicky when a threat is perceived.\u201d</p><p>She slipped her arms around his neck. \u201cI\u2019d thought about doing the same to you. I mean, after all, I am a federal agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is a local situation,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you did invite me in,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cBecause of your artistry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s up to par.\u201d</p><p>He carried her down the hall. \u201cAgent Everett, the second I saw you, I became aware that you certainly surpassed par.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I do admit, we feds never like to appear as if we can\u2019t handle a situation, but I\u2019m not sure that if we\u2019d reversed this, I wouldn\u2019t have dropped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes things just work out the way they should,\u201d he said.</p><p>They\u2019d reached the bedroom. It was dark inside, the only light coming from the hallway and the rooms beyond. He didn\u2019t turn on a lamp, nor did he pause to close the drapes; through the window they could see the dark, moon-draped hills beyond, majestic in the purple shades of the desert.</p><p>Cloaked by the shadows that surrounded them, he eased them down onto the bed. Their mouths fused together again, as he opened the belt of the robe she wore. She was instantly aroused by his touch. He rose, removing his holster and the Colt he\u2019d chosen for his work weapon, laying them on the table by the bed. She felt his hands brush her midriff and her breasts as the hot, wet fever of their kiss deepened. She tugged at his shirt, pulling it from the waistband of his jeans. Breaking apart only momentarily, he all but ripped the shirt over his head before joining her again and the feel of his bare flesh against hers was so arousing she was almost embarrassed. Following her career or her \u201ccalling\u201d into the Krewe had been all-consuming for many of the past months. But none of her previous relationships over the years had ever had this depth. Sloan knew her, as no one she\u2019d met before had; he knew that she saw and felt and accepted a world that existed on the fringes of their own, and he was the same. These were the wonderful reasons in her mind that gave everything about this moment a heightened intensity, and then there were the simple physical reasons, which were like the staggering heat and brilliance of the desert sun.</p><p>His touch, his kiss, lips, tongue, flesh\u2014all moved against her. She stroked the breadth of his back, fingers playing his spine. She felt him trying to kick off his shoes and she laughed, playing with his buckle while he removed the shoes and socks. Then he slipped the robe from her shoulders, impatiently pushing all remnants of clothing to the floor. They were locked together in a tangle of limbs, and again, she felt erotically bathed by his caress and the heat and fire of his lips. Her breasts were warmed by that fire. So were her midriff, hips, thighs and intimate areas, and she responded with a passion and abandon she hadn\u2019t known she possessed. She twisted in his arms and rolled on top of him, returning the intimacy of his touch. They laughed and teased and whispered, and then words were gone in a flurry of hunger; she was aware of the thundering of her heart, the rush of her breath and the feel of him, moving into her at last, moving with an urgency that appeased and spurred the desperate need that rocked through her.</p><p>Each thrust took her higher, each brought another burst of sensation that wiped away the rest of the world. The climax swept through her like lightning in the desert beyond, and she felt the fierce and shuddering movement of his body as he joined her. Then he lay beside her in the shadows, and again, the sound of their breathing, the beating of their hearts, seemed like a rhythmic chorus. They lay with their bodies damp, still entwined, wordless for several minutes. The silence between them in the aftermath was comfortable. For her, making love had never before seemed so miraculous, and maybe it had been new and unique because the intimacy she\u2019d felt with him was deeper than she\u2019d felt with a man before. He knew and understood what she was, what made her different from others, and it didn\u2019t stop him from wanting her.</p> <p>He rose up on an elbow, smiling down at her, and teased, \u201cYou are an artist, Agent Everett\u2014a true artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, thanks, Sheriff. You\u2019re not bad yourself, you know.\u201d</p><p>She touched his cheek in the darkness, marveling at the shape of his face. He could have been a poster boy for the perfect Western hero, the lawman who was tall and strong and relaxed in his own masculinity.</p><p>She almost drew away in that moment, reminding herself that she wasn\u2019t here forever. It was one thing to accept the stunning attraction between them and another to feel it shattering her insides; after all, they led separate lives.</p><p>He laughed at her remark. \u201cI try, ma\u2019am, I try.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close. She wasn\u2019t sure why until he murmured, \u201cAre you going to stay?\u201d</p><p>She turned into him, her fingers on his chest. \u201cI\u2019d love to stay. I just think it would be a mistake.\u201d She saw the confusion in his frown and added quickly, \u201cWhat I mean is that I think it would be a mistake for me not to be at the theater. There\u2019s...there\u2019s so much going on there.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, smoothing back a section of her hair. \u201cWe\u2019ve found Sage,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she found someone she could reach. I wonder if she just wanted it known that she was still here, in Lily, that she didn\u2019t run out on her husband and child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. And I\u2019m surprised you were afraid to find out it was her. Isn\u2019t it better knowing that she was taken from her family, that she hadn\u2019t left them on purpose?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that. \u201cI suppose I can look at it that way. I never wanted to believe she\u2019d been murdered. It was easier to tell myself that she was a free spirit who couldn\u2019t stay. But I am glad she\u2019s been found, that we can give her a service and bury her properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen her?\u201d Jane asked him curiously. \u201cWith your abilities, I would\u2019ve thought that maybe she\u2019d come to you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s never come to me. Even though she\u2019s an ancestor of mine and a bona fide legend around here... She did, however, come to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s the reason\u2014the family connection. Could be that you\u2019re just too close to her. Perhaps the love we have for family extends through the generations and she\u2019s been afraid of hurting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone obviously found her before she led me to the bones,\u201d Jane said. \u201cWhoever it was put her skull on display.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd was it a prank\u2014or a warning? And does it have anything to do with the murder victims out in the desert today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jane began.</p><p>He placed a finger on her lips. \u201cThat was, for the moment, a rhetorical question. If I\u2019m going to bring you back to the theater tonight...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Jane said, and started to rise.</p><p>He pulled her back down. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to bring you back tonight,\u201d he said, straddling her, \u201cwe haven\u2019t got much time.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and they made love again. It wasn\u2019t until they were in the car and on their way back to town that they returned their attention to the questions at hand.</p><p>\u201cMaybe all these things are separate situations.\u201d Jane turned to Sloan as he drove. \u201cSage appeared to me because she wanted the truth known. She wanted her body found. Someone\u2014maybe a cast member who wanted to torment Henri Coque\u2014uncovered the stash of bones in the floor and put the head on the wig stand. Completely unrelated, there\u2019s something going on in the desert. Jay Berman didn\u2019t come out here just to enjoy the sights. He had a purpose that was illegal, and whoever his partners were, he double-crossed them. And perhaps his death was meant as a lesson to others\u2014thus the \u2018execution,\u2019 and the old corpse dug up to point the way. Do you know who that corpse might be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows? Maybe Red Marston. He disappeared when Sage did. Maybe one of the stagecoach guards or the driver. I haven\u2019t heard about any graves being disturbed, so it\u2019s most likely someone who\u2019d been buried out in the desert. Especially when you think about the mummified state of the remains. Sand will do that.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThe point is, someone\u2019s been in the old mine shaft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m wrong. Maybe Sage made such a strong appearance to me because we\u2019re supposed to know something we don\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced over at her. \u201cYou still going to dress up as Sage tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. You\u2019re going to dress up as Trey Hardy, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMe dressing up as Trey Hardy isn\u2019t all that difficult. I wear a plumed hat and an old Confederate cavalry jacket. You, however, will have to walk around in a Victorian dress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can handle it for a day,\u201d she said. \u201cBut seriously, should I keep working with the skull\u2014sorry, your great-great grandmother\u2019s skull? With everything else\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, keep working on it. And the medical examiner\u2019s office is going to clean up the skull of the old corpse we found. It would be good to learn who he was before we bury him again. And the more I think about it, the more I believe this might have to do with someone\u2014or several someones\u2014figuring they can find the gold that disappeared in the 1870s. Hmm.\u201d He slowed the car as they came onto Main Street. \u201cTown\u2019s already hopping.\u201d</p><p>And it was. People were crowding the street. The saloon was overflowing, and although it was almost eleven, people were coming in and out of Desert Diamonds, many wearing old-fashioned garb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the station tomorrow,\u201d Jane told him. \u201cDon\u2019t get out!\u201d she said, suspecting that he meant to stop the car and open her door. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and watched her go.</p> <p>Jane hurried through the busy downstairs of the theater and up to her room. She stepped inside, closing and locking the door behind her. \u201cHey,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI hope you\u2019re feeling better. We do know the truth, and we\u2019ll bury you properly,\u201d she promised. \u201cOh, and by the way, I take back anything bad I said about your great-great grandson. In fact, I think I\u2019m a little too fond of the man!\u201d</p><p>Sage didn\u2019t respond. But later that night, when Jane started feeling chilly in the air-conditioning, she was suddenly warm.</p><p>Sage might have been Bohemian in her lifestyle; she might have been a great actress, stealing many hearts.</p><p>But Jane had the feeling that she\u2019d been a very tender mother, as well.</p><p>It was barely six in the morning when Sloan\u2019s cell phone rang.</p><p>He woke immediately and reached for it, afraid something else might have happened at the theater.</p> <p>Grabbing the phone he noted the caller ID. Liam Newsome.</p><p>\u201cWe found the rental car, Sheriff. Want to meet out on the highway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>Newsome gave him the coordinates, and Sloan told him he could be there in twenty minutes.</p><p>He got ready quickly, but before heading out, he went to his at-home office. He turned on the receiver, hoping he might have caught sounds from the cave shaft where he\u2019d left the bug yesterday. He listened, but nothing registered.</p><p>Someone was doing something in the old mine. What? If he knew that, he was certain he could solve the murder.</p><p>He checked in with Johnny, asking him to monitor the audio and get in touch right away if he heard anything.</p><p>When he arrived at the site of the car, he wasn\u2019t surprised it had taken so long to find. It was almost off the highway, strategically placed behind and to the side of a hillock of grassy shrub and brush, now covered by desert sand and blended into the landscape.</p> <p>A tow truck from the county stood ready to retrieve it and bring it in for forensics, but Newsome had halted the recovery until Sloan could reach the scene.</p><p>\u201cThought you\u2019d want to see where it was,\u201d Newsome said.</p><p>Sloan nodded. \u201cThanks. I doubt Jay Berman parked it here,\u201d he said drily, \u201cwhich leads me to believe that two people were probably involved in his murder. Someone had to drive the car here, and since we\u2019re miles from anywhere, whoever drove it must have had someone come by to pick him\u2014or her\u2014up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking,\u201d Newsome agreed. \u201cWhat still gets me is that there has to be a reason. You only see this kind of thing when gangs, mobs...drugs are involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless it was made to look like a mob hit. In a real hit, the body would usually be found in a scrap yard or such\u2014not in the desert with another dead man pointing the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You have anything else? He did come out of Lily,\u201d Newsome said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working a few angles,\u201d Sloan told him. \u201cCombing the area where the body was found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrime-scene tape is still up.\u201d</p><p>Sloan nodded. \u201cAnything inside the car?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Newsome walked him over to it; the doors and the trunk were open. The trunk was empty. So was the car. The glove compartment stood open and Sloan asked Newsome what they\u2019d found in it.</p><p>\u201cMaps. Maps of the county\u2014and maps of Lily. One was especially interesting. Copy of a map done by a surveyor back in the early 1870s. I\u2019ll get it scanned and over to your office as soon as I\u2019m back in mine,\u201d Newsome said. \u201cYour fed artist is still here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have the skull of the dug-up corpse ready by this afternoon. Someone will bring it over. I guess you\u2019ve got a lot on your plate, what with Silverfest, but the medical examiner said he\u2019d be done by then, so we might as well send it over.\u201d</p><p>Sloan wondered if it was wrong to be glad that they had another old corpse to identify, since it would keep Jane in Lily for a few more days....</p><p>He drove back to town.</p><p>Main Street was alive with activity. He arrived just in time to see the annual lynching of Aaron Munson. For the past few years, Mike Addison from the Old Jail had taken on the role of Sheriff Fogerty, while Brian Highsmith portrayed the ill-fated Munson. Henri Coque orchestrated the reenactment, and volunteers were drawn from the crowd to play small roles, along with the rest of the theater troupe.</p><p>Sloan decided to take a few minutes to watch the spectacle before heading into his office for the day. Betty was handling the desk alone. Chet was in town; one officer was always on Main Street during Silverfest, assuring tourists that law enforcement was concerned about their safety.</p><p>Parking, he saw Chet standing on the wooden sidewalk in front of the saloon.</p><p>Cy Tyburn held Mike back in his role as Fogerty as he tried to prevent the mob from taking his deputy\u2014even if his deputy had just shot their prisoner in cold blood.</p><p>Valerie Mystro and Alice Horton were out to spur the crowd into action, Valerie screaming that Munson had killed their hero, Hardy. Bartenders and waitresses from the theater were all in on the action, encouraging the crowd to join them as part of the lynch mob.</p><p>\u201cOur hero! This man\u2014this deputy!\u2014shot down our hero! No trial, no conviction. He shot him down when he was defenseless, cornered, caged! Lynch him!\u201d Valerie cried.</p><p>\u201cTake him, take him! Show him that we won\u2019t allow even a deputy to take the law into his own hands!\u201d Alice Horton shouted.</p><p>\u201cGet rope! Get a horse, get this man dead!\u201d Henri Coque demanded.</p><p>Sloan recognized two of the night bartenders as they came down the street from the stables with a horse and a rope. Brian, loudly protesting that he\u2019d killed a heinous, low-down bank robber who just wasn\u2019t going to get away with robbing the county blind, was dragged up onto the horse; the noose was slipped around his neck. The rope was then tied to the rafters of the overhang by the Old Jail. Someone slapped the horse\u2019s rump and \u201cMunson\u201d swung from the rafters.</p><p>Henri Coque crawled up on a podium set to the far side of the road for the reenactment. \u201cAnd so it was that Deputy Aaron Munson paid the price for his eagerness to kill Trey Hardy in Lily, Arizona. Was Hardy guilty? Beyond a doubt. But he was loved because at a time when the country was healing, when the West was still wild, he was a man of the people. Take care today, friends. The ghosts of Trey Hardy, murdered in his cell, and Aaron Munson, lynched by the crowd, still wander these streets! Just as the ghost of our beautiful diva, Sage McCormick, roams the stage of the theater and haunts her old room\u2014appearing at her window to watch the streets of the town she came to love.\u201d</p><p>There was a roar of applause, especially as \u201cMunson\u201d\u2014hanging from the rafter but with a safety harness around him\u2014lifted his head. \u201cAnd come back and see us here in Lily!\u201d he called out. \u201cThe Old Jail fills up for Silverfest, so get your reservations in early!\u201d</p><p>Sloan applauded with the rest of the crowd. He looked up at the theater, drawn to the window Henri had indicated.</p><p>His heart seemed to quicken. There was someone at the window. A woman, gazing down.</p><p>He glanced around to see if he was imagining things, but he saw a little girl in the crowd tugging at her mother\u2019s hand and pointing. \u201cIt\u2019s Sage! Sage McCormick!\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he thought he\u2019d actually seen her at last.</p><p>But then the woman raised a hand and he realized she was looking right at him. She smiled.</p><p>And he smiled in return.</p><p>It was Jane, and she was playing her role, just as she\u2019d been asked.</p><p>The crowd broke up after Henri announced that there\u2019d be a gunfight between Mean Bill Jenkins and Savage Sam Osterly on Main Street in an hour.</p><p>Chet walked over to him. \u201cHey, Sloan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChet. Everything going well here?\u201d</p><p>Chet nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a heck of a crowd, though. You hadn\u2019t left orders, but Betty checked in with the chief over at county. They have a few of their people here, just wandering through the crowd. Hope that sits fine with you. Not that we usually have trouble, but with this many people... The boys from the night crew suggested it. The reports are on your desk.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe had a few bar fights last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Betty was brilliant and I\u2019m ashamed I didn\u2019t take care of it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilverfest is getting bigger every year,\u201d Chet said happily.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what with a murder in town and all...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019ll go in and check the reports,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be back here for most of the day, unless something breaks.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, Jane appeared on the sidewalk. He thought she did the town\u2019s diva and his great-great grandmother proud. Her hair was swept up in a loose chignon and she was wearing a blue period dress with gold cord that seemed to bring out the brilliance of her eyes. She smiled and joined him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was stunning. But then he remembered that he knew, as of last night, that she was stunning naked, as well.</p><p>Something he shouldn\u2019t be thinking about now.</p><p>\u201cI was just about to go in and work on the skull,\u201d she told him. \u201cAre you sure you want me to finish?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like it if you did. We can get her a coffin and bury her. I think she\u2019d like your artistry\u2014for you to rebuild the lifelike appearance of her face, that is. She was reputed to be a little vain, you know.\u201d</p><p>Henri Coque walked up to them, a smile splitting his face. \u201cIt\u2019s all going wonderfully. I admit, I was worried. I\u2019m always worried when using nonactors. But the lynching went off perfectly. And have you seen all the vendors? They\u2019re set up behind the saloon and Desert Diamonds. We have more vendors this year than ever before, and with what they pay for their licenses, the town will be flourishing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Henri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you get into your Trey Hardy apparel, Sloan? Next year, we should reenact his shooting,\u201d Henri said excitedly. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done that, you know, because we can\u2019t fit spectators into the jail. But where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way! I\u2019ll work on it. Come on, Sloan, let\u2019s go get your costume.\u201d</p><p>Sloan started to excuse himself to Jane but saw that a little girl was asking to have a picture taken with her beneath the theater sign. Jane seemed puzzled at first and then realized that her costume made her a tourist attraction. She smiled and posed with the child.</p> <p>He went in with Henri and made his way down to Cy Tyburn\u2019s dressing room, where he could procure a plumed cavalry hat and Civil War butternut-trimmed cavalry jacket.</p><p>\u201cYou could let your hair grow out,\u201d Henri told him. \u201cThen you\u2019d be the spitting image of Trey Hardy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your chances of the ghost cutting his hair are better than your chances of me growing mine out,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten\u2014it\u2019s hot as hell out here.\u201d</p><p>Henri shrugged and they returned to the street.</p><p>Jane had become a celebrity. She was now with a group of Boy Scouts.</p><p>He was surprised when Henri, still standing near him, said, \u201cGood thing you\u2019re hanging around today, Sloan. I like Chet, he\u2019s a solid deputy. But he\u2019s still a kid. What with the stuff going on, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine whether I\u2019m here or not, Henri. County sent over some men. They\u2019re all in uniform, as you can see them in the crowd. Their presence will let any would-be rabblerousers know that we\u2019re watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re in town, Sloan,\u201d Henri said again. \u201cHey, the shoot-out is coming up next!\u201d</p><p>Sloan studied the activity in the street. People were pouring in and out of Desert Diamonds, the saloon, the stables\u2014and even the spa. He saw Heidi bringing out a tour group of ten; the stables charged a hefty sum for every tour they took out and he could see from the sign in front that they\u2019d sold out for the day.</p><p>Everything was going well.</p><p>Jane was now posing in front of the theater sign with Alice, Valerie, Cy and Brian. He smiled slightly. Brian Highsmith had always thought of himself as a lothario. \u201cBad boys get the chicks, you know?\u201d he\u2019d told Sloan once. He seemed to like having his arm around Jane; Sloan wasn\u2019t so sure that she was \u201cfeeling the love\u201d in return.</p><p>As he watched, his cell phone rang. He reached into his pocket for it.</p><p>It was Johnny Bearclaw.</p><p>\u201cSloan,\u201d Johnny told him, \u201cyour bug has gone off. I heard shuffling. There\u2019s movement in the mine shaft.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way out. I want you to ride with me, Johnny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the horses ready.\u201d</p><p>He hung up quickly and went over to interrupt the \u201cKodak moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, can I see you, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff!\u201d Cy protested. \u201cWe\u2019ve become a sensation! We\u2019re better than ever with Agent Everett. She can work tomorrow, can\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking Agent Everett away,\u201d Sloan assured Cy, although he didn\u2019t understand why Cy was so worried. Brian might play the \u201cbad boy,\u201d and \u201cbad boys\u201d might be popular, but Cy did all right for himself. He was tall, blond and built. He had plenty of charm, too\u2014and he knew it.</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Valerie said happily. \u201cI\u2019m always glad to have a fed with a gun around! Especially since we\u2019re missing Jennie today. Where\u2019s our stage mom? Haven\u2019t seen her yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s getting into costume,\u201d Cy said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cYeah, running late!\u201d Brian murmured. He grinned as if they were conspirators. \u201cI think Jennie\u2019s been getting it on lately. She crawled up to her room really late a few times in the past week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJennie\u2014getting it on?\u201d Valerie asked. \u201cSeriously? With whom?\u201d She giggled.</p><p>\u201cOh, for a sweet young thing, that was cruel!\u201d Alice told her.</p><p>\u201cNot cruel, just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruthful?\u201d Brian suggested.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s face it. Jennie isn\u2019t going to be the next swimsuit model of the year,\u201d Cy commented. \u201cStill, it was cruel, young woman,\u201d he said to Valerie. \u201cThere\u2019s someone out there for everyone!\u201d</p><p>Sloan shook his head, unimpressed by the actors\u2019 banter, and turned to give Jane a questioning look. She wasn\u2019t wearing her customary holster.</p><p>\u201cStrapped to my thigh,\u201d Jane said softly. But she was heard.</p><p>\u201cSexy!\u201d Brian told her.</p><p>\u201cSafe,\u201d she said, her tone harsh.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. Like I said, I need to speak with Jane for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re the sheriff. Steal our prize act for the day!\u201d Brian said with mock dismay.</p><p>He took her aside. \u201cThat was Johnny. There\u2019s someone in the mine shaft. I\u2019m heading out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Jane insisted.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an agent. Not an actress. This is fun, but I don\u2019t think you should be going in there alone. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d he broke in. \u201cI know you\u2019re a competent law enforcement officer, and that you can use a weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, about to say something he hadn\u2019t wanted to admit before. \u201cJane, I need you to be the one who knows where I am in case something happens. Jay Berman was from New York, yes. But I still believe he was killed by someone out here. Someone who\u2019s aware of the old legends\u2014someone who thinks he can find the gold, perhaps, or someone running an illicit scheme out here.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cThat means I don\u2019t know whom to trust. What if one of my staff talks to the wrong person? For the moment, anyway, the fewer people involved, the safer I\u2019ll feel. Johnny will ride with me. Just make sure you keep hearing from me every hour or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cAll right, but you know I\u2019m going to be a nervous wreck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that it\u2019s the best way for me to work this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could call in Newsome...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Sloan told her. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to cry wolf. I want to have some idea of what\u2019s really going on here. And I don\u2019t want to scare anyone away from the mine shaft, not when it might be a piece of the puzzle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I stay here in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a lot of kids happy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be closer to my property and the Apache and mine sections of the trail ride if I do need you.\u201d</p><p>Jane touched his arm and moved closer. \u201cGhosts might appear, but facial reconstructions do not complete themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get back to work soon,\u201d he said. He took a deep breath. He couldn\u2019t help disliking the fact that his great-great grandmother was a pile of bones and decayed, dried-out tissue and fabric on a slab at the county morgue, while her skull was riddled with markers and clay down at the police station.</p><p>Still, that couldn\u2019t compare with a man who\u2019d just been murdered, even if he hadn\u2019t been the most upstanding citizen.</p><p>He was also certain that they needed to establish the identity of the long-dead man who\u2019d been found at the Apache village.</p><p>Somehow it all connected. He knew it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep in touch,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d</p><p>As he left her, walking around to the rear to get his patrol car, he thought that while it had been far more grueling to be a cop on the mean streets of Houston, being here was disturbing in its own way. A different way. In Houston, it had been easier to recognize the bad guys; here, he was afraid, he was looking for someone who might well be a friend.</p><p>Driving out of town, he could see the Silverfest celebrations taking place in the cordoned-off section of Main Street.</p><p>People were in high spirits. Most were convinced that a tourist killed in the desert had nothing to do with them.</p><p>And most of them were right.</p><p>In a few minutes he was back at his place, where Johnny Bearclaw had the horses saddled. Sloan mounted Roo, while Johnny took Kanga.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll probably run into the trail group,\u201d Johnny told him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. We\u2019ll wait until the group that\u2019s out now has moved on to the Apache village. It won\u2019t look strange that we\u2019re out there,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cThere was a murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready for anything.\u201d Johnny patted his holster.</p><p>Sloan carried a .357 eight-shot Magnum. He saw that Johnny had prepared with his weapon of choice, the 629 six-shot .44 Magnum. He\u2019d had that weapon as long as Sloan could remember, but he didn\u2019t carry it often.</p><p>Leaving the property and entering the trail, they caught up with Heidi and her tour group about halfway through. He noted that Heidi wasn\u2019t alone; her older brother, Lars, just out of the military, was riding second with her. Sam, another of the tour guides, was carrying, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Heidi saw him, she went ashen, so he urged Roo through the riders, saying a friendly hello to the mounted tourists as he did.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong, Heidi. I\u2019m just keeping an active presence all over town today,\u201d he assured her quickly.</p><p>She let out a sigh of relief. \u201cThanks, Sheriff. Even though I brought my own \u2018hired gun,\u2019\u201d she said with a rueful smile.</p> <p>\u201cI see that.\u201d</p><p>Sloan waved to Lars, who waved back. Heidi was in good hands; Lars was a serious kid who had done two tours of duty in the Middle East.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019d rather not find any more dead men,\u201d Heidi said. \u201cI mean,\u201d she added in a hushed voice, \u201cI only found the old dead guy, but...that was creepy enough for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be fine today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sloan. Hi, Johnny!\u201d Heidi said.</p> <p>Johnny waved, and Sloan urged Roo back to Johnny\u2019s position beside the group. He smiled as they passed them.</p><p>\u201cGive it five minutes?\u201d Johnny asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. We\u2019ll give it five.\u201d</p><p>The tour group moved on.</p><p>They left Kanga and Roo rooting around for scrub grass and walked to the entrance. With Johnny\u2019s help, it was easy to move the loose boulder. Sloan crawled through and Johnny followed. There was nothing in the first opening; they climbed over rock to reach the second chasm and then the third.</p><p>Sloan directed his flashlight all around.</p> <p>At first, he saw nothing.</p><p>And then he saw the dark pile with the tarp over it on the earth-and-rock flooring. He walked over to it and tore away the tarp.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d he exploded.</p><p>8</p><p>Being Sage McCormick was fun.</p><p>Jane had never thought of herself as an extrovert, but she did enjoy being in this costume, and she enjoyed seeing the children so excited. Thanks to the cast of the dinner theater, she was quickly at ease answering all manner of questions, telling kids and adults alike the history of the theater and how she had disappeared one night. \u201cI was suspected of all kinds of terrible things,\u201d she told them, emoting more than she\u2019d realized she could, \u201cbut now people know\u2014I was murdered right in the theater and buried under the floorboards!\u201d</p><p>Posing for pictures and playing the part of Sage was good; it distracted her from worrying about Sloan.</p><p>It was a foolish thing to do, she reminded herself. He\u2019d signed on the line that he was willing to give his life for his work; she had done the same.</p> <p>She loved her job. She had to go where her work took her and her real home was Arlington, Virginia, where the Krewe units had their offices and where she\u2019d found the town house she loved. Okay, so she could leave a home. But she was an important part of her Krewe, and they solved cases when others couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Not that Sloan had asked her to do anything, or vice versa; they\u2019d slept together once. She didn\u2019t regret it.</p><p>No, she really wanted to do it again....</p><p>But whatever their involvement, it didn\u2019t matter; she\u2019d be worried about anyone investigating a murder. Law enforcement officers everywhere signed up for this, and it didn\u2019t stop those who cared about them from worrying about it.</p><p>\u201cHey, time for the old shoot-out,\u201d Cy said, nudging Brian.</p><p>\u201cThe shoot-out.\u201d Brian grinned at Jane. \u201cI love this part of the show!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course he loves it\u2014he gets to be fastest on the draw,\u201d Valerie said.</p><p>\u201cThe things we\u2019ll do for art!\u201d Cy said. \u201cYeah, sadly, I\u2019m Mean Bill Jenkins and Brian gets to play Savage Sam Osterly. And Osterly outdrew Jenkins.\u201d</p><p>Henri Coque was back at his podium. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, boys and girls, make way, if you please! Not long after the lynching of Aaron Munson, the streets of Lily grew even wilder! Sheriff Fogerty struggled to hold on to a deputy, but men were afraid in Lily. He did his best to protect the law, and he turned a blind eye to the men who fought in the streets. On January 17, 1873, two of the meanest, most vicious outlaws ever to come to town met on Main Street, right here, ready to duel it out. They say it was over a chorus girl from the saloon.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, Cy walked out onto the street and waved to the crowd.</p><p>For a moment, Jane was distracted. She turned to look back at the Gilded Lily.</p><p>There was definitely someone at her bedroom window.</p><p>\u201cMean Bill Jenkins fought on the Union side during the war. He was something of a hero when he was with his Indiana unit at Gettysburg, or so the history books tell us,\u201d Henri said.</p><p>Jane turned back to watch the action.</p><p>Cy raised his hat, smiled proudly and bowed to the audience\u2014among them, many admiring women.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Henri announced, \u201cwhen the war was over, he took up with a group of Kentucky Rebels and Yanks\u2014and they weren\u2019t the kind who robbed banks nicely and kept from killing people. Not like our dashing Trey Hardy!\u201d</p><p>Cy paused midsmile and frowned at Henri.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Henri said as an aside, bringing a rise of laughter from the crowd. \u201cMean Bill Jenkins was as mean as they got! Oh, yeah, mean and vicious, through and through.\u201d</p><p>The temptation to look back was strong. Jane did so. The ghost of Sage McCormick remained. She was staring at Jane. She shook her head; her ghostly hand slammed against the window.</p><p>What the hell was she trying to say?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Henri Coque repeated, \u201cmean and vicious, through and through.\u201d</p><p>Cy shrugged, and made fists of his hands.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Henri continued, \u201con this day, late in the afternoon, after both men were liquored up, Mean Bill challenged Savage Sam to a duel!\u201d</p><p>Behind Henri, Valerie raised a sign that told the audience to say \u201cOooh!\u201d</p><p>The audience complied.</p><p>\u201cNow Savage Sam...\u201d Henri paused as Brian stepped out onto the road, \u201cwas a man who kowtowed to no government!\u201d</p><p>Brian stood straight and accepted the cheers of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cNo, he was just a vicious killer.\u201d</p><p>It was Brian\u2019s turn to stare at Henri.</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s history!\u201d Henri told him.</p><p>Brian sighed and his shoulders slumped, but then he, too, straightened and twisted his lips in a sneer.</p><p>\u201cYes, friends, it was over the love of a woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe! Me!\u201d Valerie said, rushing forward.</p><p>\u201cNo, it would be over me!\u201d Alice argued, pushing her way into view.</p><p>\u201cSorry, the identity of the woman was never written down in the history books. She was just one of many bawdy-house women plying their trade in Lily,\u201d Henri said.</p><p>\u201cOh, let\u2019s see\u2014bawdy woman. That would be you!\u201d Valerie said sweetly to Alice. Alice drew back her arm as if she was going to throw a punch. Mike Addison slipped quickly between them. \u201cHey, the duel was between the men!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s have a catfight!\u201d someone yelled from the crowd.</p><p>There was a lot of laughter at that. When it calmed down, Henri said, \u201cThe men asked Sheriff Fogerty himself to call the duel. Oh, wait, that\u2019s me!\u201d He walked down from the podium and stood between the men on the street. \u201cTwenty paces, men.\u201d</p><p>The duel progressed. As it did, the amusement Jane had been feeling began to fade.</p><p>They were actors, she reminded herself. Playing with blanks.</p><p>\u201cTwenty paces!\u201d Henri called again.</p><p>Brian and Cy made faces at each other and turned to walk their paces.</p><p>\u201cAnd now...\u201d Henri said.</p><p>Both men stood still, forty feet from each other.</p><p>\u201cReady!\u201d Henri called.</p><p>They swung around.</p><p>Jane looked back at the window. Sage remained there, shaking her head.</p><p>She wanted the duel stopped. Why? Did she know something?</p><p>Jane was terrified that if the duel went through, someone was really going to die.</p><p>\u201cAim!\u201d Henri shouted.</p><p>It was quite possibly one of the stupidest things she\u2019d ever done, but she couldn\u2019t stop the abject fear that swept through her.</p><p>She burst out into the middle of the road between the men, arriving a split second before Henri could call, \u201cFire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! Wait!\u201d she shouted. She had no idea where\u2019d go from there, but she started speaking, saying whatever came to mind. \u201cPeople died back then because they weren\u2019t smart enough just to have a conversation. Now we\u2019re living in a new time, a new day\u2014and I\u2019m sure you gentlemen are smart enough to have a conversation and work it all out!\u201d</p><p>She looked back and forth between Cy and Brian; they stared at her blankly and then looked at Henri. Henri frowned at Jane, then shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHey, come on, shoot it out!\u201d someone cried from the audience.</p><p>\u201cNo! Enough violence. We\u2019ve already had a lynching,\u201d Jane said. \u201cThink how cool it would be if Congress actually talked with one another.\u201d</p><p>She was grateful that those words brought more laughter; she was swaying the crowd. \u201cNow you guys...neither of you is really mean and vicious. You just need a hug, right?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the laughter she received.</p><p>\u201cAll in favor of a peaceful discussion, raise your hands!\u201d</p><p>She was still afraid she was going to lose. She might be entertaining the crowd, but they\u2019d come to see a duel.</p><p>To her astonishment, she got help from an unexpected source. Valerie came bursting onto the scene. \u201cNo shooting, gentlemen! How will the play go on tonight if we lose one of you?\u201d</p><p>Not to be upstaged, Alice Horton, vamping it up, ran out, as well. \u201cAnd we all know that a good bad girl loves a bad boy with a story\u2014the strong but silent type, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk it out, talk it out, talk it out!\u201d</p><p>Jane was grateful when the crowd took up the chant.</p><p>\u201cGive me your weapons, boys!\u201d</p><p>They handed them over. She didn\u2019t dare take a chance on looking at them then; she had to make sure her improvised charade went on.</p><p>\u201cNow say you\u2019re sorry for flying off the handle, Mean Bill Jenkins!\u201d she told Cy.</p><p>His blue eyes touched hers with curiosity and a surprised admiration. She smiled at him, silently thanking him for playing his part. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, all right! I\u2019m sorry, Savage Sam. I think you got you a fittin\u2019 girl now, and I\u2019m going to get me one, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d Valerie said, running to throw herself into Cy\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go!\u201d Henri said. \u201cThe gunfight that wasn\u2019t. Damned good thing we\u2019re not at the O.K. Corral! Hey, everyone, take a gander at all the activities out back. Kids, you can mine sand for silver. Ladies, you can buy some great jewelry. And don\u2019t forget that while you\u2019re in town, you can catch these fine folks performing for you every night at the Gilded Lily!\u201d</p> <p>Jane stood still in the street for a moment, feeling grateful on the one hand, ridiculous on the other.</p><p>A little boy walked by saying, \u201cI thought there was going to be a gunfight!\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t happy.</p><p>But a cluster of twenty-something young people walked by and the tallest among them was talking excitedly, \u201cSee, I told you. It\u2019s great to come out here. They\u2019re not stupid, they keep changing it up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would\u2019ve figured?\u201d Henri Coque said, walking up to her. He shook his head. \u201cNever saw you as a drama queen, much less someone who\u2019d be so quick with improv.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeemed like a fun thing to try. As a law enforcement officer in the twenty-first century, of course,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd it was good!\u201d Valerie said enthusiastically, coming up beside her. \u201cJennie still hasn\u2019t shown up. She usually screams and cries and falls down in tears, saying she\u2019s Jenkins\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong if Jennie isn\u2019t here,\u201d Henri said, frowning. \u201cValerie, will you run in there and see if she\u2019s in her room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going in the Gilded Lily by myself!\u201d Valerie said. \u201cEven our staff is all out on the street now. I can\u2019t go in there alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Jane said. \u201cWhich room is Jennie\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s next to Brian and Brian is next to you,\u201d Henri explained. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind? Thank you! I hope she\u2019s okay.\u201d His voice was worried.</p> <p>Jane nodded and hurried into the Gilded Lily. It did seem strange to be in the theater when it was so silent. The main doors behind the old Western slatted doors were open; apparently, Henri wasn\u2019t worried about break-ins, but then it was true that everyone who belonged in the theater was pretty much right in front of it.</p><p>Jane ran up the stairs and realized she was still clutching the antique guns Cy and Brian had been about to use for the duel reenactment. Before going to Jennie\u2019s room, she went to her own and inspected the guns. They were replica Colt 45s, also known as Peacemakers, each with a cylinder that held six metallic cartridges. She opened the cylinders, and the cartridges fell out. The bullets from the one gun were obviously blanks.</p><p>From the other...</p><p>She had learned to shoot; she knew the action of her own gun. She also knew the most important thing about any gun\u2014when loaded and in the wrong hands, it beat brawn every time.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure about the cartridges. She left both guns, emptied, on her bed, and stashed the blanks and the questionable cartridges in tissues and then in one of her shoes.</p><p>Then she ran down the hall and knocked on Jennie\u2019s door. There was no answer. She called the woman\u2019s name. Still no answer. She tried the door\u2014which was open. Hesitantly walking in, she continued to call the woman\u2019s name.</p><p>Jennie wasn\u2019t in the bathroom or anywhere in the room. Jane felt a growing sense of unease and even checked under the bed. Again, no sign of her.</p><p>Coming out of the room, she saw Sage McCormick. The ghost was waiting for her on the second landing by the stairs, and as Jane approached her, Sage drifted down the stairs. She walked around to the bar and behind it.</p> <p>Puzzled, Jane followed her.</p><p>Sage went through the door at the far end of the stage. Jane opened the door to a set of stairs that led to the basement, now the costume storage area.</p><p>Where Sage\u2019s skull had been found.</p><p>Jane carefully went down the stairs. It was broad daylight outside, she reminded herself, and when she tried the switch on the wall, the basement flooded with light.</p><p>Sage kept moving.</p><p>The basement seemed to run the entire length of the theater. From the stairway, Jane could see the rows of wigs that now sat on mannequin heads, old and new. Most of them had faces either carved into them or drawn on them; they were supposed to be artistic, Jane supposed. Mostly, they were grotesque.</p><p>She was, however, glad to see no skulls among them.</p><p>She walked around the center of the main room.</p><p>There were racks hung with costumes, most of them now conserved in cases. There were shoes, canes, stage guns, props and boxes everywhere. She saw no sign of Jennie.</p><p>\u201cJennie?\u201d Jane called out.</p><p>No one answered her.</p><p>She realized there were three rooms that led off the main section of the basement; they were separated by foundation walls. There were no doors, just arched separations with handsome wood carved designs as if someone, long ago, had determined that a theater must be beautiful\u2014even in the storage areas.</p><p>Jane made her way through crates and boxes to the first of the rooms.</p><p>It contained more crates and boxes.</p><p>Irritated, she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she whispered aloud.</p><p>The ghost had gone through the door\u2014and then disappeared. But Sage had brought her here for a reason.</p><p>And then disappeared.</p><p>\u201cYou could be more helpful,\u201d she said. But then again, if she was right and the ammo in the one Peacemaker was live, the ghost had been a great deal of help; she\u2019d saved a man from dying.</p><p>But if it was live...</p><p>Then someone here was setting people up to die.</p><p>The thought chilled her, and she walked into the last room, the one closest to the Old Jail Bed and Breakfast. In fact, it almost seemed as if she was under the Old Jail.</p><p>This room was different. The light from the main room didn\u2019t seem to reach far enough and she couldn\u2019t find another switch. The one bulb down here illuminated the main room and stretched as far as the second room. By the third room...</p><p>The third room was filled with shadows. As she walked toward it, she stopped for a minute.</p><p>It was creepy, mostly shadowed\u2014and crowded with mannequins. Some of them were poor, barely more than two-dimensional, and held theatrical billboards. Some of them were excellently crafted and wearing costumes or cloaks from the many decades the theater had been in existence. Some were old movie props, collected fifty-plus years ago.</p><p>Some were headless.</p><p>And some had heads with faces that offered very real expressions of anger, fear, hope, happiness\u2014and evil. Some were lined up. Some were falling over on one another.</p><p>\u201cAh, Sage, where are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>At first, there was nothing. Her little pencil flashlight was back in her room; she hadn\u2019t thought to stuff that in a pocket with her cell phone.</p><p>She wondered if it was better to see\u2014or not see\u2014the mannequins. Coming close to one, she saw that it was a mannequin of a Victorian woman, carved from wood.</p><p>The eyes were huge, made of blue glass. The mouth was a circle, as if the woman had witnessed the greatest terror on earth.</p><p>A placard hung from the wrist. Jane stooped to read it. Come One, Come All. Come Scream! The Gilded Lily Brings You The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde!</p><p>Turning from the mannequin, Jane bumped right into a mannequin of Mr. Hyde.</p><p>She almost screamed but managed to swallow down the sound.</p><p>Federal agents don\u2019t scream at the sight of mannequins! she chastised herself.</p><p>Something swung toward her\u2014an arm. A gasp escaped her and then she laughed softly. Backing away from Mr. Hyde, she\u2019d pushed a replica of King Lear.</p><p>\u201cSage!\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She was stunned when, in response, she heard a groan.</p><p>So far, Sage McCormick\u2019s voice had been silent; it was unlikely that the ghost had suddenly decided to groan.</p><p>\u201cJennie! Jennie, is that you? Are you down here? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>She began to squeeze her way through the mannequins. In the eerie light, some seemed real, as if they could come to life. Among them were chorus girls and cancan dancers, fan dancers, handsome men in tuxes. And wolf men and grisly zombies and vampires....</p><p>She heard the groan again.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the ghost, she was sure of it\u2014and definitely not the mannequins.</p><p>A deranged-looking figure in a straitjacket held a cleaver high. The cleaver was plastic, although the mannequin was creepy. Out on the street it had probably drawn many to the theater; by day it would be a come-on to those who wanted to be a little scared by their entertainment.</p><p>Ignore the mannequins. They aren\u2019t real.</p><p>\u201cJennie?\u201d she called again. The mannequins might not be real, but they made it very hard to find someone who was.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. Try to scare me. I am ignoring you,\u201d Jane said aloud. She laughed at herself and admitted that the mannequins scared the hell out of her. She determinedly wound her way around some shrieking harpy and a man with a fly\u2019s head.</p><p>Again, it seemed that one of them, a man in a turn-of-the-century tux, swung around to touch her and knock her in the arm. She almost cried out in surprise, but realized she\u2019d pushed another mannequin into it and the thing had moved.</p><p>She heard the groan again.</p><p>Another mannequin with a wide-open circular mouth was in front of her, holding up a book. She scooted by it and at last found the flesh-and-blood woman she sought.</p><p>Jennie was crumpled on the floor, lying on her back. Her eyes were closed and a trickle of blood had dried on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jennie,\u201d Jane cried, digging in the pocket of her skirt for her cell phone as she knelt down by the woman, clasping her wrist to test the strength of her pulse.</p><p>It was weak.</p><p>\u201cJennie, stay with me. I\u2019m getting help right away,\u201d she said.</p><p>Even as she spoke, she felt as if there was a tap on her shoulder. She looked up. Sage McCormick was with her again, in front of her, between Jennie\u2019s crumpled body and a row of frontier schoolboys. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had a look of terror on her face and she waved an arm frantically.</p><p>It was a warning to turn around.</p><p>Jane started to do so. She felt a whoosh of air and briefly saw the twisted face of a madman wearing a pork pie hat, lips pulled back over teeth that were bared and yellow.</p> <p>It seemed to be coming at her.</p><p>She felt the slam of something hard and heavy against her head.</p><p>She crashed down on Jennie\u2019s prone body.</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t answer her cell phone when Sloan called. That worried him instantly; someone like Jane would always have her phone handy, ready for any emergency. He called Chet, who was working Main Street, and asked him to find her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see her right now,\u201d Chet said, \u201cbut, boy, did I see her earlier! She got into the action on the street. She was great! She was funny, and she switched the whole scene. They didn\u2019t have the shoot-out. She turned it into a totally different scene, with the girls from the show and the guys hamming it up. She\u2019s a natural!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChet, I\u2019m glad to hear that, but I need to speak with her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll look for her. Want me to call you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to stay on the line until you find her.\u201d</p><p>Sloan sat on a chunk of rock that had fallen to the floor when they\u2019d caved in the shaft entrance. He glanced over at the body beneath the tarp, his mind racing. He\u2019d already called Liam Newsome; he and his crime team and the medical examiner were on their way. Sloan rued the fact that there were no real roads back here and nothing was easy once you were this far into the desert.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now?\u201d Johnny asked him as time ticked by.</p><p>\u201cChet asked Henri Coque where Jane went. Henri said she\u2019s looking for Jennie and he hasn\u2019t seen either of them since.\u201d</p> <p>Sloan turned his attention back to Chet. \u201cWhere\u2019s she looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, get in there and find her!\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>He waited; Chet eventually came back on the line. \u201cI\u2019ve been to her room, I\u2019ve been in the theater, behind the stage, back of the bar, in the kitchen. She\u2019s not here, Sloan.\u201d</p><p>Sloan cursed and stood. \u201cI\u2019m on my way in,\u201d he said. \u201cGet everyone looking for her, Chet. I mean everyone. Tear the town apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re needed here,\u201d Chet argued. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a town full of people and some of them are getting drunk and a little rowdy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind her,\u201d he broke in. \u201cEveryone on it. We\u2019ve just come across another victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust find her, Chet. Now,\u201d Sloan ordered.</p><p>He hung up, feeling so frantic he was ready to crash through the rock walls.</p><p>\u201cI will deal with Newsome,\u201d Johnny said. \u201cI will tell him that the boulder was loose, and that you suspected there might be mischief going on in here, like you said when you called him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Sloan had already pocketed his bug.</p><p>He cursed himself. He had known there was illicit activity in the mine, and he\u2019d wanted to catch someone doing something.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected this.</p><p>He paused, glancing down at the body they\u2019d discovered. It was that of Caleb Hough, the big-shot, bigmouthed rancher who thought his son should get away with everything. Sloan hadn\u2019t liked the man. But he wasn\u2019t happy to see him come to this.</p><p>He lay in a pool of blood. He hadn\u2019t been shot execution-style. It appeared that he\u2019d taken a knife wound to the gut, and when he\u2019d doubled over, stunned by the attack, a second person had gotten him from behind, slashing his throat with such force that he\u2019d almost been decapitated.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Johnny told him.</p><p>Sloan nodded, backing out the way he\u2019d come in. He whistled and Roo trotted over; he told Kanga that she had to wait for Johnny. People said horses didn\u2019t really understand commands, that they responded to a tone of voice, but Sloan thought that his animals did understand him. Kanga whinnied and stayed as he had commanded. She went back to eating grass and, for a moment, Sloan wished he was a horse.</p><p>The trail back seemed long, even though he kept up a mental argument with himself\u2014would it be faster to ride to Main Street or get his patrol car?</p><p>He opted for the car.</p><p>When he reached the theater, he found that whether Chet agreed with his command or not, he\u2019d carried it out. The cast, crew, waiters, waitresses and everyone involved with the theater seemed to be combing it inch by inch. He\u2019d met up with one of the county men outside who\u2019d assured him that his people were searching the campsites, settler tents, saloon and stores.</p><p>Sloan went back to Jane\u2019s room, trying to discern if she\u2019d been there recently and if she\u2019d left anything that might give him a clue as to her whereabouts.</p><p>Her room was empty. Nothing seemed to indicate that she\u2019d been there since her stint as Sage, standing by the window.</p><p>He left the room and went down the stairs, almost crashing into Henri. \u201cYou checked all the dressing rooms, the stage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverywhere,\u201d Henri swore. \u201cAs you know, Jane volunteered to come in and search for Jennie, since we haven\u2019t seen her all day. The last time I saw Jane, she was walking into the theater. But she could\u2019ve come back out. We could\u2019ve been distracted. There\u2019s a lot going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe basement\u2014you looked in the basement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Henri nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been down there. So have Cy and Brian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try again, anyway. That place is a mass of crates and boxes and clothing. Anyone who was hurt down there might not be easily seen,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cI went down there,\u201d Henri repeated. \u201cBut...I\u2019ll go down again with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go. Keep looking around up here,\u201d Sloan told him.</p><p>He headed through the door and down to the basement. As Henri had said, when he reached the landing and the main room, he didn\u2019t see a thing. He shoved aside boxes and crates, costumes, even the wig stands. Frustrated, he moved into the first room, then the second, and finally he went into the third. Mannequins stood and stared at him from the shadows. They looked like an army of the ridiculous, assembled to protect the interior of the room.</p><p>He almost jumped when his cell phone rang. He was surprised that he had service in the basement. The shadows were so deep that he couldn\u2019t read caller ID. He answered quickly. \u201cSheriff Trent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSloan,\u201d a voice said. For a moment it sounded as if his name was being spoken by the killer in a slasher movie, the tone was so distorted.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s Sloan Trent. Who the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane. It\u2019s Jane.\u201d</p><p>There seemed to be an echo, and he realized it was because he was hearing her speak in the room at the same time as he heard her speak over the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably about fifteen feet in front of you, since I heard your phone ring,\u201d she said \u201cI\u2019m getting up.\u201d</p><p>He started, jumping back, as theatrically clad mannequins began to topple over and fall against one another.</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d</p><p>He slid the phone in his pocket and began to crawl over the mannequins. One seemed to rise before him; seconds later, he saw that it was Jane.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he demanded as he reached her.</p><p>In the dim light, she might truly have been part of the theater\u2019s history. Her hair was coming loose from the chignon she\u2019d been wearing and she seemed very pale in her blue period dress. She wavered as she stood, and he pushed past the creature in the pork pie hat to steady her.</p><p>She brought her hand to her head. \u201cSomething...someone knocked me out,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m all right, but Jennie...\u201d She stepped back, and he saw Jennie lying on the floor, and his heart leaped to his throat.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive, unconscious,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything\u2019s broken. Can you get her out of here? I don\u2019t have the strength right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not ideal to move an injured person but I\u2019ll definitely get Jennie out. Help can\u2019t even reach her in here.\u201d He paused long enough to hit speed dial and tell Chet to call for paramedics immediately.</p><p>He ducked down and lifted the slender woman in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you can manage?\u201d he asked Jane gruffly. He was frightened, and his fear was making him angry, but he wanted to get Jennie to a hospital and have Jane checked out before he let emotion rule his actions.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe Jennie has any broken bones. Someone knocked her on the head, too. Her pulse is decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo up the stairs ahead of me.\u201d</p><p>He heard activity at the door to the basement.</p><p>\u201cI can hear them! He\u2019s found her!\u201d Henri Coque shouted to someone at the top of the stairs.</p><p>Sloan was heedless of what he knocked over as he carefully made his way back to the main room and toward the stairs, following Jane. Her first steps were clumsy, but she recovered her balance, and Henri was there to help her up the stairs. When Sloan got to the landing, he saw a group awaiting them, all wide-eyed and worried. He noticed Henri first, and then Valerie, Alice, Cy and two of the night restaurant staff.</p><p>\u201cBack off, please,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure she has air!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jennie!\u201d Valerie Mystro cried in dismay.</p><p>They moved back, a stricken expression on every face.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Henri asked, sounding lost.</p><p>Yes, what the hell had happened? Sloan wondered. As he walked slowly through the bar to the center of the restaurant, Liz, the waitress, rushed ahead, clearing one of the longer dinner tables. Sloan came forward to lay Jennie down. As he did, the swinging doors to the Gilded Lily swung open, and Chet hurried through, leading two paramedics in uniform and bearing black medical bags. They immediately began to work over the prone Jennie, while asking questions regarding her injury. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sloan listened while Jane replied that no one had known where Jennie was, so she\u2019d gone down to the basement and heard her groaning and finally found her, only to be knocked on the head herself.</p><p>\u201cKnocked on the head?\u201d Henri burst out. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose stupid mannequins!\u201d Valerie said.</p><p>\u201cA mannequin did not knock her on the head,\u201d Alice protested, \u201cbut those old bastards can hurt you. One of them fell on me when I first came to the theater and went to look at them, thinking they were so cool.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re evil, Henri! We should get them out of here,\u201d Valerie said.</p><p>The paramedics started an IV on Jennie. One of them talked on his radio, and a minute later, two other emergency workers joined them, bearing a stretcher. The oldest of the group turned to Jane. \u201cYou come to the hospital, too. Head injuries can be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a scan. You could have a concussion,\u201d Sloan said harshly. He took her by the arm. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSloan!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe hospital!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...we don\u2019t know what happened!\u201d Henri said.</p><p>\u201cAll I know is that I found Jennie on the floor. I got my cell phone out to call for help, and the next thing I knew...I was waking up on the floor myself,\u201d Jane told him.</p><p>Sloan was torn; he didn\u2019t want Jane going to the hospital without him and he didn\u2019t want anyone crawling around in the basement until he\u2019d done the initial investigation himself.</p><p>\u201cChet,\u201d he barked, calling his deputy.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStand at that door. No one goes in or out until I\u2019m back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anyone comes out of that basement, arrest him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Henri frowned. \u201cI need to get down there and see what kind of damage has been done. These two might have knocked over mannequins and been knocked out by them. Sloan, this doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s some kind of a diabolical plot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenri, you started all this because you wanted to know who put the skull on the wig stand. By God, I\u2019m going to finish it.\u201d</p><p>The paramedics had already taken Jennie out. One of them was standing at the door impatiently, waiting for him and Jane. The hospital wasn\u2019t quite two miles away; he could easily be back soon.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in this town. The one thing we do know is that it involves more than the theater. I just found Caleb Hough dead in an abandoned mine. We\u2019ve had two murders. You listen to me. No one goes down in that basement!\u201d</p><p>Valerie gasped and the others stared at him in stunned silence.</p> <p>He turned. Jane was staring at him, too. He grabbed her arm, leading her to the door.</p><p>\u201cSloan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cX-ray or CAT scan\u2014or whatever they do!\u201d His words were a growl; he was acting like a macho jerk. But he was the sheriff\u2014and it was going to be done his way.</p><p>They went out to the street as the paramedics and county cops cleared a path to the ambulance.</p><p>The sirens blared and they drove to the hospital.</p><p>Jane wished she\u2019d come to long before Sloan had gotten to the basement.</p><p>She was poked and prodded, scanned, put into a hospital gown and given an IV and then a serious warning from a young doctor who said she did have a minor concussion, and that she needed to be watchful because of it. \u201cYou should be able to resume normal activity\u2014but nothing strenuous. You were unconscious for a while. This could have been severe.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou were fortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I leave now?\u201d Jane asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll discharge you.\u201d He looked over at Sloan, who\u2019d been at her side throughout, except when medical procedure had dictated he wait outside. He\u2019d taken that time, he\u2019d told her, to talk to Detective Liam Newsome with county, and that conversation hadn\u2019t improved his mood any.</p><p>\u201cYes, just take care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will.\u201d Sloan leaned against the wall, arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>Ten minutes later, they were both seated in the back of a county patrol car, being driven to Lily.</p><p>The ride was silent. Uncomfortably silent. But apparently, Sloan didn\u2019t want to talk in front of anyone else, so she didn\u2019t try.</p><p>When they returned to the theater, it was open for business, with the restaurant and bar in full swing. Liz came hurrying to the door to meet them. \u201cJane, you\u2019re all right?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jane assured her.</p><p>\u201cAnd Jennie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJennie\u2019s still unconscious, but she\u2019s being given the best possible care,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Henri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBackstage, setting up for this evening\u2019s show. He\u2019s getting the cast to help him with everything Jennie usually did,\u201d Liz said. \u201cYour deputy\u2019s been standing guard at the basement door since you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Liz.\u201d Sloan waited until she\u2019d hurried off, then turned to Jane. \u201cYou should lie down for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you upstairs,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cListen to me. I\u2019m fine. If there\u2019s something to be found in the basement, you\u2019ll find it faster with two people looking,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cJane\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSloan.\u201d</p><p>He swore under his breath. \u201cCome with me, then. But when we\u2019re finished, you have to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll search the basement first,\u201d she said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cI need to know exactly what happened down there,\u201d he said, winding his way through groups of people, one hand on Jane\u2019s back.</p><p>The crowd in the bar was rowdier and more cheerful\u2014and much drunker. Sloan\u2019s mood was like a thundercloud, and Jennie had difficulty disentangling herself from the people trying to stop her as she walked toward the door. Most wanted pictures, and she promised to pose with them later. Each time she did, Sloan, scowling fiercely, would step between her and the tourists, and they\u2019d back off.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t moved, Sloan,\u201d Chet said when they reached the door. \u201cLiz made coffee and brought it to me. No one\u2019s been down there.\u201d He started to smile at Jane, but cleared his throat and shifted awkwardly away from the door.</p><p>Sloan managed a brief, \u201cThank you, Chet.\u201d</p><p>He walked down the stairs, not turning back as she followed him. He paused to pull a giant flashlight from his belt, using it as he went straight to the third section of the room\u2014the place she\u2019d forever think of as the mannequin\u2019s lair.</p><p>With the light playing over the mannequins, they seemed far less real.</p><p>\u201cSo, relive every second of what happened,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cI looked for Jennie upstairs. She wasn\u2019t there.\u201d Jennie hesitated. \u201cI saw Sage McCormick. She led me to the basement door and then disappeared. I checked every room until I reached this part\u2014the mannequin room\u2014and then I heard a groan. I pushed over a few of the dummies and found Jennie.\u201d She stopped for a moment, shivering. \u201cWhen I went to take out my phone, I saw Sage again. She was warning me to look behind me and...and then something whacked me and I went down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo someone was in here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the mannequins didn\u2019t just fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a little unlikely that a mannequin would fall and hit Jennie so hard that she\u2019s still unconscious\u2014and then fall on me, too. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I\u2019m just asking you. Because, apparently, no one saw anyone come down here. Or leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one was in the building when I came in. Well, except for Jennie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, someone else was in the building\u2014and in the basement.\u201d</p><p>Sloan trained the light over the entire area. Now half the mannequins were on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He pointed suddenly.</p><p>She stared in that direction and saw what seemed to be a partial footprint on the dusty floor.</p><p>\u201cIt could be anyone\u2019s, Sloan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Too big to be either yours or Jennie\u2019s, and I\u2019m not wearing work shoes. Walk around it. I\u2019m going to get the crime-scene unit in here. See if you can find anything else.\u201d</p><p>She tried to search without touching while he went meticulously through the room.</p><p>\u201cFound it,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe weapon.\u201d He pulled gloves from his pocket and reached into the fallen pile of mannequins near the spot where she\u2019d discovered Jennie.</p><p>He carefully lifted something out.</p><p>It was a cane, a Victorian walking cane with a snarling wolf for a handle.</p><p>\u201cGrab the light,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She did, shining it on the cane. On the handle, almost as if the snarling wolf had just bitten flesh, was a bloodstain.</p><p>\u201cI imagine that\u2019s going to be Jennie\u2019s blood,\u201d he said tersely. \u201cYou could have been hit a hell of a lot harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and like the doctor said, I\u2019m very lucky I wasn\u2019t.\u201d She sighed impatiently. \u201cAre you going to get that to a lab?\u201d</p><p>He took out his cell. He spoke briefly but she could tell that he was speaking to Liam Newsome. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be here until you send someone,\u201d he said, and hung up.</p><p>\u201cNewsome isn\u2019t coming himself?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNewsome is still at the morgue with the body we found this morning,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She felt dizzy and fought the sensation. Concussion. She had to be careful.</p><p>\u201cYou found someone\u2014in the mine shaft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it earlier. Not until we knew you were okay. You didn\u2019t need anything else to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho...who was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb Hough, the rancher.

A skull here, the bones...Jennie and me being knocked out in the theater? These may be entirely separate. No one was killed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJennie is in a coma, still unconscious. Maybe one or both of you was meant to die.\u201d</p><p>She was almost afraid to tell him about the guns. She had to, she knew. \u201cSloan, I stopped the duel today\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, yes, I heard about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m told you gave the day a whole new meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped it because of Sage McCormick\u2014and I stopped it because I was afraid someone had tampered with one of the guns. Which, as far as I can tell, turned out to be true.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened and scowled. She hadn\u2019t thought he could look any more like a powder keg about to blow, but he managed it.</p><p>\u201cYou know this? You found cartridges that weren\u2019t blank?\u201d</p><p>She felt her cheeks burn. \u201cI\u2019m not a hundred percent sure, but the cartridges in the two guns were different.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are the guns now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left them on my bed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went into your room when I arrived, when I was looking for you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no guns on your bed.\u201d</p><p>Lock your door. Jennie had told her to do that.</p> <p>And she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI still have the bullets,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless someone ransacked my whole room. They\u2019re in the toe of one of my boots.\u201d</p><p>He still looked as if he could bite those bullets in half.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re worried about me, but you\u2019ll have a heart attack if you don\u2019t control your temper,\u201d she said mildly.</p><p>He stared at her, incredulous, but he didn\u2019t have a chance to respond. Chet called down the stairs. \u201cSloan? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, Chet. Stay there, will you? I\u2019m waiting for the county crime-scene people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>But behind Chet, Henri had a different opinion on the matter. He came running downstairs. \u201cSloan, what are you doing? This is one of our two biggest nights of the year! You\u2019re going to have crime-scene people in the theater now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenri, someone viciously smashed in the head of your stage manager with a cane\u2014and then used it on a federal agent. On Jane. You\u2019re damned right I\u2019m having crime-scene people down here!\u201d Sloan informed him.</p><p>Henri was at the foot of the stairs now. He shook his head. \u201cWhat are you talking about? This place is a mess! Jennie must\u2019ve fallen\u2014the mannequins, look at them! They\u2019ve all fallen over. Nothing evil was done here, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d He paused, turning to Jane. \u201cOh, Jane, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay. I don\u2019t mean to sound as if I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m just running around like a crazy man. And now...you\u2019re saying this was done on purpose?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Henri, someone purposely bashed Jennie and then Jane. So crime-scene people will be coming down here. You\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t close the whole theater. But while we\u2019re on the subject... No more duels, no hangings, nothing violent\u2014even as playacting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the outlaws were supposed to come riding into town tomorrow, shooting it all up!\u201d Henri protested.</p><p>\u201cThink of something else. No guns, no knives, no ropes, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the mayor, Sloan. I can fire you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire me, but the county is coming in, and the county can trump you, Henri, and you know it,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cHenri, did you hear me? Jennie is really hurt. She\u2019s in the hospital, in a coma.\u201d</p><p>Henri went silent and hung his head.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s been another murder, Henri. This one, a townsman. Caleb Hough.\u201d</p><p>Henri looked up. \u201cSloan, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m truly sorry. But he was a bigmouth and a bastard, and I\u2019m not surprised he got into trouble. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was murdered in the mine shaft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t have anything to do with the theater!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe crime-scene investigators will come down here, and you\u2019ll get to keep your theater open. For now. Something is going on, and I\u2019d think you\u2019d want to make sure a body doesn\u2019t suddenly fall on your stage in the middle of a show.\u201d</p><p>Henri glowered at him. \u201cHah! Now that\u2019s being overly dramatic, Sloan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenri, get back upstairs. We\u2019re coming, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Henri demanded, pointed at the cane.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the weapon that bashed people\u2019s heads, and it\u2019s going to the crime lab,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>Henri let out a groan of frustration and marched up the stairs. Sloan turned to Jane. \u201cGo up to your room and get those bullets. See if the guns fell somewhere, although I doubt it. When the county crime-scene unit arrives, I\u2019ll be up. And then, tonight, you\u2019ll stay at my house.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer to him. \u201cSloan, if something\u2019s happening, I should be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can get your head bashed in again?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou have a concussion. You\u2019re off for the night. Either do it my way, or you\u2019re uninvited,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>Jane straightened her shoulders. She was tempted to tell him to take his whole haunted town and shove it.</p><p>But now she\u2019d seen Sage McCormick\u2014a ghost trying to communicate.</p><p>And people were dying.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she snapped, and left. Chet tried to pretend that he hadn\u2019t heard everything as she walked by him. \u201cJane,\u201d he said, nodding politely.</p><p>\u201cChet,\u201d she said in return, and kept going.</p><p>As she passed through the bar area, she was accosted by many people in the crowd again. She posed for pictures. Too bad if Sloan didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>While she worried about poor Jennie, Jane could also understand Henri\u2019s position. She couldn\u2019t begin to calculate the amount of money the theater would be making that night.</p><p>When she saw the crime-scene techs walk in, she quickly begged off doing more pictures. She heard people whispering, wondering why the officers were heading for the basement.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see anyone running out in fear.</p><p>But the forensics people were there; Sloan would be along any minute. She excused herself and ran up to her room.</p><p>In front of the mirror, she studied her reflection\u2014no one had acted as if she looked strange. She gingerly touched the top of her head. She had a knot there, but she felt all right.</p><p>It could have been worse. But she hadn\u2019t done anything stupid, not then. Rushing out to stop the gunfight when she was afraid there might be live ammunition\u2014now, that had been stupid.</p><p>As Sloan had said, the guns weren\u2019t where she\u2019d left them. Neither were they on the floor\u2014or anywhere she could find.</p><p>She moved quickly, packing a small overnight bag and digging the cartridges out of the toe of her boot. When Sloan came to her room, she was ready.</p><p>He stepped inside for a moment and closed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cThe bullets?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She handed them over. All twelve were there. He glanced at them and then at her.</p><p>\u201cDo you know which of the actors was holding the gun with the live ammunition?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI just took them\u2014fast.\u201d</p><p>She thought he\u2019d accuse her of being the worst law enforcement officer ever; to her surprise, he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou saved someone\u2019s life, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t look fierce anymore; he looked tired and worn.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said dully. \u201cI have two county men staying through the night. Whatever\u2019s going on, I know damned well that the theater\u2019s involved. I should close the damned thing down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do, you\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cLet\u2019s pray the county guys are as good as you are.\u201d He took her bag. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tired enough to drop and we\u2019ve got a stop to make before we get to my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go to the Hough ranch. Tell his wife and boy Caleb\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then you\u2019d better give me a hand getting out of this Victorian get-up,\u201d Jane told him.</p><p>He looked at her helplessly, and she sighed.</p><p>\u201cJust unlace the bodice at the back,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll need a few minutes to change and we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>The Hough ranch was massive. Barns, paddocks and stables far to the east of the property, while the main house sat on a hillock. A stone patch, surrounded by an attractive cacti garden, led the way to the house, which could have graced many a magazine cover.</p><p>Jane stood on the porch with Sloan as he rang the bell. He was glad she\u2019d come along with him. He\u2019d always hated having to tell someone that a loved one was dead\u2014but he hated the idea that they\u2019d hear it on the news or through another source even more.</p><p>She touched his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s been hours since you found his body. Do you think they know already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam Newsome came by to speak with the family,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cAs much as you seem to think I don\u2019t play well with others, I keep him up on what I\u2019ve discovered\u2014and he\u2019s a detective. I haven\u2019t even actually seen Liam yet. Johnny Bearclaw and I were waiting for him to arrive with someone from the medical examiner\u2019s office when I called, but then you went missing. Johnny waited at the scene, while I drove to town. Newsome came out here right after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are we here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam couldn\u2019t get an answer. They\u2019ve called a couple of times. Apparently, Caleb took Jimmy\u2019s cell and Zoe, Caleb\u2019s wife, is notorious for never knowing where hers is. So, Newsome had an officer come out, but he still didn\u2019t find anyone home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that we\u2019re finding anyone at home, either,\u201d Jane said. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re out of town. Jimmy was in trouble, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sloan frowned. \u201cSometimes Jimmy works for the stables.\u201d He pulled his cell phone from his pocket. Heidi answered breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cLily Stables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeidi, it\u2019s Sloan\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah, your name\u2019s on caller ID. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Jimmy come into work today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the little dweeb was a no-show, and he didn\u2019t answer his phone all day, either. That\u2019s why I can hardly breathe. I\u2019m hauling hay all by myself for the hayride. Is something wrong\u2014something else? Wow. I went by on my third trail ride today, and an area near the old mine shaft was cordoned off. A guy in a county uniform told me just to take the trail group on by. What else has happened? Oh, God!\u201d</p><p>Heidi was going to get hysterical and he couldn\u2019t afford to listen right then. \u201cThanks, Heidi,\u201d he said, and hung up.</p><p>Watching him, Jane stepped gingerly into the garden to look inside the house. She pressed her nose to the picture window.</p> <p>\u201cSloan,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, joining her.</p><p>\u201cI see a handbag and a shawl on the little table in the foyer. There are keys lying next to it.\u201d</p><p>Sloan figured someone had to be out by the stables and barns. It was a massive ranch. But the house was also set apart from the work buildings.</p><p>He tried the front door; it was locked. It was a solid wood door\u2014slamming his shoulder against it for the next ten years probably wouldn\u2019t break it in. He hesitated a bare half second, then drew his gun and shot the lock. If Jane was surprised, she didn\u2019t say so. They entered the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the upstairs,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sloan walked through the dining room, the kitchen, Caleb Hough\u2019s office and cigar room, the pantry. Nothing seemed to be out of order. Maybe his instincts had been wrong. Explaining why he\u2019d shot through a lock to get onto private property\u2014when he\u2019d gone there to tell a woman that her husband had been murdered\u2014wasn\u2019t going to be easy.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sloan!\u201d Jane called. \u201cUp here.\u201d</p><p>He ran up the stairs. She was in Jimmy Hough\u2019s bedroom. It looked as if there\u2019d been a scuffle. Pillows were on the ground and the sheets were halfway ripped off the bed.</p><p>\u201cBut where is Jimmy now?\u201d Sloan asked rhetorically. He felt ill; Caleb Hough had been a blowhard, but no one deserved to die the way he had. Jimmy was a good kid with the potential of becoming a fine man.</p><p>Jane set an arm on his shoulder. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s lying dead somewhere. Maybe he\u2019s been kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the father is dead, so why would someone hold Jimmy?\u201d Sloan asked. He turned on his heel.</p><p>\u201cWhere now?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cThe garage.\u201d</p> <p>He ran down the stairs and back to the kitchen. A door opened out to the garage. It was locked, but it was a thin wooden door and, that one, he did slam his shoulder against. The door gave.</p><p>\u201cCarbon monoxide,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>He swore. There were three cars in the garage. While he could smell the gas, it had faded, and he couldn\u2019t see anyone. He strode quickly to the Mercedes Benz at the far end of the garage while Jane started with the Acura SUV closest to the house. They reached the \u201957 Chevy in the center together. He yanked open the passenger side while Jane opened the driver\u2019s door.</p><p>There they were, Jimmy and his mother\u2014both looking as if they were dead. Covered in sheets like children playing at being ghosts.</p><p>They ripped the sheets off the pair.</p><p>Zoe Hough was in the driver\u2019s seat and her son was in the passenger seat.</p><p>Sloan felt for Jimmy\u2019s pulse. He found a flicker of life in the vein at the boy\u2019s neck. Glancing at Jane, he was relieved when she nodded.</p><p>\u201cWeak\u2014but she has a pulse.\u201d</p><p>Sloan pulled out his phone and called in an emergency.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll open the doors, get air,\u201d Jane said. She rushed to the garage doors and, even as they slid up, Sloan saw cop cars coming down the drive. One was from his office and two were from county.</p><p>No one could have answered an emergency call that fast, but he was glad they were there.</p><p>Declan McCarthy, his managing night deputy, was the first to reach him. \u201cSloan\u2014wow, you\u2019re here. What the hell happened now? I heard about Caleb Hough, and that, so far, we hadn\u2019t found his wife and son,\u201d Declan told him.</p><p>\u201cWe need an ambulance. It\u2019s on the way,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cHow did you get here so quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house alarm went off. The security company called county, and county called me,\u201d Declan explained.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get them out of the garage,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>The two officers from county didn\u2019t pull their guns, recognizing the situation before they reached the door. Jane had Zoe Hough halfway out of the car; the county men assisted her. Declan helped Sloan maneuver Jimmy out from the other side. They got them into the driveway. There was no real grass on the lawn anywhere, but Declan got a blanket from the back of his patrol car and Jimmy and Zoe were placed on it. \u201cMrs. Hough is breathing,\u201d he said. \u201cJimmy, he\u2019s got a pulse, faint...but I\u2019m not feeling his breath.\u201d</p><p>Sloan fell to his knees by Jimmy\u2019s side, and began mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, breathing into his lungs. Declan went into emergency mode with him, counting, pressing on the boy\u2019s chest.</p><p>Jimmy choked, then he started breathing on his own. Sloan felt the tension ease from his body. The kid was going to live. He didn\u2019t know how long he and his mother had inhaled poisonous gas; he didn\u2019t know how Jimmy would be when he woke up, what brain damage he might have sustained. But he would live.</p><p>The ambulance arrived, and the emergency medical technicians took over.</p><p>One of the officers from county introduced himself as Sergeant Johnson. \u201cI was here earlier today,\u201d he said. \u201cNever occurred to me to break in. Thank God you decided to do it, Sheriff. I\u2019ll let Newsome know.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a real miracle those two are still breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the reason for the miracle,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cOne of those two got the car turned off. They saved themselves, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but if they\u2019d spent the night in there, they might not have come back from it,\u201d Johnson told him. \u201cYou want to cover this scene, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfficer McCarthy will stay here, representing the town,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cI know this kid. I\u2019d like to ride with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hang in with the mother,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>As the emergency med techs began work, Sloan noted that three men were coming from the stables. They were obviously ranch employees\u2014they wore boots, jeans and cotton shirts that showed signs of sand and mud. The Hough ranch was one of the few places in the area that had a stream and a steady water supply; Hough had paid a great deal of money for the water rights so his place would be a viable location to raise beefalo in the middle of a desert.</p><p>A burly fellow came forward, his ranch hat in his hand. There was deep concern wrinkled into his face. \u201cI am Inego Garcia, one of the managers,\u201d he introduced himself. \u201cWhat has happened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese two were apparently attacked,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cSometime earlier today. Did you see anyone here, anyone who could have done this?\u201d</p><p>Sloan was sure the man was sincere when he shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working, moving the herd. We\u2019ve had a dry spell and needed to get the animals to the second pasture. Mr. Hough\u2014he doesn\u2019t like us around the house. He says the house is his home and the ranch is where we work. Mrs. Hough, now, she\u2019s a nice lady. She doesn\u2019t mind dirt and mud. She sometimes brings us cupcakes or cookies. She is a fine lady. Is she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive right now,\u201d Sloan told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd Jimmy\u2014the boy?\u201d Inego asked, tears glistening in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAlive, too,\u201d Jane said, gently touching his arm.</p><p>\u201cHave you been able to reach Mr. Hough? I have tried to get him several times during the day. I can keep trying if you like.\u201d</p><p>Sloan took a breath before answering him. \u201cMr. Hough is dead, Inego. I\u2019m sorry to tell you this. We\u2019ve been trying to get hold of the family all day to tell them, and now, of course, we know why we couldn\u2019t. Inego, we\u2019ll need your help. We need to know who might have had an argument with Mr. Hough. We have to find out who did this\u2014who killed him and tried to kill his family.\u201d</p><p>Inego Garcia worried the ball cap he\u2019d removed and held between his hands. He glanced at his fellow workers. \u201cWell, Sheriff, he had a major argument with you. Said you were going to ruin his son\u2019s life\u2014and turn the boy against him.\u201d</p><p>Sloan felt the county men look his way.</p><p>Yes, he had really disliked Caleb Hough. And now, he\u2019d been the one to find him in the mine shaft\u2014and he and Jane had found the family in the garage. He imagined he wasn\u2019t looking so good.</p><p>\u201cAnyone else?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>Again, the workers glanced at one another.</p><p>Inego coughed. \u201cWell...everyone,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEveryone?\u201d</p><p>Another of the men stepped up. \u201cI\u2019m Lee Cho,\u201d he told Sloan. \u201cI was in the barn the other day when he came in swearing about the man who owned Desert Diamonds. Grant Winston. He said that Winston was\u2014\u201d He paused, clearing his throat as he fixed his gaze on Jane.</p><p>\u201cPlease, repeat what he said. I\u2019m a federal agent, Mr. Cho. I\u2019ve heard some pretty nasty language in my time,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hough was saying that Mr. Winston was a grade-A, motherfucking stupid asshole who had no appreciation for the fact that without his ranch, Lily was a godforsaken dust pool,\u201d Lee Cho said, staring at the ground as he spoke.</p><p>The third man cleared his throat, as well. \u201cHe hated the theater, too. The Gilded Lily. He was ranting and raving about Henri Coque being a womanizing\u2014\u201d he paused, but continued quickly \u201c\u2014a womanizing small-peckered fuck-face,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what his fight was with Mr. Coque. He never said. Mr. Hough didn\u2019t mind ranting in front of us, but he didn\u2019t consider us his friends. We kept our mouths shut.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sloan felt a tap on his shoulder. It was one of the emergency med techs. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to roll, Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>Sloan turned to Declan and the county officers. \u201cYou\u2019ll get statements from these men?\u201d</p><p>He received solemn nods in reply.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll get the crime-scene folks out here, too,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis is the busiest they\u2019ve been in a hell of a long time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d Sloan asked Jane.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d she said.</p><p>Only one of them could ride in the ambulance, and Jane felt it should be him. \u201cI\u2019ll drive behind in your patrol car,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you get in there,\u201d he insisted. \u201cYou were diagnosed with a concussion a little while ago. I\u2019ll drive the car. Stay with them for me.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t argue. As he followed, he realized she was just about the perfect agent. She was a listener, not butting in when others were questioning people, responding when she needed to respond and keeping quiet when something more might be learned.</p><p>She was a talented artist, too. He had the feeling that she worked well with her Krewe, handling the street work and the action, as well as the office work.</p><p>She\u2019d never leave her job.</p><p>But what about him?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t known how much Lily, his home, meant to him until someone had brought murder to it.</p><p>Not something to think about now, he told himself.</p> <p>But he felt numb, like someone other than himself. So much had happened in Lily, and so fast. Lily, Arizona\u2014where all the violence had been in the past.</p><p>Until they\u2019d found Sage McCormick\u2019s skull.</p><p>In the hospital, Jane dozed off, exhaustion taking its toll while they sat waiting. She woke with a start when Sloan nudged her; she\u2019d fallen asleep on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going in. They said I could go in,\u201d he muttered. He sounded weary. Beyond weary.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>He smiled briefly and joined the doctor, who was allowing him to see the patients. She started when her phone rang. Logan. She winced; she should have reported in already. Glancing at her watch, she realized it was almost 1:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>\u201cNews services have picked up reports about a second murder in Lily,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She reported in on the day, glossing over her own experience in the basement of the theater. When she\u2019d explained it all, she paused.</p> <p>Sloan seemed fine working with the county police. She didn\u2019t know what his concern seemed to be when it came to his own people\u2014other than that they were all from Lily.</p><p>\u201cSloan thinks that everything\u2019s connected. And I believe it\u2019s more than possible. He also doesn\u2019t seem to trust his own people....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSloan is probably right about a connection. And if Lily is the source of all these crimes, he might just figure that his own people are too close to too many of the players,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t her place, but she decided she should make the suggestion, anyway. \u201cMaybe you and Kelsey could head out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Sloan,\u201d Logan said. \u201cSee if he\u2019ll issue an invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJay Berman crossed state lines to get murdered here,\u201d Jane pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d He must have been sitting at the computer. \u201cWe can catch an 8:00 a.m. direct flight that\u2019ll get us out there at about eleven tomorrow. Do you think the facial reconstruction started all this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She thought for a minute. \u201cI think it started before the skull showed up on the wig rack. Something major has to be going on. Two men don\u2019t die out in the desert\u2014one shot, one with his throat slit\u2014because of some minor disagreement. Men who shouldn\u2019t even have known each other. And now we have three people hospitalized\u2014Jennie in a coma from head trauma, and Hough\u2019s son and wife with carbon monoxide poisoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a skull and two corpses removed from their graves,\u201d Logan said. \u201cSloan and I were friends. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine with us going out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in with the wife and son of the murder victim now,\u201d Jane told him.</p><p>\u201cHave him give me a call,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cYou should call him,\u201d Jane began, but Logan didn\u2019t reply. She heard a dial tone and realized he\u2019d already hung up.</p><p>Jimmy Hough was conscious but drowsy. He looked at Sloan through glazed eyes when Sloan came and sat by his bed.</p><p>\u201cMy dad is dead,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>Jimmy\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cHe was such a jerk. He was a bully. He beat me up with a spoon when I was a kid. He stopped doing that, though. Once he figured I could be a football star. Then he started telling me that...that I should seize the world. I\u2019d have everything, money, women, anything I wanted. The bigger a jerk I became, the better he liked me.\u201d He paused and tears welled up in his eyes. \u201cI know he was a jerk, but he was my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he was your dad and you should mourn him, Jimmy,\u201d Sloan said quietly. He waited a minute and then leaned forward. \u201cJimmy, who attacked you and your mom?\u201d</p><p>Jimmy shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We were getting ready to leave. I was going to help Heidi out at the stables. And my mom...she loves all the Silverfest activities. Dad\u2019s never gone with her and she gets to...she gets to kind of be herself. She watches all the stuff the actors do, she shops at all the vendors\u2019 booths...she has a beer at the saloon. She doesn\u2019t drink\u2014that\u2019s her big thing. A beer at the saloon during Silverfest.\u201d Tears welled in his eyes again.</p><p>Sloan put a hand on Jimmy\u2019s and squeezed it. \u201cCan you tell me what happened today? If I can find the people who attacked you, I can find the people who killed your dad.\u201d</p><p>Jimmy shut his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything. I didn\u2019t see anything at all. Mom had just called me from downstairs, telling me she was ready. I was opening the door to leave and when I did a sheet came down over my head. I fought. I fought like crazy. But whoever it was...\u201d He stopped for a minute. \u201cThere were two of them. There had to be. Because when they dragged me downstairs to the garage, my mom was already there. I kept trying to struggle but they knocked me on the head with something, and the next thing I knew, I opened my eyes and I smelled the exhaust fumes and the car was running. It was horrible.... I couldn\u2019t make myself move. I knew we were dying and I couldn\u2019t move. I wasn\u2019t tied up, but...I don\u2019t know. Somehow I managed to reach over and turn the car off...and then I passed out again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJimmy, did the person speak?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cHe grunted a few times,\u201d Jimmy said. There was a touch of pride in his voice when he added, \u201cI got him in the ribs. He seemed to be about my size...but he was strong. Really strong. I\u2019m in good shape, Sheriff. But this guy had it all over me.\u201d He paused again. \u201cThe other one, though...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Jimmy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other one was a woman, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my mother\u2019s a fighter, too. And I think she hurt the woman, because I heard her say something to the guy when they were leaving. Sounded like, \u2018Bitch hurt me. I\u2019m not in on crap like this anymore.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Sloan stood and set his card on the table next to Jimmy.</p><p>\u201cIf you remember anything else, call me, Jimmy.\u201d</p><p>Jimmy nodded. \u201cMy mom\u2019s going to make it, isn\u2019t she?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so. You saved her life. You saved both your lives when you managed to switch off the ignition.\u201d</p><p>At the door, Sloan found himself called back one more time.</p><p>\u201cSheriff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a bad guy. My dad thought you were a puffed-up dick who\u2019d spent too much time in Houston to be an Arizona lawman. But I never believed him. You were right to say I had to be locked up. And I\u2019m lucky that you didn\u2019t kill my record. I learned from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine, Jimmy. You\u2019re going to be just fine,\u201d Sloan assured him.</p><p>He left Jimmy and the nurse directed him down the hall to Zoe Hough\u2019s room. She hadn\u2019t come around yet, the nurse said, but she was breathing easily and all her vital signs were good.</p><p>Sloan stepped in, anyway. Zoe Hough was a pretty, blonde woman. Her hair was always impeccable, her nails always manicured; she worked out every day in her home gym and often visited the spa in the old town. Caleb Hough would have expected his wife to be perfectly put together at all times.</p><p>As he stood there, her eyes opened. She blinked, and he knew it was taking her a minute to realize where she was.</p><p>\u201cSloan?\u201d she said. His name, her single word, was a raspy whisper.</p><p>\u201cLet me get you some water,\u201d he said, pouring her a cup from the plastic dispenser. \u201cTake it easy. You\u2019ve been out of it. They\u2019re feeding you fluids through that IV, but your mouth must be dry.\u201d He helped her take a sip of the water. She lay back, gasping, eyes fluttering closed. Then they opened again. Her eyes were blue, usually a pretty color; tonight, they had a dullness about them.</p><p>\u201cJimmy?\u201d she asked anxiously, trying to rise.</p><p>\u201cJimmy\u2019s recovering. He\u2019s right down the hall,\u201d Sloan told her. \u201cHe\u2019s a good kid, Zoe. He got the car turned off. Saved your lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Caleb?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He took a deep breath, wondering how much she could handle at the moment. Despite what Jimmy had said about her being a fighter, she\u2019d always seemed to be such a fragile woman.</p><p>\u201cCaleb was killed in the old mine shaft off the trail today,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t act shocked. Nor did tears spring to her eyes. She stared at the ceiling, and then her gaze slid to meet his. \u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m horrible, Sloan. I just feel...numb. I was so in love when I married him. He was big, he was confident.... He seemed to rule the world. Then my life slowly became endless days of fear. Fear that he wouldn\u2019t like dinner, fear the house wouldn\u2019t be clean enough, fear he wouldn\u2019t like the clothes I\u2019d bought for Jimmy. Later on, I just wanted Jimmy to grow up so I could leave, you know? And then I was praying I\u2019d have the nerve to get out of there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo what happened, Zoe? What was he involved in?\u201d</p><p>She flashed him a rueful smile. \u201cDo you think he would ever have told me what was going on with his business or anything else?\u201d she asked. \u201cI was there to cook, clean, have babies and keep my mouth shut. I didn\u2019t do so well on the babies\u2014we only had the one. But Jimmy was such a great kid...and then I saw what Caleb was doing to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJimmy will grow up to be a good man, Zoe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow that his father is dead.\u201d She suddenly appeared to be furious. \u201cWhatever he got himself into this time, he nearly killed Jimmy and me, too. What kind of father does that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Caleb didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be at risk. He loved his son, Zoe, even if he misdirected that love sometimes. Caleb\u2019s killer probably thinks you knew something about what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSloan, they could try for us again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have an officer watch over you two while you\u2019re here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d Zoe asked.</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have an officer watch over you when you\u2019re out,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise, Zoe. I\u2019ll see to you and Jimmy.\u201d</p><p>He bade her good-night. He was the only one in the hospital by then. Newsome still had people at the Hough house, and he had people in town.</p><p>He called the county detective and told him he needed an officer at the hospital.</p><p>\u201cYou really think whoever\u2019s doing this would risk trying to kill the Hough family in the hospital?\u201d Newsome asked.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019d be irresponsible if we don\u2019t keep guard over them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Newsome said wearily. \u201cWe\u2019re getting stretched pretty thin here, but this kind of thing requires the county to be in on it. I\u2019ve got men on overtime as it is, but you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll get someone over there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo we have any news yet?\u201d Sloan asked him. \u201cFrom forensics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the basement at the theater? They\u2019ll be going through what they lifted from that place for weeks. We haven\u2019t gotten a damned thing from the mine shaft, and I had those men try everything. It\u2019s blocked by solid rock about fifteen feet from where you found Caleb Hough\u2019s body. They sifted for anything they could find, but the place was clean. What he was doing in there when he was murdered is a total mystery to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the old corpse in the desert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe medical examiner\u2019s office cleaned down to the bone. No identity yet. Ms. Everett could give us a likeness of the man, although I imagine he was dug up as a scare tactic. I wish we had more, Sloan, but we just don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe finding out who the dead man is will be important,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll wait until you can get someone down here.\u201d</p><p>He went to tell Zoe that an officer was on the way, but she was sleeping again.</p><p>He returned to the waiting room.</p><p>He figured Jane might have fallen asleep on one of the chairs. She hadn\u2019t. She was sitting very straight, looking beautiful and composed as always. He smiled when he saw her. \u201cReady?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. By the way, I checked in with Logan. He asked for you to call him.\u201d She was looking at him strangely\u2014almost as if she expected him to tear into her for some reason.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still awake?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He called as they left the hospital.</p><p>\u201cJane\u2019s kept me up on events in your town. Seems it hasn\u2019t been easy for her to get the work done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s done it already, for all intents and purposes. We know who the skull belonged to.\u201d Sloan went silent for a minute. Logan, he thought, was going to ask for Jane to come back. He winced inwardly. She was only on loan. He\u2019d been a fool to get used to her being there, on both a personal and professional level.</p><p>\u201cBut, yeah, it\u2019s kind of rough here right now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you could use some help. I have some of the team working at a historic hotel in the capital now, but I can bring Kelsey, and the two of us can come out. Are you willing to let us give you a hand?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>Sloan looked at Jane and then he understood. She\u2019d been afraid that she\u2019d stepped over the line by bringing in more federal help.</p><p>He smiled slowly, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be delighted, Logan. I was just talking to the lead detective at the county force. We\u2019re stretched thin, so if you can get here by tomorrow, that would be great.\u201d</p><p>Logan said he\u2019d make it by eleven.</p><p>Still grinning\u2014almost stupidly, but he was dead exhausted\u2014he told Jane, \u201cI don\u2019t know who said what and I don\u2019t care. We can use the help. Come on, let\u2019s get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>He was surprised that at his house he suddenly felt awkward. Their day had included the hospital for Jane and another dead body, and two attempts at murder. And they were no closer to solving the mystery.</p><p>Cougar appeared as soon as they entered the house, demanding attention. As he\u2019d already discovered, Jane was an animal lover. She crouched down to play with the cat.</p><p>Johnny had left food, a pot of goulash, in the refrigerator. They sat down to eat, but neither was very hungry. When they\u2019d finished, he said, \u201cYou can sleep in my grandfather\u2019s room. There\u2019s actually a bell on the bedside table in case you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I sleep away from you?\u201d she asked. She offered him a rueful grin. \u201cI thought the sleeping-together part went really well.\u201d</p><p>He stood and came over to her, kneeling down and taking her hands. \u201cI thought it went more than well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need to be alone, that\u2019s okay. I understand. But don\u2019t do it for me. The doctor said to take it easy. He didn\u2019t say that I had to stop any kind of physical activity. Although, frankly, I wouldn\u2019t mind a long hot shower first.\u201d</p><p>He rose. \u201cYou know where it is. Although you did have a concussion. You could fall in the shower or...I can wait to have mine until you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we can just shower together,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>In a matter of minutes, she\u2019d undressed. Her thigh holster and gun were placed in the bedside table in his room; he brought his into the bathroom. After today, he wanted it within arm\u2019s reach\u2014no matter what. Jane didn\u2019t question the gun on the towel rack. She stepped into the shower, turned on the water and they both took a minute to luxuriate in the hot steam before finding the soap.</p><p>The day seemed to evaporate with the steam and with her touch. Her fingers moved dexterously over his body while he returned the sensual ministrations. Soap bubbles slid down her breasts and they were slick to the touch. It was incredibly erotic.</p><p>And yet, he realized, she only had to smile to arouse him.</p><p>Her fingers ran down his back and curled around his growing sex, and he knew it was time to leave the water.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get out,\u201d he said thickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to fall,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d</p><p>Jane turned off the water. They got out of the shower and picked up towels, drying each other, pausing for deep, wet kisses that increased his desire to the breaking point. They started to leave the bathroom; he went back for his gun.</p><p>He laid it on the bedside table, then pulled her to him and they fell on the bed together. Their bodies were silky clean, caressed by the cool sheets. She straddled him, damp hair trailing over his shoulders and chest as she stroked him and delivered more wet kisses to his naked flesh. He took her in his arms, fascinated again by the scent and feel of her, his lips straying along her arms, her thighs, her sex. She rose against him and he felt her warmth envelop him. Her eyes were on his as she moved slowly and then with a sensual rhythm that sent his libido soaring. They switched positions so that he stared into her eyes as he moved over her. Far too soon, he felt the urgency of his climax overtake him. Then he felt her shudder in his arms and they lay together, trembling, seeking breath and still entwined.</p><p>In the same position, he slept.</p><p>But in his dreams he saw Longman again, up high on a plateau. Jane was talking to him, and he could see the dark cloud, evil rising around them.</p><p>And heading for Jane.</p><p>He awoke with a start. She still slept peacefully at his side.</p><p>He rose carefully, dressed and took out a notepad. He had all the pieces, he thought. He just had to put them together.</p><p>He started writing down a timeline, including everything that had happened, everything he knew.</p><p>Then he went to get the books he\u2019d bought at Desert Diamonds to read through them.</p><p>Caleb Hough hadn\u2019t been a nice guy. He\u2019d argued with just about everyone. Including Grant Winston.</p><p>And he\u2019d gotten the history books from Grant Winston\u2019s Desert Diamonds. Jay Berman had the same books.</p><p>There had to be something in the books. Something to do with the infamous gold heist?</p><p>Two people\u2014one a man, one a woman\u2014had attacked Zoe and Jimmy Hough.</p><p>A stranger, Jay Berman, had been killed, and so had a local, Caleb Hough.</p><p>Just how many people were involved in what was going on?</p><p>10</p><p>Jane came out of Sloan\u2019s room, wearing the same robe she\u2019d worn before, to find that he\u2019d already brewed coffee and had apparently been working for several hours. He had the books from Desert Diamonds on the table, along with sticky notes, a poster board and a long list of notes for himself.</p><p>\u201cAs we started to discuss earlier, I think there\u2019s a clue in the books,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve skimmed them both. The one by Sheriff Fogerty talks about the town around the time the stagecoach filled with gold disappeared. So, I\u2019m beginning to suspect that Sage knew something about the robbery\u2014and that\u2019s why she was killed. She charmed everyone who came to the bar after her performances. And while a lot of the rougher clientele preferred the saloon, I\u2019ll bet Sage had her share of admirers who came to the theater. She might have heard something from one of them. And I don\u2019t believe she was having an affair with Red Marston. From what I\u2019ve been reading, they were friends from back east and he came to town with a reputation for being a playboy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy did she visit Trey Hardy in his cell?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cThe same reason\u2014simple friendship.

And I\u2019m convinced that Jay Berman came here because someone he knew was in on the situation, and that he was murdered because he got greedy\u2014or because someone thought he\u2019d spilled the beans.\u201d</p><p>Jane poured herself a cup of coffee and sat down across from him. \u201cBut if this is all about gold, why would these murders be taking place now? It\u2019s not illegal to look for gold lost over a hundred years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sloan said, sounding frustrated. \u201cI\u2019m assuming the state would weigh in on the gold, since it was stolen, but there\u2019d have to be an enormous finder\u2019s fee. Maybe the people involved have no intention of handing it over to the state. And everyone\u2019s always assumed that the gold\u2019s around here somewhere. The stagecoach never made it to Tucson. It just disappeared. It would be easy enough to make a stagecoach disappear in the desert. The horses were probably let loose and could have been adopted by Apaches in the area. This book\u2014the one by Brendan Fogerty\u2014suggests the driver and guards were murdered and buried in the desert, and the gold was hidden somewhere, secreted away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would the silver mine have to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t know\u2014unless it was being used as some kind of cache or even a meeting place. The mine didn\u2019t go out of action until long after the stagecoach disappeared.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you really think this is about gold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t figure out anything else. It\u2019s almost as if digging up the corpses from the past is like a warning to someone who\u2019s involved. One of the conspirators, if you will. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not sure the theater is safe.\u201d</p><p>She nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get going. Logan says he\u2019ll rent a car in Tucson. He and Kelsey will be in town sometime in the midafternoon. Before then, I want to start on a few things. I\u2019ll ask Johnny Bearclaw to bring that water bottle you found in the mine to the lab. We must be able to get a DNA hit off it, and that could at least send us in the right direction.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI should\u2019ve done that right away. But now I want to get to town and question everyone at the theater about the live rounds in that gun\u2014and when they last saw Caleb Hough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get dressed,\u201d Jane said. \u201cAnd the bottle is tied to the saddle I was using.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll let Johnny know,\u201d Sloan told her.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later, they were on their way back to town.</p><p>As they drove, she flipped through the books Sloan had gotten at Desert Diamonds. Both were well-written and did an excellent job of recreating the past; it was still the wild, wild west. Everyone carried a gun. Ladies were ladies, whores were whores\u2014and actresses were looked on as little better than whores, though a woman like Sage McCormick would be admired, desired and placed on a pedestal.</p><p>By all accounts, Sage loved her husband and child, but was known as well to frequent the bar of the Gilded Lily. She even smoked a cigar upon occasion and was a good poker player.</p><p>She frequently visited Trey Hardy, once he\u2019d been taken to jail, and was disconsolate when he was shot down in his cell. Trey Hardy, being an outlaw who\u2019d often held up stagecoaches\u2014but let the driver and guards go\u2014could have learned during his time in jail that a stagecoach bearing the last of the area\u2019s gold was leaving town. And maybe he knew who might have gone after it. So if Sage McCormick had been spending time with him, it was logical that he\u2019d told her about the intended heist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet she did know something,\u201d Jane murmured. \u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd will we ever find out?\u201d Sloan responded. \u201cHey, take my phone. The number for the hospital should be in the contacts. See how Jimmy, Zoe and Jennie are doing.\u201d</p><p>Jane dialed, putting the phone on speaker so that Sloan could identify himself. He was told that Jennie remained unconscious. Zoe and Jimmy were doing well.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still a county officer watching the halls?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>The nurse giving the report assured Sloan that an officer was on duty. He come in to spell the night man just an hour ago.</p><p>Sloan thanked her, then said, \u201cOne more. Find the number for Newsome\u2019s office. And please put it on speaker again.\u201d</p><p>Newsome was at the morgue, but one of his officers told Sloan that all they\u2019d heard so far was that the blood on the cane found near Jennie Layton belonged to Jennie Layton. The cane itself had been wiped clean.</p><p>Sloan sighed, disgusted that they couldn\u2019t seem to get any solid evidence. He turned to Jane. \u201cWhen we get there,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll play along with the street theatrics again.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, surprised.</p><p>He offered her a crooked smile. \u201cI can force a county investigation, but that won\u2019t help figure out what\u2019s really going on here. I may even find that people are more willing to talk when we\u2019re in costume. Anyway, a costume isn\u2019t all that different from a uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this is kind of crazy, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything about it is more than a little crazy,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>It was still early, not quite 8:00 a.m., when they arrived. But the doors to the theater were unlocked. As they entered, they saw Henri sitting at one of the tables with his cast.</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d Valerie cried, running over and giving her a hug. \u201cHow are you? You poor dear. Do you have any idea what happened to you yesterday? Should you really be up and walking around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jane assured her.</p><p>\u201cBut...do you remember anything more?\u201d Alice asked. \u201cI mean, could you have tripped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>Valerie looked at her anxiously and then at Sloan.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! Sloan, haven\u2019t you found out anything? It\u2019s all so horrible! Caleb\u2014Caleb Hough\u2014was murdered!\u201d Valerie said. \u201cSloan, he\u2019s not a stranger. He\u2019s one of us! Please tell us you found out what happened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cAnd someone attempted to murder Jimmy and Zoe, as well. There\u2019s something going on here in Lily\u2014and everyone\u2019s in danger until we find out what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone tried to kill Jimmy?\u201d Brian repeated. \u201cJimmy Hough? The kid\u2019s decent. He used to come by a lot. He loved the show. And his mom! What a doll. Why would anyone hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re okay? The family\u2019s okay? They were...attacked?\u201d Alice asked.</p><p>\u201cThey were knocked out and left in the garage to die of carbon monoxide poisoning,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cBut they survived?\u201d Henri asked.</p><p>\u201cJimmy managed to turn the car off,\u201d Jane told them.</p><p>Alice let out a little sound and Cy groaned softly.</p><p>\u201cSloan, Caleb was an outspoken jerk. I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t get killed long ago,\u201d Henri muttered.</p><p>\u201cHenri!\u201d Alice chastised.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true. So maybe Caleb was in collusion with that tourist who got shot in the desert. Caleb was probably running drugs or illegal aliens\u2014or maybe he was even into human trafficking,\u201d Henri said. \u201cIt\u2019s a crying shame the bastard got his family involved. But, Sloan, come on. It\u2019s your job to find out what the hell\u2019s happening here, but it has nothing to do with us in the theater. You didn\u2019t come in to suggest we shut down for the day, did you? Lord, the town\u2019s still full of tourists. None of them have been scared off by this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Henri, I\u2019m not suggesting you shut down. However, the same rules apply as yesterday. No knife fights, no shoot-outs, nothing with weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on!\u201d Henri said again.</p><p>Sloan reached into his pocket and let the cartridges spill out on one of the tables.</p><p>Everyone stared at them and then at Sloan.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is that? What are you trying to say?\u201d Henri demanded.</p><p>\u201cThese are from the guns Cy and Brian were going to use for the duel yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll note that one set is live rounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Brian said, jumping to his feet and backing away, as if the bullets could take aim at him from where they lay scattered on the table.</p><p>Cy stood, too. He swallowed, frowning at Jane. \u201cYou!\u201d he said. \u201cYou knew. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, how did you know, Agent Everett?\u201d Henri asked.</p><p>Jane felt all eyes on her\u2014accusing eyes. \u201cIntuition,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething just seemed wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho handled the guns?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cBefore we had them on the street?\u201d Brian looked at Henri.</p><p>\u201cJennie Layton,\u201d Henri told them. \u201cJennie was always responsible for props. They were in the prop room\u2014right where they were supposed to be\u2014before I went to get them for the duel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut none of you saw Jennie all day. That\u2019s why I had to go search for her,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>Henri waved a hand in the air. \u201cShe had all the costumes ready, plus the prop guns and the rope and rigging we used for the lynching, the night before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can ask Jennie.\u201d Valerie\u2019s voice wavered.</p><p>\u201cHard to ask her if she\u2019s unconscious,\u201d Alice snapped.</p><p>Sloan ignored them. \u201cWho had access to the props besides Jennie?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not locked,\u201d Henri explained. \u201cAnyone could\u2019ve gotten into the prop room. But like I said, Jennie got them ready the night before. She came to tell me we were all set for the first of our big Silverfest days.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do realize that while anyone might have gotten into your prop room, not many people would know the guns would be there\u2014set for a shoot-out,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Valerie cried. \u201cSloan! You\u2019re accusing one of us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCy is my best friend out here,\u201d Brian said. \u201cI\u2019d never shoot him\u2014and he\u2019d never shoot me. I mean, on purpose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis theater is my life!\u201d Henri announced\u2014theatrically\u2014getting to his feet.</p><p>\u201cJennie did prepare the guns.\u201d Brian frowned. \u201cBut then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she accidentally bashed her own head with a cane?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cWe have housekeeping staff. Cooks, servers and bartenders,\u201d Henri said.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019ll get to them all one by one,\u201d Sloan told him.</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014but...it\u2019s Silverfest!\u201d Henri protested. \u201cSheriff, I am the mayor of this town\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Henri. I told you, I\u2019m not going to close anything down. Jane and I will get into costume again and be part of it. I\u2019ll keep an eye on everything all day.\u201d</p><p>Henri nodded, his bald head shining in the light of the chandeliers. \u201cAll right, Sloan, all right, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and two of Jane\u2019s coworkers are on their way. Henri, I thought you could put them up in Jennie\u2019s room for the next few days,\u201d Sloan said casually.</p><p>\u201cJennie\u2019s things are all in her room. It\u2019s not like an empty guest room, Sloan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be very careful of her personal belongings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho are these agents?\u201d Alice asked.</p><p>\u201cLogan Raintree and Kelsey O\u2019Brien. They work together but they\u2019re a couple, as well, so just one room will be fine,\u201d Sloan replied. \u201cThey\u2019ll be protection for you. I still believe you\u2019re all in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring them in, bring them in,\u201d Valerie said.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Alice added.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Sloan, if you think it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Henri agreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for it!\u201d Brian said. His face ashen. \u201cOne of us\u2014Cy or me\u2014almost bought it yesterday.\u201d He looked at Jane, but not with the same rakish I\u2019d love to pick you up stare he usually gave her. He looked at her as if she\u2019d suddenly become an oddity.</p><p>\u201cInstinct. Or...maybe it was the ghost. I glanced up at the window and I thought I saw a woman there. Sage McCormick. It was like a warning that something was going to happen,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, please... I don\u2019t want to believe there are really ghosts here,\u201d Valerie moaned.</p> <p>\u201cI say thank God for a ghost if she saved my life!\u201d Brian said.</p><p>Cy lifted his coffee cup. \u201cHear, hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to go,\u201d Henri said suddenly. \u201cWe need to open our doors and be out on the street. So, Sloan, you two will costume up again?\u201d</p><p>Sloan nodded. \u201cYes, we\u2019ll be part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you down to the dressing rooms,\u201d Alice offered.</p><p>\u201cAgent Everett,\u201d Henri asked. \u201cWhere\u2019s the blue gown? It\u2019s an important part of our costume department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe,\u201d Jane assured him. \u201cIt\u2019s in my room, but after everything that happened yesterday...it\u2019ll need to be cleaned.\u201d</p><p>Henri sighed dramatically. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have to find you something new for today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore we get our costumes, I have one more question,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cDid all of you see one another early yesterday morning?\u201d he asked.</p><p>They were silent for a minute. \u201cHow early?\u201d Alice shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t get up very early. We have late nights here, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian and I were both up. We had coffee together at about eight,\u201d Valerie said.</p><p>\u201cI...slept in,\u201d Cy murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd I had a meeting with Mike Addison,\u201d Henri said impatiently. \u201cAre you suggesting one of us attacked Zoe and Jimmy Hough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to ask, Henri. You know that,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve asked.\u201d Henri was evidently angry. \u201cWe\u2019re theater people. We entertain\u2014we don\u2019t hurt others. We sure as hell don\u2019t kill them!\u201d he ended indignantly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get our costumes, shall we?\u201d Alice suggested. \u201cThere\u2019s way too much testosterone flying around this room!\u201d</p><p>Better testosterone than bullets, Jane thought.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what else Sloan had planned for the day, but at the moment, it was time for costumes.</p><p>\u201cYep, let\u2019s do that,\u201d Sloan said. But he looked sternly around the group. \u201cDon\u2019t be anywhere alone. Make sure you\u2019re on the street in a crowd or with someone else at all times. I\u2019m not making accusations\u2014I\u2019m just trying to get answers. And I don\u2019t want to find any more bodies.\u201d</p><p>Silence followed his words.</p><p>Those in the room exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Henri warned. \u201cDon\u2019t go getting suspicious of one another, please! An ensemble cast must work together. Sloan, see what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have to be careful, Henri. This group may be entirely innocent\u2014but this group is in danger. Someone put Sage McCormick\u2019s skull on that wig stand, and someone got into the basement and struck Jennie and Jane. And someone shot a stranger in the desert and slit Caleb Hough\u2019s throat and tried to kill his family. Everyone needs to be watchful. Someone in this town is a murderer.\u201d</p><p>They all looked at Sloan in silence as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be careful, Sloan,\u201d Valerie said in a small voice. \u201cHonestly.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s your lives,\u201d he reminded them. \u201cTake that very seriously.\u201d</p><p>Jane set her hand on his arm; he had gotten his point across.</p><p>Henri didn\u2019t seem happy. \u201cCome on, then. If you\u2019re going to be breathing down my neck, get into costume.\u201d He paused, glancing around. \u201cHas anybody seen our housekeeper, Elsie, come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s upstairs cleaning the rooms with one of the local girls,\u201d Valerie said.</p><p>\u201cValerie, run up and ask her to make sure Jennie\u2019s room is clean so the other agents can stay there,\u201d Henri told her. \u201cAlice, you come with me and Jane and the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want Brian and me doing?\u201d Cy asked.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and start entertaining the tourists as they show up on the streets.\u201d Henri looked over at Sloan. \u201cThey\u2019re allowed to do a little trick-riding, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrick-riding is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t think the horses are in on it!\u201d Henri said with a sniff.</p><p>That, at least, made them all smile\u2014even Sloan.</p><p>\u201cNo, Henri, I don\u2019t think the horses are in on it,\u201d he responded drily.</p><p>They rose to do as asked. Behind the stage in the dressing rooms, Henri selected clothing for Jane and Sloan to wear. Sloan just had to change into a period cotton shirt, jacket and plumed hat. Jane told them she\u2019d change into her new costume upstairs.</p><p>She ran ahead before any of them could protest. Up in her room\u2014or Sage\u2019s room\u2014she spoke out loud while she changed. \u201cWe could really use some more help here, Sage. Something was going on\u2014and you knew about it, didn\u2019t you? I wish there was a way you could tell me what you found out. Because people are dying again, Sage.\u201d</p><p>If Sage was there, she wasn\u2019t speaking at the moment.</p><p>Jane walked into the bathroom. As she brushed her hair and arranged it into a loose chignon, she wished she had time to take a shower; Sage seemed to like writing on the mirror.</p><p>She bent down as she dropped a bobby pin. When she looked into the mirror again, she seemed to have double vision\u2014and then realized that the ghost was standing right behind her.</p><p>Jane spun around. The apparition didn\u2019t disappear. Instead, she reached out as if she could touch Jane, and then her hand fell.</p><p>\u201cI know it can be hard, very hard, to appear and communicate. I also know you\u2019ve been here many years, and I\u2019m not sure why. Do you watch over your family or have you been waiting for this all these years\u2014someone killing people because of the past? I realize you\u2019d never hurt anyone, that you want to help people, but we need to know what you know,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>She thought of the different apparitions she\u2019d encountered, and she knew that some were present and never appeared, some were like mist...and some had become so experienced at showing themselves that they could cause a great deal more than cold drafts or whispers in the night.</p><p>\u201cSage, we really need your help,\u201d she said again.</p><p>The ghost seemed to step through her. Sage touched the mirror, but of course there was no steam. Jane quickly closed the door and ran the hot water in the sink, creating a vapor.</p><p>The ghost wrote, \u201cTrey Hardy.\u201d</p><p>It seemed to take all her effort. She wrote the name and faded away.</p><p>Trey Hardy, gunned down in his cell. Jane had to get to the Old Jail and into that cell.</p><p>Chet Morgan and Lamont Atkins were in town, in uniform, patrolling the streets on foot, making their presence known.</p><p>Sloan spoke with them both. They were worried, aware that Lily needed Silverfest even though the town had been plagued by murder.</p><p>\u201cBad days, Sloan, bad days,\u201d Lamont told him. \u201cBut we\u2019re watching everyone. And Newsome over at county has done his part. There are three officers, two men and a woman, keeping up with everything. So far, I\u2019m feeling like a tour director, but that\u2019s all right. No trouble happening here as I can see.\u201d</p><p>Sloan started into Desert Diamonds next, but the place was overflowing with people and every step he took drew another question from a tourist or someone wanting to pose with him. He went back to the street and called Grant Winston, asking him to come out for a chat.</p><p>Sloan leaned against the post by the Old Jail Bed and Breakfast, playing his part as Trey Hardy. He didn\u2019t mind being Hardy\u2014he actually felt a certain kinship with the man. But his main goal that day was to interview everyone in town about Caleb Hough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His call to Grant Winston had ruffled the man. He was extremely busy and delighted to be; these days let him stay open for the rest of the year. But Sloan was insistent, and Grant promised he\u2019d go over to the Old Jail as soon as he could get his staff functioning smoothly.</p><p>As he waited, Sloan watched people move along the street and he listened to their conversations.</p><p>Some talked about leaving Lily then and there, despite all the festivities planned for the day; the news services had carried information about the murders that had occurred in the desert. But someone in the party would usually argue that the murders had taken place out in the desert and in a mine shaft, and had nothing to do with anyone in Lily.</p> <p>\u201cDrug-related, obviously!\u201d one person said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not that far from the border! It\u2019s all about human trafficking!\u201d another woman suggested.</p><p>Then they would stop to chat with him.</p><p>People asked him about the outlaw Trey Hardy, and he played his part whenever they did, telling them he wasn\u2019t a bad sort at all. There were those who\u2019d profited by war and those who\u2019d been impoverished by it, and he just didn\u2019t think it was right for people to make money on war.</p><p>\u201cStill happening. It will always happen,\u201d a man said.</p> <p>He posed for pictures with kids, with young women and even the men\u2014many of whom were walking around with the replica Western gunslinger pistols they\u2019d bought at Desert Diamonds.</p><p>He studied every gun he saw that day.</p><p>As he\u2019d promised, Grant Winston came out of Desert Diamonds, wearing the kind of apron an old-fashioned shopkeeper would wear.</p><p>\u201cSloan, what the hell? It\u2019s the busiest day of the year!\u201d Grant was obviously flustered and annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI would have come to you,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk in the store!\u201d Grant protested.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I want to ask you about a dead man?\u201d</p><p>Grant\u2019s ruddy face grew even redder. \u201cCaleb Hough got himself murdered. I\u2019m surprised his wife didn\u2019t kill him long ago.\u201d</p><p>That was a common assertion. \u201cI heard you and Caleb had a big argument. Want to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>Grant Winston frowned and seemed truly perplexed. \u201cFirst off, the guy never came to my shop. The wife and kid did\u2014Zoe loves a cappuccino, and the kid came with all the other kids, bought pizza, looked through the magazines and books\u2014but Caleb Hough never darkened my door. Then all of a sudden about a month ago he comes in and asks about my history books. I showed him where they all were, although a numbskull could\u2019ve found them on his own. Then, about two weeks ago, he\u2019s back, telling me I\u2019m holding out, that I\u2019ve got books I\u2019m not selling. I told him I owned collectible books that no, I didn\u2019t sell. He wanted to see them. I said no. Then I come in one day and he\u2019s just let himself into my office in back and he\u2019s going through my private collection! I told him to get the hell out\u2014that everything I have has been republished over the years. He told me he\u2019d pay me some ridiculous sum of money for my collection and I said, \u2018No!\u2019 I collect books because I love them. He told me that if I had any sense, I\u2019d accept his offer or he\u2019d see that I wound up being closed down. I said he could take his money and stuff it where the sun don\u2019t shine and that I\u2019d take my chances. That was the last time I saw him. And if you think I\u2019d go crawl into a mine and kill someone because he was an idiot, you\u2019re crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat books did he buy?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cThe same books that stupid tourist did\u2014and that you took the other day. You had a worse argument with the bastard than I did, Sloan. You told your deputy to keep his kid in jail overnight. He exploded over that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Sloan asked. \u201cThought you hadn\u2019t seen him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him,\u201d Grant said, exasperated. \u201cThis is Lily\u2014you sneeze and everyone knows it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, Grant, thanks.\u201d Sloan paused. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to need to see your collectible books sometime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSloan, you can read through the night if you want. I have the original of the book Fogerty wrote after it all happened and he\u2019d retired, and I have some of the newspapers from the day, but I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get out of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either. But I appreciate the opportunity to go through them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Sloan. Whenever you want. Just so long as you don\u2019t stop me from working today. The place is hopping!\u201d</p><p>As Sloan let him get back to work, Mike Addison came outside, grinning.</p><p>It was bizarre that a local had been killed\u2014viciously murdered, his throat slashed\u2014and that no one in town seemed to mourn him.</p><p>But then, neither did his wife.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the smile for, Mike?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI just had some people check out of the B and B,\u201d Mike told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a good thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wife was all freaked out. She said she saw the ghost of Trey Hardy sitting in the chair by the bed when she woke up. She made her husband get them a room at the chain hotel down the highway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you want people staying in Trey Hardy\u2019s cell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but the more haunted the cell gets, the more I\u2019ll have people clamoring to stay there. The wife is some kind of big blogger. Now I\u2019ll have reservations for every night of the year!\u201d Mike said happily.</p><p>It was while he was talking to Mike that Sloan saw Jane walking on the raised sidewalk from the theater to the Old Jail. Her costume today was crimson, and the color of her hair and eyes seemed to be enhanced by the color. She looked more beautiful than ever; he wondered if the ghost of Sage was pleased. She waved and made her way over.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Mike murmured. \u201cWow. You know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Agent Jane Everett,\u201d Sloan said, realizing that Mike and Jane hadn\u2019t met.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a fed?\u201d he asked incredulously. \u201cOh, but she\u2019s an artist. She doesn\u2019t...I mean, she doesn\u2019t have a gun or anything like that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a very big gun,\u201d Sloan assured him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Jane said to them.</p><p>Sloan performed the introductions. Jane was pleasant as she met Mike, but then she glanced at Sloan, a silent question in her eyes. He shook his head slightly, letting her know he hadn\u2019t learned anything new.</p><p>\u201cMike is all excited. His guests ran out of the Trey Hardy room,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cDouble income!\u201d Mike said happily. \u201cAs soon as people hear, I\u2019ll have someone else in. Double income\u2014oh, yeah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t rent it out for tonight,\u201d Jane told him.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? This is a great thing for me. I can make double! The couple who left had paid ahead for the next few nights. I\u2019ll rent the room out again, and I\u2019ll be in good shape. That\u2019s a rule when renting here\u2014if you leave early, I keep the money!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it for the night,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>Mike looked at her in surprise. \u201cYou like ghosts, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you were staying at the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I am, but I\u2019m here for a bit longer. I\u2019d love to have the haunted Trey Hardy cell for a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, sure, but...\u201d He glanced at Sloan and then asked her, \u201cYou, uh, wouldn\u2019t shoot up the place or anything if you freaked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, Mike. I don\u2019t freak out,\u201d Jane assured him sweetly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve almost never had to shoot anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d feel kind of badly taking your money,\u201d he said next.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m here working. You\u2019ll be paying for it in a way, too. Your federal dollars at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, what the hell! The room is yours,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cMay I see it now?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Come on in!\u201d</p><p>Sloan looked at her curiously, and she smiled. \u201cI\u2019d love to get to know Trey Hardy,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>Mike opened the door. The three of them passed the old sheriff\u2019s desk\u2014the check-in area\u2014and the deputy\u2019s desk, where the concierge sat; it was empty at the moment. Sloan saw that the \u201cconcierge\u201d was busy serving breakfast to a number of guests in the old gun room. He watched the way Jane studied the place as they entered. She commented to Mike on what a great job he\u2019d done turning it from an old jail into a bed-and-breakfast, while keeping its historic integrity.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, really. I mean, I\u2019ve made some improvements, but the guy I bought it from had all the ideas. I\u2019ve made a point of improving the bathrooms, though!\u201d Mike said. \u201cGuests these days expect that.\u201d</p><p>They went through the barred wooden door that led to the rows of cells, which were now guest rooms. \u201cThere it is!\u201d Mike told her proudly. \u201cThe Trey Hardy room. Right where Aaron Munson gunned down the poor guy. Take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Jane walked into the room and slowly looked around. There was a towel on the floor and the bed needed to be made. A water glass was knocked over\u2014it seemed evident that the last guests had departed quickly.</p><p>\u201cIt needs to be cleaned, of course,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t be going to bed for hours.\u201d Jane dug into her crimson velvet wristlet\u2014a perfect match for her costume\u2014and produced a credit card. \u201cWould you please charge me now? I don\u2019t want to lose the room, knowing how popular it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for you!\u201d Mike said, and Jane smiled pleasantly.</p><p>After the arrangements had been made, Sloan walked Jane down the street. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d he asked as they posed together by an old watering trough for the pleasure of a few tourists.</p><p>\u201cSage wrote \u2018Trey Hardy\u2019 on the mirror. I thought we\u2019d have to wait until this whole Silverfest thing was over to get in there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sloan was silent. She spoke so naturally to him, and he wondered what it was like to be comfortable with seeing things that others didn\u2019t. He\u2019d wondered far too often himself if he wasn\u2019t crazy, if Longman wasn\u2019t a being his mind had invented, a sort of device to help him figure things out.</p><p>\u201cTrey Hardy was dead before the stagecoach disappeared,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cBut...there\u2019s something connected to this that has to do with him. I\u2019m positive. Sloan\u2014\u201d Jane stopped to smile and say, \u201cA pleasure!\u201d to the people thanking them for posing. \u201cSo, have you spoken with Grant Winston?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the fight about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant\u2019s collection of rare books. He caught Caleb Hough in his office. Hough told him he\u2019d ruin him if he didn\u2019t sell him his own books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. But is that a motive for murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m more concerned with what Caleb was looking for. I\u2019m going to get back into Grant\u2019s office before the end of the day,\u201d he said.</p> <p>His cell phone rang as they walked, and he answered immediately. It was Liam Newsome.</p><p>\u201cMy officer just called from the hospital,\u201d Liam said. \u201cSeems there was a woman in some kind of period costume there. She was bringing a basket of food to Zoe and Jimmy Hough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know. When he stopped her in the hallway, she took off. He couldn\u2019t go after her and still guard his patients, so he called to tell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Liam,\u201d Sloan said, and hung up. \u201cI\u2019m going to borrow a horse from the stables and ride out to the hospital. With all the traffic, not to mention the street closures, that\u2019ll be the fastest.\u201d</p><p>Jane had heard the conversation. \u201cThat woman\u2014it could be anyone, Sloan. Could genuinely be a friend. Half the people here are in costume, or wearing old hats and skirts. She could be heading the other way now, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd she could be heading this way,\u201d he said. He hesitated, then suddenly took her by the shoulders. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. And Logan and Kelsey are due soon,\u201d she added.</p><p>He started to walk off, but then turned around. \u201cNo basements!\u201d he warned her.</p><p>\u201cNot unless someone screams blue blazes and I\u2019ll be ready if that happens,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cJane\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get backup, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>He left her on the street and hurried over to the stables. Heidi was just getting a group mounted for the trail ride to the Apache village.</p><p>\u201cI need a horse,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cSure, Sloan, but why? Your horses are better than anything we have in our hack line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the hospital and I\u2019d rather take a horse than a car right now. Don\u2019t want to waste time going back to my place.\u201d</p><p>Heidi looked at him wide-eyed. Her eyes brimmed with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s about Jimmy, isn\u2019t it? Is he all right? I should\u2019ve known when he didn\u2019t show up yesterday that something was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJimmy is doing well, Heidi. Now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake Bullet. He\u2019s saddled and he has some spunk in him,\u201d Heidi said.</p><p>Sloan mounted the horse and rode out of the stables.</p><p>He heard a loud cheering and realized people thought that he was part of the festivities. He tilted his hat to them\u2014and set out on the road that led from Main Street to the hospital.</p><p>He took the trail at an easy lope until he was a good mile past all the hoopla. Then he slowed Bullet and moved to the side of the road, watching for cars.</p><p>People were driving slowly, even this far from town. He was glad to see it; they needed to be careful with the number of people moving around on foot.</p><p>A car carrying what appeared to be parents and three children passed him, followed by a car with three young women. He lifted his hat to them all. They waved in return.</p><p>More parents, more kids, went by. More young people.</p><p>And then he saw the car he was waiting for.</p><p>A young woman was driving. She wore a prairie bonnet.</p><p>She frowned, concentrated on her driving, clearly irritated that she had to slow for a van filled with schoolchildren.</p><p>Sloan moved Bullet back onto the road, behind the van and in front of the car.</p><p>The driver looked up and saw him. For a moment, he thought he saw surprise and dismay on her face.</p><p>Then it was gone.</p><p>For a frightening few seconds, he was afraid she was going to hit the gas and try to run him over.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. She smiled. \u201cSloan! What are you doing out here? Oh, my God\u2014nothing else happened, did it?\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>At one o\u2019clock, Cy Tyburn and Brian Highsmith dazzled the crowd with feats of derring-do on horseback.</p><p>They rode at each other almost as if they were jousting; they were supposed to have ridden with reins between their teeth, guns blazing, but Sloan had outlawed the use of weapons.</p><p>Cy stood in his saddle and leaped for Brian. The two flew from their horses and staged a brawl right between the theater and the saloon. Jane watched the action anxiously, but they put on a good show and when it ended\u2014with both of them \u201cdead\u201d on the street\u2014they leaped to their feet and took a bow.</p><p>Jane applauded with the others.</p><p>After that, she slipped into Desert Diamonds and found Grant Winston, whom she hadn\u2019t officially met. He seemed harried and harassed, but he was cordial to her, and he offered her a chance to look through the books in his office.</p><p>\u201cTerrible thing about Caleb, but...not totally unexpected. Okay, well, his throat slit in the old mine\u2014that was unexpected. This is Arizona, and a lot of people carry weapons. Me, I keep a shotgun behind the main checkout counter. He pissed me off so much I might have shot him if I actually carried a weapon. I\u2019m sorry. I know I sound terrible. But you won\u2019t find many people here who are crying over the man,\u201d he told her. \u201cGo into my office, Agent Everett. I told Sheriff Trent he was welcome back there anytime.\u201d He suddenly frowned at her. \u201cWait. I thought you were an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He still seemed confused. \u201cWell, make yourself at home. I can\u2019t help you, I\u2019m afraid. Busy, busy, busy. And, of course, you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that the items you\u2019re letting me see are the real thing\u2014collectible and priceless. I\u2019ll be very careful with anything I touch,\u201d Jane promised.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cCappuccino? Espresso?\u201d he offered.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks. And I wouldn\u2019t risk spilling anything.\u201d</p><p>That pleased him. She wondered if the offer had been a test.</p><p>He walked her past rows of pamphlets and souvenirs to his office. It was a large room with a plush swivel chair behind the desk, which held memo boxes on one corner, plus a computer and printer. Behind the desk and along both sidewalls were rows and rows of books carefully placed in glass-covered wooden shelves. \u201cBehind the desk\u2014that whole shelf is on Arizona history and Lily.\u201d</p><p>When the door closed behind him, she turned to look at the shelves. She saw the original of the republished book she\u2019d been reading by Brendan Fogerty.</p><p>Carefully, she removed it from the shelf and sat behind the desk. The book was in excellent shape for its age. She was surprised that the original had a dedication she hadn\u2019t seen in the replica edition.</p><p>\u201cTo Sage, wherever in this world or the next she may be.\u201d</p><p>Apparently Brendan Fogerty had thought it possible that Sage was dead.</p><p>But who had killed her? Not her husband. First, he\u2019d been in the bar waiting for her when she\u2019d gone to her room. And then, it was unlikely that he could have gotten away with burying her in a dressing room. Or had she been buried elsewhere first? Jane could only imagine that even in the Old West, the smell of a decomposing body would have alerted someone to Sage McCormick\u2019s presence under the floor.</p><p>A man named Eamon McNulty had been owner, manager and artistic director of the theater back then. His actors had been more transient; only Sage had won so many hearts that she was hired to play role after role.</p><p>Jane kept flipping pages.</p><p>Most of what she read she\u2019d already seen.</p><p>A \u201crancher\u201d named Tod Green had been in town for several weeks before the deaths of Hardy and Munson and the disappearance of Sage, Red Marston and the stagecoach. Fogerty stated that he\u2019d been suspicious of the rancher, since no one had known him until he started moving cattle. He\u2019d checked with friends in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and other states, but the man had no background that he could discover. Fogerty openly voiced his dislike and suspicion of Green as far as the robbery went, while saying at the same time that he had no proof against him. Nor would he ever learn anything\u2014because Tod Green had died in the streets just days after the stagecoach had disappeared. He\u2019d been staying at the Gilded Lily and gotten into a huge dispute with Eamon McNulty; the two had taken it to the streets and Green had died in the dirt, shot to death by McNulty.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she murmured to herself, \u201cif Fogerty was right, Tod Green took down the stagecoach, murdered everyone and hid the gold. Where?\u201d</p><p>She turned another page. As she did, a fragile piece of old paper fell out. The ink was barely legible. \u201c\u2018I will see that he is brought to justice. My word to you, old friend,\u2019\u201d Jane managed to make out. Her fingers trembled slightly. The writing was full of flourishes and very pretty\u2014a woman\u2019s hand, she thought.</p><p>Sage McCormick\u2019s?</p><p>She pondered whether that could be the case when there was a tap on the door. Before she could answer, it opened. Heidi was there. \u201cAgent Everett, I\u2019ve found your friends!\u201d she said happily.</p><p>Jane quickly stood, closing the book.</p><p>Kelsey O\u2019Brien and Logan Raintree entered the room behind Heidi.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Jane said, stepping around to greet them both.</p><p>Of her Krewe, Jane knew Logan the best. They had often worked together in Texas when he\u2019d been a Ranger and she\u2019d been called in to do facial reconstructions. He was the perfect Texas Ranger, steady and strong, simply there to do what he was called upon to do. He always used reason and negotiation before brawn and bullets. He\u2019d had a horrible time when his wife was murdered, but a couple of years had gone by and during the San Antonio case, when they\u2019d all been brought together, he\u2019d been paired with Kelsey O\u2019Brien\u2014a U.S. Marshal back then. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kelsey had known that she wanted to be in law enforcement all her life. Despite the fact that she\u2019d already been a Marshal, she\u2019d had to go through the academy at Quantico to become part of the Krewe.</p><p>She\u2019d been tougher than Jane from the get-go, but she\u2019d taught her a great deal about inner strength; Jane thought she\u2019d gained a great deal of her own confidence with Kelsey\u2019s help. Jane was also proud of being a very good shot\u2014if not quite as good as those in their Krewe who\u2019d been practicing at the range much longer.</p><p>She was grateful to have them here. She\u2019d never worked any case without at least another few members of her Krewe before. It had just been days, of course, since she\u2019d left them, but it felt like a lifetime.</p> <p>Then again, she\u2019d only come here to do a facial reconstruction.</p><p>\u201cLily is pretty interesting,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been anywhere quite like this. And may I say that you\u2019ve, uh, managed to fit right in?\u201d</p><p>Jane remembered that she was in period attire and grimaced. \u201cJust being part of the theater crowd.\u201d She turned to Heidi. \u201cThanks for finding Logan and Kelsey and bringing them here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Heidi smiled. \u201cWell, back to the grind. We\u2019re all doing double shifts today\u2014so many people in town. I would\u2019ve thought...well, that these events would\u2019ve scared off more people. I mean, after I found that old corpse out by the Apache village...\u201d She gave an elaborate shudder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re safe with your trail rides, Heidi,\u201d Logan told her.</p> <p>\u201cWith another guide and parties of up to fifteen...yeah, I hope so,\u201d Heidi said. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p><p>They all said goodbye. \u201cYou\u2019ve found something?\u201d Logan asked Jane.</p><p>She confirmed that the door was closed and then showed them the note. \u201cIt\u2019s not addressed to anyone, but I believe it might be from Sage\u2014written to Trey Hardy.\u201d She glanced at Kelsey. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to keep Logan up on what\u2019s going on\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kelsey nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s filled us in on what he knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was honestly surprised that Sloan was okay with bringing you in. But as we\u2019ve discussed, he doesn\u2019t seem to entirely trust his own people. Logan suggested he\u2019s afraid that one of his deputies might have\u2014inadvertently or not\u2014shared information. There\u2019s also the possibility that someone in town instigated whatever it is going on, and I suppose it could be over the gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, that shipment was about a hundred pounds of mined gold, but at about fifty dollars a gram...someone could consider it enough to kill for. But we\u2019re talking about millions today. Trey Hardy was dead before the gold was stolen, so what would Sage have meant by this\u2014if she was writing to Hardy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI just don\u2019t. Trey Hardy might have suspected something about what was going to happen. And even though he wasn\u2019t a killer, he might have been condemned to death once he stood before the circuit court. He was a gentleman outlaw, so he might\u2019ve been ready to tell what he knew, to see that people weren\u2019t killed.\u201d</p><p>Logan remarked, \u201cMaybe Hardy\u2019s legend made too much of him being a good guy. Jesse James, for instance, comes out looking like Robin Hood, but if you were the one being robbed by him it probably wasn\u2019t so great.\u201d</p><p>Jane shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I want to think of Hardy as being a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, legends are based on real men and women, and none of us is all saint or sinner. I\u2019ll leave you two to your reading. I\u2019m going to go into the county station and see if they can give us anything from forensics. I\u2019ll keep in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere should I start?\u201d Kelsey asked Jane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep going with this. Why don\u2019t you go through the old newspaper clippings and see if there\u2019s anything new you can discover.\u201d</p><p>Valerie Mystro stood by the car staring at Sloan. She appeared completely bewildered. She batted her lashes and played the betrayed heroine to the hilt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re here, Sloan, why you\u2019d be waiting for someone who simply wanted to be friendly and bring a basket of goodies to the hospital. Everything that\u2019s happened is terrible, but your fixation on the theater is ridiculous! Yes, I went to the hospital. Jimmy Hough was a nice kid, although Caleb was obnoxious to everyone\u2014insulting Alice and me when he wasn\u2019t trying to pick us up or bribe us to have sex. I thought I was doing something good!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cValerie, this is one of the two busiest days of the year for the theater\u2014but you had time to drive out to the hospital?\u201d Sloan demanded.</p><p>\u201cI felt bad! Caleb was murdered\u2014and those two almost died, as well. Give me a little credit here, will you? Sloan, you think it all has to do with the theater because of the skull. Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019m the one who found the skull and was nearly scared out of ten years by it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stay at the hospital?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cThe guard frightened me! I was just going to drop off the basket, ask Jimmy and his mom how they were doing and rush back before anyone knew I was gone. But the way he barked at me and asked what I was doing\u2014well, I just turned around and left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see the basket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a search warrant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to let me see the basket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, you can see the basket\u2014if you ask nicely. I watch TV. I know I could make you get a search warrant!\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cAll right, all right!\u201d</p><p>She leaned into the driver\u2019s window to lift the basket off the passenger seat. It was a little straw basket with a bow and a card that said \u201cFeel Better Soon.\u201d She handed it to Sloan; he went through the contents and found cookies and candy.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to admit it, but he felt a little foolish as he handed it back. \u201cValerie, I\u2019m sorry. But it looks suspicious for you to leave when you\u2019re supposed to be playing your role for the town, and more suspicious when you run out because a guard wants to know who you are and what you\u2019re doing when you\u2019re visiting people who barely escaped attempted murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSloan, I was just trying to be friendly, like I said. And,\u201d she added, \u201ceven though he was a total prick\u2014and probably because it looked good\u2014Caleb Hough donated to the Theater Restoration Fund. I wanted to make sure his wife continued to do so.\u201d</p><p>Sloan was silent for a minute.</p><p>\u201cSloan, please\u2014can I get back to town before they notice I\u2019m gone?\u201d</p><p>He walked away from the car. \u201cOkay. But do me a favor. Be a friend by not going anywhere near the Hough family right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being paranoid, and you need to be out there finding out who really did this, not persecuting good citizens!\u201d Valerie said angrily.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I\u2019m trying,\u201d he said as he turned away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m learning about gold mining. It wasn\u2019t found on the surface or in the streams here. It was an accidental discovery when they were expecting to find silver. But once they came across the gold vein, they created a processing station right by the mine, and they used fire and chemicals to melt the gold and mold it into bars. While the gold was being processed, it was protected by Pinkerton guards,\u201d Kelsey told Jane.</p><p>Jane looked up at her and smiled. \u201cI\u2019d wondered about that. I mean, I know it wasn\u2019t going to be like a pirate cache of gold coins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but they were pretty sophisticated. So, the gold would have been formed into bars before shipping and it would\u2019ve been relatively small in bulk, and thus easy to carry on a stagecoach. There were guards the whole time it was loaded. And there were actually two armed guards on board, and the driver was armed, as well. I sincerely doubt that one person could have been responsible. And then the dead men had to be buried, the stagecoach dismantled and made to \u2018disappear\u2019 and the gold hidden somewhere. It was a pretty complex operation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne they must have been planning for a long time,\u201d Jane agreed. \u201cTwo guards and an armed driver. So, maybe a party of three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd someone in the know,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cOnly someone working for the mine, someone involved in its administration, would be aware of exactly when the gold was due to leave the mine.\u201d</p><p>Jane glanced down at her book. \u201cWell, this is like looking for a needle in a haystack. It could have been almost anyone living in the area at the time except...\u201d She paused. \u201cThe administrators at the mine would have known\u2014but local enforcement must have known, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I imagine they would alert the sheriff\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jane said, thinking it out as she spoke, still and staring down at the pages in front of her. \u201cWe know that Hardy was shot before the stagecoach was attacked. What if Hardy suspected something concerning the sheriff and the deputy\u2014something he\u2019d picked up in jail because he could hear them when they talked? So Aaron Munson was afraid Hardy would blow the whistle on them before they got the gold. He went in and shot Hardy\u2014never imagining that the townspeople would react so violently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s possible. But it would mean Munson was dead when the stagecoach was robbed\u2014and disappeared from the face of the earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not Fogerty!\u201d Jane said. \u201cHis book points at a man named Tod Green, a man claiming to be a rancher, who was in town at the time. A guy called Eamon McNulty was the director at the theater. McNulty and Green got into a huge argument and they had a duel in the street. Green died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to McNulty?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t found another reference to him, other than the fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, say the sheriff, his deputy and McNulty were in on it together. They set this Tod Green guy up to take the fall. Munson was lynched before the robbery, so he was no longer a player. But Hardy suspected what was going on and he told Sage McCormick about it. Sage disappears. We\u2019re virtually certain she was murdered because her body was found in the theater.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen there\u2019s Red Marston, who disappeared the same night as Sage,\u201d Jane said. \u201cHe might have been part of the conspiracy. People thought Sage ran off with Red Marston, but if Fogerty was involved, the rumor makes sense\u2014Fogerty is the one who implied that Sage had gone off with Red. So, let\u2019s say Red was part of this, and he did care for Sage. Maybe he didn\u2019t want her killed, and because he wouldn\u2019t take part in the murder, he had to go, too.\u201d Jane wrinkled her nose. \u201cThis is getting really complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d Kelsey frowned. \u201cBut if Fogerty and McNulty came out of it alive, why didn\u2019t they take the gold and get out of town when it all blew over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. That is a dilemma. And I doubt Fogerty admitted anything in a book he wrote himself,\u201d Jane said.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I wonder about Eamon McNulty, though.\u201d Kelsey pulled out her phone. \u201cI\u2019ll look for him on Google.\u201d</p><p>Jane waited, watching her.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Eamon McNulty, renowned actor, director, theater manager,\u2019\u201d Kelsey read. \u201c\u2018Born April 2, 1833, in New York City, New York, died June 4, 1873, Lily, Arizona, of a suspected aneurysm.\u2019\u201d Kelsey looked up at Jane. \u201cIt goes on to talk about his start as a poor Irish kid working in the bawdy houses of Five Points, getting a leg up in legitimate theater, staging some of the hits of the day. After critical success and financial failure, he accepted a request to manage the infamous Gilded Lily, in Lily, Arizona, where he brought in artists like Sage McCormick and Daniel Easton, known for their brilliance on the stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if McNulty was the one who stashed the gold\u2014maybe lying about where it was or keeping it a secret. And then he up and dies of natural causes!\u201d Jane said. \u201cThat would mean Fogerty had to spend the rest of his life looking for the gold. But since he didn\u2019t find it\u2014and he\u2019d gotten rid of all witnesses\u2014he wrote a book!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that? Although he wasn\u2019t a half-bad writer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess he wanted his version of Lily\u2019s history to be the one future generations accepted as truth,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cBut how does that affect what\u2019s happening now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else knows what we know. And they\u2019re determined to find the gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, they must have some idea of where it might be. Hidden in the old shaft of the silver mine where Caleb Hough was killed?\u201d Kelsey suggested.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But I still don\u2019t understand why Sage McCormick\u2019s skull was found on a wig stand, and why the body of an old-timer was dug up to point the way to Jay Berman\u2019s corpse,\u201d Jane said. \u201cUnless, of course...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless it\u2019s a warning to all the players to stay with the program,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Jay Berman somehow became a liability, just as Caleb Hough did. Whoever killed them thinks Jimmy and his mom knew what was going on, that Caleb let something slip,\u201d Jane said. \u201cSomeone\u2019s pulling the strings here. We know that at least two people, one of them a woman, are involved, because two people put Jimmy and Zoe Hough in the car in the garage and left them to die. Jennie was attacked in the basement. I was, too. Someone attempted to kill either Cy Tyburn or Brian Highsmith around the same time as Jennie was hurt. And the skull was found in the theater. Two things\u2014the theater has to be implicated in some way...or someone\u2019s going to a lot of effort to suggest it is. And, second, I think we\u2019re looking at something similar to what happened all those years ago. There are partners in this, and a few of them are warning the others\u2014or killing those they\u2019re afraid might be on to something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the ghosts aren\u2019t talking?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cSage...leaves messages. I\u2019ve yet to meet Trey Hardy, but I\u2019m hoping to make his acquaintance this evening.\u201d</p><p>Sloan had just gotten Bullet back to the stables and was dismounting when Logan called him. He was glad to hear his old crime-fighting partner\u2019s voice, glad he was in town.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the morgue,\u201d Logan told him. \u201cWith Liam Newsome. He\u2019s brought me up to speed. We\u2019re expecting some lab reports any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are Kelsey and Jane?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cReading at Desert Diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should be safe enough there,\u201d Sloan murmured.</p><p>As he spoke, Heidi came up to him. \u201cI\u2019ll take Bullet, Sloan, unless you still need him.\u201d</p> <p>He gave Heidi a quick smile, handing her the reins. He realized Logan was silent at the other end.</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here. They\u2019re both good at what they do,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut I found Jane with a concussion down in the basement of the theater. We\u2019re lucky our killer didn\u2019t finish her off. Or Jennie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need to have faith in Jane. This is what she does. Trust in her training,\u201d Logan said. \u201cYou, me\u2014anyone out there\u2014can be taken by surprise, especially when we\u2019re not on alert.\u201d</p><p>That was true; he\u2019d seen massive sharpshooter cops brought down by junkies because they weren\u2019t prepared to be attacked, because they were trying to help.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re right,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cI\u2019ll stop in and see what they\u2019re doing and then head over to join you,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got men in town, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth my day guys, and the county has men in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Newsome told me. See you when you get here.\u201d</p><p>Sloan walked over to Desert Diamonds. Seated on a fake boulder in front of the theater, Brian Highsmith was regaling the crowd with the story of Lily, proudly boasting that the Gilded Lily was older than Tombstone\u2019s Birdcage.</p><p>Alice Horton was beside him, dressed in full vamp attire, handing out fliers.</p><p>Sloan walked on, to the store. There were long lines at the pizzeria and the coffee bar. People were shopping, spending money\u2014everything was going as it should.</p><p>He passed Grant Winston, who was at one of the counters, cheerfully instructing a cashier to return a man\u2019s money; the man had purchased the same book twice. Grant saw him and smiled, then motioned toward his office. Sloan nodded.</p><p>He entered the office. Jane was standing with a tall, pretty woman whose reddish blond hair was tied back in a ponytail. They were going through a book slowly, page by page.</p><p>She looked up at Sloan. \u201cWell?\u201d she asked. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie Mystro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie? What reason did she give?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes Jimmy and Zoe Hough. She brought cookies and candy. And Caleb Hough donated to the theater. Apparently, she wants to make sure his wife likes theater, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believed her?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what else happens. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she said with excitement. \u201cWe think we\u2019ve got it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who killed Jay Berman and Caleb Hough?\u201d he asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her smile fading. \u201cBut I think we\u2019ve figured out the past. Brendan Fogerty wasn\u2019t such a good guy\u2014and he fooled the world with his book. He was in on the stagecoach robbery with his deputy, Aaron Munson, and the theater manager, Eamon McNulty. But Hardy heard them talking\u2014and that\u2019s why Munson shot him in his cell. He hadn\u2019t expected the mob to go crazy and lynch him. Oh, and I forgot about Red Marston. I guess he was in on it, too. Sage must have found out from him or her friend, Trey Hardy. We think she was killed because she was trying to find a way out of town so she could tell the truth. She couldn\u2019t go to the law in Lily, because the law was involved. Marston cared about her and wanted to protect her, which meant Fogerty and McNulty had to kill him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they get out with the gold?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause McNulty dropped dead of an aneurysm\u2014and he\u2019d either been the one to stash the gold or he\u2019d moved it, not trusting his partners!\u201d Kelsey said. She flushed, offering him her hand. \u201cHi, Sheriff, I\u2019m sorry. We haven\u2019t met. Kelsey O\u2019Brien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to meet you,\u201d Sloan said. She had clear eyes, a steady handshake and a lovely manner. He hid a smile; he\u2019d expected no less from the woman who had finally lifted Logan Raintree from his pain. \u201cAnd glad to have you here. Logan is at county, getting lab reports from Newsome. I\u2019m going to drive over and see what he has.\u201d</p><p>Jane nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to suck up to Grant Winston and beg him to let me borrow this book for the night. Then I\u2019ll acquaint Kelsey with the theater, and be Sage again for a while until we hear back from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on each other,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. We\u2019ve been doing that for a long time,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>He nodded and left them.</p><p>On the street, Henri was giving a history lesson on the theater with each of his cast members popping up to illustrate a different character. People thronged around them. Others stood just outside the saloon, some of the men with plastic cups of beer raised high as they leaned against the sidewalk support posts, like old-time cowboys.</p><p>The drive took him about forty-five minutes. As he neared his destination, he received a call from Logan telling him they\u2019d meet at the morgue. He arrived at a lab and offices that made his little place look like a ma-and-pa operation. But he was grateful that he had the county for backup; it was impossible to have the manpower and technical and forensic support in a town as small as Lily.</p><p>A receptionist met him and instructed him to follow a hallway. In an outer room, a man who introduced himself as Dr. Madsen\u2019s assistant gave him a paper lab suit and mask, and he entered the room.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Trent, just in time,\u201d Madsen said.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear that, Doctor,\u201d Sloan said, nodding to Logan and Newsome.</p><p>\u201cI was explaining to Agent Raintree and Detective Newsome that because of the way the throat was sliced, I believe the killer was right-handed and that the knife used was about six inches long and two inches wide.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomething like a Bowie knife?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, something like that. I\u2019d also say the killer came up behind his back, grabbed him around the chest and attacked immediately\u2014he didn\u2019t have time to fight back.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThere are no defensive wounds on the man anywhere. It must\u2019ve been a lightning-bolt attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy someone Caleb didn\u2019t think would kill him,\u201d Logan said.</p> <p>\u201cProbably. If I understand the circumstances correctly, whoever was in the mine shaft with him had to be known to him. You don\u2019t just walk into a place like that. You crawl in through an area the size of a two-by-four boulder. Is that about right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Sloan agreed.</p><p>\u201cCan you say anything more about the blade?\u201d Newsome asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was very sharp. And jagged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about any trace evidence on him?\u201d Logan asked.</p> <p>\u201cJust the sand and dirt you\u2019d expect from the mine shaft,\u201d Madsen said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about our other dead man? Jay Berman?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was kneeling. There were powder burns, so he was shot point-blank,\u201d Madsen said. \u201cThe bullet fragmented and the lab\u2019s still piecing it together. You found no shell casings, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Newsome glanced at Logan. \u201cMy people went over the tepee with a fine-tooth comb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would a man kneel down to be executed? Why wouldn\u2019t he fight?\u201d Madsen wondered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he believed he\u2019d be let up\u2014that he was just being taught a lesson or...well, people go on hoping while they\u2019re still breathing,\u201d Logan said.</p> <p>\u201cOne more thing. Both of our victims ate not more than two hours before they were killed,\u201d Dr. Madsen said. \u201cMr. Berman had nachos and beer. Mr. Hough dined on steak, potatoes, spinach and wine. Oh, and Mr. Berman was suffering from liver disease, while Mr. Hough had an artery that was almost completely blocked. I suspect he would\u2019ve suffered a massive heart attack within a week. His killer really needn\u2019t have bothered.\u201d</p><p>They left the morgue soon after and spoke on the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cYou feel my men are doing well by you in Lily?\u201d Newsome asked Sloan.</p><p>\u201cYes. Other than the murders and the attempted murders, we\u2019ve had remarkably little trouble during Silverfest,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cThanks, Liam\u2014I needed your help.\u201d</p><p>Newsome nodded, looking at Logan. \u201cAre the feds taking over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re just here to lend assistance,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Newsome smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not resentful, Agent Raintree. If you decide you can better manage the investigation, feel free. This one has me grasping at threads, and I\u2019m sure Sheriff Trent feels the same way. We\u2019ve got nothing on Berman. We can\u2019t get anything other than that he was down here on vacation. He didn\u2019t have a home phone, and we couldn\u2019t find any connection to anyone in Arizona on his cell. What he became involved in\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything, either,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cBut the angle we\u2019re working is that someone\u2019s after old gold.\u201d</p> <p>Newsome frowned. \u201cOld gold? You mean from the stagecoach that disappeared over a hundred years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Interesting,\u201d Newsome said. \u201cBy the way, the skull of that old corpse you found in the desert has been brought to your station. Maybe your artist can work with it. If you find out it was one of the old stage robbers, maybe you are on to something.\u201d He sighed. \u201cExcept that no one knew who they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect Red Marston might have been in on it,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cIf it proves to be him, we just might be on the right track.\u201d</p><p>Newsome removed his glasses and studied Sloan. \u201cSo...that would mean one of the citizens of your fair town is involved. What tourist would have the connections and the know-how to research what happened in the past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I figure I\u2019ve got a local involved. Has to be. Jimmy and Zoe Hough were attacked by people who obviously knew the house, knew the distance from the stables and barns and knew the family. They were familiar with the garage. So, that\u2019s why I\u2019m really grateful for county help.\u201d</p><p>Newsome frowned. \u201cYou think one of your own deputies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sloan broke in. \u201cOr, at least, I couldn\u2019t begin to point a finger at any one of them. And it could be a question of talking to the wrong person, of being careless. But don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust anyone,\u201d Newsome finished. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a given in law enforcement sometimes, isn\u2019t it? Sad, but true,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, we got DNA off your bottle. The bottle from the mine shaft. But there aren\u2019t any matches in the system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if we know who to get DNA from, we could have a match, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. However, that only proves a particular person was in the mine shaft at some time. I don\u2019t think you can prove murder with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Liam, I just need a solid suspect!\u201d Sloan told him.</p><p>\u201cIf you can get me DNA\u2014the right DNA\u2014I can get you a suspect.\u201d</p><p>They parted ways. When Newsome was gone, Sloan turned to Logan.</p><p>They\u2019d been excellent coworkers from the start. While Logan carried all the traits of his Native American ancestry and Sloan didn\u2019t, they still shared something of that past. They\u2019d also quickly realized that they both worked on instinct.</p><p>And heard voices.</p><p>Sloan smiled slowly. \u201cGood to see you, old friend,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish it were under different circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. I\u2019m not here to take over. I\u2019m here for support. What\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about stealing a few glasses, cups, mugs, tissues\u2014whatever we can find?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Gilded Lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ve gotten accustomed to living back east. I\u2019m feeling mighty parched. I could go for a beer,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Sloan seconded.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d</p><p>Jane headed out to the street with Kelsey following. She\u2019d barely reached the sidewalk when she heard Brian Highsmith call out with a deep Western twang, \u201cThere she is! There\u2019s my girl now!\u201d</p><p>Brian jumped down from the \u201cboulder\u201d that had been set up for performances and came striding toward her. \u201cLadies and gentlemen!\u201d he said, taking her hand, \u201cI give you the esteemed, the one and only, indeed, the adored Sage McCormick! I was madly in love with the lady\u2014I adored her from afar, of course, because she was already married! But while I might have been a bad man in the eyes of some, a low-down no-account drifter of a horse thief and an outlaw, I did indeed adore her. Now, once upon a time,\u201d he said drily, winking as he looked down at Jane, \u201cpeople thought Sage had given in to me and that we\u2019d run away together. But alas!\u201d</p><p>He played to the crowd, raising his hand. \u201cBut what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAlas!\u201d the crowd cried.</p><p>\u201cAlas, we have recently discovered the bones of the beautiful Sage McCormick right in the Gilded Lily. We now know the actress was killed and that she didn\u2019t run off with Red. But that was then\u2014and thanks to the wonders of Silverfest and these costumes, here we are again! Together at long last!\u201d</p><p>He bent down as if he was going to kiss her. Jane quickly stepped forward, addressing the crowd. \u201cYes, together again, but just as friends! Sage cared about Marston. He, like Trey Hardy, was one of those outlaws who still had a sense of morality. Trey Hardy was never a killer. Sage believed that Red Marston would happily steal your horse, but he wouldn\u2019t kill you for it. Sage was in love with her husband and she loved her child, but I don\u2019t think she realized when she married him that her first love would always be the theater. Ah, the theater! Please make sure you have your reservations for the Gilded Lily this evening, and if they sell out, do come by tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell done, Agent Everett. You are a woman of many surprises,\u201d Brian said.</p><p>\u201cYes, well...I wouldn\u2019t have put on the costume if I hadn\u2019t been willing to play the part. And I wouldn\u2019t have a badge if I wasn\u2019t willing to enforce the law,\u201d she added sweetly.</p><p>She started to turn to Kelsey but as she did, she caught sight of someone standing alone in the street, right in front of the Old Jail.</p><p>For a minute, she thought that Sloan had returned.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Sloan; this man\u2019s hair was longer and his jawline was stubbled. He looked at her and beckoned, then walked into the Old Jail.</p><p>For a moment she stood there, puzzled, but suspecting she knew who it was.</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>She turned again, distracted. \u201cUm, let\u2019s go see my room. I\u2019m at the Old Jail for tonight, the Trey Hardy cell.\u201d</p><p>They hurried toward the Old Jail.</p><p>She was right. She\u2019d seen Hardy.</p><p>He slipped through the closed door, disappearing as she wedged her way through the crowd to reach it.</p><p>12</p><p>Sloan and Logan made their way through the crowds on the street to the Gilded Lily. When they arrived, Valerie was perched on a bar stool singing a Civil War ballad to an appreciative audience of drinkers.</p><p>Liz came up to him. \u201cSloan, want me to get you a table? Hello,\u201d she said, smiling at Logan.</p><p>\u201cA table would be great, but it doesn\u2019t look like you have any,\u201d Sloan replied.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute. I know how to squeeze people.\u201d</p><p>She did; Liz managed to get one couple to join another, freeing up a table. Sloan thanked her and introduced her to Logan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re FBI, too?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe works with Jane,\u201d Sloan told her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. We\u2019re glad you\u2019re here.\u201d Liz bent low to the table as if listening closely to get their orders.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI hope we can be of some help.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you will be\u2014and just having more officers around...well, that\u2019s good.\u201d Liz shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to quit, but I don\u2019t feel great when I come into work anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anything else happened?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cBesides Jennie being attacked and still in a coma?\u201d Liz responded. \u201cAnd someone digging up Sage McCormick\u2019s skull? Or the murders? Or the attack on the Hough family?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry. I meant here at the Gilded Lily,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, not that I\u2019ve heard. I don\u2019t come in now until I know someone else is with me. Never bothered me before to be the first one in for the night. The actors and Jennie and Henri live here, so there was usually someone around, and it never bothered me to hear noises from upstairs or the theater or even the basement, but now...anyway, I\u2019m terrified of the place. I wouldn\u2019t be alone in here for the world!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear noises from the basement a lot?\u201d Sloan asked her.</p><p>\u201cWell, sure. Old buildings creak. Oh! Maybe we have rats or something down in the basement? Or ghosts. This place is haunted. We all think so. But the ghosts always seemed to know I\u2019m a complete coward\u2014they never gave me any trouble. I should move along. What can I get you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now? Draft?\u201d Sloan said, looking at Logan.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019ll call Kelsey and Jane in a few minutes. I doubt they\u2019ve eaten,\u201d Logan said. \u201cHow\u2019s the food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe food here is good,\u201d Liz assured him. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She returned swiftly with the drinks. As she did, Cy Tyburn came into the bar; he walked up to Valerie where she was singing and stood, hat in hand, sighing. She smoothly switched songs, and he joined her in a sweet duet. The heroine and the hero, singing together. When the song was over, Cy slipped away, coming to their table. \u201cSheriff. How\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Sloan said. Cy glanced at Logan and smiled awkwardly. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCy, this is Logan Raintree, an old friend of mine who now runs Jane\u2019s FBI unit. Logan, you\u2019ve seen him perform already. This is our hero in residence, Cy Tyburn.\u201d</p><p>Cy and Logan shook hands. \u201cGlad to have you here. Have you learned anything else?\u201d Cy asked, turning nervously from one man to the other.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working on it. Hey, you need to calm down some,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cHow about a beer?\u201d</p><p>Cy glanced at his watch. \u201cYeah, sure, one before the show and I\u2019m actually a better performer. Thanks. That would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour day went well?\u201d Logan asked him.</p><p>\u201cEverything was fine. Had so much fun acting out the stories and doing improv with people that I forgot someone might\u2019ve been trying to kill me yesterday,\u201d he said.</p><p>Before either could respond, Valerie made her way over to the table. She immediately offered Logan her hand. \u201cHi. You have to be another officer, right?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded and stood, taking Valerie\u2019s hand, then pulling out a chair for her. She sat, lowering her voice as she spoke. \u201cHave you found out anything? Your friend here\u2014\u201d she nodded at Sloan \u201c\u2014nearly bit my head off today for going to visit people at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went to the hospital?\u201d Cy asked her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I tried to see Zoe and Jimmy\u2014but a muscle-bound suit came after me, and then Sheriff Suspicious here stopped me on the road coming back,\u201d Valerie said indignantly.</p> <p>Sloan lifted a hand and smiled at Liz. \u201cCan we get two more here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she called back.</p><p>\u201cIs one for me?\u201d Valerie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry. Didn\u2019t you want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But I would\u2019ve ordered a double Scotch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do have a show, Valerie,\u201d Cy reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, one that could wind up putting us in a hospital, too,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re afraid to perform, I can close this place down,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>Valerie sniffed. \u201cIf you closed it down, we\u2019d have nowhere to go. And no money to get someplace else, anyway.\u201d She leaned into the table. \u201cI don\u2019t think anywhere in this town is safe, so it doesn\u2019t matter, does it?\u201d</p><p>Liz delivered two more glasses of beer. \u201cYou could get out of town,\u201d Logan said politely.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how hard it is to get acting jobs these days? If I were in L.A., there\u2019d be a million girls like me trying for one role. I have a great character to work with here, and I want to stay with the ensemble for another year. That\u2019ll help my r\u00e9sum\u00e9... I can\u2019t leave here now,\u201d Valerie told him.</p><p>\u201cI could,\u201d Cy said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Cy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you weren\u2019t told that there were live rounds in guns that should have held nothing but blanks!\u201d Cy protested.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord, Henri\u2019s coming in.\u201d Valerie stood instantly and raised her glass. \u201cThree cheers for the Gilded Lily bartenders and servers!\u201d she called, and moved away from the table, starting another song.</p><p>Sloan arched his brows at Logan. There goes our beer glass!</p><p>\u201cWell, that girl sure knows how to suck up!\u201d Cy stood, as well, following Valerie around the room, adding his voice to hers in harmony.</p><p>\u201cThey are good,\u201d Logan commented. \u201cThose two definitely know when and where to pick up on each other\u2019s moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d Sloan agreed. \u201cI want to keep an eye on those beer glasses, though.\u201d</p><p>Henri Coque saw Sloan and Logan and immediately came over to join them. He seemed as eager as anyone else to greet Logan and welcome him, expressing hope that he could help solve whatever was happening to their formerly peaceful town of Lily.</p><p>\u201cSit, Henri, have a drink with us,\u201d Sloan invited.</p><p>\u201cShould you be drinking?\u201d Henri asked. \u201cBeing on duty and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m fine with a beer,\u201d Sloan said, nodding slowly.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any information about what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Same question they were all asking, Sloan thought. That made sense, although at least one person\u2014and as yet he didn\u2019t know who\u2014had a private agenda.</p><p>\u201cNo, but we\u2019re expecting more information back from county anytime now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace evidence. You\u2019ve heard the old theory that you take something and you leave something everywhere you go. They\u2019ll find some evidence that will pin the killer,\u201d Sloan explained. The theory was solid; it didn\u2019t always work. Fingerprints could belong where they were found, and dozens upon dozens of prints could be lifted from any one place. DNA was great\u2014as long as you had a sample for comparison. Legally obtained, of course.</p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s get you a beer,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re buying, I\u2019ll have a bourbon,\u201d Henri said. \u201cNo ice. My usual.\u201d</p><p>Sloan waved a hand to order as Logan asked Henri where to find the restrooms. Henri gave him directions.</p><p>As Liz brought Henri his drink, Sloan saw that Logan had casually slipped his hand around the beer glass Cy had left on the bar.</p><p>\u201cSo, Sloan,\u201d Henri said, \u201ctoday seems to be going fine. The actors are working. The theater is open!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great day...so far,\u201d Sloan agreed pleasantly. He watched Valerie glide around the room. When he saw Logan on his way back, he nodded toward the glass she\u2019d just placed on the bar. Logan nodded in return.</p><p>Henri sipped his drink.</p><p>The spirit of Trey Hardy had disappeared when Jane and Kelsey entered the Old Jail.</p><p>Mike Addison was behind the sheriff\u2019s desk, giving directions to a couple who wanted to ride out and see the old cemetery. His \u201cconcierge,\u201d a woman of about twenty, was serving complimentary wine to guests in the old gun room, along with nachos and cheese.</p><p>When the couple moved on, Jane approached him and introduced Kelsey, then asked for the key to her room.</p><p>\u201cCalling it a night, Agent Everett? It\u2019s still early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just showing Kelsey what a wonderful bed-and-breakfast you have,\u201d Jane told him.</p><p>Mike beamed. \u201cI do love it,\u201d he said with enthusiasm. \u201cSilverfest days are great. Halloween is great. But sometimes...well, Lily is off the beaten track. So if you want to go on any travel sites and rave about the place, I\u2019d be very grateful! Oh, and, ladies, it\u2019s wine and snacks time in the gun room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but we\u2019re going to my cell for a few minutes. Then we\u2019ll head back out, of course. We\u2019ll probably catch the show tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in it tonight?\u201d Mike asked her. \u201cI saw you outside when Brian Highsmith grabbed you and dragged you into the action. You\u2019d think\u2014especially as an actor\u2014that he wouldn\u2019t be so obvious in his attempts to accost a pretty woman. I had half a mind to walk up and say something to him!\u201d</p><p>She kept forgetting she was wearing the Sage costume. It was almost unnerving, since she spent most of her days in very practical business suits. But she\u2019d learned to move easily in the Victorian attire and forgot about it...until she walked in front of a mirror.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the show. I\u2019ve enjoyed playing Sage out in the streets, but their show\u2019s already cast\u2014hero and heroine, vamp and villain. And don\u2019t worry about me, Mike. I can handle myself very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw that,\u201d he said with a wink. He smiled at Kelsey. \u201cWelcome!\u201d</p><p>They exchanged a few words, then she and Jane passed through the barred wooden door that led to the cells.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Kelsey asked her quietly as Jane fit her cell-block key into the room door.</p><p>\u201cI saw Trey Hardy. Did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. But he\u2019s supposed to haunt the street and the jail, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t get a chance to tell you\u2014Sage wrote his name on the mirror in my room. She doesn\u2019t seem to speak, but she likes to write in the mist on a mirror. Oh, and she throws a mean hairbrush, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They entered the Trey Hardy cell. The room had been updated effectively. The door made it feel like a jail cell, but the beds were plush, and the television stand looked new but was Victorian in style, as were the dresser and bedside tables. A wardrobe doubled as a closet in back. There wasn\u2019t much extra space around the furniture, but then the Old Jail hadn\u2019t originally been designed to offer luxury suites.</p><p>Jane stood in the bedroom, certain that the ghost had beckoned her here, and yet she didn\u2019t see him now.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you really sleeping here?\u201d Kelsey asked. \u201cYou have the Sage McCormick room, as well. Are you planning on spending part of the night there? Did you want one of us in here with you\u2014or do you think that will hinder Trey\u2019s appearance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t planned anything. I just saw the writing on the mirror and found out that the couple who were supposed to be here had left,\u201d Jane said. \u201cSo I took the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the question is, who knows more about what\u2019s going on? Sage or Trey Hardy.\u201d Kelsey lay on the bed and closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a bit of jet lag,\u201d she murmured apologetically.</p><p>\u201cNo, lie there for a minute. I\u2019ll just sit.\u201d</p><p>Jane did. She sat on the foot of the bed and studied the room, seeing it as it was now\u2014and trying to envision what it had been like in the past. She focused her mind, imagining the place without the bath and the wall separating it from the bedroom. The cell would have been plain, the floor uncovered. There might have been a few narrow bunks in it. The bathroom would have consisted of a chamber pot, nothing more.</p><p>The cell was at the end of the jail that almost abutted the Gilded Lily. From the bathroom area\u2014closed-in now\u2014there might have been a barred window that looked onto the Gilded Lily. Had Trey Hardy believed he was going to hang? He probably hadn\u2019t expected to be gunned down in his cell, but he might well have expected that his life was about to end.</p> <p>She rose and walked into the bathroom, glancing into the mirror above the sink. She was sure that, at one time, barred windows had hung where the mirror was now. Trey might have paced the room and looked over at the Lily. Right here, she stood only about twenty feet away from where the audience would be sitting at the Gilded Lily tonight.</p><p>And if the jail had a basement, the basement here would adjoin the room in the basement below the Gilded Lily, the one that held all the props and old mannequins.</p><p>She opened her eyes. Trey Hardy was there.</p><p>He stood behind her. He seemed as real as flesh and blood. His eyes were dark brown, his hair was dark, too, and he had a handsome, weathered face. The lines in it were attractive, as if he\u2019d spent more of his life smiling than in anger. But now he looked grave as he stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help you.\u201d</p><p>He slammed a fist against the wall, his expression bleak, frustrated. She jumped. \u201cYou can speak,\u201d she encouraged him. \u201cYou can speak if you try.\u201d</p> <p>His mouth moved; a sound escaped but it was like a groan....</p><p>He slammed the wall again and stamped his foot. He was certainly practiced at causing bangs and bumps, even if his speech was nothing but a groan.</p><p>Suddenly she heard a knocking on the outer door.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Kelsey cried, leaping up.</p><p>Trey Hardy disappeared in a flash.</p><p>\u201cAgent Everett!\u201d Mike Addison called. \u201cAgent Everett! Are you all right in there?\u201d</p><p>Kelsey was already at the door by the time Jane reached it. Mike was standing outside. \u201cYour neighbors were worried. What on earth are you two doing in here?\u201d he demanded, looking suspiciously from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kelsey said, shrugging. \u201cI was zoned out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, they heard a tremendous thump and a bang,\u201d Mike said. \u201cThis is a wooden building, you know. Sound carries!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever they heard must have been from outside,\u201d Jane said, meeting his eyes. \u201cKelsey was sleeping. I was just fixing my hair. I dropped my brush and hit my head when I bent down to get it. Maybe that was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, keep the noise down, please. Forgive me, but I do have other guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t us, Mike, honest,\u201d Jane said sweetly. \u201cMaybe it was the ghosts\u2014but the noise was probably because of whatever\u2019s happening at the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll say,\u201d Mike said, turning to leave.</p><p>Kelsey closed the door, rolling her eyes. \u201cHonestly...\u201d</p><p>Jane looked at her. \u201cIt was Hardy. He kept banging on the wall in the bathroom. He was trying to tell me something, but he can\u2019t speak. In all these years, he hasn\u2019t learned how to speak to those who can see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see him. When Mike started pounding on the door...he disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey angled her head. \u201cI hope I can get one of your ghosts to speak with me, or at least make an appearance. You can\u2019t be in two places at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA number of people have seen both of these ghosts. Most of their friends, of course, assume they\u2019re crazy. Even a ghost-busting TV guy went running out of the Gilded Lily. But I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll eventually communicate with us. I just don\u2019t know what they can tell us.\u201d She paused. \u201cSage sent me some fairly general warnings, but aside from that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you said, they\u2019re definitely trying to tell us something.\u201d Kelsey\u2019s phone rang and she quickly picked it up. \u201cIt\u2019s Logan,\u201d she murmured a few seconds later. \u201cHe and Sloan are next door. They thought we should eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, food sounds great,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>Kelsey shook her head and slowly smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping with him, aren\u2019t you? Logan told me that he\u2019s a good cop and an all-around good guy. He wasn\u2019t afraid to quit his job and come home to take care of his grandfather who was dying of cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m that obvious?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>Kelsey shrugged. \u201cNot to someone else. I work with you. I went through the academy with you. We see ghosts together and have rational conversations about them. That gives us a bond, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d Jane agreed. \u201cAnd yes, I\u2019m sleeping with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFast worker,\u201d Kelsey teased.</p><p>\u201cIt was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe circumstances. Believe me, I know. Who instigated it?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I am impressed.\u201d Kelsey laughed.</p><p>\u201cKelsey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry! But does this ghost talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should find out,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cFor now, let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>As they left the Old Jail, Jane waved to Mike at the desk where he seemed to be going through paperwork. He smiled at her. \u201cOut to enjoy the evening? Oh, I guess you\u2019re working, what with everything going on here. Shame about Caleb Hough\u2014although I doubt anyone in town is really surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if that\u2019s why no one wanted to shut down Silverfest,\u201d Jane watched Mike\u2019s reaction. \u201cI mean, I guess he was universally disliked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity about the kid and his wife being hurt, though,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cInteresting that no one seemed to be deterred from coming here, despite everything that\u2019s been going on,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>Mike shrugged. \u201cIn big cities, you sometimes have a murder a day. No one leaves a city because of a murder. Now, I\u2019ll grant you, our population is small in comparison, but, heck, we haven\u2019t had a murder since before I moved here. I have faith in the sheriff. He\u2019ll straighten it all out. Especially with the county\u2014and you feds\u2014working on it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it was two murders in less than a week\u2014and four assaults,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cFour?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cYou mean Zoe and Jimmy Hough and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJennie and me in the basement of the Gilded Lily,\u201d Jane finished.</p><p>He gave her a patient smile. \u201cThe basement\u2014it\u2019s a death trap, you know. You should stay out of it. Those mannequins are unstable. Jennie probably fell. You just got whacked by one of those fake people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Jane grimaced, looking at Kelsey. \u201cImagine. Jennie fell\u2014right on the rough end of a walking cane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always warning you about those mannequins,\u201d Kelsey said jokingly.</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t laugh, responding to Mike instead. \u201cMike, I\u2019m not part of the theater\u2014and I\u2019m not known for overreacting!\u201d</p><p>Mike frowned at them.</p><p>Kelsey took up the conversation. \u201cWell, it\u2019s really great to hear that you have faith in your law enforcement system, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTown, county\u2014and federal!\u201d he said pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cSee you later, Mike,\u201d Jane told him.</p><p>\u201cTake care now,\u201d he said, returning to his paperwork.</p><p>They left the Old Jail and walked the few steps to the entrance of the Gilded Lily. Country music was playing on the stereo system when they arrived. The bar area was busy but they quickly saw Logan and Sloan at a four-top table.</p><p>They slid into seats to join them.</p><p>\u201cAnything new?\u201d Jane asked Sloan.</p><p>\u201cA bit of an interesting twist,\u201d he said, leaning close. \u201cYou know the mummified corpse in the desert? Well, it\u2019s been stripped down to the bone for you to do a reconstruction. But the M.E. found something interesting\u2014or rather, something lacking\u2014in the skull when he removed the rest of the soft tissue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tongue,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhoever our mystery corpse might be, he had his tongue sliced out before he was shot in the chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGruesome.\u201d Kelsey shuddered. \u201cBut that\u2019s a classic punishment for talking too much, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeretics sometimes had their tongues cut out,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI guess you could say they talked too much\u2014against the establishment or the church. It\u2019s beginning to look as if whoever we found in the desert was killed to prevent him from talking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kelsey shook her head. \u201cThat was cruel and brutal, since they obviously meant to kill the victim, anyway. What difference did it make if he could talk. They were going to kill him. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>\u201cSome people are cruel and brutal,\u201d Logan said, \u201cand we\u2019ve all learned that cruelty doesn\u2019t have to make sense. Sloan, I know Jane is still working on the skull you\u2019ve already determined to be that of Sage McCormick, but if she did up a quick two-dimensional drawing from photos and scans of the second corpse, do you have old photographs or paintings we could make comparisons with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver at Desert Diamonds Grant\u2019s got several books written by historians throughout the years, plus replica editions of books written at the time. There are pictures of Brendan Fogerty, Aaron Munson, Red Marston, Eamon McNulty\u2014and, of course, Sage McCormick. But there\u2019s also a nice painting of her over the bar, just behind you. Jane\u2019s two-dimensional sketch was really all we needed to see that the skull had belonged to Sage. I\u2019d asked her to finish her reconstruction for sentimental reasons, really.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably heard that she was an ancestor of mine.\u201d When everyone nodded, he went on, \u201cI believe the skeleton we dug up in the desert is going to prove to be Red Marston, but...that\u2019s a theory at this point, nothing more. And I think if that body is Red Marston\u2019s, then we just might be right about the gold.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get on it first thing in the morning,\u201d Jane said. \u201cSo what\u2019s your plan for the evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you gotten settled yet?\u201d Sloan asked Logan and Kelsey.</p><p>Before either could answer, his phone rang, and he excused himself to answer it. Jane watched as first a frown and then an expression of relief came over his features. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else knowing,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cIf she does have something to tell us, I don\u2019t want her to be a target.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and told them, \u201cIt\u2019s Jennie, Jennie Layton. The stage manager\u2014they call her their \u2018stage mother.\u2019 She\u2019s conscious now. She\u2019s doing well, and the doctor says I can speak with her.\u201d</p><p>He got to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll call you,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019ll know. Maybe, just maybe, she\u2019ll remember some of what happened.\u201d</p> <p>Jane set a hand on his arm. \u201cSloan, this may sound strange, but I\u2019m not sure the person\u2014or persons\u2014who attacked Jennie and me can be the same as whoever killed Berman and Caleb Hough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Jennie and I are alive,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cJennie got a pretty good hit on the head with that cane,\u201d he argued. \u201cAnd you were knocked unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Berman was killed with a bullet. Caleb Hough had his throat from slit ear to ear,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what Jennie has to say,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll call when I\u2019m on my way back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re going to stay with Jane over at the Old Jail tonight?\u201d Kelsey asked Sloan blandly. \u201cIf something\u2019s going on in that room, two pairs of eyes would be better than one.\u201d</p><p>Sloan seemed confused for a minute. Kelsey had left him a nice opening, though, Jane thought, lowering her lashes to hide her amusement.</p><p>\u201cCertainly. Of course,\u201d he said. He paused to talk to Liz and then walked out the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll eat first, and then you can show Kelsey and me where we\u2019re sleeping,\u201d Logan said. \u201cAnd, if you don\u2019t mind, you can show us the infamous Sage McCormick suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. We can catch some of the show and I\u2019ll give you a tour of the place\u2014with Henri\u2019s permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharm him,\u201d Logan suggested. \u201cWhat\u2019s good on the menu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything I\u2019ve had so far,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>They ordered their meals. There was enough activity and noise in the bar so that Jane could really talk to them, put events in chronological order and get their feedback.</p> <p>\u201cPeople kill for different reasons,\u201d Logan said. \u201cRevenge, sometimes for presumed injustices. They kill for passion. Or because they\u2019re mentally ill. And they kill out of greed. Lily\u2019s past victims seem to have died because of the greed of others. And maybe the same thing is going on today. How many of the people in the town have ancestors who were here at that time?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, Sloan. As he mentioned, Sage McCormick was his great-great grandmother,\u201d Jane said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure who else. The actors working in the theater came from other places, and I believe Henri Coque came here from elsewhere, too. I don\u2019t know about the others. We\u2019ll have to ask Sloan.\u201d</p><p>When they\u2019d finished the meal, Jane found Henri. She requested a key for Kelsey and Logan, and asked if, after the show, he\u2019d mind if she showed them around the theater. Henri agreed, smiling. He told her he liked her even better in the crimson dress than in the blue. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from a number of our audience members. They say you\u2019ve been quite entertaining on the street. Thank you! Feel free to take your fellow agents around the theater.\u201d</p><p>While Kelsey and Logan went out to retrieve their overnight bags and settle into Jennie\u2019s room at the Gilded Lily, Jane decided to go to her room there. She was feeling strangely divided. She now had two of her Krewe with her, and yet she still felt it was important to be in both places\u2014the Gilded Lily and the Old Jail.</p><p>And talk to the ghosts there.</p><p>She gathered a few things to put in a small bag to take over to the Old Jail later that night, then sat on the bed.</p><p>\u201cSage, I wish you\u2019d talk to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>She stood swiftly, feeling something cold but gentle and...yearning sweep by her. Walking into the bathroom, she closed the door and turned the sink faucet on hot until steamy water poured down the drain and a mist rose to cover the mirror.</p><p>\u201cSage? I don\u2019t know why you won\u2019t speak to me. We\u2019re really trying to help. Trying to solve all this and prevent more deaths.\u201d</p><p>She felt the air shift around her. The mirror was clouded with steam, but it was through the steam that she\u2019d found the way these ghosts communicated.</p><p>Sage was behind her. Jane didn\u2019t turn around; she spoke to the mirror image of the beautiful ghost.</p><p>\u201cHelp us. If you speak to me, I will hear you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Sage stared back at her.</p><p>With a slight stirring of the air, the ghost moved around her...and began to write. She clearly saw the words.</p><p>SPEAK NO EVIL</p><p>A second later, the words were furiously erased.</p><p>SPEAK NO TRUTH!</p><p>Jane turned slowly around. The image of the ghost remained. Sage McCormick opened her mouth, and although she was a ghost, there was something Jane could clearly see.</p><p>Sage McCormick had no tongue; it had been sliced off at the base.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d Jane said softly, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, so, so sorry!\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>The county officer on duty at the hospital acknowledged Sloan as he came in. \u201cThe doctor was just in with her. One of the nurses was the first to realize Ms. Layton was coming to. I haven\u2019t spoken to her. She went from being in the coma to dozing on and off, but they say it\u2019s all right if you speak with her.\u201d</p><p>Sloan went in. When he entered the room, Jennie\u2019s eyes were closed. She looked small and frail as she lay in the hospital bed. He noted the veins in her hands where they lay on the white sheets.</p><p>He just sat there for a minute, waiting. After some time, her eyes opened. She blinked, disoriented.</p><p>\u201cSloan,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>He leaned close to the bed and took one of her thin, delicate hands. She offered him a shaky smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cThey say you\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWhen I first opened my eyes, I didn\u2019t know where I was. I didn\u2019t know what had happened. I had no...memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, I remember that I went down to the basement. And I woke up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you go down to the basement, Jennie? Do you remember? You were in the room with all the old props and mannequins. Why?\u201d</p><p>Jennie was silent, and then she looked at him, hesitant.</p><p>\u201cThey were talking,\u201d Jennie said at last.</p><p>\u201cThe mannequins?\u201d Sloan asked in a carefully even tone.</p><p>\u201cOh, Sloan, don\u2019t be silly! I got hit on the head, but I know mannequins don\u2019t talk!\u201d she told him.</p><p>He smiled again. \u201cSo someone was down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, someone was in the room. Or more than one person, because I\u2019d heard talking down there several times over the past week. I couldn\u2019t figure out what the actors would be doing down there. I\u2019m responsible for storage, props, costumes.... I wanted to know what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t recognize anything about the voices?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBut, Sloan, I heard them late at night, and once, very early in the morning. Yet whenever I went down, no one was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Henri about it?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She ran the fingers of her free hand over the sheets, glanced at them for a minute and then back at Sloan. \u201cI didn\u2019t want Henri to think I was too old for my job\u2014too old, or too crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not that old, Jennie,\u201d Sloan said firmly. \u201cAnd Henri likes your work very much. So you\u2019d go down but not see anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course, the light is pretty dim. All you\u2019re getting is the overflow from the main room,\u201d Jennie reminded him. \u201cBut no, I didn\u2019t see anyone, and the only way out is the stairs that lead to the door by the bar. So I thought I was crazy myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when you were attacked, did you see anything? Do you have any idea who swung that cane at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe clown,\u201d she said suddenly. \u201cIt was a clown mannequin. I saw it! Sloan, maybe there are ghosts down there.\u201d</p><p>Again, she was quiet. He didn\u2019t press her; he realized she wasn\u2019t sure how to say what she wanted to say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she spoke, it was in a rush. \u201cThere are spirits of all the people gunned down or murdered in or near the theater, and now those spirits are possessing the mannequins.\u201d</p><p>Sloan felt disappointment streak through him. She\u2019d sounded as if she\u2019d come out of it with all her senses. Now he was worried.</p><p>Not that spirits didn\u2019t exist. Not that people wouldn\u2019t think he was crazy if he ever told the truth.</p> <p>He just didn\u2019t believe that spirits were possessing the mannequins. People were down there doing something. He wanted to know who and what. And why...</p><p>\u201cJennie, maybe someone pushed one of the mannequins at you,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe one of those people, whoever they are, were in the midst of the mannequins, talking. And that\u2019s probably why it looked like the clown mannequin came after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, maybe... It can be so dark and shadowy down there. It\u2019s funny. The theater\u2019s always had that feeling. Of being haunted. Maybe being haunted is the same as being steeped in history. But I always felt good before. Now, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right not to feel safe\u2014but it wasn\u2019t ghosts of the old theater doing bad things.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung her eyes. \u201cAm I too old, Sloan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Jennie. You\u2019re not. You walked in on someone\u2019s secret meeting. Listen, you do everything at the theater and you do it well. That has nothing to do with the fact that you stumbled on someone who\u2019s killing people, and that someone needed to silence you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I\u2019m alive,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re alive, and we\u2019re keeping an officer in the hospital, so you\u2019ll stay alive. I\u2019ve given orders that no one else be told that you\u2019re awake,\u201d Sloan explained. He squeezed her hand. \u201cJennie, you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI love that theater, Sloan. I was never an actress. But I love working with the actors. I love fixing the costumes, fixing the props.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat brings me to another question, Jennie. Henri told me you loaded the guns for the annual duel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. With blanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of the guns had live ammunition, Jennie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSloan, I did not load a gun with live ammunition. I don\u2019t even have live ammunition!\u201d she said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you load the guns and where did you leave them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always prepare for every day\u2019s performance the night before,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt might have been an hour or so before I went down to the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you leave the guns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the prop table. It\u2019s backstage left, in one of the theater wings. Even if we\u2014or the actors\u2014are performing outside, we stick to protocol with the props and costumes.\u201d</p><p>The prop table. Not helpful. Anyone could\u2019ve gotten to them. But no, that wasn\u2019t really true; it had to be someone who could move through the theater unnoticed. The cast and crew had been working outside most of the day, but they certainly went in and out. The housekeeping staff went in\u2014and anyone might duck their head in. But only someone who knew the theater would know where to look for the props.</p><p>\u201cSloan, I would never, ever hurt an actor! Please, you have to believe me,\u201d Jennie begged.</p> <p>He squeezed her hand reassuringly.</p><p>Maybe Jennie wouldn\u2019t, but someone would.</p><p>He stood. \u201cJennie, anything you can think of, please call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the clown, Sloan. I\u2019m telling you. It was the clown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jennie. Now rest. Get better,\u201d he said, and left.</p><p>He reiterated to the staff and the officer on duty that he didn\u2019t want anyone else knowing that Jennie was conscious. He checked in on Jimmy and Zoe Hough, but both were soundly asleep. The resident told Sloan that the Houghs were both doing fine and could be released; Sloan asked that they be kept at least one more night, giving him time to talk to Newsome about arrangements for their protection.</p><p>He finally walked out of the hospital and headed for his car. The moon was high, the landscape glowing with its silvery light. But as he drove out, the desert seemed cast in shadow and mystery. The sand, he knew, hid many secrets of the past. Not some of humanity\u2019s finer moments, he thought drily. Moments of brutality and bloodshed.</p><p>He was eager to get back to town.</p><p>The show had let out when Jane returned downstairs from her room at the Gilded Lily, her bag stuffed with an oversize T-shirt for the night and the few toiletries she\u2019d need.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard from Sloan yet, and she knew Kelsey and Logan would remain at the theater, alert to all possibilities, so she called Logan and told him she was going over to the Old Jail. He gave her his customary admonition to be careful; she promised she would be.</p><p>One of Mike Addison\u2019s night managers was on duty when she entered the Old Jail. He greeted her cheerfully, but she felt she was being watched. She wondered if Mike had warned that the \u201cagent\u201d who had rented Trey Hardy\u2019s cell had already caused trouble.</p><p>There were Do Not Disturb signs on the other cell doors she passed; she was obviously the last one in for the night. Turning her key in the door, she stepped in, then sat on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m here. I wish you\u2019d talk to me. I wish I could understand what you want me to know.\u201d</p><p>There was no response. She stood, brushed her teeth and prepared for bed. She left only the small night-light on in the bathroom and lay down in the bed. Everything was quiet. She waited. Lack of sleep took its toll and she dozed off long before she intended.</p><p>She became aware of a weight settling by her side. Half-asleep, she assumed that Sloan had returned from the hospital and decided to join her. When she rolled over to touch him, she felt as though she\u2019d slipped her hand into something thick and icy, and she jolted awake, barely managing to suppress a scream.</p><p>He was back. Trey Hardy.</p><p>He was at her side. He watched her gravely for a minute.</p><p>\u201cI see you,\u201d she told him. \u201cI see you clearly.\u201d</p><p>He reached out a hand, as if he wanted to stroke her face. She felt the sensation of something there\u2014and not there. But the room was dark, and he suddenly seemed as solid as any breathing, living human being. He got up, waiting for her. She did the same. He walked back into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d she whispered urgently. \u201cDon\u2019t bang the walls!\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand on the wall by the sink, then leaned against it. He moved his lips to speak.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d the ghost said. It was a croak\u2014dry, brittle. It was the rough, sandpapery whisper that others sometimes heard, and when they did, they\u2019d get that eerie feeling that a place was really haunted.</p><p>\u201cIn the wall,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She started, hearing a knock at the door. Hardy wavered and was gone.</p><p>She hurried to her door, expecting Sloan. She was surprised to see Mike Addison. He hadn\u2019t even been at the desk; she\u2019d assumed he\u2019d gone home for the night.</p><p>She opened the door. \u201cMike. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to make sure you\u2019re okay\u2014and ask you to be quiet again,\u201d he said.</p><p>She frowned at him, startled. \u201cMike, I haven\u2019t made any noise. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d She realized that beneath his Western denim jacket he was wearing a holster. He was armed, while her Glock was on the bedside table.</p><p>\u201cThat pounding. The guest two cells down called me about it,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>He was just standing there, a little belligerently, talking to her. She didn\u2019t know why he suddenly made her nervous.</p><p>\u201cLet me see what\u2019s going on in here.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to slam the door, which would have been ridiculous. But she didn\u2019t want to let him into the room. She wished she\u2019d gotten her gun before opening the door.</p><p>\u201cMike, there\u2019s nothing going on in here. I\u2019m alone,\u201d she told him. \u201cIf any of the guests are hearing things, the sounds have to be coming from the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe theater is closed.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be moving toward her. She assured herself that the man couldn\u2019t possibly be enough of a fool to offer harm to a federal agent, especially when it was known that she was at the Old Jail.</p><p>Thankfully, she didn\u2019t have to let him in or slam the door. She heard a creak, and the barred door separating the office from the cells opened and closed.</p><p>Sloan was coming down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mike. What\u2019s up?\u201d Sloan asked. \u201cWhat are you doing here so late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was over at the theater\u2014thought I\u2019d stop in,\u201d Mike said. \u201cAnd I got here just in time. The guests are complaining about the noise Agent Everett is making.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making any noise,\u201d Jane said with exasperation.</p><p>Sloan stared at Mike. \u201cIf Agent Everett says she isn\u2019t making any noise, I certainly believe her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I had a complaint,\u201d Mike protested.</p><p>\u201cTell the complainers the ghosts must really like them,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>Mike\u2019s eyes narrowed and he cast his head at an inquisitive angle. \u201cYou gonna be here, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be here. I\u2019ll see that nothing is going on,\u201d Sloan told him.</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh!\u201d Mike said. \u201cOkay, um, fine. Well, then. Just, uh, keep it down!\u201d He turned and left abruptly.</p><p>Sloan looked at Jane, amusement in his eyes. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. There really wasn\u2019t any noise coming from the room. But I did see Trey Hardy. And he put his hand on the wall again\u2014right by the mirror. But, more importantly, how is Jennie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said the clown did it,\u201d he told her wearily. \u201cShe kept hearing voices from the room in the basement. She started to think that the spirits of people murdered in Lily had inhabited the mannequins. I think someone goes down there to talk and plot or...I don\u2019t know. But I do think we need to get in that room and find out what\u2019s down there. Anything happen here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHappen? Not really. But, Sloan, we\u2019re getting closer. In the morning, I\u2019ll do a two-dimensional sketch of the skull from the desert. I\u2019m willing to bet it\u2019s Red Marston. I\u2019m almost positive Red and Sage were killed because they knew too much\u2014and the same with Trey Hardy. I saw Sage tonight and...\u201d She paused.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d had her tongue cut out. And just like we discussed earlier this evening, you have your tongue cut out when you\u2019ve said too much or spoken against someone\u2014or when it\u2019s a warning not to talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr if you want to make sure your victims suffer before they die.\u201d</p><p>He walked past her into the bathroom and ran his hand over the painted plaster of the wall. \u201cSo, the ghost insists there\u2019s something back there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. Sloan raised his brows, hands on hips. \u201cI think your agency\u2019s budget is bigger than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, we\u2019ll dig out that wall,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to replace it. Logan and Kelsey are at the Gilded Lily, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom now on, one of us is at both of these places every night. But for now, we really need to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that chair,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that when we\u2019ve been sleeping together?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGhosts.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cJust because we\u2019re in the same bed doesn\u2019t mean that we have to fool around in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re in the same bed, I\u2019d want to fool around. I\u2019m great at sleeping in chairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, and you\u2019re going to make me feel bad.\u201d</p><p>This time he smiled. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying you can keep your hands off me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith ghosts in the room, I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in there. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Sloan was determined. He pulled the chair up, stretched his legs out on the bed and settled in. Jane crawled into the bed and tossed him a pillow. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to worry about you all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019ll be sleeping.\u201d</p> <p>He was stubborn and Jane could tell she wasn\u2019t going to change his mind, she crawled into bed. Sloan\u2019s head was thrown back; his eyes were closed. For a moment, she thought he\u2019d already drifted off.</p><p>\u201cIronic,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur relationship is going to be all over town tomorrow\u2014because of the one evening we slept apart.\u201d</p><p>She curled her arms around the remaining pillow. He was in the room with her and she let herself fall into a deep and peaceful sleep.</p><p>If Trey Hardy came again that night, she didn\u2019t know it. When she woke, Sloan was in the bathroom. The door was open; he\u2019d showered and he was frowning at the mirror.</p><p>He turned to her. \u201cHe\u2019s here. Trey Hardy is here. And there is something in that wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking up the history of mannequins,\u201d Kelsey told Jane as they drove to the station. \u201cGreat stuff. They found a torso carved out of wood in King Tut\u2019s tomb, which shows that the use of mannequins goes back thousands of years. Kings and queens gave them as gifts to fellow royals and to inform other countries of the latest fashion trends. In the 1700s they were often wicker, and a lot of them had no heads, but by 1870\u2014right around the time all the trauma was going on here\u2014the fashion-conscious French started making them elaborate again and you know how it goes with the world imitating French fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever I\u2019ve finished this drawing,\u201d Jane said, \u201cwe\u2019ll get down into that basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t a whole crime-scene unit go through it?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I think we\u2019re looking for something a crime-scene unit isn\u2019t going to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014but that\u2019s what we do, right? Find what we don\u2019t know we\u2019re looking for,\u201d Jane said, adding, \u201cin a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, in a way. We could really use physical evidence against someone, too.\u201d</p><p>They reached the office. Chet Morgan and Lamont Atkins were still working in town; Betty greeted them at the desk. Kelsey followed along behind Jane and helped her set the skull on the Franklin plane, take the photographs and do the scanning. Betty came in now and then to see how they were doing. \u201cWow!\u201d she said, watching Jane work first with the computer and then do her sketch from the overlays. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>In fact, Betty was in the room when she\u2019d almost finished. \u201cIt\u2019s him, all right. It\u2019s him!\u201d Betty said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d Kelsey asked. \u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed Marston. The man who supposedly helped Sage disappear\u2014and who supposedly ran away to Mexico with her. That was the rumor. So poor Sage was murdered at the theater. And Red was found out in the desert...so sad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it proves our theory,\u201d Jane murmured. \u201cOr part of it.\u201d</p><p>Why had he suddenly shown up in the desert to point the way to a newly murdered man?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant. Your work is really brilliant.\u201d Betty sighed. \u201cIf only you were working with the dead people from today\u2014but then we know who they are, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Kelsey said wryly. \u201cThat\u2019s not as much of an advantage as you\u2019d hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get why someone would kill a tourist no one knew in Lily,\u201d Betty said. \u201cBut Caleb Hough...well, you must be tired of hearing this, but the man didn\u2019t get along with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, of course, they might have been killed by different people,\u201d Kelsey pointed out.</p><p>A phone buzzed in the outer office, and Betty went running out to answer it. She reappeared as Kelsey was helping Jane pack up her personal art supplies and printing copies of Jane\u2019s sketch. \u201cThat was Sheriff Sloan. He wants you to know that he and Agent Raintree are still at the Old Jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Betty. Did he ask us to join him there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he said to finish whatever you\u2019re doing. He also needs to meet Detective Newsome out at the old mine shaft. But you two just stick with your program,\u201d Betty said. \u201cYou\u2019re still busy here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I have the two-dimensional likeness\u2014enough to know what we wanted to know,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cLunch,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go find some food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you need me at any time, just call,\u201d Betty said.</p><p>They thanked her and walked out of the station. \u201cYou were acting a bit strange,\u201d Kelsey murmured to Jane. \u201cAs if you didn\u2019t want Betty to know exactly what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetty certainly seems helpful and legitimate,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut Sloan\u2019s been more communicative with Newsome than his own deputies about all this. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a matter of mistrust so much as a certain wariness, since everyone in this town talks to everyone else. Or maybe it\u2019s because we know that Brendan Fogerty\u2014who came out of the whole gold heist all those years ago looking like a hero\u2014was probably behind the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. So what\u2019s our plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figure we\u2019ll get back into town, see what\u2019s up at the Old Jail, maybe get something to eat there,\u201d Jane told her.</p><p>When they arrived, Mike was at the desk. He gave Jane an angry glare when she arrived.</p><p>\u201cYou looking for Sloan? Well, he just left. Ripped up my room\u2014and took off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jane said, disappointed. \u201cDid he leave me a message?\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded, not at all happy. \u201cHe said for you to keep looking.\u201d He glared at Kelsey in turn. \u201cHe said between the locals and the feds, they\u2019d get my place back in shape. He promised!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Addison, I know we\u2019ll see that your place is better than ever,\u201d Kelsey told him.</p><p>Mike sniffed. \u201cYou like throwing those tax dollars around, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do a lot of the work ourselves,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cHonestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, I\u2019m going to see what he was up to, okay?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>Mike frowned. \u201cHe told me not to let anyone back there. But I guess he didn\u2019t mean you. Go on. You\u2019ll see what he\u2019s done!\u201d</p><p>Jane made her way through the door to the cells and then down the hall, Kelsey right behind her. They entered the Trey Hardy cell.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI can see why Mike was so upset.\u201d</p><p>The plaster in the bathroom looked as if it had been attacked with a sledgehammer\u2014which it clearly had.</p><p>Jane bit her lower lip, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure this is my fault,\u201d she told Kelsey. \u201cTrey Hardy keeps banging on this wall, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he found anything?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he had a chance to get very far,\u201d Jane said, brushing at the wall, knocking away first the new plaster and then the old plaster to get down to the wooden beams beneath. Those beams had once been strong and sturdy; when the jail was restored, thinner plywood had been used along with the plaster. She tried poking her fingers through to see if she could find anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call and ask him what\u2019s going on.\u201d Kelsey pulled out her phone.</p><p>Jane thought she knew how Sloan had felt while digging. The more she worked, the more she wanted to get done. She tried to imagine the jail as it had been with no nice modern bath built into the side. She\u2019d already guessed that the barred window would have been just about where the mirror was now, and Trey Hardy might have leaned against the wall right here, staring out at the world. He might\u2019ve been doing that when the door to his cell burst open\u2014and Aaron Munson had walked in, guns blazing.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re at the mine,\u201d Kelsey said to Jane. \u201cHe\u2019ll call us back later.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just then, Jane\u2019s fingers touched something. She wiggled them deeper between the boards. What she touched felt like metal.</p><p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cI got it, I got it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but...\u201d She managed to extract a little metal tube. It might have been the muzzle of an old gun, sawed or cut off to create a cylinder. Or perhaps it had been fashioned from the leg of an old bed. It seemed as encrusted as something taken from a shipwreck.</p><p>And inside, rolled up, was a piece of paper. It was old, fragile, but the metal tubing had done its work.</p><p>Jane looked at Kelsey and carefully unrolled it.</p><p>The bones were in the mine wall.</p> <p>They\u2019d been undetected for over a hundred and forty years because they\u2019d been shored up against the stone of the mine wall when work was done to support the structure to protect the miners from cave-ins.</p><p>\u201cWe found them,\u201d Newsome told Sloan and Logan, \u201cbecause one member of our crime-scene unit noted a little crevice in the rocks in the second set of openings. If she hadn\u2019t seen that crack and been determined to go farther...\u201d</p><p>There was something infinitely sad about the bones in the wall. They were attached to bits and pieces of fabric; time and heat had worn away the tissue and flesh, and they were heaped in a confusing pile. It appeared that the stagecoach robbers had brought them here, dug out the support structure, covered them with dirt and rock, then built up new \u201csupport beams\u201d and a new wall around them.</p><p>The robbers\u2014the killers\u2014must have moved quickly, at night, because miners were working there at the time.</p><p>In fact, miners had come to work for years. Maybe, especially in the months afterward, they\u2019d wondered at the smell.</p><p>But maybe they\u2019d been so conditioned to the stench of heat and one another that they\u2019d never noticed, and maybe decay had happened fast....</p> <p>Three skulls lay in the pile of remains. Femurs stuck out, rib bones seemed strewn about.</p><p>It no longer seemed tragic, not the way finding the newly dead could be. It was still terribly sad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see that they\u2019re removed,\u201d Newsome told Sloan. \u201cI\u2019ll take all the proper measures, do what we can to identify the remains and arrange for burial. I just thought you should see this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m glad to see it,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve managed to solve the past, and what a kick in the ass to oral history and legend. Brendan Fogerty wasn\u2019t a good guy at all. He was probably the mastermind pulling all the strings. Just his bad luck McNulty up and died without letting his partner know how to find the gold.\u201d He looked at Newsome. \u201cBut we have no clue as to where the gold did wind up, right? And what about the stagecoach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stagecoach might well have rotted to nothing over the years. And bones of dead horses have been found in the desert throughout time,\u201d Newsome reminded him. \u201cOr they could\u2019ve been rescued by ranchers or Apaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope so,\u201d Logan muttered.</p><p>Sloan nodded. \u201cYeah, but that gold is somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe someone is after it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour men are still searching here?\u201d Logan asked Newsome.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s not an easy task. I don\u2019t want my people risking their lives in a possible cave-in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and we don\u2019t want to see anyone injured, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe there are a number of people involved in this?\u201d Newsome asked, turning to Sloan.</p><p>\u201cAt least two. There were two people in the Hough house,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cAccording to the son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater today I\u2019ll have DNA results back from those glasses you pilfered from the theater the other night,\u201d Newsome said. \u201cJust remember, unless any of them show up in the system, I need something to check them against. I have the bottle you found in here, but that\u2019s all I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppreciate it,\u201d Sloan told him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job. But you know your town way better than I do, Sloan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I knew the town,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cNow\u2014\u201d He broke off and shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out what\u2019s going on. I was a lucky bastard in Texas. I was never part of an unsolved murder case. I\u2019m not going to be part of one here, either.\u201d As he spoke, his phone rang. To his surprise, it was Jennie Layton.</p><p>He stepped back. \u201cJennie? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m improving and they say I can leave. Maybe tomorrow. But, Sloan, I\u2019m afraid to leave. I keep remembering things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her voice. \u201cSloan, can you come see me? I\u2019m feeling uneasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come over right now, Jennie,\u201d he promised. \u201cI have to ride back in and get a car, but I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. There\u2019s just...\u201d Her voice fell to a whisper he could barely make out. \u201cThere\u2019s something going on here, Sloan. I can just feel it. Something\u2019s going to happen. Something bad.\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>Jane sat on the floor with Kelsey, carefully reading the note left behind by Trey Hardy.</p><p>They know, I\u2019m sure, that I overheard them talking. I don\u2019t believe they will let me come to trial. They suspect that I will use what I have overheard to save my life before a circuit judge. I know this just as I know what will transpire. They leave the jail and speak to one another about their intentions in the alley between my window and the theater, and they have seen my face when they look at me.</p><p>There is nowhere to turn. The sheriff and the deputy are both involved. I have lived hard and recklessly; I have seen the fall of the South\u2014and known that we were often wrong. What becomes of me will not be just, and yet it will be deserved because I took the law into my own hands. May God help me. I practiced no cruelty. I killed during the war in the name of a Cause, but never killed at any other time in my life. What comes my way I will accept.</p><p>But I fear now for Sage; she has been to see me many times, a dear friend, a skilled actress, and mother and wife. They will kill me before my trial. I pray that someone else might find this letter, stop the crime those conspirators have planned, and see to her safety.</p><p>Their plan is that they can surprise the stagecoach. A sheriff and his deputy riding up will not cause alarm. They will murder those on the coach and hide their bodies in the desert; they have no fear of reprisal. They will hide the gold and let time go by, let it be forgotten. Then they will remove it from its hiding place, divide it and make haste across the border. The robbery will remain a legend, and they will invent some story to explain the disappearances of so many\u2014including themselves.</p><p>God help us. Pray for all sinners.</p><p>Trey Hardy</p><p>Jane looked at Kelsey. \u201cThis is so tragic. I\u2019m halfway in love with this poor dead outlaw!\u201d</p><p>Kelsey nodded, trying to shove a piece of plaster back onto the wall.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to work.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s sad. It\u2019s terrible. But where\u2019s the gold?\u201d</p><p>Jane was thoughtful. \u201cIt\u2019s in the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the theater? It could be anywhere. We just dug out a wall and found the note. And here\u2019s another question\u2014why kill Berman? He was a stranger as far as we know. Berman, and then Caleb Hough. Hough is probably involved. But...why kill people, when the gold hasn\u2019t even been uncovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey both had to be in on it,\u201d Jane insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou seem convinced,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI\u2019m going to call Logan again. If the county cops are handling whatever they just found in the mine, Logan can come back and get started on figuring out the connection. There has to be a connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know,\u201d Jane said slowly.</p><p>\u201cKnow what? The connection?\u201d</p><p>Jane nodded. \u201cHow do you best hide anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, in a deep hole?\u201d Kelsey suggested.</p><p>Jane laughed. \u201cNo. In plain sight. I think one of these conspirators found some of the gold, maybe a piece. He brought them all in on it, but the hiding place must be so obvious that no one\u2019s seeing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. No one\u2014like any one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, call Logan and tell him about the note. Meanwhile, we\u2019ll go check out the theater.\u201d</p><p>The county officer on duty at the hospital, a conscientious man in his late twenties, was distressed when Sloan arrived at Jennie Layton\u2019s room.</p><p>He started to move a few feet from the door to greet Sloan, and Sloan smiled as he heard Jennie calling out, \u201cDon\u2019t you leave me, young man!\u201d</p><p>He grimaced as he saw Sloan, speaking softly. \u201cI keep telling her I have to keep an eye on three people here and she\u2019s just one of them. She doesn\u2019t want me to leave her, not for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Go see Jimmy and Zoe Hough. I\u2019m here. Do you know what got her so upset?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>Sloan went in to be with Jennie. \u201cHey,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou have that young officer all in a dither, Jennie. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to find me now, and they\u2019re going to kill me!\u201d she said, her voice hushed. She glanced at the door as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cWho are they and how are they going to find you?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cThey know I\u2019m here. Maybe they didn\u2019t mean to kill me at first, but they do now,\u201d Jennie said decisively.</p><p>He sat for a minute, wondering if\u2014despite her job or perhaps because of it\u2014she was still essentially a lonely aging woman with no family of her own.</p><p>\u201cJennie, we haven\u2019t let it out that you\u2019ve even regained consciousness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone in here, watching me,\u201d Jennie said stubbornly. \u201cOne of the nurses, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of these nurses has anything to do with the theater.\u201d He took her hand. \u201cThis is a county hospital. We\u2019re from the little town of Lily. Honestly, a lot of county people hardly know we exist.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she muttered, shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Someone is here, Sloan. Watching me\u2014waiting for an opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Sloan was torn. Jennie obviously felt afraid, certain of her own conviction. He didn\u2019t want to sit at the hospital and worry about her imagined fear. Just as he began to tell her that he couldn\u2019t stay with her, he noticed a nurse hovering in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d the woman said in a husky voice. She had long dark hair with bangs and wore glasses with large green plastic frames.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, come in, we\u2019re just talking,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I can, uh, check Ms. Layton\u2019s vitals later,\u201d the nurse said, and turned quickly to move down the hall.</p><p>Sloan stood, frowning. He wouldn\u2019t say that the nurse had been ugly, but she had a strange, rather masculine look to her.</p><p>He lit out of the room.</p><p>\u201cSloan, don\u2019t leave me!\u201d Jennie cried.</p> <p>\u201cStop!\u201d Sloan commanded in the hallway, watching the nurse all but run away. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>He was completely ignored. He didn\u2019t want to threaten to fire or shoot off a warning in a hospital. With Jennie\u2019s voice fading in the background, he tore after the nurse.</p><p>The nurse looked back and then forward, running, pushing a work cart between the two of them. It flipped onto its side, and Sloan hopped over it as paper cups filled with medications flew into the air and onto the floor.</p><p>He caught the nurse about twenty feet past the overturned cart. Tackling the buxom brunette from the rear, he brought both of them down. He finally straddled his madly scrambling prey.</p><p>The brunette wig fell off, so did the glasses. He found himself staring down into the face of Brian Highsmith\u2014easily recognizable now despite the eye makeup and bright red lipstick.</p><p>\u201cBrian, you\u2019re under arrest for the murder\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Sloan, no, please! This isn\u2019t what it looks like,\u201d Brian wailed.</p><p>By then, they had an audience. Patients, some dragging their IVs, had come out to the hall. Nurses, doctors and orderlies, as well.</p><p>Sloan got to his feet, dragging Brian up with him.</p><p>\u201cSloan, honest, I swear to you! I would never murder anyone! You have to believe me. I\u2019d never hurt Jennie. Not on purpose. No\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? It looks like you\u2019re pretending to be a nurse in order to see Jennie Layton. And since someone put her in a coma to get her here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I was trying to see Jennie. I thought\u2014hoped\u2014she might have recognized me,\u201d Brian said quickly. \u201cI never meant for anything bad to happen to her\u2014I love her like I love my grandma!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing, dressing up so you could slip in that door?\u201d Sloan demanded.</p><p>\u201cI had to see her!\u201d Brian answered.</p> <p>\u201cMommy!\u201d one of the patients cried out. \u201cThat lady is...a man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Let\u2019s go back to your room,\u201d the mother said.</p><p>\u201cHey, man, there\u2019s meds all over the floor!\u201d A skinny fellow who looked like he should be in detox said happily.</p><p>Another nurse came up. \u201cMr. Wilson, get back in your room!\u201d she told him.</p><p>One of the doctors approached Sloan. \u201cYou need to take this out of here, Sheriff. You\u2019re upsetting my patients.\u201d</p><p>Sloan spun around on him. \u201cWell, you\u2019re going to have to explain to me how an actor got into your hospital dressed as a nurse and was moving among your upset patients!\u201d he snapped.</p><p>He spun Brian around, snapping plastic cuffs onto his wrists. \u201cI will remove this man that you\u2019ve let in,\u201d he said, glowering as he marched down the hall. The county officer was standing in front of Jennie\u2019s room, trying to watch Sloan and trying to watch the hallway. Both Jimmy Hough and his mother had come out of their respective rooms. Zoe Hough was standing behind her son, a protective hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Sloan told them.</p><p>\u201cHe got in here!\u201d Zoe said with horror.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill my father?\u201d Jimmy demanded, scowling at Brian.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Brian shouted. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone! Won\u2019t anybody listen to me?\u201d</p><p>Sloan pulled his phone from his pocket and called the office. Betty answered. \u201cBetty, get Chet or Lamont down here. I need someone to pick up a prisoner. I want him held at our facility until I can get back there myself. And warn whoever\u2019s coming not to take their eyes off him for a minute. You understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sheriff, of course. Who\u2019s being picked up? Did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Brian Highsmith. I want this man in our lockup, and I don\u2019t want him getting out. No mess-ups. Get someone here now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYessir, yessir!\u201d Betty said.</p><p>He hung up his phone. Jimmy Hough, fists clenched, looked as if he was going to hit Brian with a hard right hook to the jaw. Sloan quickly stepped between them. \u201cJimmy, stop. We have to get to the bottom of this. Please, go back into your rooms. Everything\u2019s under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff, you\u2019re not leaving us, are you?\u201d Zoe asked, her eyes wide and frightened.</p><p>\u201cNot right now. I\u2019m here until I can get more help in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo as he says, please, Jimmy!\u201d Zoe told her son. Jimmy continued to stare at Brian but he moved back as his mother pushed his chest. \u201cJimmy, the law will take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed my father,\u201d Jimmy said dully.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cI swear I just came to see Jennie!\u201d Brian insisted. \u201cI was, uh, fooling around in the basement when she came down and I didn\u2019t want to get into trouble. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt her\u2014or that nice agent, Jane. I didn\u2019t want them to know I was there.... I accidentally hit Jennie too hard and I need her to forgive me. I was trying to...I was trying to talk to her, to beg her forgiveness. I\u2014I was worried about jail, but I love Jennie. I need her to forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up for now, Brian,\u201d Sloan said. His phone was ringing. He flipped it open; Logan was calling.</p><p>\u201cI found the connection,\u201d Logan said without preamble.</p><p>\u201cWhich connection?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cJay Berman. He did some work for Caleb Hough about a decade ago. I\u2019m pretty sure he put a few ranch workers in the hospital. He\u2019d been out in Arizona on another so-called vacation. That was right around the time two of Hough\u2019s workers\u2014who\u2019d demanded higher pay\u2014ended up injured. So, I\u2019m not sure who the hell killed Hough, but I\u2019ll bet Jay Berman messed up, so Hough was the one who might\u2019ve killed him.\u201d</p><p>Sloan looked at Brian. \u201cCan you get down to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away.\u201d</p><p>He hung up. Brian was shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m not a killer, Sloan. I\u2019m an actor! I was just going to plead with Jennie not to give me up so I didn\u2019t go to jail or lose my job!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBrian, people just \u2018fooling around\u2019 in the basement of the building they work in don\u2019t render old women unconscious because they\u2019re afraid of being caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. I could have lost my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian, you should lose your job for nearly killing people,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t mean to! Hey, Sloan, I\u2019m a good guy. Really. Sure, I wanted to look for the gold. That\u2019s all anyone talks about now. But I never\u2014I swear I never meant to hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>Jennie came into the hall then and confronted Brian, her face twisted in a mask of fury. She pointed a finger at him. \u201cYou tried to get in before. There was another nurse in here and she sent you to tend to another patient. God help that patient! How could you, Brian? How could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJennie, please, believe me! I came to beg your forgiveness!\u201d</p><p>Sloan was relieved to hear the sound of a siren. \u201cJennie, go back to bed. Brian, move!\u201d</p><p>He prodded Brian to the front, pulling him through reception where stares and whispers followed his every move.</p><p>As he drew Brian outside with him, he was surprised to see Betty getting out of the car.</p><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing here? I told you to send Lamont or Chet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLamont was breaking up a bar fight and Chet was dealing with some kid who was higher than a kite. He\u2019ll probably be in here in a few minutes. Talked to Scotty and he was on his way in. It sounded urgent when I talked to you,\u201d Betty said.</p><p>Sloan nodded. \u201cBetty, get him back to our offices, put him in lockup, make sure he\u2019s secure. And stay there. Scotty will be manning the office alone, since the other night guys will be back in town. It won\u2019t be that long. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I\u2019ve gotten the Hough family and Jennie calmed down enough for me to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he calls an attorney\u2014\u201d Betty began.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if he calls in all the gods on Olympus, I can have him for twenty-four hours and I want him there when I get in,\u201d Sloan told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it, Sloan. But...Brian? Brian Highsmith? What the hell were you doing, young man? And to think I enjoyed your performances!\u201d</p><p>Brian groaned. \u201cYes, I knocked Jennie out by mistake. Okay, and the agent. But I didn\u2019t kill anybody. Honest to God, I\u2019m not a killer! I just thought I\u2019d look for gold, too. I mean, I hear so much about it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetty, get him out of here,\u201d Sloan said, irritated. Betty took Brian by the arm. \u201cWait!\u201d Sloan said, accosting Brian head-on. \u201cWhat about the bones? The skull? Did you put the skull on the wig stand?\u201d</p><p>Brian turned red and pursed his lips, nodding. \u201cSheriff, I...found the trapdoor, the body. I should have reported it, but... I set up the skull. You weren\u2019t supposed to come. When Valerie screamed, I was supposed to save her. I was just trying to get lai\u2014\u201d He broke off, looking at Betty. \u201cI was trying to make Valerie see me more as a date than a coworker. The woman in the floor had been dead forever. Yeah, I figured it might be Sage McCormick. Sheriff, I know she was...that you\u2019re like her great-great-whatever grandson, but come on, she\u2019d been dead for years. More than a century. I didn\u2019t kill anyone, I swear it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou never went near Caleb Hough? Or his wife or son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever! I\u2019m here because I had to try to tell Jennie I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a nurse\u2019s uniform\u2014dressed up as a woman?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am an actor!\u201d Brian reminded him with wounded dignity.</p><p>\u201cWhether you did or didn\u2019t hurt anyone else, you almost killed Jennie and you assaulted Agent Everett. You\u2019re in it deep, Brian, and when I get back, you\u2019re going to tell me everything\u2014step by step. Betty, get him out of here!\u201d</p><p>He watched while Betty put Brian Highsmith in the backseat of her patrol car. Then, trying to get a grip on his anger, he walked back into the hospital. He called Newsome and told him what had happened, then called Logan to give him the latest and was glad to hear that Logan was nearly at the hospital. As soon as he\u2019d finished that conversation, he phoned Jane.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d she asked. \u201cBrian\u2014Brian Highsmith\u2014knocked me out and put Jennie in a coma. And he claims he didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s his story.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd he started the whole thing by putting Sage McCormick\u2019s skull on the wig stand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he was trying to scare Valerie into sleeping with him when he became the hero who saved her. Apparently, I ruined that by showing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jay Berman\u2014and the corpse in the desert? Do you think Brian killed Caleb Hough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe denies it\u2014but as he just reminded me, he is an actor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s also the fact that two people went into the Hough house and attacked Jimmy and Zoe Hough,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Jennie and the Hough family\u2014calm them down, calm myself down.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI was pretty sure that Jennie was being paranoid. Once Logan gets here I\u2019ll go back to talk to Brian.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKelsey and I will hang around the theater,\u201d she told him. \u201cMike Addison is breathing fire over the fact that we\u2019ve ripped up his wall.\u201d She was quiet for a minute. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to see this letter. Kelsey mentioned it to Logan.\u201d</p><p>When Sloan acknowledged it, she went on. \u201cTrey Hardy managed to file down some metal tubing to make sure his note was preserved. He\u2019d hoped somebody would find it if he was killed, and if so, see that his killers didn\u2019t get to Sage.\u201d She paused. \u201cOr, in the event that it wasn\u2019t found until later, I guess he wanted to set the record straight. About the gold heist. And about Sage.\u201d</p><p>Sloan felt a little numb. He wasn\u2019t used to being sentimental, but this did involve his family. Or, at any rate, an ancestor.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d like to see that note,\u201d he finally told Jane, and realized his voice was a little husky. Maybe it meant something that Trey Hardy and Sage McCormick had stayed around as ghosts all these years\u2014and were here to help out when he\u2019d needed them.</p><p>\u201cAnd while we\u2019re at the theater, we\u2019re not going to be destructive. We\u2019re going to look for the obvious,\u201d Jane assured him.</p><p>\u201cHey, did you make a likeness of our mummified corpse?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFrom the pictures I\u2019ve seen, I\u2019d say we definitely found Red Marston. I honestly believe he was trying to save Sage, too, and died for his efforts,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. We know that Trey Hardy was gunned down in a conspiracy. And I\u2019m guessing Sage and Red were killed because of possible interference\u2014or because they might talk. Since Brendan Fogerty was in on it all along, the law never caught anyone. I suspect Caleb Hough discovered that the gold was still here. He brought Jay Berman in on it and then killed Berman. The only possible reason for all these murders is that someone found some part of that gold already\u2014and means to keep it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking, Sloan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep in touch. And be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Sloan rang off and went back into the hospital. Jennie was still upset, but she was in bed again and she\u2019d been given a sedative; she clung to Sloan when he walked inside the room. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel right, Sloan. I don\u2019t feel right. Brian! And I cared about that boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe claims he loves you, too, Jennie. That he never intended to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Jennie sniffed at that. \u201cHe\u2019ll go to jail, won\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a serious assault. Yes, I imagine he\u2019ll do time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t press charges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe attacked a federal agent, as well.\u201d Sloan hesitated. \u201cHe might have murdered other people, too. We don\u2019t really know the truth yet. We only know what he\u2019s willing to admit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian Highsmith,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cHe played a villain, Sloan, and he was an atrocious flirt, but I always felt he was a good kid at heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe put you in a coma,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cBut I believe he didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d Jennie argued.</p><p>There seemed to be no arguing with her; she was still charmed by Brian.</p><p>They were both startled when they heard a sound of disgust from the doorway. Sloan saw that Zoe Hough was standing there.</p><p>\u201cHow could you say such a thing?\u201d she demanded. \u201cThat man is a killer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe,\u201d Sloan said, rising to walk over to her where she stood in the doorway. \u201cZoe, we don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe crept in here dressed like a nurse! He could\u2019ve come and killed Jimmy or me!\u201d Zoe said, obviously shaken.</p><p>\u201cZoe, he admits to what he did as far as Jennie and Jane are concerned, but denies killing anyone,\u201d Sloan told her.</p><p>\u201cBut he came into the hospital!\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, we think that whoever killed your husband also attacked you,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cDo you remember anything about him? The sound of his voice? Any details at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I remember him! I\u2019ve seen him perform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant on the day you were attacked,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>Zoe swallowed hard. \u201cI was attacked by a woman. I think. I mean, it\u2019s hard to be sure, but there was something about the scent...like perfume.\u201d</p><p>Bingo. This aligned with what Jimmy had said. It was also the first time Zoe had recalled that particular detail.</p><p>Sloan was glad when Jimmy appeared behind her, holding her shoulders. \u201cMom, come on, you\u2019re going to upset Jennie.\u201d He looked at Sloan. \u201cHe\u2019s not the man who attacked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Zoe asked aggressively.</p><p>\u201cI just do,\u201d Jimmy said. \u201cI would know.... I feel I\u2019d know. I wasn\u2019t completely out at any time. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d recognize a voice if...if I heard it right now.\u201d</p><p>Sloan was glad to see Logan as he came around the bend in the hallway. He was wearing a tailored denim shirt and jeans and an air of authority that suited him well. He approached Sloan and the small group in the hallway with a query in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading back to the office,\u201d Sloan told him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave us! Even with an officer in the hall,\u201d Zoe protested.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mrs. Hough. I\u2019ll be here with you,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI promise you I\u2019ll see to your safety and that of your son. So will the officer in the hall. The sheriff has work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis man\u2014he\u2019s going to watch all of us?\u201d Jennie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I\u2019ll be here. With all of you,\u201d Logan assured her.</p><p>Sloan tipped his hat to Logan, smiling\u2014and grateful that Jane had called her Krewe and that Logan had come.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find the truth.\u201d He met Zoe\u2019s eyes. \u201cI guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t you hurt that boy!\u201d Jennie called as he turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cNo torture, Jennie. I promise,\u201d Sloan said, making an effort not to smile.</p><p>At last he was out the door. He called the office and Scotty, the night desk deputy, picked up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in about ten minutes,\u201d Sloan told him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Scotty said. And then, \u201cWhy? What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo interrogate Brian Highsmith. He\u2019s there, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. In fact, no one\u2019s here. I came into an empty office, which was pretty surprising, but I chalked it up to the end of Silverfest. There was a note from Betty saying she\u2019d had to run out. But she isn\u2019t here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall in our troops. Tell them to start looking for Betty\u2019s patrol car. She left the hospital with Highsmith. Find her car. Find Betty\u2014and Highsmith!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on it myself\u2014\u201d</p><p>He broke off, swearing. He was still about a mile from Main Street in Old Town.</p><p>And there was Betty\u2019s car, run off the road.</p><p>He pulled his own car to the side and wrenched open the door. There was no sign of Betty in or near the patrol car.</p><p>Nor was Brian Highsmith in back.</p><p>A trail of blood trickled through the sand. Sloan followed it, his heart pounding, until it disappeared.</p><p>15</p><p>Silverfest had quieted down. There were still a number of vendors around and Desert Diamonds seemed to be doing a decent business, along with the saloon and the spa. There was a group heading out for a night ride, Jane noticed, but Heidi wasn\u2019t leading it\u2014two young men of about college age seemed to be doing it. The haunted hayride was getting ready to roll, as well.</p><p>Jane saw Henri Coque in front of the Gilded Lily, out on the street giving a lecture on the history of the theater in the United States, while Cy Tyburn and Valerie Mystro\u2014dressed in hero and heroine attire\u2014were chatting with people on the street. She didn\u2019t see Alice anywhere...and she wondered if any of them knew that Brian had been arrested.</p><p>\u201cBest time ever to sneak in,\u201d Jane told Kelsey.</p><p>The bar and restaurant had yet to open. There weren\u2019t even any kitchen workers in the old theater; there was nothing but dead silence when Kelsey and Jane walked in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It felt strange, almost eerie.</p><p>\u201cWant to check out the rooms upstairs while everyone else is outside?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jane agreed. \u201cIf they aren\u2019t all locked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe master key is in Jennie\u2019s room. I found it last night,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI\u2019ll grab that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood find!\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t need to search the Sage suite, nor Jennie\u2019s room, since Logan and Kelsey had stayed in it. They entered Brian\u2019s. Anything he might have taken\u2014such as the dueling pistols that had disappeared from Jane\u2019s bed\u2014wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>But they were equally disappointed as they went through the rest of the rooms. The pistols didn\u2019t turn up, nor did any notes, remnants of gold, hidden gold\u2014or even gold jewelry.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try the theater,\u201d Jane suggested.</p> <p>Downstairs, Kelsey admired the stage. \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable place, really,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe should move quickly. The company will be coming in soon,\u201d Jane warned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Henri going to do? He\u2019ll be missing a villain tonight,\u201d Kelsey said. She was sorting through the props on the table, then looked at Jane. \u201cHey, I think I just found your dueling pistols.\u201d</p><p>Jane walked over to the prop table. The pistols were there, in plain sight. She picked up one and then the other, handing both to Kelsey.</p><p>\u201cBlanks,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Kelsey nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re sure there was live ammunition in one of them?\u201d she asked Jane.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure\u2014and Sloan still has the live rounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess Brian was trying to kill Cy. But...why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s the hero? Because he gets the girl?\u201d Jane shrugged. \u201cAlthough, while he admits he set up the skull, he denies wanting to hurt anyone. According to Sloan, Brian was just trying to get out of the room without being seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we check the dressing rooms?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d She led Kelsey through the various rooms, showing her where Sage McCormick\u2019s body had been found.</p><p>As they walked to the next room, Jane saw something on the floor. Bending down, she touched the fresh, wet stain.</p><p>She looked up at Kelsey.</p><p>\u201cBlood,\u201d she mouthed.</p> <p>Kelsey drew her gun and Jane did the same. Kelsey counted silently to three, then nodded at Jane. Jane threw the door open.</p><p>On the floor, as if he\u2019d fallen while clutching the rack of costumes, lay a man in a pool of blood and fallen fabric.</p><p>Jane quickly fell to her knees at his side and rolled him over...and recognized Brian Highsmith.</p><p>She put two fingers on his throat to check for a pulse. It was there but weak. \u201cHe\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, Brian\u2019s eyes flew open. He stared at Jane but couldn\u2019t seem to focus. \u201cShe\u2019s dead...she\u2019s dead, too. They knew...they knew...they killed her.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed.</p><p>Jane felt for his pulse again. \u201cKelsey, I think...the bullet is in his shoulder. He might make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get a signal down here,\u201d Kelsey said urgently.</p><p>\u201cGo out to the street. Get an ambulance over here!\u201d Jane begged. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with him.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey left her, running upstairs and out to the street. As Jane tried to staunch the flow of blood, she heard something behind her. She looked up, assuming Kelsey had returned.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Kelsey.</p><p>It was one of the mannequins. An old one, from the late 1800s. She\u2019d seen it downstairs.... Jennie had claimed that a clown attacked her, but they\u2019d figured out that it had been Brian, that he\u2019d pushed a clown figure toward her....</p><p>This clown was moving\u2014alive and moving.</p><p>It lifted its arm; it held a gun and took aim at Jane.</p><p>She rolled to a corner of the room just as the bullet exploded against the dressing-table mirror. The sound of the mirror shattering was what she heard, and she realized there was a silencer on the gun.</p><p>Someone had tracked Brian down. Someone had tracked him to this room. That someone meant to kill him.</p><p>And now her.</p><p>Sloan searched up and down the road, seeking a trail of blood. While he walked, he called the office and reported that Betty and her prisoner were missing. Then he called Newsome and asked for officers to scour the streets in town, the hell with Silverfest.</p><p>He got into his car and drove slowly, searching the road for any sign of either Betty or Brian Highsmith.</p><p>He was five minutes from town when his phone rang.</p><p>Logan said, \u201cGot a call from Kelsey. She has an ambulance rushing to the theater. She and Jane found Brian Highsmith, shot and bleeding to death, in his dressing room at the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost there,\u201d Sloan told him. \u201cAny word on Betty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. I\u2019ve got another officer coming to the hospital. I\u2019ll be there as soon as he shows up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Whatever\u2019s going down seems to be going down now,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>He stepped on the gas.</p><p>As he reached the outskirts of Lily, he was forced to slow down. There was some kind of Silverfest event happening on the road.</p><p>He left the car on the edge of Main Street and started running in.</p><p>As he did, he nearly ran by a heap on the ground. He recognized what it was\u2014a body\u2014and stopped himself.</p><p>He turned and fell to his knees.</p><p>It was Betty.</p><p>His heart thundered as he carefully examined her for an injury.</p><p>\u201cBetty!\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She groaned and looked up at him. \u201cSheriff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetty, what the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was someone flagging me down...I veered off the road. Next thing I knew, someone was in front of me, spraying something in my face...I can\u2019t remember. My head...my head is killing me.... I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking. I\u2019ll get an ambulance out here.\u201d</p><p>Betty sat up. \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m fine. Go...after him. Whoever it was...took Brian. He took Brian....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetty, who the hell was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you not know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014I can\u2019t even say if it was a man or a woman\u2014was dressed up. Dressed like a...like a Plains Indian...like an Apache in buckskin...with a dark wig and makeup and a black mask. I don\u2019t know who it was...but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d reached for his phone. She set her hand on his. \u201cNo, Sloan. I\u2019m all right. Go\u2014get to the theater!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetty, you\u2019re injured\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine! I\u2019ll call for help. Go.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t trust her. Betty\u2014who\u2019d been his right hand since he\u2019d returned to Lily.</p><p>He rose, suddenly very afraid\u2014for many reasons. On many fronts. He crouched down again and pretended to make sure she wasn\u2019t shot or injured, hoping his sleight of hand was successful.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Betty,\u201d he said, and rose.</p><p>She might be innocent; she might be telling the truth.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Cops would be crawling all over the theater any minute\u2014but he felt a growing urgency to get there himself.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Betty insisted.</p><p>He did. He ran. As he raced through the streets, he looked for people he knew. He didn\u2019t see anyone. He paused just long enough to pull out his phone and call Logan. \u201cFound Betty on the road. I left her there. I\u2019m at the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see Kelsey? The ambulance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve called for backup. Was Betty shot? Dead, alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive. I don\u2019t trust her, Logan. I don\u2019t trust anything right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a few minutes. You\u2019ve also got county cops moving in. Maybe you should wait for backup.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he should.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>He burst in through the slatted doors of the theater.</p><p>Jane scrambled to get her own gun. She managed to fire a shot at the clown, but then the clown was gone. She jumped to her feet and moved carefully to the door\u2014just in time to see the clown run across stage right. Ever wary that a bullet could come tearing at her again, she pursued the clown.</p><p>She got off a shot when the clown passed ahead of her in the bar area, but he threw open the door to the basement and tore down the stairs. She walked to the doorway, determined to guard the one entry until someone could come.</p><p>Then she realized that someone was behind her. She turned, ready to fire.</p><p>Her gun went off just as she was slammed in the head. As she went tumbling down the stairs, she heard someone cry out; she might not have killed her attacker, but at least she\u2019d injured him.</p><p>It did her little good. She landed in the basement, staring up at the clown.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t released her grip on the Glock.</p><p>She lifted her gun. The clown dived to the floor, knocking the wig stand on top of her. She struggled to free herself from the hair and heads with sightless eyes.</p><p>Footsteps were heading her way down the stairs. The clown, too, was trying to get free from the wigs. She fired again; the clown rolled across the floor and into the mannequin room.</p><p>Someone was nearly on top of her, coming down the stairs\u2014and swearing in fury. Jane managed to get up and tear across the room, plowing into the rows of mannequins.</p><p>Once she was there, she went as still as she could...and she listened. Someone was breathing near her. And someone else was walking into the room.</p><p>In the near-darkness, Victorian madams stared at her, along with Mr. Hyde. A vampire held his cape above his eyes and in the dim light seemed real.</p><p>Why not? The clown was real.</p><p>And then she heard a voice she\u2019d come to know well. \u201cAgent Everett, you\u2019re harder to kill than I\u2019d thought! But you should just give it up. Those bullets won\u2019t last forever, and quite frankly, you\u2019re outnumbered. Give it up!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t breathe. When she felt movement beside her, she turned and fired. She heard a gasp and a scream and then cursing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She knew the voice. A woman\u2019s voice. She hadn\u2019t even begun to suspect that it could have been this woman!</p><p>Who was not alone.</p><p>Just how many people were involved?</p> <p>Suddenly, the mannequins were shoved at her. They all seemed to be coming at her, their faces grotesque in the shadows.</p><p>Painted faces, wooden faces, laughing faces and the leering eyes of a Dracula...</p><p>She tried to remain steady, but tripped and fell. One of the arms struck hers, and the Glock fell with her in the chaos. She hit the floor.</p><p>And something soft.</p><p>A body.</p> <p>Kelsey.</p><p>She managed to keep quiet.</p><p>\u201cHave you found your friend yet, Jane? Such a conspiracy! And so easy to figure out. I mean, Sloan was friends with Logan. They sent you in, and then Kelsey and Logan showed up. So easy when lawmakers get involved. Just like before!\u201d</p><p>Jane felt for Kelsey\u2019s pulse. She was still breathing. In the darkness, Jane patted her holster. They\u2019d taken Kelsey\u2019s gun.</p><p>She realized they\u2019d never been alone in the theater.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get you, Agent Everett! Oh, don\u2019t go thinking it\u2019s like the play\u2014that the good guy\u2019s going to save you. We\u2019ve been waiting for him, and in a few minutes, well...the gang will all be here! And the gang will all be dead!\u201d</p> <p>Sloan let his eyes adjust to the darkness. He raced to the stage and was startled to run into Cy Tyburn, who seemed to be practicing a monologue.</p><p>\u201cCy! Where is everyone? Has the ambulance come? What the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know! Everyone\u2019s supposed to be in here. What did you say? Who needs an ambulance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian. Brian Highsmith,\u201d Sloan said. He started to go backstage. As he did so he heard the familiar click of a gun.</p><p>He spun around. Cy had a Colt aimed at him. \u201cYes, go on back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to shoot me, Cy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I am. But...play your cards right, and you can hope for escape in the next few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Sloan moved toward Cy, itching to reach for his own weapon.</p><p>Cy shot the stage floor in front of him\u2014barely missing his foot.</p><p>\u201cTurn around and walk. We\u2019re going down to the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place\u2019ll be crawling with cops in about two minutes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Cy indicated the aisle along the side of the seats.</p><p>Someone was coming\u2014and he knew who it was. Betty. His trusted deputy. Sweet, older, gray-haired.</p><p>And lethal.</p><p>\u201cNo, I just talked to Scotty and I called Newsome,\u201d Betty said. \u201cOn your behalf, of course. I assured him that no ambulances were needed. You\u2019re here, and everything is under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelsey called for the ambulance. Not me. A federal agent,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know how those feds are, always trying to take control. No, I assured him that I\u2019m all right. We\u2019ve got Brian Highsmith again...and it\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil they find us all dead, of course?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve figured out the old story\u2014you and your so-called artist. So, figure this out. When we\u2019re done, it\u2019ll look like you\u2014the sheriff\u2014and Agent Jane Everett got together and plotted to take the gold for yourselves. You were going to shoot Brian and me and the others, but we\u2019re not idiots. We shot you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Who the hell is going to believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have our story down pretty well,\u201d Betty told him. \u201cSo, do you want to die alone or see your pretty agent one more time before you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I\u2019d like to say goodbye,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re going to die, I think I\u2019d like to hear how this all started. Brian wasn\u2019t involved, was he? Cy, you were the one who put live bullets in the gun, but when Jane did her little charade in the street, you really had no choice but to go along with it. But why start this whole thing? Why kill people over gold when you didn\u2019t even have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb Hough found some of it. Didn\u2019t you know? He had it\u2014and he was acting like a big shot. He called in that enforcer of his to keep the rest of us in line. Can you believe that? Caleb knew Jay Berman and probably thought we\u2019d all be afraid of him, that we\u2019d keep our mouths shut and obey his every edict. But I think Caleb felt that his own enforcer got greedy\u2014and that\u2019s why he shot Jay Berman out in the desert. Then, well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Cy. Quit being such a dramatist!\u201d Betty snapped. \u201cGet him downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot fair. Not fair if I don\u2019t know the whole story. So, let me see\u2014Caleb was holding out on you. That\u2019s why he wound up dead?\u201d Sloan asked.</p><p>\u201cGet him moving!\u201d Betty shouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m moving, I\u2019m moving.\u201d Sloan turned, hands held high, and started walking toward the front of the room as Betty indicated. She had her gun trained on him.</p><p>\u201cGo on. Go on!\u201d Betty urged, nudging him with the muzzle.</p><p>\u201cTo the basement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, smart boy!\u201d</p><p>He walked slowly. Betty might have stopped the county people from coming, but not Logan. Still, he didn\u2019t want Logan taken by surprise\u2014as he\u2019d been.</p><p>He didn\u2019t waste a lot of time cursing himself; he\u2019d made a mistake. Now he had to fix it.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you out at the mines?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat bastard, Hough!\u201d Cy said. \u201cHe had us all convinced the gold was in the mines. But it wasn\u2019t. And he admitted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if you knew where it was, why didn\u2019t you just get it and take off?\u201d Sloan asked. \u201cAnd, by the way, where is it?\u201d</p><p>Silence was his answer.</p><p>He chuckled softly. \u201cYou still don\u2019t know, do you? Let\u2019s see, Caleb showed you a sample because he was going to need help getting it. He needed a cop on his side, so he got you, Betty. And then he created a little gang of thieves, but you were so afraid of being double-crossed that you did him in. Of course, he was trying to double-cross you, wasn\u2019t he? He actually cared for his son, so that probably got in his way, didn\u2019t it? And let\u2019s see\u2014one of you was supposed to torture the truth out of him, but you lost it. Or else he fought back and you had to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet down those steps!\u201d Betty yelled.</p><p>\u201cCy,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cWhy you? Ah...you don\u2019t really have what it takes. But you were dissatisfied and Caleb saw that in you. Betty, you, too. You hated playing second fiddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Betty shouted. \u201cYou think you\u2019re so smart. You think you\u2019re right about everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I am right. You needed a cop for protection, and you needed the actors because...well, because, of course, you searched the mine shaft\u2014no luck\u2014and realized the theater was the most likely place. The gold\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet down the stairs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going. I\u2019m going!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it!\u201d someone called from below.</p><p>Jane was down there, just as they\u2019d said. But she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in with the mannequins,\u201d the voice said.</p><p>Damn! He\u2019d never suspected.</p><p>\u201cHeidi,\u201d he called. \u201cYou weren\u2019t making enough on the trail rides, huh? But working the trail rides, you were able to set up Jay Berman\u2019s body with the corpse of poor Red Marston pointing at it. Caleb didn\u2019t leave the body there. You dug it up and put it there so Caleb would know you weren\u2019t just a bunch of country hicks. You left Red pointing at him to scare Caleb, but then you killed Caleb, anyway. This is really pathetic\u2014because you still don\u2019t know where the gold is.\u201d</p><p>Sloan reached the bottom of the stairs. He tried to judge their firepower. They hadn\u2019t taken his gun, and he\u2019d seen to it that Betty\u2019s was worthless; that was what his sleight of hand had been about. But Heidi and Cy were armed\u2014and he didn\u2019t know who else might be in the basement with them.</p><p>\u201cShe can find it. She knows where it is,\u201d Heidi said. \u201cSloan, come on over here.\u201d</p><p>He walked around the fallen wig stand. The basement floor looked gruesome\u2014with the wigs and heads everywhere, it seemed to be a floor full of decapitations.</p><p>He was about four feet from the first of the mannequins in the third room. He judged his chances.</p><p>\u201cAgent Everett!\u201d Heidi called out. \u201cI\u2019m going to suggest you show yourself. You might live if you tell us where the gold is. Oh\u2014and let\u2019s see. I\u2019ll start by shooting Sloan in the foot, then the calf\u2014maybe a shoulder. Don\u2019t want to hit an artery until you come out.\u201d</p><p>And she would come out, he was afraid.</p><p>They were too confident. Heidi wasn\u2019t even looking at him. Cy was by the stairs, peering into the mannequin room. Sloan saw that Betty had her gun on him.</p><p>He reached for her in a swift movement.</p><p>She fired.</p><p>Nothing happened; he\u2019d emptied her gun.</p><p>He pulled her in front of him and pushed her toward Heidi just as Heidi fired. Heidi\u2019s bullet hit Betty, who screamed and choked.</p><p>\u201cShit, Heidi, you killed Betty!\u201d Cy cried. \u201cShe was our cop. We needed a cop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Cy!\u201d Heidi fired again.</p><p>She missed Sloan.</p><p>He\u2019d plowed into the mannequins.</p><p>They seemed to embrace him. They were everywhere.</p><p>\u201cMike, get out here!\u201d Heidi shouted. \u201cGet the hell out here and we\u2019ll just shoot until we get them all.\u201d</p><p>Mike! Mike Addison made up the last of their little club\u2014or so he hoped.</p><p>He heard a scrambling near him; he could have fired. But he didn\u2019t know if it was Jane or Mike.</p><p>He tackled the moving creature.</p><p>A clown went down before him. Mike Addison as a clown. Maybe it was fitting.</p><p>Mike had a gun. They struggled for it; it went off, but then flew across the floor and disappeared in the pile of mannequins.</p><p>When he ripped off the clown face, Mike stared up at him furiously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sloan didn\u2019t bother speaking. He slugged Mike with the hardest right to a jaw he\u2019d ever wielded in his life. Mike was silent. Lights out.</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d Heidi shouted. She began firing. She was going to hit one of them if he didn\u2019t draw his own gun. He returned fire.</p><p>Heidi screamed and ducked behind a wall. Cy Tyburn sprinted across the room, taking cover by the wall. He fired into the mannequins.</p> <p>Sloan fell to one side, trying to use a Victorian lady to shield him. Then the door burst open and he heard someone shouting.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on down here?\u201d</p><p>It was Henri Coque.</p><p>Jane had to force herself to keep silent. At first, she was afraid they had Sloan, that they\u2019d kill him or torture him if she didn\u2019t move.</p><p>But then Sloan had gotten into the mannequin room, as well.</p> <p>And she\u2019d had to keep silent\u2014because she couldn\u2019t defend herself.</p><p>She scrambled in the darkness, trying not to show herself, desperate to find her gun in the commotion. Then she heard Henri Coque.</p><p>\u201cHenri! Get down here, too. You know, Henri, you\u2019re really good at keeping this place afloat\u2014and the shows are terrific!\u201d Heidi said. \u201cBut we need you now. Come out, Sheriff. Come out, come out wherever you are, or I will kill this innocent man. And you\u2019ll have to go your whole life knowing he died because you were a coward. Hmm. Maybe we\u2019ll have to run and I can leave Henri alive. I wouldn\u2019t mind doing that. He\u2019s not a bad guy.\u201d</p><p>Jane heard movement near her. Sloan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him, Sloan. It\u2019ll all be on you!\u201d Heidi said.</p><p>She was still behind the wall. Sloan had been returning fire; she had to know approximately where he was. Heidi wasn\u2019t taking any chances. She had Henri in the center of the room. She fired\u2014and Henri screamed.</p> <p>Just then, Jane felt movement among the mannequins again\u2014but not from Sloan\u2019s direction. She turned. For a moment, she thought she was looking at another mannequin.</p><p>Then she realized she was seeing Sage McCormick.</p><p>And Sage was desperately trying to push something at her.</p><p>Jane frowned. Whatever it was glittered in the dim light. She reached for it, but Sage shoved something else at her.</p><p>Her Glock.</p><p>Jane nodded her thanks and grabbed the gun.</p><p>She had one chance.</p><p>She shoved all the mannequins toward the wall where Heidi was taking cover; Henri had been knocked over and Heidi raised her gun to shoot.</p> <p>Jane fired, and Heidi went down. She heard Cy Tyburn curse.</p><p>And then saw that he\u2019d taken aim at her.</p><p>But he never fired.</p><p>Sloan stepped from the mannequins and fired first.</p><p>Cy went down like a log.</p><p>Henri sat on the floor, sobbing. \u201cMy foot! She shot my foot!\u201d</p><p>The door burst open and Logan shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re surrounded in here! Nobody move!\u201d</p><p>Jane saw Sloan\u2019s shoulders sag slightly. \u201cI think they\u2019re all dead, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet some light!\u201d Jane shouted. \u201cGet light, quickly. Kelsey is in this mess.\u201d</p><p>She heard Logan swearing and Henri crying. In the darkness, she made her way to Sloan as he made his way to her. He took her in his arms and held her, and they were both shaking.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what happened next; suddenly there were officers everywhere. An ambulance came for Henri, who was completely dazed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to close the show tonight. I\u2019ve never closed a show. Oh, my God, I\u2019ve never closed a show. My theater....\u201d</p><p>Kelsey refused to go to the hospital. She let the ambulance driver tend to the knot on her forehead. She was humiliated that they\u2019d managed to surprise her right after she\u2019d called the ambulance and come back in to tend to Brian Highsmith.</p><p>The rest of the night involved a great deal of paperwork. And because they were law officers who\u2019d exchanged fire and killed, they had to go through additional hours of questioning. Even though there was no doubt they\u2019d been justified, it was protocol.</p><p>Not until late afternoon of the next day did they return to the Gilded Lily.</p><p>Jane and Sloan didn\u2019t talk about the case after that. They took a long shower together, one filled with tender kisses and whispered words of gratitude that they were together and unharmed. Afterward they made love with an energy and passion neither had thought they could muster.</p><p>Then they slept.</p><p>Then they made love again.</p><p>And at last, when Logan called for a team briefing, they showered once more and dressed and came downstairs.</p><p>The Gilded Lily, according to the county, could open the next day.</p><p>For that night, Logan had ordered food from across the street. They got drinks from behind the bar and sat and ate in the empty room. They talked and tried to make sense of it all, even though they\u2019d talked about it for so long already.</p><p>\u201cThe killing spree is what gets me,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cSomehow, Caleb Hough found some of the gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cI think he did find it in the mine, though, at this point, we\u2019ll never know for sure. Then he must have realized that it had to be hidden somewhere in plain sight\u2014but I think he felt he couldn\u2019t get to it himself. Seems he engaged Betty first, and then Heidi\u2014and then Mike and Cy. But one of them did something that made him distrust them. Maybe it was when Brian foolishly put that skull on the wig stand. They all thought they were betraying one another. Caleb led them to the old mine because he wanted to make sure he could trust his partners after that. He seemed to think they were after him. Brian had no idea he\u2019d started the whole rash of mistrust with that skull on the wig stand,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cI heard people creeping around my property because Mike Addison was involved\u2014and he owns the land next to mine. He was probably supposed to be keeping an eye on me, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Brian?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cThey shot him and Betty left him for dead. But he caught up with her and gave her a good knock on the head. She really was injured when I found her. And luckily, she was a lousy actress, so she was so busy playing possum she wasn\u2019t aware I took her bullets,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cWho killed Caleb\u2014and tried to kill Jimmy and Zoe?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cI believe it was Heidi. Heidi had been here all her life, and all her life, she\u2019d watched Caleb act like a rich man while she took out hayrides and shoveled manure. So far, according to Newsome, all Mike Addison is doing now is swearing that he didn\u2019t kill anyone and didn\u2019t mean to be involved with killing anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould have fooled me!\u201d Jane muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m convinced it was Heidi and Cy who went to the Hough house. Heidi seemed to have the upper hand in everything. Betty was at the station\u2014keeping an eye on me, trying to find out everything I might know,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>\u201cI guess I was semiconscious when Heidi claimed you knew where the gold was, Jane. Do you?\u201d Kelsey asked her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know. Not until last night,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>They all stared at her.</p><p>\u201cSage showed me. She wasn\u2019t trying to show me. I\u2019m not actually sure whether she knew. I\u2019d lost my gun and she helped me find it. But when she got it to me...\u201d She let her voice trail off.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d the other three demanded in unison.</p><p>\u201cWell, the stagecoach was never found because it was broken up\u2014and used to make mannequins. The gold was stuffed into the ones that were made out of wood that was part of the stagecoach. I only saw a glint of metal in the leg of one that had fallen. The leg broke on it, and you could see the gold. I\u2019m willing to bet that if they\u2019re all dismantled, the gold will be recovered.\u201d</p><p>They all just stared at her.</p><p>Sloan reached over and took her hand. \u201cSecretive, aren\u2019t we, Agent Everett? You knew that last night, and you didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night, our lives mattered. I hadn\u2019t even thought about it again\u2014didn\u2019t want to.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhat will happen to it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume most of it will go to the state,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s left would go to keep the theater open, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Brian will have to do some jail time, but that won\u2019t kill the theater,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Sloan added, \u201cValerie was innocent of everything that went on, as was Alice. Henri had no clue. He called us in because he was really indignant about the skull. But...he will need to rethink the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why was Valerie sneaking around the hospital?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to talk to Jennie. She was afraid the theater was haunted or that someone really was after the people here,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>Logan cleared his throat. \u201cActually, Henri is in trouble. Valerie\u2019s heading back to L.A. She says that as far as she knows, no one ever killed anyone over a toilet paper commercial. Alice says she\u2019ll come back\u2014but she wants a two-week paid vacation. Cy is dead and Brian...Brian won\u2019t be working for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenri will be all right,\u201d Jane said confidently. \u201cDirectors have done new shows or recast old ones since the day theater began.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gets to reopen tomorrow,\u201d Sloan murmured. \u201cI wonder what he plans to do.\u201d</p><p>The next night, Sloan couldn\u2019t believe he was standing onstage. Or rather, lying on the stage. He and Jane were now staying together at his place, and she\u2019d talked him into doing this.</p><p>Jane was a natural. She was playing the vamp who sang most of the songs and had the most lines. She was carrying him through the song they did as the vamp and the hero\u2014just as Logan and Kelsey covered him at other points.</p><p>They\u2019d done a reversal in the show; Kelsey got to save him from the train. That way, he had fewer lines.</p><p>Henri had talked Jane into persuading the rest of them. But Henri was halfway in love with Jane himself. The others had thought it would be fun; they\u2019d give Henri three days to find a new cast. They\u2019d warned him they couldn\u2019t possibly learn the lines, but he\u2019d told them it didn\u2019t matter. Ad-libbing was better than no show at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They did their performances for a week.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sloan had placed Chet in charge of the sheriff\u2019s office, and he and Lamont were interviewing for a new deputy.</p><p>Sloan wanted Chet to get in a lot of experience, because Logan had broached Sloan with a job offer.</p> <p>He and the higher-ups at the Krewe center\u2014men named Adam Harrison and Jackson Crow\u2014had decided to create a third Krewe. Logan wanted him in on it.</p><p>It was a big decision.</p><p>On the day they finished the show, he went out to his house alone. Out back, he stroked Kanga and Roo and talked to them. He told Johnny Bearclaw about the offer, and Johnny assured him that he\u2019d stay at the Arizona ranch and care for it, no matter where Sloan might be.</p><p>In the end he sat in his living room with Cougar on his lap. When he looked at the chair by the fire, he saw that his ancestor, Longman, was sitting with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do, Longman?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cMake your own decision,\u201d Longman said. \u201cYou came here when you needed to come here. You can\u2019t go back, but you can go forward. Maybe you came back for many reasons. But it\u2019s time to bury the past, all of the past. And then, as men must, go where your heart leads you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and leaned back. He still wasn\u2019t convinced Longman was real. Longman had said what Sloan felt in his own mind.</p><p>In the next few days, Jane finished the reconstructions of Sage\u2019s skull and she did a quick job with Red Marston\u2019s.</p><p>He wanted a quiet service for the two of them, but the whole town showed up at the chapel by the cemetery.</p><p>The dead were put to rest.</p><p>He lingered when the others left the graveyard; Jane stayed with him. She\u2019d never once tried to influence him to accept Logan\u2019s offer, but they were together every night\u2014as if they\u2019d always be together.</p> <p>She squeezed his hand suddenly. \u201cSloan. There they are.\u201d</p><p>He looked up. The day was dying; red streaked a darkening sky. But he could make out three forms and they slowly became clearer.</p><p>Red Marston, Trey Hardy and Sage McCormick. He stood and Jane rose with him.</p><p>One figure broke away. It was Sage. She moved among the wooden crosses and the occasional stone marker to reach them. She set a hand on his face. He felt it, like the caress of a soft and gentle fog.</p><p>Then she turned away and rejoined the others. They started walking into the darkness as the sun fell lower and lower.</p><p>Someone else was walking toward the three friends, someone who seemed to shimmer with light.</p><p>\u201cYour great-great grandfather?\u201d Jane whispered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Then they were all gone. Neither he nor Jane spoke as they left the cemetery.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s beautiful land in Virginia,\u201d she told him. \u201cNot far from Arlington. Beautiful horse ranches, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirginia. There\u2019s a lot of horse country there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is. And cats are happy just about anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHome is where the heart is, you know.\u201d</p><p>He whirled her around and kissed her as the red drained from the sky and soft shadows surrounded them.</p><p>He smiled, because she looked at him a little anxiously when they separated.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m going to be a fed,\u201d he mused.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll make you go through the academy,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cWell, they taught you to shoot!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey did.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again.</p><p>\u201cWhen do we leave?\u201d he asked.</p><p>And with those words, she threw her arms around him. </p> </body></html>"]
