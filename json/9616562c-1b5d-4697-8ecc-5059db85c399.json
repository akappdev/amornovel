Preacher wiped down the bar, and while it was only seven-thirty, it was already dark. No one in Virgin River would be out on a night like this. After the dinner hour was past, people tended to stay in on cold, wet nights. The campers and fishermen in the area would be locked down tight against the storm. It was bear-and-deer hunting season, but it was unlikely any hunters would pass en route to or from lodges and blinds at this hour in such weather. Jack, his partner and the owner of the bar and grill, knowing there would be little if any business, was tucked away with his new wife at their cabin in the woods. Preacher had also sent home their seventeen-year-old helper, Rick. As soon as the fire burned down a little more, Preacher planned to switch off the Open sign and lock the door.</p><p>He poured himself a shot of whiskey and took it over to the table nearest the fire, then turned a chair toward the hearth and propped up his feet. Quiet nights like this were to his liking. He was a solitary kind of guy.</p><p>But the peace was not to be. Someone pulled on the door, causing him to frown. It opened a little bit. The wind caught the door and it flew open with a bang, bringing him instantly to his feet. Entering and then struggling to close the door was a young woman holding a child. The woman wore a ball cap and had a heavy quilted bag slung over her shoulder. Preacher went to get the door. She turned, looked up at him and they both jumped back in surprise. She was likely startled because Preacher looked intimidating\u2014he was six foot four, bald with bushy black eyebrows, a diamond stud earring and shoulders about as broad as an ax handle was long.</p> <p>Under the bill of the baseball cap, Preacher saw a pretty young woman\u2019s face bearing a bruise on her cheek and a split lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m sorry. I saw the sign....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, come on in. I wasn\u2019t expecting anyone to be out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you closing?\u201d she asked, hoisting up her burden, a little boy, not more than three or four years old. He was asleep on her shoulder, his long legs dangling limply. \u201cBecause I...Are you closing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, stepping back for her to pass. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t have anyplace better to go.\u201d He extended an arm toward a table. \u201cSit by the fire there. Warm up. Dry off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said meekly. She went to the table by the fire, and when she saw the drink, said, \u201cIs this where you\u2019re sitting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. Take it,\u201d he said. \u201cI was having a shot before calling it a night. But there\u2019s no hurry. We don\u2019t usually close this early, anyway, but with the rain...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want to get home?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cI live here. Makes me real flexible on the hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the weather\u2019s decent, we usually stay open till at least nine.\u201d</p> <p>She took the chair facing the fire, the boy\u2019s gangly legs straddling her lap. She let her quilted shoulder bag drop to the floor and pulled the child closer, hugging him tight, stroking his back.</p><p>Preacher disappeared into the back, leaving her to warm herself for a minute. He came back with a couple of pillows from his bed and the throw from his couch. He put the pillows on the table next to her and said, \u201cHere. Lay the kid down. He\u2019s probably heavy.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him with eyes that seemed to want to cry. Oh, he hoped she wouldn\u2019t do that. He hated when women cried. He had no idea what to do. Jack could handle it. He was chivalrous; he knew exactly what to do with a woman under any circumstance. Preacher was uncomfortable around women until he got to know them. When you got down to it, he was inexperienced. Although it wasn\u2019t intentional, he tended to scare women and children simply because of how he looked. But they didn\u2019t know that underneath his sometimes grim countenance he was shy.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said again. She transferred the child to the pillows on the table. He immediately curled into a ball and put a thumb in his mouth. Preacher stood there, lamely holding the throw. She didn\u2019t take it from him so he put it over the boy and tucked it around him. He noticed the boy\u2019s cheeks were rosy and his lips bright pink.</p><p>When she reclaimed her chair, she looked around. She saw the stag\u2019s head over the front door and flinched. She turned full circle, noting the bear skin on the wall, the sturgeon over the bar. \u201cIs this some kind of hunting place?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really, but a lot of hunters and fishermen pass this way,\u201d he said. \u201cMy partner shot the bear in self-defense, but he caught the fish on purpose. One of the biggest sturgeons in the river. I got the buck, but I\u2019d rather fish than hunt. I like the quiet.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m the cook here. If I kill it, we eat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can eat deer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd we did. We had a great winter of venison. Maybe you should have a drink,\u201d he said, trying to keep his voice soft and nonthreatening.</p> <p>\u201cI have to find a place to stay. Where am I, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirgin River. Kind of out of the way. How\u2019d you find us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She shook her head and a small laugh escaped. \u201cI got off the highway, looking for a town with a hotel....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got off the highway a while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t many places wide enough to turn around,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I saw this place, your sign. My son...I think he has a fever. We shouldn\u2019t drive anymore.\u201d</p><p>Preacher knew there wasn\u2019t anyplace to get a room nearby. This was a woman in trouble; it didn\u2019t take a genius to figure that out. \u201cI\u2019ll fix you up with something,\u201d he said. \u201cBut first\u2014you want something to drink? Eat? I\u2019ve got a good soup tonight. Bean and ham. And bread. I made the bread today. I like to do that when it\u2019s cold and rainy. How about a brandy to warm you up first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr whatever you feel like...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be good. Soup would be good, too. I haven\u2019t eaten in hours. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit tight.\u201d</p><p>He went to the bar and poured a Remy into a snifter\u2014fancy stuff for this place. He hardly ever used the snifters on the usual crowd\u2014but he wanted to do something special for the girl. For sure she was down on her luck. He took her the brandy and then went back to the kitchen.</p><p>The soup was put away for the night, but he took it out of the refrigerator, ladled out a scoop and put it in the microwave. While it warmed, he took her a napkin and some utensils. By the time he got back to the kitchen, the soup was ready and he got out the bread\u2014some of his best: soft, sweet and hearty\u2014and nuked it for a few seconds. He put that and some butter on a plate. When he came out of the kitchen he saw her struggling out of her jacket, like maybe she was stiff or sore. The sight of it stopped him briefly and made him frown. She threw a look over her shoulder, as if she was caught doing something bad.</p><p>Preacher put the food in front of her, his mind spinning. She was maybe five foot five and slight. She wore jeans and her curly brown hair was tucked through the back of the ball cap like a ponytail. She looked like a girl, but he guessed she was at least in her twenties. Maybe she\u2019d been in a car accident, but it was more likely someone had smacked her around. The thought alone got him a little hot inside.</p><p>\u201cThat looks great,\u201d she said, accepting the soup.</p><p>He went back behind the bar while she ate. She shoveled the soup in, smeared the bread with butter and ate it ravenously. Halfway through with her meal she gave him a sheepish, almost apologetic smile. It tore through him, that bruised face, split lip. Her hunger.</p><p>When she\u2019d sopped up the last of her soup with the last of her bread, he returned to her table. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, it\u2019s okay. I think I\u2019ll have some of this brandy now. I sure appreciate it. I\u2019ll be on my way in a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he said, and hoped he didn\u2019t sound harsh. It took a while for people to warm up to him. He transferred her dishes to the bar, clearing her place. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anywhere around here to get a room,\u201d he said when he returned to the table. He sat down across from her, leaned toward her. \u201cThe roads aren\u2019t so good out this way, especially in the rain. Really, you don\u2019t want to head back out there. You\u2019re kinda stuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no! Listen, if you\u2019ll just tell me the closest place...I have to find something....\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it easy,\u201d he said. \u201cI got an extra room. No problem. It\u2019s a bad night.\u201d Predictably, her eyes widened. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s got a lock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m kind of scary-looking. I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I know how I look. Works great on guys. They back right off.\u201d He gave her a small smile, not showing any teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a car....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, I couldn\u2019t stand to think of you sleeping in a car!\u201d he said. \u201cSorry. Sometimes I sound as bad as I look. But no kidding\u2014if the kid\u2019s not feeling so good...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Probably makes you wonder, huh? But I\u2019m way safer than I look. You\u2019d be okay here. Better here than at some hotel on the freeway, guaranteed. A whole lot more okay than out in that storm, trying to deal with those mountain roads.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him hard for a minute. Then she said, \u201cNo. I\u2019m just going to press on. If you\u2019ll tell me how much\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty rough-looking bruise you have there,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cCan I get you anything for that lip? I have a first aid kit in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cHow about if we settle up and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything for a kid\u2019s fever. Except a room. With a lock on the door so you feel safe. You don\u2019t want to pass up an offer like that in this weather, with a kid who might be coming down with something. I look big and mean, but I\u2019m about as safe as you get. Unless you\u2019re wildlife.\u201d He grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look mean,\u201d she said timidly.</p><p>\u201cIt can make women and little kids real nervous\u2014and I hate that part. You on the run?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She lowered her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019you think? I\u2019m gonna call the cops? Who did that to you?\u201d</p><p>She immediately started to cry.</p><p>\u201cAw. Hey. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She put her head down on folded arms on the tabletop and sobbed.</p><p>\u201cAw. Come on. Don\u2019t do that. I never know what to do.\u201d Hesitatingly, squeamishly, he touched her back and she jumped. He touched one of her hands, very lightly. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t cry. Maybe I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever know,\u201d he said, lightly patting her hand.</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted, I guess. It was an accident. It was really stupid, but I was struggling with Chris\u2014\u201d She stopped suddenly and looked around nervously, as though worried about being overheard. She licked her lower lip. \u201cI was trying to get Christopher in the car, hanging on to stuff, and I opened the door right into my face. Hard. You shouldn\u2019t be in a hurry, you know? It was just a little accident. It\u2019s fine.\u201d She lifted the napkin to her nose.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cSure. Too bad about that. Looks sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it will. So\u2014what\u2019s your name?\u201d When she didn\u2019t answer for a long moment, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not going to repeat it. If anyone came looking for you, I\u2019d never mention seeing you.\u201d Her eyes grew round and her mouth stood open slightly. \u201cOh, damn, that was the wrong thing to say, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cAll I mean is, if you\u2019re hiding or running, it\u2019s okay. You can hide or run here. I won\u2019t give you up. What\u2019s your name?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She reached out and ran her fingers gently through the boy\u2019s hair. Silent.</p><p>Preacher got up and flipped off the Open sign and threw the latch on the door. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, sitting down with her again, the little boy taking up much of the table beside them. \u201cTry to take it easy,\u201d he said softly. \u201cNo one here\u2019s gonna hurt you. I can be a friend. I\u2019m sure not scared of the weak dick who\u2019d do that to a woman. Sorry.\u201d</p> <p>She looked down to avoid eye contact. \u201cIt was the car door....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot afraid of any mean old car door, either,\u201d he said.</p><p>She gave a little huff of laughter, but had trouble looking him in the eye. She picked up her brandy with a slightly trembling hand and lifted it to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYeah, there you go,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cIf you think the boy needs a doctor tonight, there\u2019s one right across the street. I could go get him. Or take you over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s just coming down with a cold. I\u2019m keeping a close eye on him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf he needs medicine or something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s okay....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy buddy, the guy who owns this place, his wife is a nurse. A special nurse\u2014she can give medicine, see patients.... She takes real good care of the women around here. She\u2019d come in ten minutes. If a woman makes a difference, under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCircumstances?\u201d she asked, a panicked look floating across her features.</p><p>\u201cCar door, and all that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Really. It\u2019s just been a long day. You know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, must\u2019ve been. And the last hour or so off the freeway, that must\u2019ve been pretty awful. If you\u2019re not used to those roads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little scary,\u201d she admitted softly. \u201cAnd not having any idea where I am...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in Virgin River now, that\u2019s what matters. It\u2019s just a little crimp in the road, but the people are good. Help out where they can. You know?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a small, shy smile, but her eyes were downcast again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked again. She pursed her lips tight, shaking her head. Her eyes welled up again. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said softly. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige,\u201d she whispered, a tear running down her cheek. \u201cPaige,\u201d she repeated in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s good. That\u2019s a pretty name. You can say your name around here without being afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJohn,\u201d he said, then wondered why he had done that. Something about her, he guessed. \u201cJohn Middleton. No one calls me John, though. I\u2019m known as Preacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a preacher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said with a short laugh. \u201cWay far from it. The only one ever to call me John was my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your father call you?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cKid,\u201d he said, and smiled. \u201cHey, kid,\u201d he emphasized.</p><p>\u201cWhy do they call you Preacher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d he said, ducking shyly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I got the nickname way back, when I was just a kid in the Marine Corps. The boys said I was kinda straitlaced and uptight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, not really,\u201d he said. \u201cI never used to curse at all. I used to go to mass, when there was a mass. I grew up around priests and nuns\u2014my mother was real devout. None of the boys ever went to mass, that I remember. And I kind of hung back when they went out to get drunk and look for women. I don\u2019t know...I never felt like doing that. I\u2019m not good with women.\u201d He smiled suddenly. \u201cThat should be obvious right away, huh? And getting drunk never really appealed to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have a bar?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jack\u2019s bar. He watches over people real good. We don\u2019t let anybody out of here if they\u2019re not safe, you know? I like a shot at the end of the day, but no reason to get a headache over it, right?\u201d He grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cShould I call you John?\u201d she asked him. \u201cOr Preacher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want. Yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, I like that. Been a while since anyone called me that.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes for a moment, then raised them again. \u201cI really appreciate this, John. You staying open and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. Most nights we\u2019re open later than this.\u201d Preacher inclined his head toward the boy. \u201cHe going to wake up hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said. \u201cI had some peanut butter and jelly in the car, and he went through that pretty fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, there\u2019s an extra room upstairs, right above the kitchen. You help yourself in the kitchen\u2014I\u2019ll leave a light on for you. Anything you want. There\u2019s milk in the refrigerator. And orange juice. Cereal, bread, peanut butter, more of that soup in the fridge and a microwave. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige, you look like you could use some rest, and if the boy\u2019s coming down with something, you don\u2019t want to take him out in that cold, wet mess.\u201d</p><p>She thought about it for a second and then said, \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>He laughed in spite of himself, then sobered quickly. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to laugh. It\u2019s just that\u2014it\u2019s my old room. It\u2019s not a hotel room or anything. I lived up there for two years, but then Jack and Mel got married and I got his apartment out back. That room over the kitchen\u2014smells a little like bacon and coffee in the morning, but it\u2019s a good size, with a big bathroom. It would do for a night.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cJust being a good neighbor. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s generous,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not putting myself out any\u2014it\u2019s an empty room. Glad to help out.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cGot a suitcase I can get for you or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one, on the backseat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it for you. You get your brandy there,\u201d he said. \u201cGive yourself another shot if you need it. If I were you, I\u2019d need it, after driving through these hills in the rain.\u201d He stood up. \u201cBring it with you and I\u2019ll show you the room. Upstairs. Um\u2014you want me to carry the kid up for you?\u201d</p><p>She stood, as well. \u201cThanks.\u201d She stretched her shoulders\u2014as if stiff from a long drive. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, so you don\u2019t worry, your room and my apartment aren\u2019t even connected\u2014we\u2019re separated by the kitchen and stairs. You just lock your door and rest easy.\u201d He gently and clumsily lifted the little boy into his arms. His head went onto Preacher\u2019s shoulder and it felt odd. Preacher didn\u2019t have a lot of experience with carrying around children, but he liked the way it felt. He gave the boy\u2019s back a few long, slow strokes. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>He led the way through the kitchen and up the back staircase. He opened the door and said, \u201cSorry. It\u2019s kind of a mess. I left some things up here, like my weights. But the sheets are clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get out first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. If you need a couple of days, we can work it out. Like I said, it\u2019s not exactly for rent or anything. Just sits empty. I mean, if the kid\u2019s got a little bug or something...\u201d</p><p>He laid the boy gently on the bed, strangely reluctant to put him down. The warmth of the child against his chest was comforting. He couldn\u2019t resist touching his floppy blond hair. Beautiful little kid. \u201cHow about some car keys? Might as well go get that suitcase....\u201d</p><p>She dug around in her quilted bag, which looked kind of like a diaper bag, although the boy was too big for diapers. She passed him the keys.</p><p>\u201cJust be a minute,\u201d he said.</p><p>Preacher went to her car, a little Honda, and got in. He had to put the seat all the way back and his knees still rubbed against the steering wheel. He pulled it around to the back of the building and parked it beside his truck where it couldn\u2019t be seen from the main street in case someone was looking for her. He wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d explain that\u2014he wouldn\u2019t want her to be afraid.</p><p>He plucked the suitcase out of the back; it was way too small for someone who was taking a trip. It was the right size for someone getting out with the clothes on her back.</p><p>When he was back in the upstairs room, she was sitting tensely on the edge of the bed, her son behind her. He put down the suitcase, placed the keys on the bureau right inside the door and shuffled a little in the doorway. She stood up and faced him. \u201cLook. Ah. I moved your car\u2014put it right out back by my truck. Off the street. It\u2019s out of sight from the road now. So if you get up or look out, you\u2019re not confused about that\u2014it\u2019s right out back. I recommend you sit tight, wait out this rain, travel in dry daylight. But if you get\u2014you know\u2014nervous, the bar only locks on the inside and here are your keys. It\u2019s no big deal if you...Like if you can\u2019t relax and have to leave, it\u2019s no big deal if the bar door\u2019s left unlocked\u2014this is a real quiet, safe place. Sometimes we forget to lock up, anyway. I\u2019ll get it locked for sure tonight, you and the kid being here. Um...Paige...you don\u2019t have to be worried or anything. I\u2019m a pretty reliable guy. Or else Jack wouldn\u2019t leave me with the bar. Okay? Just get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and it was barely a sound.</p><p>He pulled the door closed. He heard her move the dead bolt, protecting herself. For the first time since coming to this little town, he wondered why that dead bolt had ever been installed.</p><p>He stood there a minute. It had taken him about five seconds to conclude someone\u2014ninety-eight-percent chance a boyfriend or husband\u2014had belted her in the face and she was on the run with her kid. It wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t know that stuff happened. It happened all the time. He just never understood what satisfaction a man could get out of hitting a woman. It made no sense to him. If you have a pretty young woman like that, you treat her right. Hold her safe against you and protect her.</p><p>He went to the bar, turned off the lights, checked the kitchen, leaving a light on in case she came downstairs, then went to his apartment behind the kitchen. He was only there a few minutes when it occurred to him that there were no longer clean towels up there\u2014he\u2019d emptied the bathroom and moved all his downstairs. He went to the bathroom, gathered up a stack of clean white towels and went back upstairs.</p><p>The door was open a crack, like maybe she\u2019d already been down to the kitchen. He could see a glass of orange juice sitting on the bureau inside the door and it pleased him that she\u2019d helped herself. Through that space of an inch, he saw her reflection in the bureau mirror. Her back faced the mirror and she had pulled her bulky sweatshirt up over her head and shoulders, trying to get a glimpse of her back and upper arms in the mirror. She was covered with bruises. Lots of big bruises on her back, one on her shoulder and upper arms.</p><p>Preacher was mesmerized. For a moment his eyes were locked on those purple splotches. \u201cAw, Jesus,\u201d he whispered in a breath.</p><p>He quickly backed away from the slit in the door and got up against the wall outside, out of sight. It took him a moment to collect himself; he was stricken. Horrified. All he could think was, what kind of animal does something like that? His mouth hung open because he couldn\u2019t imagine this. He was a warrior, a trained fighter, and he was pretty sure he hadn\u2019t done that much damage to a man equal to him in size, in a fair fight.</p><p>Some instinct kicked in that told him he shouldn\u2019t let on that he\u2019d seen. She was already afraid of everything, including him. But there was also the reality that this wasn\u2019t a woman who\u2019d been smacked. She\u2019d been pummeled. He didn\u2019t even know the girl, yet all he wanted was to kill the son of a bitch who\u2019d done that to her. After five or eleven months of beatings, then death for the sorry bastard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t know he was feeling that; it would scare her to death. He took a few deep breaths, composed himself. Then he tapped lightly on the door.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he heard her say, sounding startled.</p> <p>\u201cJust some towels,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOne second, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time.\u201d</p><p>Momentarily she opened the door a tiny bit farther, her sweatshirt back in place.</p><p>\u201cI forgot, I took all the bathroom stuff out,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll need some towels. I\u2019ll leave you alone now. Won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you. John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Paige. Get some good rest.\u201d</p><p>Paige pulled the bureau carefully, as quietly as possible, in front of the door. She really hoped John hadn\u2019t heard that, but as close as she could figure out, the kitchen was right beneath this room. And\u2014if the man meant her or Christopher any harm, he could have already delivered it, not to mention that a locked door and empty bedroom dresser couldn\u2019t possibly keep him out.</p><p>As much as she\u2019d have liked a hot soak in a tub, she felt too vulnerable to get naked. She couldn\u2019t talk herself into the shower, either\u2014she might not hear the doorknob rattle or Christopher call out to her\u2014so she washed up in the sink and put on clean clothes. Then, leaving the bathroom light on, she lay carefully on the bed, on top of the covers. She knew she wouldn\u2019t sleep, but after a little while she calmed down. She stared at the ceiling, the wood slats forming a perfect V over her head. What came to mind was that this was the third time in her life she\u2019d lain in bed looking at such a ceiling.</p><p>The first time was in the house she grew up in\u2014the beams were bare, pink insulation puffing out between them. The house was small, only two bedrooms, and already old when her parents moved in, but the neighborhood had been clean and quiet then, twenty years ago. Her mother moved her into the attic when she was nine; she shared her space with boxes of stored household goods pushed back against one wall. But it was her space, and she escaped to it whenever she could. From her bed she could hear her mother and father arguing. After her father\u2019s death when she was eleven, she could hear her older brother, Bud, argue with their mother.</p><p>From what she had learned about domestic battery in the last few years, she should have expected to end up with an abuser, even though her father never hit her or her mother, and the worst she ever got from Bud was a shove or slug in the arm. But man, could the men in her family yell. So loud, so mad, she wondered why the windows didn\u2019t crack. Demand, belittle, insult, accuse, sulk, punish with the meanest words. It was just a matter of degrees; abuse is abuse.</p> <p>The next time she had found herself staring at a ceiling like this one was after she left home. She\u2019d gone to beauty school after high school and stayed home with her mother, paying rent, until she was twenty-one. Then she and two girlfriends\u2014also beauticians\u2014rented half an old house. Paige had happily taken the attic bedroom, though it wasn\u2019t even as large as her childhood room and most of the time she had to crouch to keep from hitting her head on the slanted walls.</p><p>Tears came to her eyes because she remembered those two years with Pat and Jeannie as the happiest in her life. Sometimes she missed them so much it made her ache. Three hairdressers, mostly broke after rent, food and clothes\u2014it had seemed like heaven. When they couldn\u2019t afford to go out, they\u2019d buy popcorn and cheap wine and make a party of it at home, gossiping about women whose hair they cut and frosted, about boyfriends and sex, laughing till they couldn\u2019t sit up straight.</p><p>Then Wes came into her life, a successful businessman, six years older. It was shocking to realize he\u2019d been the age she was now\u2014twenty-nine. Yet he\u2019d seemed so worldly, mature. She\u2019d been styling his hair for only a couple of months when he asked her out and took her to a restaurant so fine the hostesses were better dressed than she was. He drove a brand-new Grand Prix with cushy leather seats, darkly tinted windows. And he drove too fast, which at twenty-three didn\u2019t seem dangerous. It was thrilling. Even though he yelled at and flipped off other drivers, it seemed his right\u2014he was powerful. By her standards, rich.</p><p>He had a house already, which he didn\u2019t even have to share with roommates. His career was trading stocks and commodities; an exhausting job that required brilliance and high energy. He wanted to go out every night, bought her things, pulled his wallet out of his pocket and said, I don\u2019t know what you really want, what little thing would just make you cry it\u2019s so perfect, so I want you to shop for yourself. Because you being happy is the only thing that matters to me in the world.\u201d He\u2019d peeled off a couple of bills and handed her two hundred dollars, a veritable fortune.</p><p>Pat and Jeannie didn\u2019t like him, but there was hardly a mystery in that. He wasn\u2019t all that nice to them. He treated them like wallpaper, furniture. Answered their questions with one word when he could. In fact, she couldn\u2019t remember what they said about him when they tried to warn her off.</p><p>Then came the insanity of her life spiraling out of control that to this day seemed impossible: he\u2019d hit her before they married, and she\u2019d married him anyway. They\u2019d been in his fancy car, parked, having an argument about where she was living\u2014he thought she\u2019d be better off at home with her mother rather than that old half a house in a questionable neighborhood with a couple of dykes. It got pretty nasty; she\u2019d said her share of ugly things to him. He said something like, \u201cI want you with your mother, not in some little whorehouse in the ghetto.\u201d</p><p>Just who the fuck do you think you are, calling where I live a whorehouse?</p><p>How do you use that language with me?</p> <p>You called my best friends dykes and whores and it\u2019s my language you criticize?</p><p>I\u2019m just thinking about your safety. You said you wanted to marry me someday, and I\u2019d like you to still be around when that happens!</p><p>Well up yours, because I love living there and you can\u2019t tell me what to do! And I\u2019m not marrying anyone who can talk about my best friends like that!</p><p>There was more. More. She vaguely remembered calling him a bad name, like prick or asshole. He called her a bitch, a difficult bitch. In any case, they both contributed, she was sure of that.</p><p>He\u2019d slapped her, open palm. Then he immediately broke down, collapsed, cried like a baby, said he wasn\u2019t sure what had happened to him, but maybe it was because he\u2019d never been in love like this before. It was wrong, he knew it was wrong to overreact that way, he was crazy, he was ashamed. But...he wanted to hold her in his arms every night, take care of her for the rest of her life, never lose her. He apologized for what he\u2019d said about the roommates\u2014maybe he was jealous of how loyal she was to them. In his mind he couldn\u2019t see past her; there was no one in his life he valued like he valued her. He loved her so much it made him nuts, he said. She was the first person he\u2019d ever felt that way about. Without her, he was nothing!</p><p>She believed him. But she never used profanity around him again.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t told Pat and Jeannie because even though she was stupid about what was happening, she knew better than to risk their further disapproval. It only took her a couple of days to get over that slap. It wasn\u2019t much of a slap. It didn\u2019t take more than a month for her to almost forget it happened and trust him again; she thought him handsome, exciting, sexy. He was edgy and confident. Smart. Passive men couldn\u2019t get the kind of success he had. She wasn\u2019t attracted to passive men.</p><p>Then he said, \u201cPaige, I don\u2019t want to wait. I want us to get married as soon as you\u2019re ready. A nice wedding\u2014screw the cost, I can afford whatever you want. Ask Pat and Jeannie to stand up for us. And you can quit your job\u2014you don\u2019t have to work anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her legs hurt; she was getting bunions. Fixing hair six days a week was no easy job, even though she had liked it. She\u2019d often thought how much more she\u2019d like it if she only had to do it about six hours a day, four days a week, but that seemed an impossible dream. She could barely make ends meet as it was, and her mother had been working two jobs since her father died. In her mother, she saw her future\u2014alone, weak and worked to death. A picture of her surly roommates wearing pretty satin at her wedding, smiling, envious of her good fortune and the cushy life she\u2019d have. And she\u2019d said yes.</p><p>He hit her again on the honeymoon.</p><p>Over the next six years she\u2019d tried everything\u2014counseling, police, running away. He got out of jail right away, if they even bothered to take him in; he found her in hiding, and it just got worse. Even her pregnancy and Christopher\u2019s arrival hadn\u2019t stopped the abuse. She discovered by accident that there might be a little more to this equation\u2014a certain chemistry that gave him such energy to work those long hours and wear himself out keeping track of her, the fits of euphoria, the skull-splitting temper\u2014some white powder in a small vial. Cocaine? And he took something his personal trainer gave him, though he swore it wasn\u2019t steroids. A lot of traders used amphetamines to keep up with the demands of the job. Cocaine users tended to be reed-thin, but Wes was proud of his body, his build, and worked hard on his muscles. A coke and steroid regimen, she realized, could make his temper hair-trigger short. She had no idea how much, how long. But she knew he was crazy.</p><p>This was her last chance. Through a shelter she\u2019d met a woman who said she could help her get away, change her identity and flee. There was an underground for battered women and children in hopeless situations. If she and Christopher could just get to the first contact, they would be passed along from place to place, collecting new ID, names, histories and lives along the way. The upside was\u2014it worked a lot. It was nearly foolproof when the woman followed instructions and the children were young enough. The downside was, it was illegal, and for life. Life like this, covered in bruises, afraid she\u2019d be killed every day\u2014or a life of being someone else, someone who isn\u2019t hit?</p><p>She started squirreling away money from her grocery allowance and packed a bag that she hid with a contact from a shelter. She managed almost five hundred dollars and fully intended to get herself and Christopher out before another bad episode occurred. With the last beating, she knew she was nearly too late.</p><p>And here she was, looking at her third V-shaped ceiling. She knew she wouldn\u2019t sleep; she\u2019d hardly slept in six years. No worries about the drive\u2014with so much adrenaline going on, she\u2019d make it.</p><p>But then she woke up to sunlight and a regular thwacking noise outside. Someone was chopping wood. She sat up cautiously and smelled coffee. She had slept after all. And so had Christopher.</p><p>The dresser was still pushed against the door.</p><p>Two</p><p>Preacher barely slept. He spent half the night on the computer. It was like this little machine was invented for him, because he liked to look things up. He had been trying to get Jack to put the inventory and receipts on the computer, but Jack had a clipboard that was like an extension of his arm and wanted nothing to do with Preacher\u2019s technology. It was slow, there being no cable hookup out here, but he was patient. And it got the job done.</p><p>The rest of the night was spent trying to catch some sleep, which eluded him completely. He got out of bed several times and looked out the back window to see if the little Honda was still there. He finally got up for the day at five, when it was still black as pitch outside. He went into the kitchen, started the coffee, laid a fresh fire. There was no sound from upstairs.</p><p>The rain had stopped, but it was overcast and chilly. He\u2019d have liked to go ahead and split logs, work off some aggression, but Jack liked doing that, so he let it go. At six-thirty, Jack came into the bar, all smiles. This was the happiest man in Virgin River since he got married. It was as if he couldn\u2019t stop grinning.</p><p>Preacher stood behind the bar with his coffee mug and lifted his chin in greeting to his best friend. \u201cHey,\u201d Jack said. \u201cGood rain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d he said. \u201cListen. I did something...\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged out of his jacket and hung it on the peg inside the door. \u201cPee in the soup again, Preacher?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got a woman upstairs....\u201d</p><p>Pure shock settled over Jack\u2019s face. Preacher didn\u2019t have women around. He didn\u2019t prowl, didn\u2019t flirt, didn\u2019t do any of that. Of course, Jack didn\u2019t really know how he lived like that, but this was Preacher. When the guys, the Marines they had served with, were all out looking for women to pass the night with, Preacher stayed behind. They jokingly called him the Big Eunuch. \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Preacher took down a mug and filled it for Jack. \u201cShe came in last night, during the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s got a kid with her\u2014little,\u201d he said, measuring with his huge hands. \u201cKid might be coming down with something. He\u2019s got a fever, she said. I gave her my old room because there\u2019s no place to stay around here....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jack said, picking up his coffee. \u201cThat was nice of you. I guess. She steal the silver or anything?\u201d</p><p>Preacher made a face. They didn\u2019t have silver; the only thing worth stealing was the cash, locked up tight. Or liquor\u2014way too much trouble for a woman with a kid. Not that any of that ever crossed his mind. \u201cShe\u2019s probably in some trouble,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cShe\u2019s got...Looks like maybe she\u2019s been in some trouble. Maybe she\u2019s running or something.\u201d</p> <p>Again, Jack was shocked. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Preacher stared hard into Jack\u2019s eyes. \u201cI think she needs some help,\u201d he said, when in fact he knew she needed help. \u201cShe\u2019s got a bruise on her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cMel coming in to Doc\u2019s?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs to have a look at the kid\u2014make sure he\u2019s not sick. You know. And the woman\u2014Paige\u2014she says she\u2019s all right, but maybe...Maybe Mel can\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014be sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said, taking a sip from his mug. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>Preacher shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna want to get out of here, I think. She\u2019s all skittish. She seems scared. I want her to at least see Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. Ask her to let Mel have a look. But I can\u2019t make her, you know. I think you should do it. Talk to her, suggest it to her....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, Preach, you can handle this. It\u2019s your deal\u2014I haven\u2019t seen her or anything. You just talk to her. Quiet and soft. Try not to scare her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already scared, which is how I figure she\u2019s in some trouble. The kid hasn\u2019t seen me yet, though\u2014he was asleep. He\u2019ll probably run screaming.\u201d</p><p>At seven-thirty Preacher fixed up a tray with some cereal in bowls, toast, coffee, orange juice and milk. He went up the back stairs and gently tapped on the door. It opened immediately. Paige had showered and dressed. She wore the same jeans and a long-sleeved chambray shirt. A little black-and-blue spot peeked out from the opened collar and Preacher immediately felt steamed up, but he tried to keep it from showing on his face. Instead, he focused on her eyes, which were a deep emerald-green, and her damp hair, which fell in curly tendrils to her shoulders. \u201cMorning,\u201d he said, trying to keep his voice quiet and soft, like Jack would.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been up forever,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d came a voice from behind her. He looked past her and saw the little kid, Christopher, sitting cross-legged in the middle of the bed.</p><p>She opened the door for Preacher and he came in, putting the tray on the bureau just inside the door. He stayed by the door and gave the kid a nod. He tried to relax his features into softness, but wasn\u2019t sure how to do that. \u201cHey, little buddy. You want some breakfast?\u201d</p><p>The kid shrugged, but his round eyes were wide and focused on Preacher.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not so good with men,\u201d Paige whispered softly. \u201cShy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Preacher asked. \u201cMe, too. Don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ll stay back.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the child and tried out a smile. Then the kid pointed at Preacher\u2019s head and said, \u201cYou hafta shabe that?\u201d</p><p>It made Preacher laugh. \u201cYeah. Wanna feel?\u201d he asked. He approached the bed slowly, carefully, bending his bald head toward the kid. He felt a small hand rub over his dome and it made him laugh again. He raised his head and said, \u201cCool, huh?\u201d And the kid nodded.</p><p>Preacher went back to Paige. \u201cMy buddy\u2019s wife, Melinda, she\u2019s coming to Doc\u2019s this morning and I wanna take you over there. Let her have a look at the kid, make sure he\u2019s okay, and if he needs medicine or anything, she\u2019ll fix you right up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a nurse, you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. A special nurse. A midwife. She delivers babies and that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Paige said, a little more interested. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a good idea. But I don\u2019t have much money\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWe don\u2019t worry about things like that around here, if someone could use a little help. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good. Come on downstairs when you\u2019re ready. Mel will be over there about eight, but take your time. Not too many people get sick around here and they\u2019re not usually busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Then we\u2019ll press on....\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, if you need to, you can stay a couple of days. I mean, if he\u2019s not feeling so well. Or, if you\u2019re tired from driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably just get back on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you headed?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou never mentioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little farther. I have a friend...We\u2019re going to visit a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, but if it had been just a little farther, she\u2019d have kept going. \u201cWell, you think about it. Open offer.\u201d</p><p>While Christopher sat cross-legged on the bed to eat cereal, Paige leaned toward the mirror, dabbing makeup on her purple cheek, covering it as best she could. It had at least lightened somewhat. But there was nothing she could do about the split lip, which was scabbing over. Christopher would touch it and say, \u201cMommy\u2019s owie.\u201d</p><p>Her mind wandered back to that last beating. The part that still shook her was not being able to remember what had really started it. Something about Christopher\u2019s toys being strewn all over the family room, and then Wes\u2019s suit not back from the dry cleaners. He wasn\u2019t happy about what she\u2019d made for dinner. Or was it what she had said about the toys? \u201cJesus, Wes, he has toys\u2014he plays with them. Just give me a minute...\u201d Had he slapped her then? No, right after that, when she muttered, under her breath, \u201cDon\u2019t get excited, don\u2019t get mean, just let me do it....\u201d</p><p>How could she not know that he\u2019d react like that? Because she never knew how he would react. They\u2019d had months of no violence. But she had seen it in his eyes when he came home from the office. It was already there\u2014eyes that said, I\u2019m going to hit you and hit you and hit you some more and neither of us will know exactly why. As usual, by the time she zoned in on that dangerous gleam, it was too late.</p><p>She had started spotting then, in danger of losing the baby\u2014the new baby that she\u2019d recently told him about. Big surprise\u2014since he had kicked her. So she dragged herself out of the bed and went to pick up Christopher at day care. The girl behind the desk, Debbie, had gasped when she saw Paige\u2019s face. Then she stammered, \u201cM-Mr. Lassiter asked us to call him if you came for Christopher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Debbie. Maybe you could forget to call him. Just this once. Maybe for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to hit you,\u201d she had said boldly.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Lassiter, maybe you should call the police or something?\u201d</p><p>And Paige had laughed hollowly. Right. \u201cI guess you think I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>At least she\u2019d gotten out of town. With her one suitcase, almost five hundred dollars and an address in Spokane.</p><p>And here she was, waking up under another V-shaped ceiling. Still scared to death, but at least in the moment, apparently safe.</p><p>While Christopher ate, she poked around a little, not touching anything. It wasn\u2019t a real big room, but there was enough space for Preacher\u2019s bench and weights. She looked at a couple of barbells on the floor\u2014sixty pounds each. On the press he had stacked four hundred pounds; Wes had bragged incessantly about his two-fifty.</p><p>There was a medium-size bookcase against the wall, full, books stacked on the floor beside it and on top. She held her hands behind her back; force of habit\u2014Wes didn\u2019t like her touching his things, except his dirty laundry. Weird titles\u2014the biography of Napol\u00e9on, World War Two warplanes, medieval armies. Hitler\u2019s Occupation\u2014 that sent a chill through her. Most of them were pretty worn, old. Some new. She couldn\u2019t spot a fiction title\u2014all nonfiction, all military or political subjects. Maybe they had belonged to his father or an uncle. He didn\u2019t exactly look like a big reader, though he sure looked like a weight-lifter.</p><p>When Chris was done with his breakfast, she put on his jacket, then her own, picking up the quilted bag to hang over her shoulder. She left the suitcase, packed, on the bed and carried the breakfast tray down the back stairs. John was in the kitchen wearing an apron, flipping sausage patties, an omelet pan steaming over a high flame. \u201cGo ahead and set that down right on the counter and give me one minute,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could wash these up,\u201d she said meekly.</p><p>\u201cNah, I got it.\u201d Paige watched as he pressed the patties with his big spatula and sprinkled cheese on the omelet, then deftly folded and flipped it. Toast popped up, was buttered and everything put on a large oval plate. He took off his apron and hung it on a hook. He was wearing jeans and a black T-shirt that was stretched so tight across the broad expanse of his chest it looked like it should split. The biceps on the man were like melons. If he\u2019d been wearing a white T-shirt, he\u2019d look like Mr. Clean.</p><p>He plucked a denim jacket off the peg and shrugged into it. He picked up the plate and said, \u201cCome on,\u201d and walked into the bar. He put the plate down in front of a man who sat at the bar, quickly refilled the man\u2019s coffee and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes. Here\u2019s the pot. Jack\u2019s out back if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>Paige stole a look out the back door window where she saw a man in jeans and a plaid flannel shirt hefting an ax over his head and bringing it down to split a log. That had been what woke her. She took note of the muscular shoulders and broad back\u2014not as pronounced as John\u2019s, but still impressive.</p><p>Wes was not nearly as big as either of these men; he was about six feet and in good shape, but as for muscles, nothing by comparison, even with his chemical assistance. If John raised a fist to a woman the way Wes had done, she wouldn\u2019t live to tell about it. She shuddered involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cLook, Mommy,\u201d Chris said, pointing to the mounted stag\u2019s head over the door.</p><p>\u201cI see. Wow.\u201d The place did look like a hunting lodge.</p><p>John stuck his head out the back door and yelled, \u201cJack! I\u2019m walking over to Doc\u2019s. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned toward her and gave a nod. He opened the door for her to follow him outside. \u201cHow\u2019s he feeling this morning?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHe ate breakfast. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d John agreed. \u201cThe fever?\u201d he whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a thermometer with me, so I\u2019m not sure. He feels a little warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to let Mel check, then,\u201d he said, walking alongside her but careful not to get too close. She held her son\u2019s hand, but Preacher put his in his pockets. He glanced at the boy; the boy glanced around his mother at him. They eyed each other warily. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he said to her. \u201cMel\u2019s the best. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Paige looked up at him, smiled sweetly, and it made him feel all soupy inside. Her eyes were so sad, so scared. She couldn\u2019t help it, he understood that. If it weren\u2019t for the fear, he might actually take her hand to give her courage\u2014but she wasn\u2019t just afraid of whoever did that to her. She was afraid of everything, including him. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous,\u201d he said to her. \u201cMel\u2019s very kind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not nervous,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAfter I introduce you, I\u2019ll go back over there. Unless you want me to stay? In case you need me for anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Melinda sat on Doc\u2019s front steps with her morning coffee, listening to the loud crack of Jack\u2019s ax as he split logs. He had called her when he got to the bar and said, \u201cPut a wiggle in it, babe. Preacher\u2019s got a patient for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cSome woman stumbled into the bar last night during the storm and he put her up for the night. Says she\u2019s got a kid who might be feverish. And he also said he thinks she might be in trouble....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? What kind of trouble?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t even seen her yet. He gave her his old room, upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be along shortly.\u201d Out of instinct, she put her digital camera in her bag. Now, watching the front of the bar, she saw something she had never expected to see. Preacher held the door for a woman and a child and walked them across the street. He seemed to be talking to her in soft tones, leaning close, a concerned look on his face. Amazing. Preacher was a man of so few words. Mel thought she remembered being in town for a month before he said ten words in a row to her. For him to take in a stranger like this was both very like him, yet so unprecedented.</p><p>As they neared, Mel stood up. The woman appeared to be in her twenties with a dark stain on her cheek that she\u2019d tried to cover with makeup. She couldn\u2019t cover the split lip, however. There\u2019s the trouble Preacher had seen. It made Mel wince. But she smiled and said, \u201cHi. Mel Sheridan.\u201d</p><p>She faltered. \u201cPaige,\u201d she finally said, then looked over her shoulder nervously.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Paige,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cYou\u2019re safe with Mel. Everything with her is top secret. She\u2019s ridiculous about it.\u201d</p><p>Mel laughed as if amused. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not ridiculous. This is a doctor\u2019s office, a medical clinic. We\u2019re confidential, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s very simple. Standard.\u201d She reached out to shake Paige\u2019s hand. \u201cNice to meet you, Paige.\u201d</p><p>Paige took the offered hand and looked over her shoulder at Preacher. \u201cThank you, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn?\u201d Mel asked. She laughed lightly. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard anyone call you John.\u201d She tilted her head a bit. \u201cKind of nice. John.\u201d Then she said, \u201cCome with me, Paige.\u201d And she led the way.</p><p>Inside the house they passed by Doc, who sat at the reception desk behind a computer. He looked up briefly, gave a nod, then went back to his work. \u201cThat\u2019s Doc Mullins,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThis way.\u201d She opened an exam room door and let Paige precede her into the room. She closed the door and said, \u201cI\u2019m a nurse practitioner and midwife, Paige. I can have a look at your son if you\u2019d like. Now, I understand you suspect a fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of warm. Not too much energy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a look,\u201d Mel said, briskly taking charge. She bent down and asked the little boy if he\u2019d been to the doctor before. She hefted him up on the exam table, showed him the digital thermometer and asked him if he knew what to do with that. He pointed to his ear and Mel laughed happily. \u201cYou\u2019re an expert at this,\u201d she said. She picked up the stethoscope and asked, \u201cMind if I listen to your heart?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to tickle, but it\u2019s hard for me, because tickling is kind of fun\u2014I just love hearing the giggles.\u201d On cue, he laughed, though softly. Mel let him listen to his own heart, then hers. She palpated his lymph nodes while he listened to his chest, his leg, his hand. She looked in his ears and throat, and by the time she\u2019d gotten that far he was already getting comfortable with her.</p><p>\u201cI think he might have a little virus\u2014doesn\u2019t seem to be too serious. His temp is only a hundred. Have you given him anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChildren\u2019s Tylenol, last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, then he\u2019s in pretty good shape. His throat looks a little red. Keep up the Tylenol, lots of fluids. I don\u2019t think you have to worry. If he gets worse, of course...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s safe to just keep driving...?\u201d</p><p>Mel shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Paige. Want to talk about you? I\u2019m here to help, if I can.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze instantly dropped and that was really all it took. Mel knew where this was going. She\u2019d spent years in a big-city emergency room, and had seen more than her share of battery victims. The bruise on the young woman\u2019s face, the split lip, the fact that she wanted to keep driving...away...</p><p>Paige lifted her gaze. \u201cI\u2019m a little pregnant. And spotting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a couple of bruises?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>Paige averted her gaze and nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Would you like me to have a look?\u201d</p><p>Paige looked down. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut what about Chris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not to worry. I\u2019ve got that covered.\u201d She bent at the waist and smiled into Christopher\u2019s handsome brown eyes. \u201cYou like to color, buddy? Because I have a ton of coloring books and crayons.\u201d He nodded shyly. \u201cGood. Come with me.\u201d She helped the little guy down off the exam table and with the other hand, pulled a gown out of the cabinet and handed it to Paige. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put on this gown. I\u2019ll give you a few minutes. And try not to be afraid. I\u2019ll go slow, be gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...Are you leaving him alone?\u201d Paige asked.</p><p>\u201cMore or less.\u201d Mel laughed. \u201cI\u2019m leaving him with Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems a little...shy...around men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Doc\u2019s good with kids, especially the shy ones. He\u2019ll just make sure this guy doesn\u2019t do surgery or run away. Beyond that, it\u2019s just coloring. At the kitchen table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do it all the time, Paige. It\u2019ll be okay. Try not to worry.\u201d</p><p>Mel took Christopher to the kitchen, and after setting him up with coloring books and crayons, she refilled her coffee. Decaf. She wasn\u2019t enjoying coffee nearly as much these days. Then she went to the office and got out a new patient form. Given the situation she believed she faced, she would examine the patient first before frightening her with paperwork. Clipboard in hand, she asked Doc to keep an eye on the child in the kitchen while she performed a pelvic.</p><p>Being a few months pregnant herself, Mel had a sick feeling at the thought of anyone hitting a pregnant woman. It never ceased to amaze her that a man could live with himself after doing something like that. Forms on her clipboard, her small digital camera in her shirt pocket, stethoscope around her neck, coffee in hand, she tapped on the door and heard Paige softly say, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>She put the clipboard and her coffee on the counter and said, \u201cOkay, then...Let\u2019s get your blood pressure first.\u201d She picked up the blood pressure cuff and went to apply it to Paige\u2019s arm and was frozen. There was a huge hematoma that covered much of her upper arm.</p><p>Mel put the cuff aside and gently pulled the gown away from Paige\u2019s back; she had to concentrate not to gasp. She pulled the gown over Paige\u2019s shoulder, down her arm, exposing the bruises on her back, arm, chest. She carefully lifted the gown at the bottom, exposing her thighs. More bruises. She looked at the girl\u2019s face. Tears glistened on her cheeks. \u201cPaige,\u201d Mel said in a whisper. \u201cMy God...\u201d</p><p>Paige put her hands over her face. Shame at having let it happen.</p><p>\u201cHave you been raped?\u201d Mel asked gently.</p><p>She shook her head, tears flowing. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d she asked. Paige just closed her eyes and shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re safe right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband,\u201d she answered in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re running away from him?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me help you lie down, slowly. Carefully...Are you all right?\u201d Paige nodded, not making eye contact, and reclined on the exam table. Mel gently moved the gown around. Her chest, breasts, arms, legs\u2014all covered in bruises. Mel palpated her abdomen and Paige winced. \u201cDoes it hurt here? Here?\u201d When Paige nodded or shook her head, Mel moved on. \u201cHere? Here?\u201d Mel gently rolled her from one side to the other\u2014her buttocks were bruised, as were her lower back and upper thighs. \u201cAny blood in your urine?\u201d she asked, and Paige shrugged. She didn\u2019t know. \u201cThe only way I can get a clean urine specimen if you\u2019re spotting is with a catheter, Paige. Would you like me to do that? Just to be sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God...Do you have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s check what we can, first. Any chance you\u2019ve had an ultrasound with this pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even been to the doctor yet,\u201d she said.</p><p>Another symptom, Mel thought. Battered women didn\u2019t take care of themselves, or their pregnancies, out of fear.</p><p>Paige sucked on her sore bottom lip, staring at the ceiling through glassy eyes while Mel examined her. \u201cOkay, let me help you sit up. Easy does it.\u201d Mel listened to Paige\u2019s heart, looked in her ears, checked her head for lumps and lacerations. \u201cWell, Paige, you don\u2019t appear to have broken bones. At least none that I can detect. I wouldn\u2019t mind getting an X ray of your ribs, just to be sure, since you have some tenderness there, but with you being pregnant and all...Frankly, if it were up to me, I\u2019d admit you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No hospitals. I can\u2019t have any records of any kind....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, but realize, this looks very scary. How heavy is the bleeding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too bad. Less than, say, a period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, lie back and slide down. I\u2019ll be as gentle as possible.\u201d</p><p>When she was in the position, Mel pulled on her gloves and took her stool. She touched the inside of Paige\u2019s thigh before touching her external genitalia. \u201cI\u2019m not going to use a speculum for this exam, Paige. Just a pelvic to estimate the size of the uterus. If you have any discomfort at all, please tell me.\u201d She inserted two fingers, gently pressing down on her lower abdomen with the other hand. \u201cDo you know how far along you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust over eight weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. When we\u2019re done here I\u2019ll have you take a pregnancy test. If the fetus was still viable\u2014alive\u2014as of a day or so ago, it should come out positive, but it won\u2019t tell us much about the past twenty-four hours, I\u2019m afraid. I don\u2019t have an ultrasound, but there\u2019s one a couple of towns over that we use when necessary. But...One thing at a time. Uterus is normal for an eight-week pregnancy.\u201d Mel made a derisive sound. \u201cPaige, you\u2019ve been through such a lot.\u201d She removed her gloves and offered her hand. \u201cCan you sit up for me, please?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Paige sat up and Mel took her stool, looking up into her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re how old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-nine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand how hard it is in situations like yours to get help, but I\u2019m wondering if you tried to call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done that,\u201d she said very softly. \u201cI\u2019ve done everything. Police, restraining orders, shelters, moving out, counseling...\u201d Then she laughed. \u201cCounseling,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had the counselor in love with him in five minutes.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go too well after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to kill me one of these days. One of these days soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he threatened to kill you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She looked down. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said again, softly.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find Virgin River?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cI think...I got lost. I got off the highway looking for a place to stay, to eat. And I got lost. I was going to turn around when I saw the town, the bar.\u201d</p><p>Mel took a breath. Time for a reality check. Not only was it hard for the battery victim to make charges stick if the police weren\u2019t called to the scene right away, half the time the victim bailed the abuser out of jail in fear for her life. And it wasn\u2019t an idle threat\u2014abusers did kill their victims. All the time. \u201cPaige, I worked in emergency medicine in Los Angeles before coming up here and, unfortunately, I have some experience with situations like yours. We have to get you some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to get away,\u201d she said with a sniff of emotion she was trying desperately to contain. \u201cThen I got lost, Chris wasn\u2019t feeling good, I\u2019m so sore I could hardly drive another minute...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d Mel asked.</p> <p>Paige hung her head, shaking it, and said, \u201cTo a friend he doesn\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here a few days. Let\u2019s see how you\u2019re doing before\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shot to Mel\u2019s. \u201cI can\u2019t! I\u2019m in a hurry now! I\u2019m already behind schedule! I have to\u2014\u201d She stopped suddenly. She seemed to gather herself up and try to speak with composure. \u201cI have to get where I\u2019m going before he can report me missing. Before my car is being\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re okay,\u201d Mel said calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Paige. Leave your car behind the bar, out of sight. When it\u2019s time to go, take a butter knife out of the kitchen, to loosen the screws on the license plate holders. Switch plates with someone. If you don\u2019t speed, drive erratically or get in an accident, no reason for a highway patrolman to run your plates.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNo one around here will notice switched plates for weeks. Months. I\u2019d never even look.\u201d</p><p>While Mel spoke, Paige stared into her eyes and her mouth dropped open slightly in surprise. \u201cDid you just suggest I steal someone\u2019s...?\u201d</p><p>Mel smiled. \u201cOh! Did I use my outside voice? I should watch that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act like you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI did a little community service in a shelter once. It killed me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt tore me up. But I learned a couple of things. Just let me say this\u2014it\u2019s worse if you rush. If you hurry. You might drive too fast, drive too sore or tired. Take a few days, heal a little, let the boy\u2019s fever go down. Then do it smart. Wherever you\u2019re going\u2014it\u2019ll be there in a few days or a couple of weeks. You\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if he finds me here...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my Lord, if he finds you here, I seriously don\u2019t like his chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a gun, too. Though he\u2019s always kept it locked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandgun?\u201d Mel asked, and Paige nodded. Mel actually heard herself let out a breath of relief. Mel, who had been so afraid of guns before coming to Virgin River. There weren\u2019t many handguns here, but there were a lot of guns that could kill a bear with one shot. Or blow a man in half. \u201cThere is so much you don\u2019t know about our men. Okay, with your permission, I\u2019d like to take some pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Mel touched her forearm. \u201cJust as a record, Paige. I promise you, what happens to them will be entirely up to you, but we should have a record for your use, in case you decide you need it. I\u2019m not going to ask your last name or where you came from, all right? I\u2019ll make up a chart without a last name but I\u2019ll date it. I\u2019ll take some pictures with a digital camera. And if you can be convinced to stay put for a day or two, I\u2019d like to take you to Grace Valley for an ultrasound\u2014see how that baby\u2019s doing. Just stay long enough to be sure your injuries aren\u2019t any more serious than I can tell from this exam. By now you know\u2014while you\u2019re under Preacher\u2019s care, no one can hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said...John said I could stay a couple of days. But he\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s what?\u201d Mel asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a little scary.\u201d</p><p>Mel chuckled. \u201cNo, he\u2019s a lot scary. Looking. First time I saw him, I was afraid to move. But he\u2019s been my husband\u2019s best friend for something like fifteen years now, his partner in that bar for more than two. He\u2019s gentle as a lamb. He takes a little getting used to.... But he\u2019s so good,\u201d she added softly. \u201cHis heart...It\u2019s so big. As big as he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could come out to our place,\u201d Mel offered. \u201cWe could find another bed. Or stay here in the clinic. We have two hospital beds upstairs for patients. But Preacher can protect you better than Doc or I can, I guarantee that. Whatever you decide\u2014just so you\u2019re comfortable. Now, I\u2019m going to slip the gown off your shoulder a little bit,\u201d Mel said, pulling the camera out of her shirt pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ll make this as painless as possible.\u201d She pulled the gown off her shoulder slightly. \u201cThere we go,\u201d she said softly, snapping. She put the gown back up. Then she went to the other shoulder, slowly, gently, quickly getting the picture. One body part at a time; her back, her thighs, her arms, her chest above her breasts. Last, her face, and in that picture, Paige\u2019s eyes were closed.</p><p>After the pictures were taken, Mel asked for a complete medical history. \u201cBut with no last name. It\u2019s only for medical purposes, so you can be treated if it becomes necessary. After we\u2019re done, you should lie down. Where would you like to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Christopher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll nap a little bit. Or we can keep an eye on him. Between us\u2014my husband, me, Preacher, Doc\u2014we can keep him occupied. Girl,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have no idea what a piece of luck it was that you stumbled into Virgin River. This place doesn\u2019t have so much by way of technology or shopping, but you won\u2019t find a town with more heart.\u201d She smiled. \u201cOr better food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to burden my problems on this little town,\u201d she said miserably.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mel said, gently touching her hand, \u201cyou would hardly be the first.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>Jack was behind the bar having coffee while one of his breakfast regulars was eating when Paige and Christopher came in. Paige stopped inside the door, looking across the room tentatively. Jack gave a small smile and a nod. \u201cPreacher\u2019s in the kitchen,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked down as she walked past him into the kitchen. Jack gave her a few minutes, refilled Harv\u2019s cup, then went to the kitchen. Preacher was alone; he\u2019d just lifted a rack of glasses out of the dishwasher. \u201cIf you say it\u2019s okay, she\u2019s going to stay a couple of days. Till the kid feels better,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cIs that all it is?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cShe in some trouble?\u201d</p><p>Preacher shrugged and put the rack on the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know her, Preacher. Don\u2019t know who did that to her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about who,\u201d he said. \u201cJesus. I\u2019d love to see who.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want her to stay, she stays. I\u2019m just saying...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your place,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cDo I make you feel like that? That it\u2019s my place? Because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cYou\u2019re good that way, even if it really is your place. I just don\u2019t want you to make her...them...feel bad about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t screw with me. You know I consider us partners. This is your place, too. That\u2019s your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d Preacher took the rack of glasses out to the bar.</p><p>Jack followed. \u201cIf you\u2019re okay here, I\u2019m going to step out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Jack walked across the street to Doc\u2019s. There were no patients, but Doc and Mel were inside the front door where, behind the reception counter, Doc was sitting at the desk, eyes focused on the computer.</p><p>Mel stood behind Doc, her hand on his shoulder. She looked up when Jack entered and inclined her head slightly, indicating he should come behind the counter. Her eyes were so troubled and angry, he went toward them. Mel glanced back at the computer screen.</p><p>Jack had never done anything like this before; Mel had never pulled him into her medical business, even though confidentiality was as safe with Jack as with either of them. She didn\u2019t confide medical issues with her husband because that was an ethic she was firm about.</p><p>There on the screen were the pictures from the digital. Paige\u2019s battered body was on display in many different angles. The bruises were astonishingly bad. If he saw bruises like that on Mel, it would be impossible for him to keep from killing someone.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d he said in a breath. He wondered if Preacher knew there was a lot more to his houseguest than a little bruise on her cheek.</p><p>Mel looked up at her husband and saw the grim set of his jaw, the pulsing of a vein in his temple. His narrow eyes. \u201cThis goes no further,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you understand why you\u2019re standing here, looking at this with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. She\u2019s at the bar. Preacher wants her to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should know, I told her she could stay with us if she wanted to. I think she feels okay at your bar, especially since I vouched for Preacher. We have to get her some help or this beast will kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You think Preach knows how bad this is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. I\u2019m not sharing this with him, but you need to know what\u2019s going on if she\u2019s under your roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur roof,\u201d he said. Mel and the baby\u2014they were his life. He couldn\u2019t imagine laying anything but a loving hand on her. \u201cYou know anything about her? Because I don\u2019t want Preacher getting used. Or hurt.\u201d</p><p>Mel shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where she came from. But I don\u2019t think Preacher\u2019s the one you have to worry about at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already caught up in this. Taking it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good for him. She needs someone to take this on. And Preacher can take care of himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we just went over that.\u201d</p><p>Mel leaned against Jack and he put his arm around her. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it, and I\u2019ve seen a lot,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cThis is one dangerous son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you in over your head, either,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSave it. I have a job to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is really bad, Mel,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEven more reason why I\u2019d better do my job.\u201d</p><p>Preacher was surprised that Paige came back from Mel deciding to stay a couple of days. She seemed so hell-bent to take off. She took Christopher upstairs in the morning and there hadn\u2019t been a sound from up there. They missed lunch altogether. But, he reasoned, if the kid didn\u2019t feel good, maybe he\u2019d sleep extra long, which would give his banged-up mother a needed rest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>During the quiet of the afternoon was when he usually got dinner ready, but today he got out one of his older cookbooks. He had great admiration for Martha Stewart, even though most of her recipes were too fussy for a bar. But he liked the real old-fashioned ones\u2014old Betty Crocker, Julia Child\u2014before everyone started eating light and watching their cholesterol.</p><p>He looked up cookies.</p> <p>Preacher didn\u2019t know a lot about kids, and there wasn\u2019t much call for cookies in a bar, but he had tender memories of his mother making cookies. She had been a little tiny thing. Tiny, high-principled, soft-spoken but stern, and real shy\u2014he\u2019d inherited the shy part, probably. His dad had died when he was young, but he hadn\u2019t been a big guy, either\u2014just average. And here came Preacher. More than nine pounds at birth, almost six feet by the seventh grade.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have cookie stuff on hand. But he had flour, sugar, butter and peanut butter\u2014a good thing. Those ingredients would make the soft, sweet kind of cookies, anyway. While he was mixing the dough and rolling little brown balls he found himself thinking about the sight of his mother and him sitting together in mass\u2014her narrow shoulders, high-buttoned dress, graying hair pulled into a proper bun at the nape of her neck. And he, beside her, taking two spaces in the pew by the time he was fifteen. While he was gently pressing the little balls flat with a fork, he chuckled to himself, remembering when she taught him to drive. It was one of the only times he heard her raise her voice, get all flustered and upset. His feet were so big and his legs so long, he was rugged on the accelerator, the brakes. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, John! You have to be gentler! Slower, more graceful! I should have sent you to ballet lessons instead of football! It was a surprise she didn\u2019t die of a heart attack, riding with him.</p><p>She did die of a heart attack a little while later, the summer before Preacher\u2019s senior year in high school. She didn\u2019t look like the kind of woman with a weak heart, but how would anyone know? She never went to the doctor.</p><p>Preacher was working on his second tray when he glanced up and saw that little blond head, peeking at him from the bottom of the stairs. \u201cHi,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cYou sleep?\u201d Christopher nodded. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cFeel better?\u201d Chris nodded again.</p><p>Watching the boy\u2019s face, Preacher slowly pushed a fresh-baked cookie across the counter with one finger until it was at the edge. It was a good minute before Chris took one step toward the cookie. Almost another full minute before his little hand touched it, but he didn\u2019t take it. Just touched it, looking up at Preacher. \u201cGo ahead. Tell me if it\u2019s any good.\u201d</p> <p>Chris slowly pulled the cookie off the counter and to his mouth, taking a very small, careful bite.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d Preacher asked. And he nodded.</p><p>So Preacher set him up a glass of milk right where the cookie had been. The boy nibbled that cookie in tiny bites; it took him so long to finish it that Preacher was pulling out the second cookie sheet and taking off the cookies before he was done. There was a stool on the other side of the counter near the milk and eventually Chris started trying to get up. But he had some stuffed toy in his grip and couldn\u2019t make the climb, so Preacher went around and lifted him up. Then he went back to his side of the counter and pushed another cookie toward him. \u201cDon\u2019t pick it up yet,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hot. Try the milk.\u201d</p><p>Preacher started rolling peanut butter dough into balls, placing them on the cookie sheet. \u201cWho you got there?\u201d he asked, nodding toward the stuffed toy.</p><p>\u201cBear,\u201d Christopher said. He reached his hand toward the cookie.</p><p>Preacher said, \u201cMake sure it\u2019s not too hot for your mouth. So\u2014his name\u2019s just Bear?\u201d Christopher nodded. \u201cSeems like maybe he\u2019s missing a leg, there.\u201d</p> <p>Again the boy nodded. \u201cDoesn\u2019t hurt him, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a break. He ought to have one, anyway. I mean, it wouldn\u2019t be the same as his own, but it would help him get by. When he has to go for a long walk.\u201d</p><p>The kid laughed. \u201cHe don\u2019t walk. I walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t, huh? He should have one for looks, then.\u201d He lifted one of his bushy black brows. \u201cThink so?\u201d</p><p>Christopher lifted the small, worn brown bear. \u201cHmm,\u201d he replied thoughtfully. He bit the cookie and immediately opened his mouth wide and let the sloppy mouthful fall onto the counter. For a second his look was stricken. Maybe terrified.</p><p>\u201cHot, huh?\u201d Preacher asked, not reacting. He reached behind him, ripped off a paper towel and whisked away the spit-out. \u201cMight want to give it about one more minute. Have a drink of milk there. Cool down the mouth.\u201d</p><p>They communed in silence for a while\u2014Preacher, Chris, the three-legged bear. When Preacher had all his little balls rolled, he began mashing them with his fork, perfect lines left, then right.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that yer doing?\u201d Christopher asked him.</p> <p>\u201cMaking cookies. First you mix the dough, then you roll the balls, then you smash them with the fork, nice and easy. Then they go in the oven.\u201d He peered at Chris from underneath the heavy brows. \u201cI bet you could do this part. If you were careful and went nice and slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to come around here, let me lift you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay,\u201d he said, putting his bear on the counter, getting off his stool and coming to Preacher.</p><p>Preacher lifted him up to sit on the edge of the counter. He helped him hold the fork and showed him how to press down. His first solo attempt was a little messy, so Preacher helped him again. Then he did it pretty well. Preacher let him finish the tray, then put it in the oven.</p><p>\u201cJohn?\u201d the boy asked. \u201cHow many of them we gotta do?\u201d</p><p>Preacher smiled. \u201cTell you what, pardner. We\u2019ll do as many as you want,\u201d he said.</p><p>Christopher smiled. \u201c\u2019Kay,\u201d he said.</p><p>Paige came slowly awake, her first realization being that she\u2019d slept so hard, she\u2019d drooled on the pillow. She sleepily wiped her mouth and turned her head to look at Christopher, only to find his side of the bed empty. She sat up with a sudden start that jolted her bruised and sore body. She got up and looked around the bedroom quickly, but he wasn\u2019t there. She went down the stairs in her stocking feet. When she got to the bottom, she stopped suddenly.</p><p>Chris was sitting up on the counter, John standing beside him. They were both rolling brown dough into small balls. She crossed her arms over her chest and watched. John had heard her come down and smiled at her. He gave Chris a nudge and inclined his head toward Paige, so Chris turned.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re makin\u2019 cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cJohn said Bear needs a leg\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been getting along fine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor looks,\u201d Christopher said.</p><p>Paige thought that Bear had been looking pretty awful for a long time now. But for the first time in too long, Christopher looked okay.</p><p>When Rick came to work after school, it was just Preacher in the kitchen, working on dinner. Rick, now seventeen, had been Jack\u2019s shadow since Jack first came to town. Preacher came not long after and it was a three-some. Rick lived with his widowed grandmother, his parents long dead, and the guys took him on, let him help in the bar, taught him to hunt and fish, helped him buy his first rifle. Sometimes he was a pain\u2014talked too much. But he\u2019d only been a kid in puberty then\u2014zits trying to beat out freckles\u2014and a little hyper. He\u2019d grown taller in the years since, filled out, quieted down. After about a year of building, the bar opened and they put him to work there.</p><p>\u201cRick. You need a briefing,\u201d Preacher told him.</p><p>\u201cYeah? What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a woman and kid upstairs in my old room. I\u2019m looking out for them. Kid doesn\u2019t feel so hot right now\u2014he might be coming down with something. They\u2019re staying awhile. Looks like maybe...Well,\u201d Preacher said, struggling with the words. \u201cShe\u2019s got a bruised face, a cut lip. I think she ran into some trouble and she\u2019s on the move. So...We\u2019re not going to say their names around, just in case someone\u2019s looking for her. Her name\u2019s Paige, the kid\u2019s name is Christopher\u2014but we\u2019re not going to say names for a while. And they\u2019re going to stay until they feel better. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly God, Preach,\u201d Rick said. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I\u2019m looking out for them.\u201d</p><p>Preacher had no experience with children and wasn\u2019t planning on having his own. He was thirty-two and hadn\u2019t had a single serious relationship with a woman. He figured he and Jack would fish, run the bar, hunt a little, have regular reunions with the squad, but he couldn\u2019t see life changing much. That Jack fell in love and got married hadn\u2019t upset Preacher\u2019s expectations because he thought Mel was the best. It just hadn\u2019t changed his own life. One of the reasons he liked Virgin River\u2014it was less obvious he\u2019d always be alone.</p><p>Then his life began to change in days. Really, in hours.</p><p>Christopher would run down the stairs in his pajamas before his mother could grab him, stop him. He liked to eat his breakfast at the kitchen counter and watch while Preacher diced vegetables, shredded cheese and whipped eggs for omelets. Then there was sweeping to do, and Chris liked having his own broom. There was that bear skin and mounted buck\u2019s head\u2014which he needed to be lifted up to touch. They got some coloring books and crayons from Mel\u2019s clinic so Chris had something to do while Preacher worked on lunch or dinner. And there were more cookies to bake than there were to eat\u2014cookies were not exactly bar food. Then, amazingly, Paige helped with the washup in the kitchen\u2014probably to be near Chris, who wanted to be with Preacher, and maybe a little to earn her keep. He found this not only helpful, but awful pleasant.</p><p>Paige needed to rest, though at first she was reluctant to leave her child in John\u2019s care. She seemed to get beyond that nervousness, probably because she was usually near and Chris seemed to be relaxed. And on the fourth day of her stay, at Mel\u2019s convincing, she actually left Chris with Preacher while she went somewhere with Mel. Preacher made no speculation of where they were going\u2014he was just flattered that she had come to trust him enough to babysit without supervision.</p><p>But still, he used the time to his advantage.</p><p>Preacher had been on the Internet, learning about domestic abuse and California law regarding the same. He had done this late at night because there were things he needed to understand about her situation, her terrible bruises, her flight. First of all, it didn\u2019t matter if it were a husband or boyfriend, either were equally dangerous. Then there was lots of stuff about how she could be cited with parental kidnapping if she\u2019d taken a man\u2019s child away, even after what had been done to her, and how whoever beat her up could be let off with misdemeanors the first couple of times, but the third time was a felony, which carried a prison sentence.</p><p>He also read about the psychology of this syndrome, how you could be sucked in, manipulated, terrified\u2014and suddenly find yourself in a life-threatening situation. Battered women who were threatened with death if they told, if they fled, if they fought back\u2014were often killed. It chilled Preacher to the bones.</p><p>So, while Chris was napping and Paige was off somewhere with Mel, Preacher called one of his best friends from the Corps, one of the guys who came up to Virgin River regularly when they gathered for fishing, hunting and poker. Mike Valenzuela was LAPD\u2014a sergeant in the gangs division. Too bad he couldn\u2019t be in the domestic violence division. Preacher called him, told him about Paige.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know I happened to see,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cIt was just a little crack in the door and I saw her in the mirror, and Jesus...She was so beat up, it\u2019s amazing she\u2019s not dead. She\u2019s running for her life, man. She ran to get her three-year-old kid out of there. So how is it he can file kidnapping charges against her and get her back?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cParental kidnapping.

She wouldn\u2019t necessarily have to go back alone. Hey, how into this woman are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, man. I\u2019m just trying to help out. That little kid\u2014he\u2019s a good little kid. If I could help with this, even a little, it would make me feel like I\u2019d done something that mattered. For once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreach.\u201d Mike laughed. \u201cI was with you in Iraq! You mattered damn near every day, for God\u2019s sake! Hey\u2014where did you learn all this stuff about battery DV? Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a computer,\u201d Preacher answered. \u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone but Jack have a computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Mike laughed.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing I can\u2019t get online\u2014I wanna know who she is, how guilty he is, and what\u2019s the best way to go here. All I know is her license plate....California plate...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Preach. I\u2019m not supposed to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you be curious?\u201d Preacher asked. \u201cBecause there could actually be a crime in here somewhere. All you have to do is look, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Preacher,\u201d Mike said. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s not good news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be the truth?\u201d Preacher asked. \u201cBecause I think that might be important here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mike said. \u201cMight be.\u201d</p> <p>Preacher swallowed hard and hoped it would be okay. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cGo ahead and hurry, huh?\u201d</p><p>Paige had gone with Mel to Grace Valley where Dr. John Stone examined her and performed an ultrasound, showing her a small, beating heart in a little mass that didn\u2019t look anything like a baby. But it gave her hope. She had gotten out in time. Barely in time.</p><p>The pregnancy was an accident, of course. Wes didn\u2019t want children. He hadn\u2019t wanted Christopher\u2014it interfered with his focus, which was his job and his possessions, Paige being chief among them. Perhaps this new baby precipitated the beating; she\u2019d only told him a couple of days before. In fact, she\u2019d been terrified to tell him. But then, if he didn\u2019t want it, why put her through so much? Why not just suggest termination?</p><p>The larger question was how could Paige be so relieved to learn the baby had survived when Wes\u2019s merest touch repelled her? She was, that\u2019s all. But then, she\u2019d come to think of her son as the one good thing that could come out of the biggest mistake of her life. Have you been raped? Mel had asked. Oh, no\u2014not rape. She wouldn\u2019t dare tell Wes no...</p><p>When she got back to Virgin River, she found Chris making bread with John, kneading and punching the dough, laughing.</p><p>Such an uncomplicated scene, she thought. So many times when Wes was stressing out and getting himself all worked up about his job, the financial pressures of their lifestyle, she had told him that simplifying things would actually appeal to her. No, she didn\u2019t want to be dirt poor and worked to death, but she could be so content in a smaller house with a happier husband. Not long before Chris had been born, Wes bought the big house in an exclusive, guarded, gated L.A. community\u2014more house than they could ever need, and hanging on to it was killing him. Killing her.</p><p>So, here she was. The baby had made it. She had to get going, to that address in Spokane, to the first step in her underground escape. The dresser had not been pulled against the door since the first night and she thought she\u2019d give herself another twenty-four hours to rest, then leave in the quiet of night. If there was no rain, the roads wouldn\u2019t be so difficult and it would be easier to travel at night while Chris slept.</p><p>There was a soft tapping at the door. It was her instinct to ask who was there, but there was only one possibility. She pulled the door open and there stood John, looking nervous. Looking, in spite of his height and girth, like a teenager. He might\u2019ve had a flush on his cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cI closed up the bar. I was thinking about a short drink before calling it a night. How about you? Wanna come down for a little while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a drink?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d He peered past her. \u201cHe asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut like a light, despite an overdose of cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I probably gave him too many. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014he loves making them. If he makes them, he has to eat them. It\u2019s fun\u2014sometimes that\u2019s more important than nutrition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you say,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cI could cut him back. He likes \u2019em though. He especially likes burning his mouth on them. He doesn\u2019t wait so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cYou have anything like...tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Aside from sportsmen, I serve mostly little old ladies.\u201d He took on a shocked look. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cup of tea would be nice. Good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said, turning and preceding her down the stairs, looking almost grateful to get away.</p><p>He got busy brewing tea in the kitchen, so Paige went into the bar and sat at the table where she saw his drink by the fire. When he finally brought her that cup of tea, he said, \u201cYou have a good time with Mel today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Was Christopher a lot of trouble?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head with a chuckle. \u201cNah, he\u2019s a kick. He wants to know everything. Every detail. \u2018Why is it a quarter teaspoon of that?\u2019 \u2018What does the Crisco on the tray do?\u2019 And man, yeast blows him away. I think he has a little scientist in him.\u201d</p><p>Paige thought, he couldn\u2019t ask his father questions. Wes didn\u2019t have the patience to answer them. \u201cJohn, do you have family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. I was an only child. And my folks were older, anyway\u2014they didn\u2019t think they were going to have kids. Then I surprised \u2019em. Boy, did I surprise \u2019em. My dad died when I was about six\u2014a construction accident. And then my mom when I was seventeen, right before my senior year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve had a good life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do when you lost your mother? Go live with aunts or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo aunts,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cMy football coach took me in. It was good\u2014he had a nice wife, good bunch of little kids. Might as well have lived with him. He acted like he owned me during football, anyway,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cNah, kidding aside, that was a good thing he did. Good guy. We used to write\u2014now we e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeart attack.\u201d After a moment of respectful silence, looking into his lap, he laughed softly. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe this\u2014she died at confession. That really tore me up at first. I thought maybe she had some deep, dark secret that threw her into a heart attack\u2014but I was tight with the priest\u2014I was his altar boy. And it was hard for him, but finally he leveled with me. See, my mom was the parish secretary and real...how should I say this? Kind of a church lady. Father Damien finally told me, my mom\u2019s confessions were so boring, he used to nod off. He thought they\u2019d both just fallen asleep, but she was dead.\u201d He lifted his eyebrows. \u201cMy mom, good woman, not a lot of excitement going on there. She lived for that job, loved the clergy, loved the church. She\u2019d have made a great nun. But you know what? She was happy. I don\u2019t think she had any idea she was boring and straitlaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must miss her so much,\u201d Paige said, sipping her tea in front of the fire, trying to remember when she last had a conversation like this. Unhurried, nonthreatening, warm in front of a friendly fire.</p><p>\u201cI do. This is going to sound stupid, especially since I\u2019m no kid\u2014sometimes I pretend she\u2019s back there, in that little house we lived in, and that I\u2019m just getting my stuff together to go see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound stupid....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere anybody you really miss?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>The question caused her to suddenly go still, her cup frozen in midair. Not her dad, so scrappy and short-tempered. Not her mom who, without knowing or meaning to, had trained her to be a battered wife. Not Bud, her brother, a mean little bastard who had failed to help her in her darkest hour. \u201cI had a couple of really close girlfriends. Roommates. We lost touch. I miss them sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where they are?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBoth got married and moved,\u201d she said. \u201cI wrote a couple of times.... Then my letters came back.\u201d They didn\u2019t want to be in touch with her; they knew things were bad. They hated Wes; Wes hated them. They had tried to help, briefly, but he ran them off and she rejected their help out of pure shame. What were they supposed to do? \u201cHow\u2019d you get so close to Jack?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cMarines,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cDid you go into the military together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He laughed. \u201cJack\u2019s older than me\u2014by about eight years. I\u2019ve always looked older than I was\u2014even when I was twelve. And Jack\u2014I bet he\u2019s always looked younger. He was my first sergeant in combat, back in Desert Storm.\u201d And for a split second he was back there. Changing a tire on a truck when the tire exploded and the rim knocked him back six feet and he couldn\u2019t get up. He remembered it like it was yesterday\u2014he had always been so huge, so rock hard, so strong, and he couldn\u2019t move. He might\u2019ve been unconscious for a little while because he saw his mother leaning over him, looking right into his eyes and saying, \u201cJohn, get up. Get up, John.\u201d Right there in that paisley, high-collared dress, graying hair pulled back.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t move, so he started to cry. And cry. Mom! he\u2019d cried out.</p><p>Yeah, you have a lot of pain, buddy? Jack asked, leaning over him.</p><p>And Preacher said, It\u2019s my mom. I want my mom. I miss my mom.</p><p>We\u2019re gonna get you back to her, pal. Take a few deep breaths.</p><p>She\u2019s dead, Preacher said. She died.</p><p>She\u2019s been dead a couple years at least, one of his squad members told Jack.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, Sarge, I couldn\u2019t help it. I\u2019ve never done this before. Cried like this. We\u2019re not supposed to cry.... I never did before, I swear. But he cried helplessly even as he said that.</p><p>We cry over people we lose, buddy. It\u2019s okay.</p><p>Father Damien said, remember she\u2019s with God and she\u2019s happy and don\u2019t soil her memory with crying about it.</p><p>Priests are usually smarter than that, Jack had said with a disapproving snort. You don\u2019t cry over something like that and the tears turn into snakes that eat you from the inside out. The crying part\u2014it\u2019s required.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry....</p><p>You get it out, buddy, or you\u2019ll be worse off. Call her, call out to your mom, get her attention, cry for her. It\u2019s damn past time!</p><p>And he had. Sobbed like a baby, Jack\u2019s arms under his shoulders, holding him up a little. Jack rocked him and said, Yeah, there you go. There you go....</p><p>Jack sat with him for a while, talking to him about his mother, and Preacher told him that he made it through that last year of school, tough and silent. Then, with no idea where to go or what to do, he joined up. So he could have brothers, which he had now, but it wasn\u2019t enough to take away the need for his mother. And that goddamn tire rim almost cut him in half and it was like the pain of losing her came pouring out. It was humiliating, to be six four and two-fifty, sobbing for your five-foot, three-inch mommy. Jack said, Nah, it\u2019s just what you need. Get it out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>After a little while, Jack pulled him up, hoisted him over his shoulder and carried him about a mile down the road to meet their convoy. And Jack had said, Let it out, buddy. After you get it all out, you stick to me like duct tape\u2014I\u2019m your mother now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no good to lose touch with people who mean a lot,\u201d Preacher said to Paige. \u201cEver think of trying to find those girlfriends again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t thought about that in a while,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever want to try, I could maybe help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the computer. I like to look things up. It\u2019s kind of slow, but it works. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>She said she would. Then she said she was awful tired and had to get some sleep, so they said good-night. She went up the stairs and he went to his apartment out back.</p> <p>That\u2019s when she decided she\u2019d better get moving. She couldn\u2019t afford to get comfortable here. No more cozy little chats, no more late-night questions. Attachments were completely out of the question.</p><p>Four</p><p>Paige got the suitcase ready. She pulled the covers back from her sleeping son to search for Bear, but he wasn\u2019t there. She nearly stripped the bed around him, looking. Then down on her knees to look under the bed, in the bathroom, in every empty drawer of the bureau\u2014nowhere. She\u2019d check in the kitchen before leaving, but if Bear was lost, he would have to be left behind.</p><p>She pulled two hundred dollars out of her billfold and put it on the bureau, then sat, still as stone, on the edge of the bed next to Christopher. Palms together, hands pressed between her knees, she waited. At midnight, she put on her jacket and crept quietly down the stairs. The cabin was so solid, not even a board squeaked.</p><p>He\u2019d left a light on in the kitchen for her. This was the only time she\u2019d come down after bedtime since that first night, but she suspected John left that light on for her every night. She tiptoed stealthily toward the door to his apartment and listened. No sound, no light under the door.</p><p>She\u2019d located a flashlight in the kitchen when she\u2019d been helping John clean up, a stroke of luck. Up to that point, the best idea she could come up with was a book of matches to light the night while she dealt with the license plates. Once the plates were switched, she\u2019d fetch the suitcase, then Chris. She took a butter knife from the drawer and slipped quietly out the back kitchen door.</p> <p>Once behind the bar, she was relieved to see no lights on in John\u2019s little apartment. She crouched to the task of removing her plates, easily done even though her hands were shaking. Then she got to work on John\u2019s, taking the license plate off his truck and replacing it with hers. Then back to the Honda, bending down to fix the new plate in place.</p><p>\u201cGetting back on the road again, Paige?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>She jumped, dropped the plate, flashlight and knife, straightening, her breath cut off and her heart hammering. The flashlight lit a path along the ground that illuminated his feet. Then he took a couple of steps toward her and came into complete view.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t going to do the trick,\u201d he said, nodding toward her car. \u201cThey\u2019re truck plates, Paige. Anyone, like the sheriff or CHP sees your little car with truck plates\u2014they\u2019re gonna know right off.\u201d</p><p>She felt her eyes well up with tears. Something like that would never have occurred to her. She shivered in the cold night, her hands shaking worse. Inside, her stomach was gripped in a tight, hard knot.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you need different plates, not yet, but we can get it done. Connie\u2019s got a little car right across the street. She\u2019d never miss \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>A tear rolled down her cheek and she stooped to pick up the flashlight. \u201cI...Ah...I left some money. Upstairs. For the room. The food. Not much, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Paige. You do something like that, it makes me look so bad. You gotta know I never thought about money.\u201d</p> <p>She hiccuped tears back and said, \u201cWhat did you think about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, reaching a hand out toward her. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out here. Come back inside, I\u2019ll make you some coffee so you don\u2019t fall asleep on the road, then I\u2019ll switch the plates for you. If that\u2019ll make you feel safer on the drive, even if you don\u2019t really need \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>She stayed out of his reach, but walked alongside. \u201cWhy do you say that? That I don\u2019t need them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s looking for you,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least not officially. You\u2019re still okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d she asked, ready to fall apart and sink into helpless sobs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll throw a log on the fire, get you warmed up and we\u2019ll talk. Then I\u2019ll switch the plates for you if you want. But after we talk about it, you\u2019ll probably want to go back upstairs and sleep till morning, drive in daylight. Besides,\u201d he said, holding open the back kitchen door for her, \u201cI got the bear. I\u2019ll get it for you\u2014you can\u2019t leave without the bear.\u201d</p><p>She started to cry as she walked into the kitchen, pressing her fingers against her lips. She felt like a caught felon. It made her feel even worse that he was being so nice to her. \u201cI looked everywhere for that damn bear,\u201d she said softly with a whimper.</p><p>Preacher turned toward her. Hand pressed against her mouth, eyes overflowing, she seemed to jerk with the effort not to add sound to her crying. Then slowly and carefully, he pulled her by her shoulders toward him, against his big chest, gently circling her with his arms. And she collapsed from inside, sobbing against him. No holding back the sound now, she was racked with tears. \u201cAw, you been holding that in too long, haven\u2019t you? I been there, all right. It\u2019s okay, Paige. I know you\u2019re scared and worried, but it\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>She doubted it, but she was helpless in the moment. All she could do was cry and shake her head. She tried to remember when someone had pulled her sweetly into strong arms and tried to make her feel safe. Long ago. So long ago, she couldn\u2019t remember the last time. Not even Wes in the early days, at his most manipulative. No, he would cry. He\u2019d hit her, beat her, then he would cry and she\u2019d comfort him.</p><p>Preacher rocked her back and forth in the dimly lit kitchen for a long time until she quieted down, then with a hand on her back, pushed her through the kitchen into the bar. He directed her to that same chair near the fire, stirred up the flame and threw on a new log, and went behind the bar to fix her a brandy. When he put it in front of her, she said, \u201cI have to be ready to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be any good to drive unless you calm down. Just a sip, then if you want coffee, we\u2019ll make some.\u201d He sat down in the chair next to hers and, with elbows on his knees, leaned toward her. \u201cWhen you came in here, I had no idea what happened to you, but I knew it wasn\u2019t good and I knew it wasn\u2019t a car door. You have California plates. So, I called a good friend of mine\u2014someone I knew I could trust. He checked out the plates, registered to your husband. He\u2019s been booked for battery domestic before.\u201d Preacher shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to know much more than that, did I?\u201d</p><p>Paige\u2019s eyes closed, then slowly opened again, focused on his face. She lifted the brandy to her lips and took a tiny sip, not confirming or denying anything.</p><p>Preacher went on, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t reported you missing, so no law enforcement\u2019s looking for you. I don\u2019t know what your plan is, Paige, but if you take Christopher out of state, you\u2019d be breaking the law\u2014that could go hard on you trying to keep him. I figure you must be thinking that way, \u2019cause you came all the way from L.A. and you\u2019re almost out of state now. If you\u2019re thinking of running off on your own and disappearing, whew, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. You just don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u2014you\u2019ll get tripped up. You don\u2019t know the difference between truck and car plates. There isn\u2019t much devious going on in that head of yours.\u201d</p><p>A huff of rueful laughter escaped her. Maybe that had been her problem; she wasn\u2019t sneaky enough.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you have someplace to go where they\u2019ll keep you hidden and safe\u2014that\u2019s a better idea. I just hope wherever that is, there\u2019s a bunch of big, mean, angry guys like me and Jack around, ready, on the off chance the son of a bitch hunts you down and finds you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of choices,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI have to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course you do,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know there\u2019s one more way to go? You wouldn\u2019t have any trouble getting custody of Chris, at least temporary custody, given the father\u2019s record, even if they weren\u2019t felony charges. You don\u2019t need his okay to get a divorce. Not in this state. It\u2019s no fault.\u201d She was shaking her head, closing her eyes again, another tear spilling down her cheek. But Preacher went on. \u201cThere\u2019s restraining orders, and even if he ignores \u2019em, it keeps the law on your side. You ever think of these things, Paige?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know all this? Did your friend tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna find out something, I look it up,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen do you know while I\u2019m trying to do that, he\u2019s going to kill me? He\u2019s mean, and he\u2019s crazy. He\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you stay here,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>She was stunned silent for a moment. Then she said, \u201cI can\u2019t stay here, John. I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Then it was Preacher\u2019s turn to show shock. Silent and dark. It settled into his eyes and over his expression slowly as he sat back in the chair, then stood. He went behind the bar and poured himself a shot, throwing it back. When he returned to the chair by the fire, he asked, \u201cDid he know? When he beat you, did he know you were pregnant?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and looked away from him, pursing her lips tight. Intellectually, she knew none of this was her fault, but there was an emotional misfire in her brain that said, you married him, had a child with him, didn\u2019t get out in time, let it happen, screwed up, got pregnant again, never ran in time, never saw it coming and it was plain as day.</p><p>\u201cYou ever been to a shelter?\u201d he asked her. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cHere are your choices,\u201d Preacher said calmly. \u201cYou can stay here and try to get your ducks in a row so when you do leave, you\u2019re not breaking the law or hiding for the rest of your life. It\u2019s okay if you stay here\u2014there are medical people across the street if you need them, you can help out in the kitchen if you want to, so you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re taking advantage, and if you happen to run into that son of a bitch around here, we\u2019re ready for him. You think of it as a shelter, like any other shelter\u2014sometimes people just want to help out. Or you can go if you want\u2014continue on with your plan. Whatever it is. You don\u2019t have to run in the night, anyway. Safer in daylight. Huh?\u201d He stood up. \u201cYou sit a minute, think, have a little brandy there\u2014it won\u2019t hurt that baby, a tiny sip of brandy, and I think maybe you need it. I\u2019m going to take care of those plates for you, then I\u2019m going to get you the bear. Whatever you decide to do, you can\u2019t leave without the bear, you know that.\u201d</p><p>He left her, going through his apartment. She could hear him go out his back door. He must have found the bear in the kitchen and put it in a safe place. A log in the fireplace dropped and she pulled her jacket tighter around her, taking another tiny sip of brandy that burned its way down her throat and did, miraculously, settle her stomach and her nerves, if slightly. Or maybe it was the news that Wes didn\u2019t have the police after her that calmed her a little. A while later, John came back from his apartment, still wearing the jacket he\u2019d obviously fetched, and holding the bear.</p><p>\u201cConnie\u2019ll never know the difference on those plates,\u201d he said, holding the bear out to her. \u201cBesides, if she knew what was going on here, she\u2019d tell you to take \u2019em.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She frowned as she looked at the bear, changed. He had a new leg, sewn out of blue-and-gray plaid. It wasn\u2019t exactly the same shape as the surviving leg; it was just a stuffed flannel tube stuck on the bear, but he was symmetrical now. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she asked, taking the bear.</p><p>Preacher shrugged. \u201cI told him I\u2019d give it a try. Looks pretty silly, I guess, but it was a good idea at the time.\u201d He put his hands in his pockets. \u201cThink you can get a little rest tonight? You still feel like you have to go right now? I could brew you up some coffee if you wanna just get out of here. I think I even have a thermos I could\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She stood up, leaving the brandy on the table, holding Bear close against her. \u201cI\u2019m going back to bed,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave in the morning, after Chris has a little breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d he said.</p><p>Paige awakened to the dim light of morning streaking through the dormer window and the sound of an ax striking wood. She rolled onto her side to see Christopher still sleeping peacefully, gripping the bear with the blue-and-gray flannel leg and she knew she should think about this for a while. It scared her to take a chance like this. But it didn\u2019t scare her any more than driving on to some address in Spokane and a commitment to a life she knew nothing about, and might not be devious enough to pull off.</p><p>She\u2019d like to think she had learned one or two things from her experiences. If anything, in any way, made her feel threatened, caused her radar to go up, she\u2019d be gone in a flash. She wouldn\u2019t bother with license plates or goodbyes.</p><p>Then there was that guilt\u2014she didn\u2019t want to put these people in Wes\u2019s path, in danger. But her reality was that wherever she went, whether to family, a shelter, into hiding\u2014the people who helped her were at risk. Sometimes it was unbearable to think about.</p> <p>She dressed quietly, without waking Chris, and crept down the stairs to the kitchen. Preacher was standing at the counter, slicing and dicing for his morning omelets. When he saw her at the bottom of the stairs, his hand on the knife froze and he waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need to borrow your washer and dryer,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t bring too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it makes more sense to stay here. A little while. I\u2019ll be glad to help out. If you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>He began to dice again, slowly. \u201cWe can do that easy. How about minimum wage plus the room and meals. Keep track of your own hours. Jack\u2019ll pay you when you want him to\u2014doesn\u2019t matter. Daily, weekly, monthly. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too much, John. I should help for just the room and meals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe open by six, stay open past nine, there are two of us plus Rick after school. Two days and you\u2019re going to be complaining it\u2019s slave labor.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not ready for the rest\u2014the restraining order, the custody thing...Court documents like that have to reveal where I am, and I\u2019m not up to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEventually, he\u2019s going to come after me. File charges, have police looking, maybe hire a detective. But he\u2019s going to try to find me. He won\u2019t let me walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing at a time, Paige,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that. We\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cOkay. Where\u2019s that washer?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cIn my apartment. The door\u2019s never locked.\u201d He stopped chopping again and, looking at her, asked, \u201cWhat made you decide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBear\u2019s new leg. That old blue plaid flannel...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld?\u201d Preacher asked, smiling slightly. \u201cThat was a perfectly good shirt.\u201d</p><p>Preacher took breakfast to Ron and Harv in the bar, and on his way back to the kitchen, glanced out the window to see Jack at the stump with the ax. He heard the sound of the washing machine start up in his apartment.</p><p>He poured two cups of coffee and walked out back. When Jack saw him coming, he left the ax stuck in the stump. Preacher passed him a cup.</p><p>\u201cDelivery service,\u201d Jack said. \u201cGuess you have something on your mind.\u201d He took a sip, watching Preacher over the rim of the cup.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking, we could probably use a little help around the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige mentioned she\u2019s looking for something. The kid\u2019s no trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like a good idea to me,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cDon\u2019t have any use for that bedroom over the kitchen, anyway. You can pay her out of my check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bar makes money, Preach. It can take on an employee. She doesn\u2019t want fifty grand and a 401(k) or anything, does she?\u201d</p><p>Preacher made a face. Jack thought he was funny. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be temporary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy responsibilities are changing,\u201d Jack said. \u201cGrowing,\u201d he added with a proud smile. \u201cBe nice to have a little help in there, in case I have other things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, then. I\u2019ll let her know.\u201d He turned as if to leave.</p><p>\u201cAh, Preacher,\u201d Jack said, and the man turned back. Jack held out his cup for Preacher to take back into the kitchen. \u201cYou already let her know, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight\u2019ve let slip I thought we could use her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. One question. She cover her tracks on her way into town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows she\u2019s here, Jack. Not that it\u2019s any of our business...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nosy, Preacher. I\u2019m prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cThat\u2019s good, I like that. Anything changes on that, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>There were things about being in Virgin River that gave Paige peace of mind. Small things, like her car sitting behind the bar between two big, extended-cab trucks, a car she had no reason to take out for a drive. The sound of log-splitting in the early dawn hours that coincided almost exactly with the smell of coffee. And the work\u2014she liked the work. It started with bussing tables and doing dishes, but before even a couple of days had passed, John was showing her how he made his soup, bread, pies.</p><p>\u201cThe real challenge here is making use of what we have,\u201d he told her. \u201cOne of the reasons this bar does well and we can get by like we do\u2014we cook what we kill or catch, we make use of Doc and Mel\u2019s patient fees that come in produce and meat and we concentrate on making sure our people are taken care of. Jack says, if we think first about making sure the town is taken care of, we\u2019ll do just fine. And we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you take care of a town?\u201d she asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cAw, it\u2019s real easy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe put out three good meals a day, on their budget, and the sharp folks know about the leftovers. When we shop, since we go all the way to the coastal towns and big stores and have our trucks, we check with people who don\u2019t drive so far\u2014old folks, infirm, maybe new mothers\u2014see if we can get them anything. They appreciate that\u2014take a meal or two at the bar. For special occasions we just open up the place, the women bring in the casseroles and the only thing we sell are mixed drinks. We put out a donation jar for the space, sodas, beer\u2014and we make out better than you\u2019d think. We lay in good liquors for the hunters and maybe fly fishermen out this way for contests, but we charge the same prices and they duke us up, real nice.\u201d To her perplexed expression he said, \u201cTip us, Paige. They know what Johnny Walker Black costs. They like how we try to have what they\u2019re gonna want\u2014they have money. They leave it on the tables and bar.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNah. Jack and me\u2014we\u2019ve been hunters, we fish. It\u2019s good to take care of the people that put up with us. Maybe the most important thing is remembering them when they come in\u2014makes \u2019em feel welcome. Jack\u2019s good at that. But then there\u2019s the food. We\u2019re small and not very experienced, but the food\u2019s getting a good reputation,\u201d he said, sticking out his chest.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cFattening, but good.\u201d</p><p>Paige felt that staying in this dinky country bar was like a cocoon, sheltering her from the outside world. Rick and Jack were good about having her there, both of them giving her things to do. It didn\u2019t seem that her minor contributions were so much, but they went on about her as if they didn\u2019t know how they\u2019d gotten by before. Then there were the customers who came in almost daily, sometimes twice a day. It took no time at all for them to regard Paige as someone who\u2019d been there a long time.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sure getting lots more cookies around here these days,\u201d Connie said. \u201cIt took a woman in the kitchen to get it right.\u201d</p><p>Paige didn\u2019t bother to explain that it was all John\u2019s doing, for Christopher. It was not for the folks in the bar who\u2019d come to like cookies with their coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he cook tonight, Paige?\u201d Doc asked.</p><p>\u201cBouillabaisse,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAch, I hate that crap.\u201d Doc leaned close. \u201cHe hide any of yesterday\u2019s stuffed trout back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look,\u201d she said, grinning, already feeling a part of something.</p><p>Mel was in the bar at least twice a day, sometimes more often. When the place was quiet and she didn\u2019t have patients, she\u2019d sit and talk awhile. Mel knew more about Paige\u2019s special circumstances than anyone, and it was Mel who asked about her recovery. \u201cBetter,\u201d Paige said. \u201cEverything\u2019s better. No more spotting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like this was a good idea of yours,\u201d Mel said, looking around and indicating the bar.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea,\u201d Paige said. \u201cJohn said I could stay, help out around here a little. If I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you might be enjoying it,\u201d Mel said. \u201cYou\u2019re smiling a lot.\u201d</p><p>With a shock of surprise, Paige answered, \u201cI am. Who would\u2019ve guessed? This has been a good...\u201d She paused. \u201cBreak,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI guess I can make this work for a while, at least. Until I start to...\u201d Again she paused. \u201cShow,\u201d she said, looking down at her middle.</p><p>\u201cDoes John know?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt was the only decent thing to do\u2014to tell him, when he made the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, even though hardly anyone knows the circumstances that brought you here, I think it\u2019s fair to say everyone around here understands you must have had another life. Before Virgin River. I mean, you do have a son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that,\u201d Paige agreed.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Mel said, sitting back, running two hands over her small tummy. \u201cLotsa people are starting to \u2018show.\u2019 Did you know I\u2019m four months now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat looks about right,\u201d Paige said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And I\u2019ve been in this town seven months. Married to Jack less than one. I was married before Jack. I was widowed, and according to the experts, completely incapable of conceiving a child.\u201d Paige\u2019s eyes grew round, her mouth forming an O. Mel laughed. \u201cObviously, I need better experts. Oh, you think you\u2019re the only one who came to this place by way of a wrong turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to this story,\u201d Paige said, lifting one brow.</p><p>\u201cJust the details, sister. We have plenty of time.\u201d And then Mel laughed brightly.</p><p>Paige had been in the little room over the kitchen for ten days, the first four of which she\u2019d been planning her departure. Preacher told her he thought it was working out pretty well. They had a nice little routine. Right after Chris had his breakfast and Paige was showered and primped, she plunged into kitchen work, cleaning up after breakfast. While Chris was with John, either coloring, playing War with a deck of cards, sweeping or doing other chores, Paige would take care of her room and their things. Because she didn\u2019t have much with her, there was frequent laundry in John\u2019s laundry room\u2014so while the washer and dryer hummed along, Paige did a few things she hoped would help him out\u2014cleaning his bathroom, dusting, making up his bed, running the sweeper around his room. \u201cCan I throw in a load of clothes for you?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that. Listen, you don\u2019t have to clean up after me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cJohn, I spend all day in the kitchen, collecting your pots, pans and dishes. It\u2019s becoming a habit.\u201d She laughed at his shocked expression. \u201cYou look after my child all day long\u2014you\u2019re pretty much helpless, since he won\u2019t leave you alone. The least I can do is help out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking after him,\u201d John said. \u201cWe\u2019re buddies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. And thought, yeah\u2014buddies.</p><p>Lunch was usually busy, and Paige served and bussed. Dinner, from five to eight, was also busy, especially this time of year\u2014fall, hunting season with fishing getting good. After eight there were occasionally lingerers, hanging out over beer or drinks, but the cooking was over for the night. That\u2019s when Paige would take Chris upstairs for his bath and bed, and after that she\u2019d only check in to see if anything needed to be done before she called it a night. Occasionally, she\u2019d have a cup of tea with John.</p><p>Preacher liked that time of night, when there was no more dinner to be served, when the kitchen was cleaned, when he could hear Paige running water upstairs. Sometimes he could hear her singing play songs with Chris. Before pouring that last shot for the day, he\u2019d look at his cookbooks, planning dinner for the next day or maybe the next week, making supply lists. The process made him feel he had everything managed efficiently. Preacher was very well organized.</p><p>It was about eight-thirty and there were a few hunters in the bar. Jack was handling the front. Buck Anderson had brought Mel a couple of nice-size lamb shanks, which came straight to Preacher. He was reading about lamb shanks hestia with cucumber raita when he heard a small shuffle. He looked over the counter to see Christopher standing at the bottom of the stairs, stark naked, book under one arm, Bear under the other.</p> <p>Preacher lifted one bushy brow. \u201cForget something there, pardner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Chris picked at his left butt cheek while hanging on to the bear. \u201cYou read to me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...Have you had your bath?\u201d Preacher asked. The boy shook his head. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re ready for your bath.\u201d He listened upward to the running water.</p><p>Chris nodded, then said again, \u201cYou read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>Chris ran around the counter, happy, raising his arms to be lifted up.</p> <p>\u201cWait a second,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cI don\u2019t want little boy butt on my clean counter. Just a sec.\u201d He pulled a clean dish towel out of the drawer, spread it on the counter, then lifted him up, sitting him on it. He looked down at the little boy, frowned slightly, then pulled another dish towel out of the drawer. He shook it out and draped it across Chris\u2019s naked lap. \u201cThere. Better. Now, what you got here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorton,\u201d he said, presenting the book.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance your mother isn\u2019t going to go for this idea,\u201d he said. But he opened the book and began to read. They hadn\u2019t gotten far when he heard the water stop, heard heavy footfalls racing around the upstairs bedroom, heard Paige yell, \u201cChristopher!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe better get our story straight,\u201d Preacher said to him.</p><p>\u201cOur story,\u201d Chris said, pointing at the page in front of him.</p><p>Momentarily there were feet coming down the stairs, fast. When she got to the bottom, she stopped suddenly. \u201cHe got away from me while I was running the tub,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. In fact, he\u2019s dressed like he barely escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, John. Christopher, get over here. We\u2019ll read after your bath.\u201d</p> <p>He started to whine and wiggle. \u201cI want John!\u201d</p><p>Paige came impatiently around the counter and plucked him, squirming, into her arms.</p><p>\u201cI want John,\u201d he complained.</p><p>\u201cJohn\u2019s busy, Chris. Now, you behave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014Paige? I\u2019m not all that busy. If you\u2019ll tell Jack I\u2019m not in the kitchen for a bit, I could do the bath. Tell Jack, so he knows to lock up if everyone leaves.\u201d</p><p>She turned around at the foot of the stairs. \u201cYou know how to give a child a bath?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, no. But is it hard? Harder than scrubbing up a broiler?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled in spite of herself. She put Chris down on his feet. \u201cYou might want to go a little easier than that. No Brillo pads, no scraping. No soap in the eyes, if you can help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d Preacher said, coming around the counter. \u201cHow many times you dunk him?\u201d She gasped and Preacher showed her a smile. \u201cKidding. I know you only dunk him twice.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cI\u2019ll see if Jack needs anything, and then I\u2019ll be up to supervise.\u201d</p><p>Paige was peeling and slicing apples, Preacher rolling out pie dough, when Jack came into the kitchen. \u201cMel\u2019s out front,\u201d he told them. \u201cShe\u2019s going over to the Eureka mall, Paige\u2014she can\u2019t get into her pants anymore. She said you can ride along, if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>Paige looked at John, lifting her brows.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Paige,\u201d he said. \u201cChris won\u2019t be up for another hour and I got the kitchen. You probably need all kinds of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, thanks,\u201d she said, putting her apple and knife in the bowl, taking off her apron.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Preacher said, wiping his hands on a dish towel. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if you have credit cards, but you have to be real careful about that. You should shop with cash\u2014huh?\u201d He pulled out his wallet, took some bills out and began to unfold them, peeling off one, then another, then...</p><p>Paige went completely pale, her eyes round and clearly frightened. She started shaking her head and backing away. \u201cTell...Tell Mel I have to do...some things...Okay?\u201d</p><p>Jack tilted his head, frowning. \u201cPaige?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Paige backed up until she was against the wall, her hands behind her back, her face as white as alabaster. Then a tear rolled down her cheek.</p><p>Preacher put his wallet on the counter and said, \u201cGive us a minute, Jack.\u201d Then he took off his own apron and walked toward her. As he neared, she slid down the wall to the floor and put her hands over her face.</p><p>Preacher got on his knees in front of her and gently tugged at her hands, pulling them away from her face and holding them. \u201cPaige,\u201d he said softly. \u201cPaige, look at me. What just happened there?\u201d</p><p>Her expression was panicked. Tears ran down her cheeks, but her voice was a whisper. \u201cHe did that,\u201d she said. \u201cGot his money out of his pocket and said, \u2018Go buy yourself some nice things.\u2019 He did that so much. Later, he\u2019d throw the money at me and say he couldn\u2019t afford to have a wife that looked like a vagrant.\u201d</p><p>Preacher sat on the floor right next to her. \u201cDid you hear what I said? I didn\u2019t say anything like that, did I? I said, you have to be careful, don\u2019t use your charge card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you,\u201d she said in a whisper. \u201cDid I tell you I married him because my legs hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t said anything about him,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cNothing at all. That\u2019s okay\u2014you don\u2019t have to say anything unless you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a beautician. Hair, I did hair. Sometimes twelve-hour days because the pay was so low. We really worked hard. I never had enough for the rent and my roommates and I lived in a real dump. I loved it, but I was tired, broke. Sore. My legs hurt,\u201d she said again. \u201cI knew he was bad for me, my friends hated him, and I married him because he said I didn\u2019t have to work anymore.\u201d She started to laugh and cry together. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t have anything. Because I had nothing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys like that know just what to use for bait,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a sense for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI read about it.\u201d He wiped a tear from her cheek. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. None of it was your fault. You got tricked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing again,\u201d she said. \u201cA little suitcase, a car with stolen license plates on it, a child and one on the way...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have everything,\u201d he said. \u201cA car with stolen license plates, a son, a baby on the way, friends...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had friends before,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThey were scared of him. He ran them off and I lost them forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like the kind of friend he can scare? Run off?\u201d He pulled her gently onto his lap and she rested her head against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I stay so crazy,\u201d she said softly. \u201cHe\u2019s not anywhere near. He\u2019ll never guess this place. But I\u2019m still scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never scared,\u201d she said.</p><p>He chuckled softly, stroked her back. He was scared of a bunch of things, number one being the day she got these problems managed and left with Christopher. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the Marines, they used to say everyone\u2019s afraid, so you have to learn to use fear to your advantage. Man, if you ever figure out how you do that, let me know. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do when you were scared?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOne of two things,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d either pee myself, or I\u2019d get mad.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head off his chest, looked at him and laughed a little.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a girl,\u201d he said, wiping off her cheeks. \u201cI think you need to get out of Virgin River a little bit. But you\u2019re probably in no shape to go shopping today.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I made a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little country bar, Paige. We live for those.\u201d He grinned. Then he sobered. \u201cThey also used to say, stare it in the face\u2014fake brave. They taught us to look mean.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered.</p><p>\u201cNever mind all that. Tomorrow I\u2019ll go for supplies instead of Jack. He can get lunch for once. I\u2019ll take you and Chris, get you out of town for a break. You can pick up a few things, if you want to. I\u2019m not buying you anything, though. I\u2019ll use the bar charge card so we can get our annual perks, you save your receipts and catch me up later, after a payday or two.\u201d He touched her nose. \u201cChris is running around naked. Suggests a wardrobe problem.\u201d</p><p>Jack had backed out of the kitchen slowly when Preacher asked for a moment. As slowly as he could, because something major was happening and he was curious. When he got back to the bar, Mel was waiting, up on a stool. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jack put a finger to his lips, shushing her. \u201cSomething\u2019s going on,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d she asked, none the wiser.</p><p>Jack stuck his head back close to the door. Eavesdropping.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d she scolded in a furious whisper.</p><p>He put a finger to his lips again. Then with a frown on his face, he went behind the bar and glared down at his pretty young wife. \u201cPaige is having a breakdown in there....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Does Preacher need help?\u201d</p><p>Jack shook his head. \u201cHe asked me to step out. I heard a couple of things, purely by accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a car with stolen license plates?\u201d</p><p>Mel sat suddenly straight, eyes wide. \u201cNo kidding?\u201d she asked. \u201cI guess I better check mine, see if they\u2019re still mine.\u201d Then she smiled cutely.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s a baby coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fooling me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know things.\u201d</p><p>Mel made a face at him, as if to say, Duh. Of course I know things. Patient things. She might have shared Paige\u2019s bruises with him, so he could be prepared for anything and help protect her, but she wasn\u2019t a bigmouth. She got off the bar stool and went to the swinging door to the kitchen. She peeked; Preacher was sitting on the floor, gently rocking Paige on his lap. Ah, that was probably exactly what she needed at the moment. Better than a sedative. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Mel walked behind the bar and got up on her toes to kiss Jack. \u201cI don\u2019t think she wants to go shopping. Tell her I went ahead\u2014I have to cover up the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, Jack? I don\u2019t quite know how to explain this to you. You and I have such different life experiences with things like this....\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarting with, I would never hit a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s lovely, Jack. That\u2019s not what I mean. Hmm,\u201d she said, looking skyward. \u201cIt might be easiest for you if you thought of Paige as a POW.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA POW?\u201d he asked, looking startled and confused at once.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the closest thing I can think of that you can relate to. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I have a bagful of elastic waistbands, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Okay.\u201d</p><p>A couple of hours later, with still plenty of time before the dinner hour, Jack was sitting on the porch, tying off flies for fishing. Paige came onto the porch holding a slice of fresh apple pie on a plate. He took it and said, \u201cOohh, still warm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about before, Jack. I\u2019m a little embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her, saw a sweet, docile face\u2014the face of a devoted young mother, a pregnant woman running to protect her unborn baby. And, as he had been instructed by Mel, he imagined an enforced barricade, deprivation, regular beatings, fear of death\u2014for years. It was not only hard to imagine a young woman like Paige, so helpful and tender, going through something like that, it was impossible to imagine the kind of man who might subject her to it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, okay? We all have our moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t. Only I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off, laughing. \u201cOh, don\u2019t go there. Don\u2019t go the \u2018only I have this baggage\u2019 route. Ask Mel\u2014not long before I married her, I had a fantastic meltdown. Come to think of it, so did she!\u201d Then he frowned slightly. \u201cOn second thought\u2014could you take my word for it?\u201d</p> <p>Paige tilted her head. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t want to be asked about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d mind. It just pisses me off\u2014the way she never tells me anything, and I just lay it all out there. I don\u2019t know how she does it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Jack.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI won\u2019t ask. I apologize, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need, Paige. I just hope you feel better.\u201d</p><p>John took the supply list, Chris and Paige to Eureka. They went to Target first so the groceries wouldn\u2019t go bad in the truck while they shopped. She bought a few things\u2014underwear, jeans, shirts. John held Chris\u2019s hand outside the dressing room while she tried things on. They stopped at the bookstore. John spent some time in the history section, picking up a couple of books\u2014the same type she\u2019d seen on his bookshelf. Then when he came to the children\u2019s section to see if they were ready to go, Paige put up the books they\u2019d been looking at and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should get a new book or two,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe have his favorites,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe could use two new ones,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay if I do this?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said.</p><p>Maybe the best part of the outing was the drive. She\u2019d come into Virgin River at night, in the rain, and except for her quick trip to Grace Valley along the back mountain roads, hadn\u2019t seen much of the countryside. John took them for a little drive along the high cliffs of the Pacific Coast\u2014so different up here in the north than in L.A. He passed through a redwood grove, then up into the mountains toward Virgin River.</p><p>She looked over at him as he drove; he was grinning. \u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He turned to look at her. \u201cI\u2019ve never been shopping with a woman before,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t hate it.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>During her stay in Virgin River, Paige started out in the bedroom above the kitchen, reluctant to step outside. Next the kitchen, then the bar, then late evenings with John in front of the fire, talking. And then she\u2019d begun working, getting to know the locals. Gradually her circle widened until she\u2019d been to the corner store a few times, then she\u2019d gone to the little library, open on Tuesdays, to get picture books for Chris and novels for herself.</p><p>In only three weeks, she no longer felt like a guest. A newcomer, certainly, but for the first time in years, at ease with her surroundings. The days were long, the work wasn\u2019t light. Her legs hurt again, and this time she was grateful for the opportunity to spend this kind of physical energy rather than being locked up and emotionally drained from the constant tension and uncertainty of her life. She fixed her own breakfast and lunch, ate dinner in the kitchen with Rick and John between hustling meals and doing dishes, and it felt good.</p><p>After Chris was asleep, she read for a couple of hours, and actually fell into the story, something she hadn\u2019t been able to do in years. She left her sleeping boy to go downstairs to get herself a glass of milk, smiling as she descended the stairs\u2014there was always a night-light on in the kitchen, welcoming her. She noticed a glow from the bar and peeked in. John sat in the darkened bar at the table in front of the fire, his feet up on the open hearth. She walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this awful late for you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He jumped in surprise, put his feet on the floor and sat up straight. \u201cPaige! I didn\u2019t hear you come down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust prowling around, getting a glass of milk. What\u2019s the matter? Can\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a little trouble, yeah. I\u2019ll go in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant some company?\u201d He had a strange look on his face. \u201cOh, I guess you want a little time to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay...\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I understand. You\u2019ve been here alone all this time and now you have people underfoot. I\u2019ll just see you in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, Paige,\u201d he said, somber. Unhappy.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d she asked, pulling out a chair.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not so good. I didn\u2019t want to do this tonight. I wanted to save this for morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I do something?\u201d she asked, frowning. \u201cIs there something I need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not you\u2014you\u2019re perfect. I got some bad news a little while ago. Wes did it\u2014what you expected. He finally did it. Reported you and Chris missing. Almost two weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>She was stunned speechless for a moment. She sank weakly into the chair. While she was settling in, growing more comfortable with her surroundings, her new friends, he had crossed her mind often. She\u2019d look over her shoulder; she couldn\u2019t help it. A shudder would pass through her now and then and often her heart would start to beat a little wildly and she\u2019d have to focus her energy on breathing evenly, reminding herself he was nowhere near, and it would pass.</p><p>She closed her eyes briefly. \u201cI\u2019ll go up and pack,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019d better get going. Get back to the plan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pack yet, Paige,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about, John. He\u2019s after me\u2014I have to get us away. I can\u2019t afford to take a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you run, you\u2019re taking a bigger chance. If they pick you up, they\u2019re going to take Chris to him and arrest you. You have to do it, Paige. Face him down,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cI\u2019ll help. I\u2019ll find a way to get you through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one way through this\u2014I have to get out of here. You said it yourself, he\u2019ll outsmart me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that,\u201d he argued. \u201cI said you\u2019re not devious. But I think you can beat him. I know a couple of people\u2014my buddy the cop, for one. There\u2019s a judge in Grace Valley I\u2019ve been fishing with\u2014I know he\u2019ll help if he can. Jack\u2019s little sister, Brie, is a lawyer\u2014a hotshot lawyer in the state capital\u2014and she knows everyone. Brie\u2014she\u2019s so smart, it\u2019s scary. We have to ask some of these people how you can get out of this mess and have a real life. I\u2019ll see it through with you, till you\u2019re free and safe.\u201d</p><p>She sat forward in her chair. \u201cListen, why are you doing this? What do you think you\u2019ll get out of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Sleep, that\u2019s what. When this is over, I\u2019ll sleep at night knowing you\u2019re not getting beat up, knowing Chris isn\u2019t growing up mean, learning how to beat on women. Paige, I saw. That first night, when I brought you clean towels, the door was open a little and you had your shirt pulled...\u201d He stopped and hung his head. Then he raised it and looked her dead in the eye and said, \u201cThat was no little slap. No little argument.\u201d</p><p>She looked down into her lap. It was unbearable to think he\u2019d seen that awful mess.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said, lifting her chin with a finger. \u201cI was okay with my life until you walked in the door that night, with your kid and your bruises. It was all right with me to fish and cook and clean up\u2014I never minded being alone. I\u2019m never going to get married, have kids of my own\u2014I know that. But I can do something about this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your business!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is now! Even if you\u2019re not counting on me, that kid is! He counts on me every day, from the time he comes running down here in his jammies until he\u2019s finally sound asleep! When you and Chris leave here, I\u2019m going to know we did everything we could to keep you safe from that bastard!\u201d He took a breath. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI can sound as scary as I look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look scary,\u201d she said so softly he barely heard. \u201cAnd if this doesn\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>He straightened. \u201cThen I\u2019ll help you get to someplace safe. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes. Jesus Christ, Paige, if I don\u2019t do this, what am I gonna do with my life? When something like this hits me square in the face and I ignore it, what am I worth then, huh?\u201d</p><p>She gazed at his pleading expression and shook her head almost sadly. \u201cHow do you know you\u2019ll never get married and have kids?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said, frustrated.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo start with, there\u2019s not a single unmarried woman over eighteen and under sixty in this town\u2014that might be one clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019re lots of towns...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, do we have to make this about me? Your kid, he\u2019s the only kid ever came near me. Christ, they hide behind their mothers when they see me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cYou\u2019re swearing like mad. I bet your mother\u2019s turning in her grave....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpinning,\u201d he agreed. Then, pleadingly, \u201cI know you\u2019re scared. Are you too scared to try to stare the bastard in the eye and face him down if I swear I have your back? If you have lots of help?\u201d He took a breath. \u201cDid you know, when you come face-to-face with a bear, you never run? You straighten up tall as you can. Puff up and try to make yourself big. Make a lot of noise. Act tough, even if you\u2019re not tough.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019d have trouble doing that, little as you are. But you should think about the theory. If you act like you\u2019re not scared and you have help, good and strong and smart help\u2014you might get this behind you. We\u2019ll help. The judge, Mel, Jack, Brie. Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy buddy the cop. Mike.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cHe says what you really have to do right now is turn yourself in\u2014maybe not to the police. But to someone in the law, someone who will listen to your story. I\u2019m thinking a lawyer, or the judge.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he repeated, surprised.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m terrified, but okay.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cIt\u2019s your way or running, hiding. Either way, the danger is pretty much the same. Him.\u201d Then, quietly, \u201cThank you. For offering. To help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt feels good to help,\u201d he said. \u201cJust do it for Chris. Let\u2019s get him outta this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll try that,\u201d she said, but her voice was shaky.</p><p>Preacher didn\u2019t look like the kind of guy who could use looking after, watching over, but this is what Jack did. It was partly out of habit\u2014he\u2019d had the big man\u2019s back since they were in the Marines together; Preacher had served under him twice, the first and second Iraq conflicts.</p><p>There was another reason Jack was watching closely right now, and that was because Preacher was changing. Jack recognized it at once because it hadn\u2019t been so long since he went through similar changes\u2014although Jack had known exactly what was happening to him, and he suspected that Preacher did not.</p><p>After twenty years in the Marine Corps and three in Virgin River, Jack had never formed a strong attachment with a woman. It never occurred to him to settle down, commit to one woman. The closest he\u2019d ever come was one woman at a time. And then Mel came to town to work alongside old Doc Mullins and before she\u2019d been here a week, Jack was cooked. It was the right time, the right woman, the right circumstances. And while it shook him, startled him to feel what he was feeling, it never confused him. It was unmistakable. He\u2019d fallen in love with such a horrendous crash it surprised him that the redwoods hadn\u2019t trembled, as though an earthquake shook them.</p> <p>It had happened almost as quickly to Preacher. Paige appeared that rainy night just three weeks ago with her child and her bruises and Jack could sense a fire in Preacher right away. At first it appeared to be an intense need to right a wrong, to protect\u2014typical of Preacher. He was that kind of man\u2014tough on the outside and soft on the inside. Justice and loyalty\u2014those values were everything to him. But in the days since what he saw had evolved. Preacher watched over Paige with an intensity that spoke of something more than the goodness of his heart. He would glance at her and his eyes would grow dark. Glow. He\u2019d shake himself, look away, and his brow would furrow as though he were trying to make sense of feelings he hadn\u2019t had before.</p><p>Jack and Preacher had such different histories with the opposite sex. Jack had never done well with abstinence\u2014he had always had a woman somewhere. He was driven by those needs. But Preacher was solitary. And while a very private person, he wasn\u2019t secretive. In fact, he was candid. Transparent. Jack was sure that if he\u2019d had women around, Jack would know about it. No, he was fairly sure\u2014this was a first for Preacher. He was powerfully attracted to a woman and didn\u2019t have any idea what to do about it.</p><p>Jack watched Paige, as well, because he cared deeply about his friend. This was a kindhearted and vulnerable woman, and she was tender toward Preacher\u2014but it was entirely possible it was no more than gratitude. If she were ever able to put the threats she faced behind her, she would probably go away. Back to a family somewhere, perhaps. Or even some new place.</p><p>For now, they were inseparable. The three of them. Preacher kept Paige and Christopher under his protective wing, as though danger loomed nearby and might strike at any moment. When there were no patrons in the bar, Preacher and Paige sat at one of the tables and talked or played cribbage; if Christopher wasn\u2019t napping, he was on Preacher\u2019s knee. When the place was busy, fishermen dropping in for drinks or dinner after a long day on the Virgin, Paige and her son would be in the kitchen with Preacher, helping out or just keeping him company. She worked in the bar, apparently content with her duties and constantly checking with Preacher to ask what he\u2019d like her to do.</p><p>It was obvious what Preacher was beginning to feel. Not so obvious what Paige was feeling. And no time presented itself in which Jack could talk to Preacher privately. Of course, he wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d say, anyway. But there was one thing Jack had heard\u2014these domestic situations were probably more dangerous than war. Volatile, unpredictable, lethal. Cops often said they\u2019d rather walk into an armed robbery than a domestic. Jack didn\u2019t want anything bad to happen to this woman\u2014he liked her. But he also didn\u2019t want anything bad to happen to Preacher.</p><p>With this on his mind, he wanted to talk to his wife about it. \u201cI\u2019m going to step out for a while,\u201d Jack said to Preacher. \u201cYou got the bar?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jack walked across the street to Doc\u2019s where he found Mel and Doc playing gin at the kitchen table. Mel had a nice little stack of pennies sitting by her hand. When she saw him standing there, her blue eyes sparkled and she smiled at him. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done with the game, can you go for a ride with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cJust for a ride. Me and you. The sun\u2019s out for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be done right now,\u201d Doc said. \u201cI haven\u2019t had gin once.\u201d He threw his cards down and stood up.</p><p>\u201cYou need to work on your sportsmanship,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI need to work on my cheating,\u201d Doc returned, heading out of the kitchen.</p><p>Mel got her coat and walked outside with Jack. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked again.</p> <p>\u201cJust for a ride. Tell me about your morning.\u201d</p><p>They held hands as they walked out to Jack\u2019s truck and he opened the door for her. When he was in beside her and driving, she said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t had anything very interesting. This nasty weather we\u2019ve been having seems to be bringing out the viruses\u2014lots of runny noses, coughs, fevers. We\u2019re running through the decongestant. I think I feel a cold coming on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but my head is stuffy and one ear is plugged. And I can\u2019t take the decongestant because of you-know-who.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t be working in a doctor\u2019s office right now. All those germs,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop.\u201d She laughed. She smoothed her hands over her little pooch of a tummy. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a little on the overprotective side.\u201d</p><p>They drove out of town to the west for about ten minutes and Jack turned off the road, then he stopped. \u201cIt\u2019s bumpy. The road sucks. That okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I don\u2019t hit my head on the ceiling, we\u2019re okay. What is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething I came across and wanted to show you. Hang on and I\u2019ll go slow. We\u2019re going up.\u201d And up and up, along a winding dirt road wide enough for only one vehicle, through the trees. Then momentarily they broke out in a big, grassy clearing from which you could see for miles. \u201cI thought you\u2019d love this view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My,\u201d she said, taken with it. She looked across fenced pastures, ranches, farms, orchards, a vineyard. Behind them the pine-covered hills rose and in front of them, the hill sloped down to the valley.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, opening his door.</p><p>They got out and stood on this grassy knoll, looking out across the foothills and valley below. Off in the far distance what appeared to be clouds rolled in from the Pacific Coast. Jack put an arm around her shoulders and she leaned against him. \u201cJack, this is beautiful. I didn\u2019t even know this place was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither. Mel, what if this spot, right where we\u2019re standing\u2014what if this spot was your front porch?\u201d</p><p>She snapped her head up to look at him, her mouth open slightly, her eyes wide. She said his name in a breath. \u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can get it. It\u2019s the Bristols\u2019 land\u2014too craggy for planting, too far from their pastures and too much forest for grazing. And we don\u2019t need much\u2014just a couple of acres, maybe.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. \u201cOh, Jack,\u201d she said again. \u201cYou\u2019ve been looking for land.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve been sneaking around the back acreage of neighbors\u2019 properties, looking for a good piece someone might be talked out of. A view, a good yard, somewhere where the deer might wander right up to the house, destroy your vegetable garden...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had a vegetable garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d she said. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He moved behind her and slipped his arms around her. His hands went under her jacket, under her sweater to where the jeans she could no longer close were gaping open. He put his large hands over her tummy and she put her hands over his, leaning back against him. They stood and looked out across the beautiful land, and then there was a little movement within her. These tiny flutters had just begun. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t feel that yet,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe baby just fluttered.\u201d</p><p>He bent to kiss her neck. \u201cShe likes it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you not? Oh, Jack, you shouldn\u2019t have shown it to me. Now if you can\u2019t get Fish and Carrie Bristol to part with it, my heart will break.\u201d She pressed down on his hands.</p><p>\u201cThink positive,\u201d he said. He gently massaged her tummy. \u201cI thought men were supposed to get all freaked out when their wives were pregnant. Not want to touch them. Not want to have sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all men,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGod, I want you more than ever,\u201d he said, kissing her neck again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014\u201d she laughed \u201c\u2014is simply impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to christen the new home site?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cI\u2019m not going back to Doc\u2019s with grass stains on my butt. Control yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to build you a house here,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst thing I\u2019m going to do is get the road graded and widened, then have the land excavated. I can\u2019t do that myself. While that\u2019s happening, we\u2019re going to have some plans drawn up. I\u2019ll need help with the foundation, but after that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, stop. You have to buy the land first.\u201d</p><p>He turned her around. \u201cI\u2019m going to build you a house here, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just do that.\u201d</p><p>Eventually, they went back to the truck, but they sat there a long while, silent, looking out over the valley. Mel was remembering last March when she arrived, a recent widow looking for a fresh start, and the first thing she thought was that she\u2019d made a terrible mistake in coming to this washedout little town. She wasn\u2019t made to live in the woods\u2014she was a city girl. Now she looked out at the most glorious landscape in America and knew she would never leave it.</p><p>Next March, their baby would arrive, a baby John Stone, her OB, said would be a girl. How far she had traveled, emotionally and physically. From a woman who thought she\u2019d never love again, to a woman in the most intense romantic relationship she could imagine. From a woman who thought she\u2019d never have a child to mother.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet,\u201d she said to her husband.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I think too much,\u201d he said. \u201cMel. Talk to me about something. Help me with something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t bring me out here to show me the view. No\u2014you would have surprised me with this later, when you were sure you had it locked up. You wanted some privacy,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching Preacher,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAh. Lots of people have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it seems pretty apparent. He\u2019s growing very attached to his houseguests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s what I think, too. I have a feeling he doesn\u2019t know what hit him.\u201d</p><p>She reached for Jack\u2019s hand. \u201cHe\u2019ll work it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel, I\u2019m not sure the looks Paige gives him mean anything but thank you. I mean, Preacher\u2014he\u2019s the kind of guy you want around when someone\u2019s about to take you out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cTurns out feeling safe for once is a big item,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThat was one of the things you gave me that meant the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s been hurt bad, Mel. Real bad. When the damage heals and she isn\u2019t afraid anymore\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack, stop. I was damaged. You never let it discourage you for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe this is different....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried that he\u2019s going to get hurt,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I might be.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but she squeezed his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a mother hen,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a big boy. Let him be. Let her be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw the way that woman was beat up. You know the guy who did that to her is obsessed. Mean as the devil himself. She\u2019s going to have some crazy bastard after her and I\u2019d hate to have Preacher caught in the crossfire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, you\u2019d better listen to me\u2014this isn\u2019t up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching out for that guy for years now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis just surprises the hell out of me. Preacher never had much traffic with women. I\u2019m not sure he knows the score.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to know the score, but I bet you\u2019re wrong about that, too,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cHe just has to know how he feels and what he wants. This isn\u2019t your bone, Jack\u2014don\u2019t chew on it. And if you try to warn him off, he\u2019s going to break your jaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said sullenly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He started the truck and drove them back to town. When he let Mel off and went back to the bar, he found Preacher behind the bar and Paige sitting up on a stool in front of him. The boy must have been napping; it was only the two of them. And Preacher was holding her hand.</p> <p>\u201cGood, you\u2019re back. We need a minute with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI need a day, if you can spare me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow or the next day. Soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to know what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re going down to GraceValley to see Judge Forrest. I hope you don\u2019t mind, but I called Brie. I asked her about getting a lawyer for Paige in L.A. in case she needs one. But what she\u2019s after from Judge Forrest is a restraining order, custody\u2014at least temporary. From her husband, who beat her up. A lot.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked from Paige to Preacher. \u201cIs that what you want to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Jack. I\u2019m backing Paige up so she can get out of this mess and keep her kid and her baby safe.\u201d Paige looked down as if ashamed. Preacher saw that and nudged her, then with a finger, lifted her chin and said to her, \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong, Paige.\u201d Then to Jack he said, \u201cI told Paige we\u2019d all back her up. Not let anything bad happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad happen?\u201d Jack repeated.</p><p>\u201cPaige is pregnant. She needs our help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cThing is\u2014here\u2019s something about that restraining order. The husband\u2014he can find out where she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Jack said. He hadn\u2019t known that. \u201cYou sure that\u2019s the best way to go? I mean, what are the odds someone\u2019s going to find her here, if you just stay quiet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t really get around it,\u201d Preacher said with a shrug. \u201cThe husband\u2014he\u2019s reported her missing. And Chris, missing. If anyone does sniff her out here, even worse things are going to happen. We\u2019re just going to have to face it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust remember, if you do this, these domestic things can be dicey. Real dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Preacher glowered at Jack. \u201cLooks like it already was. That shit\u2019s gotta stop. And Paige needs us to help put a stop to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, yeah. I\u2019m there. Anyone comes around and makes trouble, you know we can handle that. But\u2014you sure you want to dive into this? It might not come out the way you want,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHave you looked at alternatives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, John,\u201d Paige said. \u201cIt could be a mistake. You could get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting hurt. No one\u2019s getting hurt. Except, best-case scenario, him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least think about it, Preacher,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Preacher\u2019s expression darkened and his eyes narrowed. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this, Jack,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jack took a breath. \u201cOkay, Preach. Okay, whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Preacher sensed that Paige had a bad case of nerves, and he didn\u2019t blame her. He blamed Jack. It was wrong of him to raise questions, put Paige on the defensive as he had. The very night of that discussion with Jack, right after Christopher was put to bed, while there were still a couple of guys at the bar, Paige quietly said, \u201cI think we should reconsider this plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be afraid, Paige. There\u2019s only one real danger\u2014losing Christopher in the court. And I may be just a big dope, but I can\u2019t see that happening. Not after what\u2019s been done to you. He has a record, Paige. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s your word against his. They\u2019d be putting Chris in danger. I can\u2019t believe any judge would let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s right\u2014you shouldn\u2019t be getting yourself into this mess. We can still get away, me and Christopher. I can get to that address in Washington, get things in order. Get into that underground that gives women and children new identities...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d he said again. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. I talked to Judge Forrest and he\u2019s optimistic about working this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are alternatives to taking this kind of chance, is all I\u2019m saying....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige, if it comes to that, I\u2019ll take you away myself. Stay with you until you get into some safe place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a promise, Paige.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hold you to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a promise to myself.\u201d</p><p>When Preacher proved intractable, Paige just said good-night and went up the back stairs. But, worried about her, after he closed the bar and locked the door, he crept up those stairs and tapped lightly at the door. When she opened it, he could see she\u2019d been crying. Her eyes were red and her face pink from the tears.</p><p>The little suitcase was open on the bureau, clothes neatly folded inside.</p><p>\u201cAw, Paige,\u201d he said, pulling on her hand, drawing her out of the room so that Christopher wouldn\u2019t be awakened.</p><p>She leaned against him and wept onto his chest. He put his arms around her and held her for a little while, gently stroking her back. Finally he said, \u201cCome on. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>He took her downstairs, his arm around her shoulders, and led her into his room, leaving the door open so they could hear Christopher if he woke. Taking her hand, he directed her to the sofa in the living area, now crowded with the weight set he\u2019d taken out of his old bedroom. He sat in the big leather chair at a right angle to her. He scooted forward and reached for her hands. Holding them, looking into her eyes, he asked, \u201cAre you so scared you were going to run?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and he ran a finger along the line of her jaw.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try to get through this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEven if it works, there\u2019s no way I can ever repay you,\u201d Paige said.</p><p>He just shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything from you, Paige. Except that no one ever hits you again. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Paige just had to touch his face. She put her small palm against his cheek and whispered, \u201cYou are such an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw. I\u2019m just an average guy.\u201d He laughed a little. \u201cA below-average guy.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and a tear escaped and rolled down her cheek. Preacher carefully wiped it away. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a man has a family like this\u2014you and Christopher and a new baby coming\u2014why? It seems like he\u2019d do anything in the world to keep you safe, not hurt you. I wish...\u201d He shook his head sadly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wish, John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve to have a man who loves you and never lets you forget it. Someone who wants to raise Christopher into a solid and strong man, a good man who respects women.\u201d He put his hand against her hair, grabbing a silky fistful. \u201cIf I had a woman like you, I\u2019d be so careful,\u201d he said in a whisper.</p><p>She looked into his tender eyes and smiled, but it was tinged with fear and sadness.</p><p>\u201cCome here, let me hold you,\u201d he said, pulling her to him. She slipped onto his lap, pulled up her legs and curled against him, her head on his shoulder, his arm around her back. She nestled like a little kitten against his broad chest.</p><p>Preacher leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes, his arms around her, holding her against him. All I have to offer is this, he thought. Help. Safety. We\u2019ll get this bastard out of her life, she\u2019ll grow strong and confident again. And then she\u2019ll go. Somewhere down the line there will be a man\u2014one who treats her right. But until then, sometimes she might need someone to hold her for a little while. And if it gets to be me, those few times, I\u2019ll make the most of it.</p><p>He sat like that until the small clock on the wall said that it was midnight. Paige had not moved in hours; she slept in his arms. He could stay there until dawn, just feeling her small body against his. With a deep sigh, he kissed the top of her head. Then he stood, carefully lifting her in his arms. She roused briefly, looking up at his face. \u201cShh,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed. We have a big day tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He carried her up the back stairs and into his old room. Preacher lowered her to the bed, next to her son, and brushed the hair away from her brow. \u201cThank you, John,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing what I want to do.\u201d</p><p>Jack was splitting logs at 7:00 a.m. when Preacher came out of the back door of his living quarters and walked toward him. Jack leaned the ax against the tree stump and turned toward his friend. Then, noting the menacing look on Preacher\u2019s face, tipped his head slightly and frowned, wondering what was wrong.</p><p>Before he could wonder for long, Preacher landed a shattering blow to Jack\u2019s face, knocking him backward about three feet and flat on his ass. It felt like a bomb going off in his head. \u201cJesus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you thinking, making her feel like she\u2019s doing something wrong?\u201d Preacher demanded. \u201cYou oughta have more brains in your head than that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa\u201d was all Jack could say. He stayed where he was, a hand pressed to his jaw. He didn\u2019t dare get back on his feet until he was ready to fight the man. And when Preacher was this pissed, that seemed a stupid idea.</p><p>\u201cThe girl\u2019s already scared to death and doesn\u2019t think she deserves any help, and I got you questioning me. What the hell\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Preacher...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve expected more out of you, Jack. It\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t been there. Mel came up here with some shit on her back\u2014not the same shit, but shit just the same. And if I\u2019d told you, right in front of her, that you shouldn\u2019t be getting involved, you would have taken me out on the spot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said slowly. He moved his jaw back and forth with his hand. Not broken. He said, \u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d He touched his cheek right below his eye. Now, that might be broken.</p><p>\u201cI thought I could count on you to step up. You could always count on me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so the girl\u2019s gotten real important to you...\u201d he said carefully.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what this is about! I\u2019m just trying to help out\u2014I don\u2019t expect anything. But I sure didn\u2019t expect you to try to back end me out of helping her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never do anything I don\u2019t want to do!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. Boy, do I get that.\u201d He started to get up and Preacher put out his hand. Jack took the assist only to find himself shoved back onto the ground.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t help, then at least shut the fuck up!\u201d</p><p>And with that Preacher turned and stomped back into his quarters.</p><p>Jack stayed down another minute. He drew up his knees and circled them with his arms. He tried shaking the cobwebs out of his head. Whoa, he thought. Damn.</p><p>He got slowly to his feet and decided the log-splitting could wait. He was seeing a few stars. He meandered over to Doc\u2019s and walked in. Mel was not yet in town but Doc was in the kitchen making coffee. He turned as Jack came in and squinted at him. \u201cHow\u2019s the other guy look?\u201d Doc asked.</p> <p>\u201cI think I might\u2019ve stepped on Preacher\u2019s little toes,\u201d he said. \u201cHave an ice pack?\u201d</p><p>A half hour later the front door opened and Mel came in. She left her medical bag in the reception area and went to the kitchen for coffee, where she found Jack sitting at the table, an ice pack held to his eye. Something about this seemed not to surprise her terribly. She leisurely poured herself a mug and sat down at the table. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d she said, wearing a very superior expression. \u201cYou felt the need to give advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I listen to you?\u201d he asked, lowering the ice pack to reveal a bruised cheek and black eye that was threatening to swell shut. She shook her head in disgust.</p><p>\u201cAs it turns out, Preacher does know what hit him,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cToldja,\u201d she said, leaning her chin into her hand, elbow on the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cHe took some exception to my advice that he might want to give serious thought to getting involved in this mess.\u201d</p> <p>She tsked so that he would know she found him stupid without coming right out and saying so.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I said I was sorry. That he was right and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter he cleaned your clock, I assume....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. After.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re usually on the same team,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWhen there\u2019s not a woman between you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, there\u2019s this little rule about opinions. They\u2019re only good when someone actually asks you for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did say something about how I could just shut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go. Who\u2019d figure Preacher for sage advice?\u201d</p><p>He made a face at her and put the ice back against his face. He winced.</p><p>\u201cHurts, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, that boy\u2019s got an arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to sit over here and hide out for as long as you want, but sooner or later you\u2019re going to have to kiss and make up. Aren\u2019t you at the bar today so he can go over to see the judge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But I was going to give him time to cool down a little. I\u2019m going to need at least one eye to see out of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think if Preacher had more in mind for you, he\u2019d have already delivered it.\u201d</p><p>A little while later Jack walked into the kitchen at the bar and saw Preacher scowl his greeting. Bravely, Jack walked up to the counter. \u201cHey, man,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were right, I was wrong, and I\u2019d like us to get back on the same team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure this team of mine isn\u2019t too much trouble for little you?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you about done? Because this really hurts and I\u2019m trying not to deck you right now. We could\u2019ve just talked about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure I was clear,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cI get it, Preach. Now, come on. I\u2019m only going to ask once.\u201d</p><p>Preacher seemed to think about it a second, then slowly put out his hand. Jack shook it and said, \u201cDon\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me want to.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before Paige came downstairs with Christopher. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d she said, looking at Jack\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s much worse than it looks,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got too close to the rear end of a mule.\u201d He pulled a disc out of his back pocket. \u201cMel told me to give you this\u2014some pictures she took. In case you need it. But she said it should come with a warning\u2014they\u2019re very scary pictures, whatever that means,\u201d he said, pretending he hadn\u2019t already seen them. \u201cShe still has copies, so you can leave this, if someone asks for it\u2014like the judge.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>Judge Forrest served in the Superior Court and made his home in Grace Valley. In his seventies, he was spry and had a serious, perhaps grim countenance. But for Preacher he had a ready smile and handshake. They met not in the courtroom, but in the judge\u2019s office. Preacher and Paige sat in chairs facing his desk, Christopher in the outside office with the judge\u2019s secretary. Judge Forrest asked Paige some questions about her life in Los Angeles.</p><p>Paige explained that she had been married to Wes Lassiter for six years, that Christopher was her three-year-old son and she was a little over two months pregnant. The abuse began right away\u2014he\u2019d actually hit her once before they were married. It became increasingly worse and horribly violent in the past couple of years. \u201cBut I should have seen it coming from the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was very controlling even before we were married. And he had a temper, rarely at me, but just about things in general. You know, like driving. Or anger about something at work. He\u2019s a trader. Stocks and commodities\u2014very high stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the most recent abuse...?\u201d the judge asked.</p><p>With a trembling hand, she slid a disc across his desk. \u201cWhen I got to Virgin River, the nurse practitioner in the doctor\u2019s office examined me because I was threatening to miscarry. She took pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s wife,\u201d Preacher explained, for the judge had been fishing with Jack. \u201cMel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was the last time,\u201d Paige said. \u201cThe one that sent me running. Once again.\u201d</p><p>Judge Forrest took the disc and slid it into the portal on his computer. He clicked the mouse a few times, then turned his eyes toward her. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you notify the police?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever notified the police?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTwice. And I had a restraining order once, which he violated. I couldn\u2019t even stay with my mother\u2014he threatened her, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel Sheridan dated these pictures,\u201d the judge said.</p><p>\u201cI know. She said she\u2019d take a medical history, no last name, date it and have it handy in case I needed it for treatment, or whatever....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed it. Your injuries are dated September 5. He reported you and your son missing on the twelfth.\u201d Judge leaned toward her. \u201cYoung woman, this is a dangerous man. If you don\u2019t press charges, there is no hope of stopping him. You certainly can\u2019t stop him on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t file charges against me sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Judge said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want you recovered and returned to L.A. while you looked like this.\u201d He popped the disc out and handed it back to her. \u201cI\u2019m granting you a TRO and temporary custody based on these pictures and what I can safely assume will be the testimony of your practitioner, and others. He beat you up, then waited until you had time to get away, possibly out of state, before reporting you missing\u2014which presupposes you told him you were leaving. As far as I know, with his permission.\u201d Paige opened her mouth, and Judge held up his hand to silence her. \u201cDon\u2019t say any more without a lawyer, young lady. That week that he waited before missing his wife and son speaks volumes. But you\u2019re going to need some legal help. With any luck, you can obtain a divorce and permanent custody in absentia, but don\u2019t be too surprised if you\u2019re required to go back to L.A. If that happens, don\u2019t stay with family. Your location should be undisclosed. And don\u2019t go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing this through,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>Judge gave a nod of approval. \u201cYour paperwork should be ready in about an hour. Maybe two. Go have some lunch and come back.\u201d He stood up. \u201cI wish you good luck.\u201d</p><p>Later in the afternoon, as they drove back to Virgin River, Paige said, \u201cNow comes the scary part.\u201d</p><p>Rick was whistling as he arrived at work. He came from the back, through the deserted kitchen, into the bar. Jack was going through some receipts at the bar as Rick came in. \u201cHey, Jack,\u201d Rick said. And Jack looked up. \u201cHoly God!\u201d Rick said, jumping back. \u201cMan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Kind of ugly, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho hit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran into a door,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Rick said, shaking his head. \u201cThat door has a name. And there\u2019s only one guy I can think of who could get one like that off on you. What did you do to piss him off?\u201d</p><p>Jack shook his head and chuckled. \u201cToo smart for your own damn good, aren\u2019t you? I had an opinion I should\u2019ve kept to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. You told him not to get mixed up with Paige, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jack straightened indignantly. \u201cNow, why the hell would you say something like that?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s pretty obvious how Preach feels about her, and her kid. Where is the big man?\u201d Rick asked, looking around.</p><p>\u201cHe took Paige over to the county courthouse to see a judge. He should be back any time now.\u201d</p><p>Rick\u2019s face split in a huge grin. Then he started to laugh. He plunged his hands in his pockets, rocked back on his heels, shaking his head. Laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack demanded.</p><p>\u201cAw, Jack,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you tell him not to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jack insisted. Then he let out a huge sigh. \u201cI\u2019d be dead now if I\u2019d told him not to.\u201d He pointed at his face. \u201cI got this for telling him he might want to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my Jesus,\u201d Rick said. \u201cPreacher-man is all in. Got a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m not sure he gets that yet, so watch your step.\u201d</p><p>Rick stepped close and gave Jack a shot to the arm with his fist. \u201cCome on. I\u2019m not dumb enough to get between him and a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Jack said. And he thought, am I the only one around here without a brain?</p><p>Jack left the bar a little early because he was tired of people asking him what happened to his face. He was having a quiet evening in the cabin with Mel when the phone rang. When Jack heard the voice of his youngest sister, he beamed. \u201cBrie! How you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Jack. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Listen, Preacher told me he asked you for some advice about this young woman he\u2019s helping out. That was good of you, Brie. It\u2019s a bad situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m calling with some names for you to write down. Got a pen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound a little rushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a little. Ready to copy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, picking up a pen. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>She rattled off a few names of lawyers, a couple in L.A., a couple in northern California, spelling for him when he asked her to. \u201cTell the woman to contact one of these local lawyers immediately, before she makes a move, before the husband can make another move. Immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Why do you sound so pissed off?\u201d he asked her. \u201cBad day in court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig case,\u201d she said shortly. \u201cNot my best day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s Brad up to? He around?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Without missing a beat she said, \u201cPut Mel on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat. Can I talk to Mel, please?\u201d</p><p>Jack held the phone toward Mel, who, with a perplexed look on her face, got off the couch and went to him. She took the phone in confusion; she said hello.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d came Brie\u2019s stressed voice. \u201cI need you to tell him for me, because I can\u2019t talk to him about this yet. Tell Jack\u2014Brad left me. Left me for another woman. He hasn\u2019t even taken his clothes, which tells me he might already be moved in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie?\u201d Mel said in question. \u201cWhat...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy best friend,\u201d she said, rage dripping from every word. \u201cChristine, my best friend. I never knew. Never even suspected.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrie, when did this happen?\u201d Mel asked, and that question spoken into the phone brought Jack back to the kitchen, hovering.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost a week since he told me he\u2019s been fucking her for a year! We were talking about babies\u2014he said he wanted a baby. We\u2019ve been having sex like mad, and he\u2019s been having it like mad down the street.\u201d She laughed bitterly. \u201cYou suppose she wanted a baby, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Brie...\u201d Mel tried.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to come back for his things. I\u2019m thinking of burning everything on the front lawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s seen a lawyer already. He knows better than to face me without a really good lawyer. He wants a divorce\u2014fast.\u201d She laughed. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s pregnant or something. Wouldn\u2019t that be rich?\u201d And then her voice broke for a moment.</p> <p>Mel had only known Brie a short time. For that matter, she hadn\u2019t known Jack all that long. But of Jack\u2019s four sisters, she felt closest to Brie; they were around the same age and Brie was Jack\u2019s pet. The baby of the family.</p><p>Jack and Mel had just been to Sacramento\u2014it was where they were married. Unless she was completely blind and distracted, it had looked to her as if Brad and Brie were the most loving, the most openly affectionate couple out of his four married sisters. This didn\u2019t seem possible, a few short weeks later.</p><p>\u201cTell Jack for me, okay? He thinks all the brothers-in-law are true brothers. This\u2019ll go down hard. You tell him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie, stop!\u201d Mel insisted. \u201cCome to us. Take a week off and come up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, sounding suddenly deflated. \u201cI have a big case building. Brad knows all about my case,\u201d she said. \u201cHe broke it to me now, when my defenses are down, when I have nothing in me to fight with.\u201d She laughed bitterly. \u201cDo you fight for a man who\u2019s been sleeping with your best friend for a year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Mel answered, her heart sinking.</p><p>\u201cMel, tell Jack I\u2019ll call him in a while. Tell him I don\u2019t want to talk to him about this yet. Please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, honey. Whatever you want. You have someone to lean on? Your sisters? Dad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m leaning like crazy. But I have to be strong through this\u2014strong and mad. If I talk to Jack, he\u2019s going to make me cry. I can\u2019t afford to fall apart yet.\u201d</p><p>And then abruptly, Brie hung up, leaving Mel holding a dead phone with a completely shocked expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cShe asked me to tell you Brad moved out. Asked her for a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>Mel nodded. \u201cAnd she said, please, she doesn\u2019t want to talk to you about it right now. Later. She\u2019ll call later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d he said, grabbing for the phone.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you respect her wishes?\u201d Mel asked, even as Jack punched in numbers.</p><p>He stood with the phone at his ear for a long time as it rang. Then, apparently Brie let the machine come on, because he said, \u201cPick up, Brie. Come on\u2014I have to hear your voice. Goddammit, pick up! I can\u2019t do this\u2014waiting around like this. Brie\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mel was close enough to hear Brie say, \u201cYou absolutely never do as you\u2019re told, do you?\u201d And Jack sighed heavily. Mel left the kitchen.</p><p>The cabin was very small, so going as far as the living room didn\u2019t really afford Jack much privacy as he stood by the kitchen sink, but he turned his back and talked in soft tones for a long time. There was plenty of quiet to indicate he also listened, something Jack was pretty good at, for a man.</p><p>Mel looked at her watch a couple of times. It was more than thirty minutes before he put the phone down and sat beside her on the couch. \u201cYou make her cry?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201c\u2019Course I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014I just had to know about this, that\u2019s all. I want to talk to him. She threatened to kill me if I call him.\u201d</p><p>She ran a finger under the bruise on his cheek. \u201cI had no idea, when I married you, how much you\u2019re in everyone\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>Jack stood and left the room. He went to the empty bedroom where he stored boxes of things he\u2019d brought from his quarters behind the bar. He had a dusty, framed black-and-white photo in his hand and rubbed the sleeve of his shirt over it, cleaning it off. It was Jack, age sixteen, holding Brie, age five. Jack held her on his hip, her arms around his neck. He was looking off, pointing at something; she was laughing, her golden curls lifted by the wind. \u201cShe was always like my shadow,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t shake her. When I went into the Marines she was only six. All the girls got sloppy about me leaving, but Brie was heartbroken.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cI know she\u2019s a big-shot prosecutor. I hear she\u2019s one of the scariest prosecutors they have\u2014a real killer. But it\u2019s hard for me to think of her as anything but my baby sister, little Brie. I wanna do something....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should let her tell you what she needs,\u201d Mel advised. \u201cDon\u2019t get her all mixed up in your agenda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy agenda...\u201d he said absently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve suffered a loss, too, Jack. It\u2019s a real tight family you have\u2014I saw that. This is going to shake up everyone. Just try not to make your loss taxing on Brie\u2019s emotions. She has enough hurt. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYeah.\u201d He sat back on the couch, the picture resting on his lap. The expression on his face darkened. \u201cI thought of him as a brother,\u201d he said. \u201cI trusted him with the care of my sister. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever understand how he could defect like this.\u201d He grabbed his wife\u2019s hand. \u201cYou know, in the middle of all that, while Brie\u2019s trying not to cry, she says to give Paige her phone numbers. To tell Paige she\u2019s prosecuted batterers and knows all their tricks. Mel, I usually understand the things that men do. Right now men don\u2019t make any sense to me.\u201d</p><p>Paige called Brie and one of the recommended lawyers. Brie advised her to be prepared for contact from her husband\u2014it was probable he\u2019d get in touch. Argue, maybe threaten, try to use their child as leverage. \u201cI know,\u201d Paige said. And peaceful sleep through the night was impossible, even though John assured her they were locked up tight and he wouldn\u2019t miss a sound.</p><p>She was jittery and distracted; the smile patrons had grown accustomed to as she served and cleaned up was missing. She looked outside a lot, scanning the area. Every time the phone rang, she tensed. \u201cJohn, if he called here, you would tell me, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. But he has your lawyer\u2019s name\u2014he should really call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he won\u2019t,\u201d Paige said.</p><p>Mel tried to cheer her up, lure her out. \u201cHave you been outside in the past three days?\u201d she asked Paige.</p><p>Paige leaned close. \u201cI\u2019m fighting the urge to load Chris in the car and run for cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Mel said. \u201cWith any luck, the lawyers will battle this out quickly and settle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to walk across the street and watch the afternoon soap with Connie and Joy. Come with me\u2014laugh a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige, you haven\u2019t seen the sky in three days. Come on. It\u2019s just across the street. We\u2019ll look both ways.\u201d</p><p>Preacher, overprotective, walked out onto the porch at the bar and watched them cross, noting nothing out of the ordinary on the quiet main street. But when the soap was over and the women were returning, Paige\u2019s worst fear was waiting for her, right in broad daylight, right on the street. Parked alongside of the bar was an SUV, and leaning against it was a man. Mel didn\u2019t even notice. She was chattering about the older women\u2019s running commentary on the soap opera when Paige stopped walking.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she said in a breath. She tugged at Mel\u2019s sleeve, stopping her in the middle of the street.</p><p>He was positioned between them and the bar, one leg lazily crossed in front of the other, hands in his pockets as he watched them, a satisfied smile shaping his lips.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Paige whispered.</p><p>\u201cIs it him?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she said, drawing a fearful breath.</p><p>He pushed himself off the car and walked toward them, slowly and leisurely. Mel instantly put herself between Paige and the man. \u201cYou can\u2019t be here,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThere\u2019s a restraining order.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a large, folded document out of his back pocket, kept coming and said, \u201cThere\u2019s also a court order for Paige to return my son to Los Angeles for a custody hearing. I\u2019m here to pick him up. Paige,\u201d he said, \u201cwho do you think you\u2019re screwing with, huh? Come on, we\u2019re going home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Mel yelled, shielding Paige from his approach. \u201cJesus. Jack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d Paige said in a near cry.</p><p>As Paige continued to back slowly away, moving in the direction of the store, Mel held her ground. While the man approached, although he had a sinister twist to his mouth, he was clearly no match for the men waiting just inside the bar, waiting to protect Paige. This preppy man in his pleated pants and Florsheim Chester loafers was not like the big Virgin River men. How could he inflict so much power, so much damage? He was smaller than Jack; so much smaller than Preacher. Goodness, he was about Rick\u2019s size! Not quite six feet with short, moussed, spiky brown hair. A pretty boy from the city. He was going to be very surprised.</p><p>Mel caught a glimpse of Jack coming onto the bar porch just as Paige turned and broke into a run. Wes Lassiter shoved Mel roughly out of his way to give chase. Mel stumbled backward and fell. Her fleeting thought was, Oh, Jack will have seen that. She could hear Jack\u2019s heavy tread into the street before she could refocus and watch his running approach. She glanced over her shoulder to see that he wasn\u2019t fast enough to save Paige. Lassiter caught up with Paige, grabbed her by the hair on the back of her head and threw her to the ground. In a blur of unreality, Mel watched as he drew back his foot and kicked her, shouting, \u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re gonna do, huh? Leave me?\u201d</p><p>Jack glanced down at Mel and she glanced up at him briefly as he ran on to Paige\u2019s rescue.</p><p>Just as Lassiter drew his foot back to deliver another kick to Paige\u2019s stomach, Jack hooked an arm around his neck, lifted him clear off the ground and away from Paige. He whirled him and threw him from his victim; he landed a few feet away.</p><p>Preacher, who had no doubt been in the kitchen when Mel screamed, was the next one out of the bar, Rick on his heels. A glance at Paige found her struggling to sit up, a hand covering her face, her nose bleeding from her head-first plunge onto the ground. Mel crawled the short distance toward Paige as Jack was trying to help her sit up, when Preacher came running into the street.</p><p>Preacher saw that Mel and Jack were with Paige and he went directly to Lassiter, who was still down. Preacher bent at the waist, grabbed the man under his arms and lifted him straight up, clear off the ground. They were face-to-face, Lassiter\u2019s feet swinging in the air. For a moment, a look of sheer terror showed on Lassiter\u2019s face as he stared into Preacher\u2019s enraged eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI could hit you one time, jag-off, and you\u2019d never get up,\u201d Preacher snarled into the man\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d Paige cried. \u201cJohn!\u201d</p> <p>Preacher felt Jack\u2019s hand on one of his arms. \u201cPreach, go get Paige.\u201d</p><p>He looked over his shoulder at her, sitting up, crying, her hand pressed over her nose and blood running down her chin. He held Lassiter off the ground effortlessly; he wanted to pummel him till he cried. He looked back at Lassiter\u2019s shocked face, staring into his frightened eyes for a second, and thought, I can\u2019t do violence in front of her. She might think I\u2019m like him. I\u2019m not like him. Preacher dropped the man to the ground. He bent his face close to Lassiter\u2019s and said, \u201cDo not get up.\u201d Then he straightened, whirled and went to Paige a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Preacher said. He got down on one knee and lifted her off the ground, into his arms. He stood with her against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she wept against his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her hand away from her face, saw the blood coming from her nose.</p> <p>\u201cAw, Paige, that should never have happened to you,\u201d he said. He started to carry her to Doc\u2019s.</p><p>Jack helped Mel to her feet. She brushed herself off and stood for him. \u201cI\u2019m not hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cI just got off balance....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>She nodded and Jack turned toward Lassiter, still crumpled on the ground. His look of fear was gone and replaced with a narrow-eyed sneer that made Jack furious.</p><p>Rick bravely put himself between Jack and Lassiter. When Jack turned from Mel, Rick took one look at the storm gathering on Jack\u2019s face, the way he clenched his fists open and closed, and stepped out of his way.</p><p>Jack walked over to Lassiter and stuck out a hand to assist him in standing. \u201cGood thing you stopped him,\u201d Lassiter said, putting out his hand for assistance. \u201cI\u2019d have had his ass.\u201d</p> <p>Jack pulled him to his feet with a snarl, and once he was upright, threw a punch into his face that blew him across the street four feet. He walked the few feet and stood over Lassiter, looking down at him. \u201cNow you gonna have mine?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lassiter looked up at him, blood immediately spurting from his nose. \u201cWhat the hell...?\u201d He got clumsily to his feet and faced off with Jack, his fists up as a boxer would do. He shuffled his feet a little, dancing, ready to land a blow with a closed fist.</p><p>Jack actually laughed, completely loose, relaxed. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d he said. He wiggled his fingers. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Lassiter came at him, then retreated suddenly, whirled in a crouch and came up with a high kick aimed at Jack\u2019s head. But Jack stopped the assault of Lassiter\u2019s foot with a fast hand that grabbed his ankle. Jack yanked hard and Lassiter landed on his back, his ankle still in Jack\u2019s grip. \u201cWhat you going to do, buddy? Kick me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d</p><p>Jack dropped the leg and reached down to pull him to his feet by the front of his expensive shirt. He threw a punch into his gut, doubling Lassiter over. Then another one to his face, reeling him backward onto the ground.</p><p>At Doc\u2019s porch steps, Preacher turned around and looked over his shoulder at what Jack was doing, then continued on.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had it now,\u201d Lassiter said with a strained, breathless voice.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had it quite yet,\u201d Jack said, pulling him up again. He delivered one more blow to the man\u2019s face, sending him airborne a few feet before he landed in the dirt, rolling around, semiconscious. Jack brushed his hands together to remove the stain. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve had it,\u201d he said. \u201cRick, tie his hands behind his back. I\u2019m going to call the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Jack,\u201d Rick said, sprinting off to the bar in search of rope.</p><p>Mel shook her head. \u201cShame on you,\u201d she said to Jack.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Melinda. But someone had to knock the shit out of this asshole at least once, and if Preacher had done that, this idiot would never walk again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you get into trouble, don\u2019t come crying to me,\u201d she said, and turned to follow Paige and Preacher into Doc\u2019s.</p><p>Paige lay on the examining table in Doc\u2019s clinic and Preacher held her hand in both of his. \u201cI let you down,\u201d he was saying, so softly Mel barely heard.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige, were you afraid I was going to hurt him?\u201d Her eyes shifted away from his face and he brushed a soft hand against the hair at her temples. \u201cPaige, I could\u2019ve hit him\u2014but I don\u2019t lose control. Paige,\u201d he said, putting a finger and thumb on her chin, turning her eyes back to his face. \u201cPaige, I don\u2019t lose control. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded weakly. Mel put an ice pack on Paige\u2019s face and told her to hold it there, then noticed that a dark stain was spreading in the crotch of her jeans. \u201cPreacher, please step out of the room and call Doc so we can examine Paige.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said to Paige. \u201cI let you down.\u201d</p><p>Paige put a hand on his face. Preacher put a light kiss on her forehead and left, hanging his head. Mel knew the only way this could have turned out differently was if Preacher had been strapped to Paige\u2019s side twenty-four hours a day. Lassiter was quick and mean. Obviously crazy.</p><p>And Paige was bleeding, perhaps miscarrying.</p><p>Mel shook out a sheet to cover Paige. She leaned over her and said, \u201cHelp me pull off your jeans, Paige. We have a problem. You might be miscarrying.\u201d</p><p>Although she cried softly, she was able to lift her hips enough for the pants to be removed. Blood immediately began to pool beneath her and Mel decided not to examine her; she didn\u2019t want to aggravate a hemorrhage. Rather, she fixed her up with a Peripad, covered her with the sheet, and told her she\u2019d be right back.</p><p>She met Doc in the hall before he came into the examining room. \u201cWe need to transport her, at least to Grace Valley\u2014and maybe on to Valley Hospital. Will you call John Stone and have Preacher bring the gurney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpontaneous AB?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAt least. I just hope it\u2019s not a uterine hemorrhage. The girl is only twenty-nine. I\u2019m not going to examine her. I\u2019m going to leave that to John. Will you please tell him there was severe abdominal trauma? Bastard kicked her.\u201d</p><p>Doc grimaced, but then he nodded and went to talk to Preacher.</p><p>Back in the exam room, Mel bent over Paige. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to the OB in Grace Valley, Paige. We need a specialist. Possibly a surgeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I losing the baby?\u201d she asked weakly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you\u2014it doesn\u2019t look good. I\u2019ve asked that Preacher bring the gurney back. Would you like him to go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have to talk to him, though.\u201d</p><p>When Preacher rolled the gurney to the exam room, Mel told him to take a moment with Paige, quickly, then she would need his help to load her. He stepped into the room and took her hand, the one that wasn\u2019t holding the ice pack to her face. \u201cJohn,\u201d she said, \u201cplease make sure Christopher is all right. That he doesn\u2019t see his father. That he knows Mama is okay. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel and Jack can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, John. Please. Take care of Chris. I\u2019ll be all right, but I don\u2019t want him scared and I don\u2019t want him to see his father. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want,\u201d he said. \u201cPaige...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no more apologies,\u201d she said. \u201cTake care of Chris.\u201d</p><p>Preacher assisted Mel in sliding Paige from the exam table to the gurney, and the bright red puddle of blood left behind as she was moved caused his own blood to roar in his ears. As he pushed the gurney out of Doc\u2019s office, Rick ran to help him lift it down the porch stairs to the waiting Hummer. His vision blurred as his eyes clouded with unshed tears. \u201cEverything will be all right, Paige,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of Chris.\u201d</p><p>Wes Lassiter had achieved a kneeling position in the street, his hands bound behind his back, his face bloody and swelling. He\u2019d begun to draw a crowd. Several men were leaning on the rail or sitting on the porch chairs at Jack\u2019s while Jack and Preacher sat on the steps, watching. Jack\u2019s hand was plunged into a bowl full of ice when the sheriff\u2019s deputy pulled into town. He had to carefully drive around the man in the street and parked at the bar, right in front of Jack.</p><p>It was the same deputy who had attended the shooting Jack had been involved in over a month ago when a drug addict, looking for narcotics from Doc\u2019s drug cabinet, had held a knife on Mel. The deputy, Henry Depardeau, got out of the car and hitched up his gun belt. \u201cSheridan,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot more of you these days than I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d Jack said. He lifted his swollen hand. \u201cI\u2019d shake, but...\u201d</p><p>Henry threw a look over his shoulder. \u201cYou do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. The man threw my pregnant wife to the ground so he could kick the shit out of his own pregnant wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew.\u201d Henry shook his head and looked down. \u201cHe punch you?\u201d Henry asked, pointing to his own cheek, indicating the bruise Jack still wore.</p><p>\u201cNah. I wasn\u2019t going to let him hit me. This is old,\u201d he explained. \u201cI walked into a door. A big, stupid door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you beat him. That\u2019s two batteries, Jack. His and yours. Might have to hook you both up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you have to do, Henry. He did try to kick me in the head, though. That count for anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. At least you didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaved his life,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cI was going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get that blood on you there, big fella?\u201d Henry asked Preacher.</p><p>\u201cCarrying Paige to Doc\u2019s. Paige being his wife,\u201d Preacher said, looking down at the wide smear of blood on his shirt. To Jack he said, \u201cShew\u2014I better change this shirt before Chris wakes up from his nap. The things you don\u2019t think about with kids.\u201d And he got up quickly, going inside.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Henry said to Jack. \u201cYou did that all by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been taken to a specialist\u2014an OB. She might be losing that baby. He knew she was pregnant, by the way,\u201d Jack added, throwing a glance in Lassiter\u2019s direction. \u201cLast I heard, besides being thrown to the ground by her hair and kicked in the stomach, she\u2019s bleeding real bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitnesses to this beating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty. There\u2019s me, Preacher, Rick here, my wife, who took the woman to the doctor in Grace Valley. You can catch up with her later. It was an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Lassiter yelled. \u201cI\u2019m over here!\u201d</p><p>Henry glanced lazily over his shoulder and said, \u201cYeah? Then shut up.\u201d Back to Jack, he said, \u201cI suppose I can trust you to stay right here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I gonna go, Henry? I want to be sure Mel\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what we\u2019re going to do. I\u2019m going to book him. And if the sheriff wants you to come in, you drive on over. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Henry.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head again. \u201cI just can\u2019t figure out why anyone in his right head would bother these Virgin River women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Makes no sense,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>The baby spontaneously aborted\u2014miscarried\u2014before Doc and Mel could even get Paige to Grace Valley. John Stone and June Hudson loaded her in their ambulance and took her to Valley Hospital where, thankfully, a D and C caused the bleeding to slow and no further surgery was required.</p><p>When Paige woke from her procedure, she was told that fortunately it appeared there had been no further damage to her reproductive organs. She would only stay through the night for observation and could be released in the morning, but Dr. Stone wanted her to stay off her feet for at least a couple of days. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>The next face she saw was Preacher\u2019s. \u201cHi,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She reached for his hand. \u201cWhere\u2019s Christopher?\u201d she asked sleepily.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s with Mel and Jack. They\u2019re staying at the bar till I get back. I\u2019ll keep him in my room through the night and bring him with me to pick you up in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPaige, are you awake enough for me to tell you some things? I want to tell you without the boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s how it is. Wes was arrested. Paige, they found drugs on him. They wouldn\u2019t tell me what, just that he\u2019s going to be arraigned for a couple of felonies\u2014battery, possession, defying an order of protection. He might make bail but he\u2019s going to have to go to trial. Judge Forrest promises he\u2019ll at least get a fast trial\u2014and believe me, if I have to stand over you twenty-four hours a day until he\u2019s in prison, I\u2019m willing to do that. I\u2019m so sorry I let this happen to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did all you could, John,\u201d she said sleepily.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not getting off this time. You did it, Paige. Okay? You with me, Paige?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...\u201d He stumbled. \u201cThen, when he\u2019s convicted and locked up, you can go home if you want to. Get your custody and divorce. He can\u2019t get custody if he\u2019s in prison. No ifs. Felons can\u2019t get custody. He can\u2019t keep you from getting a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can do whatever you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long will he be in jail?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d he said. \u201cYour lawyer is trying to get them to add attempted murder to his charges, given the baby, but that\u2019s a real stretch. Paige, I\u2019m awful sorry about the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat baby,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cI tried, but it just didn\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p><p>He put his big hand softly against her tummy, the most personal he\u2019d ever been with her. \u201cI know you did. It wasn\u2019t your fault. It was more my fault than yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, stop saying that. Of all people, it was least of all your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as good as free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFree. I won\u2019t know how to act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019ll want to go back to L.A.?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. So many bad memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want a place to sit for a while, while you think things over, you can have that room that smells like bacon in the morning for as long as you want.\u201d Then very quietly, almost to himself, he said, \u201cFor life, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could help out,\u201d she said. Eyes closed, she smiled sleepily. \u201cI could do dishes.\u201d Her eyelids fluttered a little, but she couldn\u2019t keep them open.</p><p>He brushed her hair back. \u201cJack wants to build a house,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take him away from the business. I could always use the help. You and Christopher...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re done. You have to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and gently touched his lips to her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll be back for you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He started to leave and she said, \u201cJohn?\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her bed.</p><p>\u201cCould I? Stay there until I feel better?\u201d</p><p>His chest felt suddenly full, as if it might burst. He tried to tamp down hope, but it was impossible. \u201cOf course. I love having you there. Everyone loves having you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice there,\u201d she said, and her eyes closed.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Paige was once again burrowed into the room over the kitchen, but this time her injuries were not terrible. She had to recover from her D and C by staying off her feet for a couple of days, and although she\u2019d received a bloody nose, it was not broken. While she rested, Preacher watched Christopher. Via long distance, Brie helped line up a lawyer in L.A. to appeal to the court to reverse the order to return Christopher to his father, given his pending trial. Wes Lassiter made bail after three days and went back to Los Angeles, returning to his job before his employer could sniff out the arrest. Preacher was not content to take Lassiter\u2019s lawyer\u2019s word for that\u2014he called Mike Valenzuela, who was happy to check, twice a day if necessary, to be sure that Lassiter was back at his job, hundreds of miles away from Virgin River.</p><p>It seemed as though things might calm down, at least until the trial, but then Mel was surprised by a patient she wasn\u2019t expecting. A patient and condition she would never have anticipated.</p><p>Doc was off fishing when Mel\u2019s friend Connie came to the clinic. Connie was in her early fifties, a good-natured little redhead who was still recovering from cardiac bypass surgery that she\u2019d had last May. She was almost back to her old self. With her was her niece, Liz. Upon seeing Liz\u2019s face, Mel\u2019s first reaction was to smile brightly, but then, noting that Liz\u2019s eyes were downcast, her smile froze. Mel\u2019s gaze drifted lower to the very slight rounding of her tummy, and she felt her heart plummet. Oh-oh. Then she stole a glance at Connie\u2019s face and saw her friend grimace, then shrug, helpless.</p><p>Connie\u2019s sister had sent Liz to her from Eureka last spring, right around the same time Mel had come to Virgin River. March. The reason was that Liz was a handful, too much for Connie\u2019s sister to handle. She\u2019d been reportedly running wild in Eureka. Both Connie and her sister thought Virgin River might calm the girl down, or at least prove to have fewer opportunities for getting in trouble than were available in the much larger town of Eureka. But when Connie had a heart attack in May, Liz was sent home to her mother.</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d Mel said cheerfully. This was Mel\u2019s work\u2014she knew how to get beyond the shock, the panic. \u201cWelcome back. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot totally great,\u201d Liz said.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s good to see you, anyway,\u201d Mel said, reaching out and taking her hand. \u201cI bet you\u2019re here for an exam. Why don\u2019t you come with me.\u201d</p><p>Liz let herself be led to the exam room. The girl looked quite a bit different than she had last spring. She came into town looking like a hussie; she wore skirts no bigger than napkins, high-heeled boots, abbreviated tops, belly button ring, glossy lips and thick black mascara on her sexy long lashes\u2014like an ad for Playboy. And at the time she was all of fourteen, a very beautiful, provocative fourteen who looked more like eighteen. No wonder her mother had been terrified. Now she was clad in jeans and a bulky sweatshirt that was pulled down to cover her tummy, but it was still evident she was pregnant. Her makeup was much more natural looking and conservative than it had been, but she really didn\u2019t need it at all. She was lovely. And she actually looked younger today than she had last spring. Younger and more vulnerable.</p><p>Rick had taken one look at Liz last spring and went bonkers. Jack and Preacher had been looking out for Rick for years, kind of surrogate big brothers or dads. According to Jack, he\u2019d had a serious talk with Rick about the dangers of intimacy, especially with such a young girl. After Liz went home to her mom, Rick had told Jack that they were no longer seeing each other. Knowing Rick, the kind of young man he was, Mel couldn\u2019t imagine that he would get her pregnant and abandon her. He just didn\u2019t seem like that kind of boy. Mel thought perhaps Liz had wasted no time in finding herself a fella back in Eureka.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Mel said to Liz. \u201cWant to tell me why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant. Obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been examined by a doctor yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t sure I was until...I thought I was just getting fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz, how many periods have you missed?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWho knows? I hardly ever got any, anyway. I never knew when I was supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how far along you might be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a perfect idea. Since there\u2019s only been one person. One guy. One time.\u201d She lifted her clear blue eyes and looked directly into Mel\u2019s.</p><p>Mel had a brief and delusional hope that Rick had escaped this mess. She asked, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, if you can remember the approximate time of conception, it will help us set a due date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay 7th,\u201d she said, and her eyes grew moist.</p><p>Rick, she thought. Damn. Two days before the heart attack that sent Liz home to her mom. And it made her even further along in her pregnancy than Mel was. \u201cWell, first things first. Let\u2019s examine you and see how you\u2019re doing. Can you put on his gown for me? Everything off, bra, panties, the whole bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never...I haven\u2019t ever had one of these....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Liz. It\u2019s not terrible. I\u2019ll give you a few minutes to undress and when I come back, I\u2019ll explain everything as I go. I promise you\u2019ll be fine. Once you\u2019re sexually active, it\u2019s very important to have regular exams, pregnant or not.\u201d</p><p>Even if Liz hadn\u2019t delivered that date of conception, any of Mel\u2019s curiosities would have been quickly answered when she found Connie in the waiting room. \u201cMy sister,\u201d Connie said with an ounce of disgust. \u201cShe said, she got knocked up in Virgin River, she can go back there and have the baby. You\u2019d think I did it.\u201d</p><p>Mel shook her head. \u201cIt happens, Connie. Too often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know which one of them I want to kill most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo killing,\u201d Mel said, reaching out and giving her hand a pat. \u201cLet\u2019s just get them through it and see if they can have their young lives back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid idiots,\u201d Connie said. \u201cWhat were they thinking?\u201d</p><p>Mel sat down beside Connie for a second. \u201cWhat gives you the impression they were thinking? If they were, they were thinking below the waist. How are you feeling? We don\u2019t want your blood pressure up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAch, I\u2019m fine. This just took me by surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling it\u2019s going to take everyone by surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell could she not know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Connie, you\u2019d be amazed at how tight denial can keep those fourteen-year-old tummy muscles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fifteen now. Not that it matters too much.\u201d</p><p>Mel heard herself laugh, though humorlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly less stunning. Let me take care of my patient while you practice deep breathing. Hmm?\u201d</p><p>Liz was already more than five months pregnant. Almost six. She might\u2019ve felt the baby move already, but she wasn\u2019t sure. She thought it was just gas. She thought her breasts were sore because her period was coming. This was so typical of a young girl, especially a young girl who wasn\u2019t getting regular periods. She was oblivious to the changes in her body, combined with an overwhelming desire for it not to be so.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying here now?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cWith your aunt Connie?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI guess so. If she doesn\u2019t just throw me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know she wouldn\u2019t do that. Does this mean you\u2019ve decided to have the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. What else can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this stage, your options are definitely limited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having it. I can\u2019t do anything else now.\u201d She took in a ragged breath. \u201cThis is going to be really bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you, Liz?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>She just shook her head miserably. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can help me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you\u2019re not the first teenager to get pregnant. I won\u2019t kid you\u2014there will be some tough times, getting through this. But you will get through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just hoping to get through today.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so important about today?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cI guess I better tell him. Huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Mel said, and it was not a question.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She lifted her eyes and they welled with tears. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be so mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you didn\u2019t get this way alone. You remember that. I\u2019ll give you a few days to settle in, then we\u2019ll drive down to Grace Valley and get an ultrasound. You\u2019ll be able to see your baby. I think you\u2019ll be able to determine the sex, if you want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can think about who you would like to deliver your baby. You\u2019ll meet the OB in Grace Valley when you have the ultrasound, and given this is a first pregnancy, there\u2019s plenty of time for you to get to Valley Hospital. Or, you can have the baby here, but I don\u2019t administer anesthesia, something you might want to keep in mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I don\u2019t know what to do yet,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou take your time. Some advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cJoin the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait. Tell him right away. Get that part behind you.\u201d</p><p>Liz shuddered. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Rick parked his little truck right next to Jack\u2019s behind the bar and, whistling, he bounded up the back steps and into the kitchen. Preacher was rolling out dough for pies, and right beside him, sitting up on the counter crosslegged and pounding at his own little wad of dough, was Christopher. Preacher\u2019s shadow. Rick tousled the boy\u2019s hair. \u201cHow you doing, buddy? Makin\u2019 pies?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m making my own,\u201d he said, concentrating.</p><p>\u201cGood for you,\u201d Rick said.</p><p>Preacher said, \u201cRick, there\u2019s someone out in the bar here to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cListen, Rick,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cNice and easy, Rick. Take it nice and easy. Use your head. Think before you talk, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he said again, in question.</p><p>Rick went into the next room and saw that Jack was behind the bar serving beer to a couple of men. He met Rick\u2019s eyes and his expression was real serious. Then he inclined his head slightly, into the room. Rick glanced across the room to a corner table, and when he saw her there, his eyes lit up and he grinned. Liz, he thought. Oh, God\u2014Liz! His heart actually started to hammer\u2014he hadn\u2019t seen her since last May and he had missed her like mad! He couldn\u2019t imagine the number of times he thought about her. He\u2019d dreamed about her.</p><p>As he walked quickly around the bar toward her, she stood. And as she stood, her hands automatically went to her middle, as if holding up her round tummy, and the bottom suddenly dropped out of Rick\u2019s world. He stopped dead in his tracks, stunned. Paralyzed. His mouth hung open and his eyes went from her face to her belly to her face. He wanted to run for his life. He wanted to die.</p> <p>From across the room he could see that tears instantly gathered in her eyes. She was scared, he could see that. He heard Preacher\u2019s voice in his head\u2014nice and easy; think before you talk. He managed to close his mouth, swallow and take slow steps toward her. As he neared, she lifted her chin bravely, even though a big, fat tear spilled over.</p><p>His head was spinning. How could this be? It couldn\u2019t be his\u2014she said she was okay\u2014no baby. Next thought\u2014I\u2019m a senior in high school and the only girl I ever did anything with is pregnant, standing here right in front of me, scared to death of me. While I\u2019m scared to death of her... Please, God, let this not happen to me.</p><p>Then, helplessly, What does she think\u2014I\u2019m going to blame her?</p><p>And then he concentrated real hard, as if grabbing hold of his brain\u2014get a grip. A pregnant girl you did it with is standing in front of you, scared to death of you. He heard Jack in his head\u2014it\u2019s not enough to feel like a man, Rick\u2014you have to think like a man. Do the right thing.</p><p>He had limited options. He could run, he could deny, he could pass out, and when they brought him around, she and her belly would be gone.</p><p>Another tear spilled down her cheek while he was in shock. He tried to imagine what Jack would do, because he admired and respected Jack. What would Preacher do? And he got a picture in his mind of Preacher watching over Paige and Chris. He decided that no matter what he was feeling, he\u2019d just act like them. He\u2019d deal with the real issues later. For now, he was at least going to look like a man.</p><p>He stood in front of her, looked into her eyes, her terrified eyes, and managed a soft smile. He put an arm around her waist and drew her close enough to put a kiss on her forehead. His life was unraveling, but what he noticed was that she smelled so good\u2014like he remembered. \u201cLizzie,\u201d he whispered. She let her head drop against his shoulder and he could feel the trembling, feel her shoulders quaking. He pulled her against him and held her. \u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cCome on, Lizzie. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>He looked over his shoulder at Jack and Jack solemnly inclined his head toward the door. He turned back to Liz. \u201cCome on. We have to go somewhere and talk. Come on,\u201d he said, his arm around her waist, leading her out of the bar as she leaned against him in tears.</p><p>He led her out behind the bar where there were no people, where they were alone, and stood with her under a tree. \u201cHere now,\u201d he said. \u201cHow we gonna talk if you cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick,\u201d she said, leaning her head against his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rick.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her chin with a finger and took in her red eyes, her chapped cheeks. He tried to keep his voice soft. Tender. \u201cWhat happened, Lizzie? You said it was all right.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI thought it was. It seemed like that\u2019s what you wanted me to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if it was true,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s all. I just didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you got your period. Didn\u2019t you tell me that?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shrugged again. \u201cI never got \u2019em very much. I only had, like, four last year, all year. You asked me every day, so I said it was okay, so you\u2019d stop asking me. And you broke up with me. Right then. That minute. On the phone. Pretty soon, that was all I thought about...not anything else. Just that you broke it off. That you didn\u2019t want me. Like I did something wrong, something bad. I felt like such a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d he said, ashamed of how he\u2019d made her feel.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it felt,\u201d she said in a whimper.</p><p>It took him less than half a minute to remember those details, and to feel like total crap at the accuracy. Just a couple of days after the little mishap that caused this pregnancy, Liz went home to her mom in Eureka. He called her all the time, kept asking her if she was okay, if she\u2019d gotten her period so they could relax that they hadn\u2019t been caught. Finally she said yes, they were okay. And in that very same conversation he told her they should cool it, not see each other anymore. He told her he cared about her, but holy God\u2014they obviously couldn\u2019t control themselves. And they were both too young to get caught with a baby.</p><p>Except, no, they weren\u2019t.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms. \u201cOh, Liz, baby,\u201d he said. \u201cI broke it off to keep you safe!\u201d To keep me safe! \u201cI didn\u2019t want to lose control again and get you in trouble.\u201d Get me in trouble! \u201cYou\u2019re so young! Too young!\u201d I\u2019m too young! \u201cOh, God, Lizzie. You should have told me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said again, crumbling into sobs against him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, baby, don\u2019t cry. It\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s my fault. Come on, don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>But she was going to cry for a long time, it seemed. First, because she\u2019d been so scared of what he would say, and second, because she was so relieved. He held her for what seemed like forever, but it at least gave him time to think of what he might say next. When finally the tears abated, he said, \u201cCan we go for a ride? Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He wiped the tears from her cheeks with the backs of his fingers. \u201cShould you tell your aunt Connie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cShe knows I came to talk to you. To tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. We\u2019ll go for a ride, settle down a little bit, and then we\u2019ll face the music with Connie. Hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould you ask Jack?\u201d</p><p>He put an arm around her shoulders and led her to his little truck. Jack had seen her belly, had seen Rick take her out of the bar. \u201cJack knows exactly what I\u2019m doing right now.\u201d The only thing I can do, he thought. What I should have done before this happened. Try to act like the grown-up. A little too late...</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out to the river. We\u2019ll sit on a rock and talk about what\u2019s coming. How about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sticking by me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure I am, Liz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love me, Rick?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He looked down at her round belly; he\u2019d put that there. Holy shit, he thought. Love? That was a stretch. He wanted no part of this. So he forced himself to think about Preach and Jack, how they were around women. And he put a soft kiss on her temple. \u201cOf course I do. I want you to stop being afraid now. Everything is going to be okay. Maybe not so easy, but okay.\u201d</p><p>Ordinarily Jack would have left the bar as soon as possible after the dinner hour had passed. Preacher was occupied with little Christopher and Paige, and he had a sense that Rick might come back. Rick would feel that he had to explain things. There wasn\u2019t too much to explain\u2014it had been pretty obvious by Lizzie\u2019s presence. But still, Rick looked to Jack as if he were a father, and Jack had never been unhappy about that. Not even now.</p><p>Jack had talked to Mel briefly, before she went home for the night. \u201cWe have a situation, and I think you know all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk about it, darling,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to help,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know, Jack. I still can\u2019t talk about a patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you give me any advice?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She leaned toward him, kissed him and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need any advice. You\u2019ll know exactly what to do.\u201d She looked down at his swollen hand, up at his black eye. \u201cYou\u2019re a mess. Try not to get into a fight tonight.\u201d She smiled her sweetest smile. \u201cFollow your instincts with Rick. It\u2019s not as though you haven\u2019t been there yourself.\u201d</p><p>There was that, he thought. He was certain their baby had been conceived the first time they\u2019d been together. The only time he\u2019d had unprotected sex in more years than he could remember.</p><p>It was about eight-thirty and he was close to giving up. Preacher had bathed Christopher and put him in the bed beside his mother and was back downstairs, pouring a short whiskey with Jack, when Rick came in. He was tall, already six feet. Hard work around the bar had honed his arms and shoulders, made him strong. He was seventeen now, and this was his last year of high school. With his high cheekbones, square jaw and thick, expressive brows, he was a handsome youth. But as he walked into the bar, head down and hands in his jacket pockets, he seemed to have new lines on his face. He might have aged about ten years in the past few hours.</p><p>The bar was empty but for Jack and Preacher, so Rick jumped up on a bar stool and faced them. He ran a hand through his hair and looked at the two men who, if they hadn\u2019t just about raised him since he was thirteen, sure had mentored him. \u201cSo, by now you\u2019ve figured most of this out. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz seems to be pregnant,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That little slip last spring\u2014it hit solid ground. The baby is due in February, as near as she can figure out. As near as Mel can figure out. She\u2019s very pregnant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cJesus, Rick,\u201d Preacher said, almost weak. \u201cAw, man...\u201d</p><p>Rick shook his head. \u201cWell, it\u2019s mine.

Besides, she didn\u2019t hold me down.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cGuys. I\u2019m sorry. I let you down. I fucked up. Big.\u201d</p><p>Jack felt a proud smile threaten his lips. Any other seventeen-year-old boy would be on his way out of town, but not Rick. He was stepping up the best he could, like a man. Accountable. Facing Jack and Preacher had to be as hard for him as facing this disaster. \u201cYou manage to work anything out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. You can\u2019t really do too much the second you find out. You know? But I told her I\u2019m in this with her. And I want her to not be afraid anymore. Then I told Connie that I\u2019ll pay for everything, no matter what I have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d Connie and Ron hold up?\u201d Preacher asked him.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I think they pretty much want to kill me right now,\u201d Rick said. \u201cI did an awful lot of groveling. Apologizing. Begging. Promising to work till I drop dead seemed to ease the pain a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably won\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe can always help you with extra hours. School\u2019s important, Rick. No matter what else comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. The most important thing right now is that she not be scared. She\u2019s so frickin\u2019 scared, it kills me. I not only knocked her up, I terrified the shit outta her! Holy Jesus! Aw, guys. I know you expected better out of me than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick, you didn\u2019t let anyone down,\u201d Jack said. \u201cShit happens. You handled yourself real well. Better than most guys in your position would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see how scared she was? You know why? She told me everything was okay because I kept asking and asking, like that was all I cared about. And the second she let me off the hook, I dumped her!\u201d He scrubbed a hand along the back of his sweaty neck. \u201cI knew I screwed that up, I just didn\u2019t know how bad. I thought I was keeping us out of trouble\u2014instead I was keeping her from telling me sooner. If I\u2019d known sooner, maybe we could\u2019ve done something about\u2014that baby,\u201d he said softly, almost reverently. \u201cThat baby\u2019s moving inside her. I felt it move. Holy God.\u201d</p><p>Jack felt something in his chest stir. He was over forty and more than ready for a family, true, but he could relate to Rick\u2019s shock and awe just the same.</p> <p>As for Preacher, no one in the world knew how much he\u2019d give for a mess like this one. Not even Jack.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a kid,\u201d Rick said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to make this up to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor starters, you\u2019re in this with her,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cYou treat her good, sweet as you can, with respect. You treat her like the mother of your baby, no matter what\u2019s coming for that baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rick said. \u201cShe asked me if I loved her,\u201d he said uncomfortably.</p><p>Silence hung in the air for a second. Then Jack got down a third glass and tipped the whiskey bottle over it, a short shot. He pushed it toward Rick. He probably needed it right about now.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got my baby in her, Preach. She didn\u2019t ask for it. What the hell was I gonna say, huh? Maybe I should\u2019ve said, I sure thought I did last spring when we were doing it\u2014that\u2019d be a real stand-up guy.\u201d He looked down into that short shot and shook his head. \u201cI said, \u2018Of course I do.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Rick, that was the right thing,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cWhat else could you do?\u201d</p> <p>Jack clinked Rick\u2019s glass; he was damn proud of the boy. No feeling sorry for himself, no whining about how he got screwed. No blaming. It took a lot to straighten your back like that, hold your head up, be the strength and not the victim. Took a lot to do that at any age\u2014and at seventeen, it was admirable. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, buddy,\u201d he said, hoping it was true.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I have to do something, and I have no idea what,\u201d Rick said.</p><p>\u201cRight now, you do nothing,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou take some time to think. Don\u2019t get crazy on me and run off and get married or something. You\u2019re seventeen, she\u2019s fifteen, and the only thing for sure is a baby\u2019s coming. You just hang close to her, treat her right, and we\u2019ll figure it all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, Preach,\u201d he said, his eyes getting a little wet. \u201cGuys, I\u2019m sorry. You tried to warn me about this and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick,\u201d Jack said, stopping him. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first guy to walk down this road, okay? Take it slow.\u201d Jack lifted his glass and had a little sip. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get through this. Might be tough, but thank God\u2014we\u2019re tough.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>All of Judge Forrest\u2019s determination to get Wes Lassiter to trial quickly hit a predictable snag\u2014Forrest was in Mendocino County and Lassiter was arrested in Humboldt County. His case would go before a different judge.</p><p>Lassiter had been found to be in possession of methamphetamine at the time he assaulted his wife, a condition that his lawyer argued contributed to his crazed behavior and lack of judgment. The prison sentence could be impressive, if he was convicted. But his lawyer pleaded for drug treatment and the judge allowed bail on the condition that Lassiter would stand trial for one misdemeanor and two felony counts after drug rehab, and that successful completion of treatment could be held in sentencing consideration. There were other conditions\u2014if he checked himself out of treatment early, his bail would be revoked and he could sit in jail, awaiting trial. And while ordinarily treatment centers operated under a code of strict anonymity, in Lassiter\u2019s case, the prosecutor\u2019s office would be able to check in, make sure he was still under wraps and not a threat to his family.</p><p>Brie called Paige. \u201cDon\u2019t take this decision as bad news,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that sobriety will make a huge difference in his perspective. My recommendation is that you proceed with the dissolution of the marriage and custody arrangements. He can stall you while he\u2019s in treatment\u2014but given the facts of the decision, my bet is that he\u2019ll prove cooperative to keep his sorry ass out of prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will he be in treatment?\u201d Paige asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. A month is a minimum, but meth is a pretty tough drug and I\u2019ve heard of people staying as long as several months. In order for this agreement to work in his best interest, he can\u2019t just quit. He has to be released by a supervisor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea how bad his drug problem is,\u201d Paige said. \u201cI suspected drugs. I found something that looked like drugs once, but I was afraid to ask him about it. If it\u2019s a matter of convincing a supervisor he\u2019s cured\u2014he\u2019s very manipulative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they all are. Believe me, if there\u2019s one place in the world the pros are on to the cons, it\u2019s drug treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be looking over my shoulder for months....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige, with what you\u2019ve been through, as long as he\u2019s alive you\u2019ll be looking over your shoulder. Ask Preacher to teach you how to shoot.\u201d</p><p>It took her a couple of days of thought before she broached the idea to John.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s worth thinking about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could do that. In the meantime, I called my buddy Mike to be sure scum-bucket was where he belonged in L.A., but now that he\u2019s gone to that treatment center in Minnesota, you should call the prosecutor\u2019s office and check on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, kind of squeamish. \u201cMaybe I could have my lawyer do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Paige,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cTake control. You know I\u2019m glad to look out for you, but it\u2019s important you get your confidence back. That confidence I know you had before...all this.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she thought. I did have confidence once. Not as much as some young women, maybe\u2014but enough to carve a little space out of the world for herself. And although it seemed barely noticeable to her, it was coming back, piece by tiny piece. She was going to have to reclaim her former self-assurance, self-trust\u2014she was going to be a single parent to Christopher.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought she could ask for that restraining order or custody; fear had had her in its grip. But with John at her side, encouraging her, she had. It was ugly and terrifying, but she\u2019d gotten through it and Wes had been taken away in handcuffs. He might be in a cushy treatment program right now, but it wasn\u2019t over. He had a lot to atone for, and his atonement might come behind bars, freeing her and her son for years. Now that she was on this track\u2014getting free, getting her life back\u2014she was determined to stare it in the face. No matter how scared she was.</p><p>She paced back and forth in front of the kitchen phone, then picked it up and called. The next day she paced less, and when she got the A.D.A.\u2019s secretary on the phone, she was told they hadn\u2019t checked that day and might not have time\u2014perhaps she could call back the next day. Suddenly, she was furious. \u201cNo!\u201d she said. \u201cDo you understand my life and my child\u2019s life are in constant danger from this man? That he\u2019s threatened to kill me, and if you take a look at my medical records, it\u2019s obvious he tried? No. I\u2019m not waiting until tomorrow. I\u2019ll call back in an hour!\u201d She hung up the phone, heart hammering, and stole a look at Preacher. She could feel the heat on her cheeks.</p><p>He lifted one eyebrow and smiled slightly. \u201cThere you go,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her call was returned twenty minutes later by the assistant district attorney himself. He reassured her, then gave her the number of the treatment center and the name of a counselor with whom he\u2019d been in contact, inviting her to call directly, as many times a day as it took.</p><p>Again she paced in front of the phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Preacher asked her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll answer or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if he did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d die!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cYou\u2019d hang up, because you don\u2019t have to talk to him ever again. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said, a little bit surprised by that reality. Her mind started spinning\u2014what if he denied ever having touched her? What if he convinced them he was sorry? She picked up the phone immediately, punching in the numbers, though her brain twisted with possibilities. What if he wanted a message delivered to her? What if he asked to call her, to talk to Christopher? He never talked to Christopher, but she wouldn\u2019t put it past him to act as though he cared about his son.</p><p>The phone was answered, the counselor she asked for was put on and she said, \u201cThis is Paige Lassiter. I\u2019m just calling to be sure Wes Lassiter is still there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll tucked in, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, his voice calm and friendly. \u201cRest easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cYou try to have a nice day.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone, trembling for a moment. Then she looked at John and found him smiling. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard,\u201d he said, his voice soft. \u201cBut every day you take your life back a little more. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done, Paige.\u201d</p><p>There was a road into Fallujah, Iraq, that held a strong reputation for mortal danger. American troops had fallen there before. When Sergeant Major Jack Sheridan led his platoon in, one of his squads, led by Gunnery Sergeant Miguel\u2014Mike to his friends\u2014Valenzuela, was separated from the platoon by a suicide truck bomb. They were holed up in an abandoned building with injuries, pinned down by sniper fire. Joe Benson and Paul Haggerty were bleeding dangerously, along with others wounded by sniper fire. Gunny held off snipers with an M16 he fired repeatedly for hours until the rest of the platoon\u2014Preacher among them\u2014could subdue the insurgents and effect a rescue. When it was over, Mike could barely move his arm and his shoulder was frozen. He was decorated for his heroic performance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Mike, an L.A. police sergeant, had been activated for an eighteen-month tour in Iraq. He was never injured. He had saved lives.</p><p>And now he lay in an L.A. hospital bed, comatose, with three bullet holes in him. The shots were fired by a fourteen-year-old gangbanger. The one place the kid hadn\u2019t hit was square in Mike\u2019s bulletproof vest. Another officer got off a fatal shot to the kid. Investigation suggested it might have been an initiation right of passage to get jumped into the gang\u2014and bringing down the sergeant under which the gang unit served was a major feat.</p> <p>Preacher had called on Mike about Paige, and Mike had done everything he could to help. Now Preacher had received the call.</p><p>It was early\u2014the coffee barely brewed, Chris not yet racing downstairs in his pajamas, the loud crack of the ax in the backyard just begun. The shooting had occurred the night before and it took Ramon Valenzuela, Mike\u2019s oldest brother, a few hours to get to someone in the old Marine squad. In the meantime, Mike had undergone emergency surgery and lay comatose in an intensive care unit.</p><p>Preacher went to the back door of the bar. \u201cJack!\u201d he called. \u201cCome in!\u201d</p><p>Jack had an anxious look on his face when he came through the back kitchen door.</p><p>\u201cValenzuela was shot on the job,\u201d Preacher said without preamble. \u201cHe\u2019s critical. L.A. trauma center. I\u2019ll call Zeke, have him pass the word, and close up the bar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Jack said, rubbing his chin. \u201cWhat chance they give him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis brother Ramon said he thinks he\u2019ll make it\u2014but he\u2019s in a coma. He said something about him never being the same.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSee if you can catch a flight. I\u2019ll make the drive.\u201d</p><p>Paige appeared at the bottom of the stairs and knew something serious was happening. She stood, waiting.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Paige? Christopher?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Preacher shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll have to take them. I\u2019m sure as hell not leaving them here without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me where?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>Both men turned to look at her. \u201cL.A.,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cOne of our boys was shot in the line of duty. He\u2019s in intensive care and I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cL.A.? John, I can\u2019t go to L.A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you can. You have to. My friend Mike, the one who helped you so much, he\u2019s in the hospital. Jack?\u201d he said, looking at his best friend. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019ll call Rick\u2019s grandma and have her tell him to check on the bar every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jack said, taking off at once.</p><p>Preacher turned back to Paige. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right. You\u2019ll be safe. You can call that treatment center every day. If you want to, you can go get a few of your things while he\u2019s in there. Maybe there\u2019s someone you want to visit\u2014you could do that safely. But I have to go.\u201d She stared at him, unmoving. \u201cI have to go right away, Paige. I need you to do this with me, so I can go to my friend and be sure you and Chris are safe. Please.\u201d</p><p>She shook herself. \u201cI\u2019ll get us ready,\u201d she said, running back up the stairs.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear Preacher let out his breath in a long, relieved sigh.</p><p>Jack stood on Doc\u2019s front porch with Mel, his packed duffel on the bed of his truck. \u201cReconsider,\u201d Jack said. \u201cCome with me. I don\u2019t want to leave you here alone.\u201d</p> <p>She put a hand on his chest, looked up at him and said, \u201cI won\u2019t be alone. I have a whole town. Nothing is going to happen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Preacher won\u2019t be here. He\u2019s taking Paige and Christopher because he can\u2019t leave them. I think he\u2019s scared to death to leave them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Jack, Doc needs me. I have things I have to do. And I\u2019ll be fine. No one\u2019s going to bother me. Here\u2019s the name of a doctor to speak to,\u201d she told him, tucking a piece of paper into his shirt pocket. \u201cJust tell him you married his old nurse. He\u2019ll give you any information he can about Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worked with him? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, but he won\u2019t have forgotten me. He\u2019s a trauma surgeon\u2014he may have operated on Mike. Be sure to tell him the news\u2014that we\u2019re having a baby. That\u2019ll make him so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find him.\u201d He lowered his lips to hers and kissed her deeply, one hand at the small of her back while the other ran over her expanding middle. \u201cLeaving you is the hardest thing I\u2019ve done in some time,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better go. You want to get there as quickly as you can.\u201d</p><p>Jack drove like mad to Eureka, charging Mel\u2019s old cell phone in the truck so that he could use it to call her from the L.A. hospital. He picked up a flight that made only one stop in Redding, getting him to L.A. in less than three hours. Preacher, however, was making the whole drive, which would take eight, maybe closer to ten, hours.</p><p>When Jack got to L.A., he didn\u2019t even stop at a hotel. Mike was still on the respirator with visitors limited to immediate family for just a few minutes every hour, but the crowd at the hospital was very much what Jack expected\u2014impressive in numbers. Cops were known to gather for one of their fallen and there were dozens, in and around the hospital. They had parked an RV in the parking lot where Mike\u2019s family could take occasional breaks from the stress of the hospital and they stood virtual guard around it. Mike had been married twice, but was at present single. There was no shortage of family\u2014a big family of parents, brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews. There was probably an ex-wife around somewhere, and an inevitable girlfriend or two. A couple of their boys from the squad were there, the ones who could get away on short notice\u2014Zeke, a firefighter from Fresno, and Paul Haggerty, a builder from Grants Pass. Others might make an appearance if they could. \u201cWhere\u2019s Preacher?\u201d they asked.</p><p>\u201cHe should be here soon. He made the drive. How\u2019s Mike doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know too much. Three hits\u2014one each in the head, shoulder and groin. He lost a lot of blood and hasn\u2019t regained consciousness. There was a long surgery.\u201d</p><p>Jack pulled the piece of paper out of his pocket. \u201cAnyone know the surgeon\u2019s name?\u201d he asked.</p><p>They looked at one another, shaking their heads.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me look for this guy,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAn old friend of Mel\u2019s. He\u2019s a doctor here\u2014might be able to tell us something. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Jack spent the better part of an hour going from nurses\u2019 station to nurses\u2019 station, looking for Dr. Sean Wilke, leaving messages for him to no avail. It wasn\u2019t until two hours later that a man about forty years old wearing a white coat over scrubs was heading for the ICU and the name embroidered on his coat in blue thread read \u201cWilke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Wilke,\u201d Jack said, stepping forward and stopping him. Jack put out a hand. \u201cJack Sheridan, Doctor. I\u2019m here for Mike Valenzuela.\u201d The doctor seemed cool and distracted, accepting the handshake absently. After all, there were a ton of people here for Mike\u2014the doctor couldn\u2019t speak to all of them. \u201cI\u2019m married to Mel Monroe,\u201d he blurted.</p><p>The man\u2019s expression changed instantly and dramatically. \u201cMy God,\u201d he said, grasping Jack\u2019s hand enthusiastically in both of his. \u201cMel? How is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. She gave me your name. Said you might be able to get me some information about my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see my patient, then I\u2019ll tell you whatever I can. That work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>About fifteen minutes later Jack realized he had hit the jackpot when he saw Wilke pausing outside the ICU to have a brief conversation with Mike\u2019s mother, father and brother. So\u2014he was the surgeon. After leaving the family so they could go back into ICU, Wilke walked toward Jack. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Jack. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna make it, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give him a ninety-eight percent chance of making it\u2014but we don\u2019t know the extent of his potential disabilities.\u201d Dr. Wilke took Jack to the employee lounge in the back of a busy emergency room. Wilke poured himself and Jack coffee. Jack took a sip and almost gagged. It was horrible. He wondered if it was possible they got the tap water mixed up with the mop-pail water. \u201cYeah,\u201d Wilke said. \u201cI know. Pretty bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI own a bar and restaurant up north. Our coffee is fantastic, better than Starbucks. I think I hooked Mel with the coffee first\u2014she\u2019s a caffeine junky. Tell me about Mike, Dr. Wilke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Sean. Here\u2019s the situation so far. He remains unconscious because of the head wound, although it was really the least traumatic. The bullet, miraculously, doesn\u2019t seem to have damaged the brain, but we had to do a craniotomy to remove it, and that has caused swelling, for which a shunt and drain has had to be inserted, and I believe that explains his coma. The bullet to the groin was his worst injury\u2014the most complicated repair. We repaired bowel and bladder and he lost a lot of blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. He made it through eighteen months in Iraq without a scratch....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shoulder is bad. We\u2019re looking at a permanent disability there, I\u2019m almost certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Jack said, shaking his head. \u201cWhat about his job?\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t see it. His injuries are critical. We\u2019re looking at long-term rehab. The shoulder\u2019s stitched up real nice, but it\u2019s going to be weak. He\u2019d be compromised in defensive tactics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s tough,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s keeping him alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jack said. \u201cFor everything you\u2019ve done. For taking the time to tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cI know he\u2019s your first concern right now, but I\u2019d love to know how Mel\u2019s doing. I haven\u2019t heard from her in a long time.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled, happy to catch him up on Mel\u2019s trek to the mountains, her first inclination to bolt, get the hell out of there. And how all that turned into not only her decision to stay, but remarriage and a baby on the way.</p><p>The shock on Wilke\u2019s face was evident.</p><p>\u201cYeah, plenty of surprise to go around there. I know she didn\u2019t think that was possible. Here she was, a woman who didn\u2019t think she could ever be happy again, a midwife who would never have a baby. And I\u2019m almost forty-one, a retired marine who never married. Hell, I was never attached, never intended to be. The day I met her was the best day of my life. A new life for both of us, I guess. She\u2019s everything to me.\u201d</p><p>There was a tablet on the table and Jack pulled it toward him. He reached toward Sean, holding out a hand for his pen, which the doctor took out of his coat pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou should call her. Don\u2019t take my word for it\u2014ask her how she\u2019s doing. She\u2019d love to hear from you. She gave me your name\u2014told me to look you up.\u201d He scribbled the number on the yellow pad and turned it toward Sean.</p><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Sean tore the page off, folded it and put it in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cReally, give her a call. She\u2019d like that. And one more thing. Any chance you can sneak me into ICU? Mike\u2014he was one of my best guys. He was a fine marine. He saved lives. He was a hero. I love the guy. I do. Lotta people do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Jack sat at Mike\u2019s side through the night so that the family could sleep. Mike\u2019s head was shaved on one side, tubes and drains everywhere, but probably the hardest thing to see was the respirator breathing for him. Nurses and therapists moved his extremities, but Mike didn\u2019t move them himself.</p><p>After briefly talking with Mike\u2019s family, Preacher took Paige and Jack\u2019s duffel and secured a couple of hotel rooms nearby and came back in the morning to give Jack a key. Jack went there to take a nap, but was back by afternoon, and again, spent the whole night at Mike\u2019s bedside. Every hour at least he would stand up, lean over the bed and talk to him. \u201cEveryone is here, buddy. Your family, your cops, some of your squad. Everyone\u2019s waiting for you to get up. Wake up, buddy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>On the third day, the respirator was removed and Mike opened his eyes, but looked at Jack and his parents blankly. The nurses tried to stimulate him, but he was groggy and listless.</p><p>While Jack took his place at his friend\u2019s bedside to wait out another long night, Mike\u2019s mother put a hand on his shoulder. It was the middle of the night when he turned to look up into her dark eyes. Mrs. Valenzuela was a handsome and strong woman in her sixties; she had raised eight kids and had a passel of grandchildren. When she wasn\u2019t in the ICU she was in the chapel worrying the beads; by now the rosary that dangled from her hands should have caused blisters. She hardly slept. \u201cYou\u2019re a very patient man, aren\u2019t you, Jack?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot in this, I\u2019m not,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI know about you. Miguel is not the first young man you\u2019ve kept vigil for. He said you\u2019d never leave your man\u2014no matter how dangerous staying with him could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe exaggerates,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m going to get some rest so I can be alert in the early morning. Thank you for doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave this one, Mrs. Valenzuela. He\u2019s a good troop.\u201d</p> <p>In the middle of the sixth night, Mike opened his eyes, turned his head and said, \u201cSarge?\u201d</p><p>Jack was on his feet instantly, leaning over the bed. He saw clarity in Mike\u2019s eyes. \u201cYeah, Gunny. Right here. Lotta people here for you, buddy. You have to stay with us now\u2014the hospital staff is ready to throw us all out.\u201d</p><p>A nurse was instantly at the bedside. \u201cMike?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou know where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope I\u2019m not in Iraq,\u201d he said weakly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the hospital. In intensive care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. No snipers here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMike, I\u2019m going to call your mother,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019ll be nearby.\u201d</p><p>Jack walked out of the ICU and down to the lounge where family and friends could wait, make phone calls, rest. The Valenzuelas were in the trailer provided by the police department, but there were easily a dozen men passing the night in the lounge, just to be close by. \u201cHe\u2019s awake. He\u2019s recognizing people.\u201d</p><p>A collective sigh of relief came out of the room. Jack called the trailer to bring Mrs. Valenzuela to her son\u2019s bedside, then went back to ICU. By the time he got there, two doctors were examining his friend. One of them was Sean, the other a neurologist.</p><p>Sean came around the bed and, his hand on Jack\u2019s arm, led him away from Mike. \u201cI haven\u2019t called Mel yet, but I\u2019m going to. I just wanted to say something\u2014you\u2019ve been here every night, through the night, for almost a week. I\u2019m damn glad you decided not to let her be lonely. You\u2019re a good man, Jack. A good friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014he\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019d do the same for me.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAs for Mel, when she took me on, she made my life.\u201d</p><p>While Jack was away Mel had one important errand to occupy her. She picked up Liz at the corner store to make the trip to Grace Valley to see Dr. Stone, the OB. Liz was waiting outside for her. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to invite your aunt Connie along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to go with just you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. You look very pretty today,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Liz smiled. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>It pleased Mel that Liz had gone to some trouble to look nice today, since she\u2019d be meeting Dr. Stone for the first time. Her hair was shiny clean and curled, her makeup tasteful. She had on those tight jeans with a long sweater pulled down over the belly that wouldn\u2019t allow them to close anymore.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking forward to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to worry about\u2014it\u2019s completely painless.\u201d</p><p>When they got to the Grace Valley clinic, Mel realized that the appointment was probably not the only reason behind Liz\u2019s primping, and there was definitely another reason Liz didn\u2019t invite Aunt Connie. As they pulled up to park, a very familiar little white pickup was waiting across the street. Rick got out of the truck and began to walk toward them. When Liz saw him, she beamed with happiness and ran to him, meeting him halfway. Now, Mel had seen them together since Liz returned to Virgin River\u2014at the bar and around town. They were pretty cautious, especially around Connie and Ron, and Connie and Ron seemed to always be around. Rick would hold her hand, drop an arm over her shoulders, maybe put a mature little kiss on her temple.</p><p>But this was different. She ran into his arms. He held her closely, lovingly. She saw Rick in a different light, his arms full of a pregnant girl. Tall, broad, strong, handsome, yet a boy\u2014full of all that seventeen-year-old testosterone.</p><p>They embraced and kissed in the middle of the street, kissed like grown-ups. Liz\u2019s hands were on his cheeks, pulling him hard against her mouth. Hungry, eating each other\u2019s mouths\u2014there was enough passion in their kiss that steam was rising. He held her tight against him, his hands running up and down her back. He slid a hand over her tummy while he talked and smiled against her parted lips. This was no boy, but a man. Man and woman, yet children.</p><p>Mel cleared her throat.</p><p>They reluctantly parted and walked toward Mel. \u201cHey, Rick. I didn\u2019t know you were coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to cut school. I don\u2019t think an ultrasound appointment for the father is the usual excused absence. But Liz wanted me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that.\u201d So old. So young. They were kids; it was disconcerting. In fact, their apparent love for each other was somehow more unsettling than getting a poor young girl through something like this alone. These two seemed to want to have this baby together, and what could be more impossible for kids so young?</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s go in and meet the doctor.\u201d</p><p>Mel had talked to John Stone, told him about her patient. The exam got under way. Rick took his place beside Liz, holding her hand, like any young husband might. She looked up at him adoringly while his eyes were more fixed on the monitor. John moved the wand over her belly, and on the screen the baby fluttered and kicked. \u201cOh, man,\u201d Rick said. \u201cMan, look at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make it out? Arms here, legs, head, butt. Penis,\u201d John said.</p><p>Mel hadn\u2019t been prepared for this\u2014she watched a slow transformation come over Rick. His eyes grew wide; they began to mist. He gripped Liz\u2019s hands tighter and his mouth fixed in a firm line as he struggled for control. It\u2019s one thing to see a round tummy and know it\u2019s yours, to feel movement there and understand it had life. But it was a whole lot more to see that baby, and know it\u2019s your son.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Rick said. Then he lowered his head and his lips touched Liz\u2019s brow while she held on to his hands. Then she started to cry and Rick began to whisper to her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Liz. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d He kissed her tears away and Mel thought she might cry with them.</p><p>Mel had known this boy for quite a while, since her first night in Virgin River. She was at once amazed by him and felt that she didn\u2019t know him at all. When had he crossed over into this other life? What was he doing here, looking at his son on a monitor when he should be in his calculus class?</p><p>John finished with the ultrasound, printed them a picture to take with them, then, pulling Mel\u2019s hand, led her out of the room, leaving the kids alone for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was going to be here. I know that boy pretty well, but I never knew him like that. A father. Growing up way too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung and dumb, and so in love they make me ache. You think it\u2019s too soon for me to get Sydney into the convent?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cAt eight? Maybe just slightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s almost six months along. Fifteen years old. Holy shit, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, don\u2019t let them hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel, they\u2019re not going to hear me. In fact, we\u2019d better knock on the door or they\u2019ll be doing it again. Right in the exam room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not doing it, John. Their hearts are breaking. How can there possibly be a happy ending here?\u201d</p><p>On the drive home, Mel asked Liz, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me Rick was going to meet us there?\u201d</p><p>Liz shrugged. \u201cConnie wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He\u2019s the father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Connie\u2019s pretty mad about this. Mad at me and Rick. And my mom\u2014jeez. She\u2019s on the moon, she\u2019s so pissed. She doesn\u2019t want me to see Rick at all....\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sent you back to Virgin River, but doesn\u2019t want you to see Rick?\u201d Mel asked, wondering, How does this make any sense?</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Liz said. \u201cStupid, huh?\u201d She rubbed her hands over her belly. \u201cA boy,\u201d she said quietly. Sadly.</p><p>Mel stole a glance and saw a tear running down the girl\u2019s cheek.</p><p>If a woman is old enough to have a baby, Mel found herself thinking, then she\u2019s old enough to love what\u2019s inside her. Old enough to love the man who put it there.</p><p>Nine</p><p>While in Los Angeles, Preacher was able to leave Paige and Chris at the hotel for short periods of time while he went to the hospital. He was confident there was no danger to her. Although she still made phone calls to that treatment center regularly, even if Wes somehow slipped away, he had no way of knowing where they were. But whenever he returned, she would sigh audibly, her relief obvious, when he was back, shoring her up. He wasn\u2019t quite sure if it was that terror from her marriage or something deeper. There were still some very large holes in his understanding of her. The largest of which was her family.</p><p>On the long drive to the city from Virgin River, hours and hours in the truck together while Chris slept on and off in the backseat, there had been lots of time to talk. Paige shared happy and animated stories about the soap-operaish beauty shop in which she had worked, good times in the old half a house she\u2019d shared with her best friends, and she even talked about old boyfriends. She had opened up more about life with Wes, in hushed, careful tones so that Chris wouldn\u2019t hear and possibly become upset. But when it came to her widowed mother and older, married brother, she seemed to clam up, grow tense and gloomy. There was deep ambivalence, but she didn\u2019t explain. \u201cI haven\u2019t had much of a relationship with my family since I married,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Bud and I were never close, not even as kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that will change now,\u201d he replied. \u201cListen, you don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity. I\u2019d give anything for an hour with my mother. I joined the Marines to get brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t let me talk you into anything. But if you\u2019re right here...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not like my family, John,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Paige, I don\u2019t have to like \u2019em. They don\u2019t have to like me. I\u2019m just saying, you have a chance to visit now, if you want to.\u201d</p><p>It was four days before she called her mother, another two before a meeting was arranged. She invited John to take her to her brother\u2019s house for dinner with the family; her mother would be there.</p><p>Preacher suspected within three minutes what the problem was, but it took him about an hour to put it all together. Fifty-eight minutes too long. He wasn\u2019t slow; he hadn\u2019t been around too many people like this. A big, silent, loner type of guy like Preacher, when he got a whiff of something off, he gave it a wide berth.</p><p>Bud, Paige\u2019s older brother, met them at the door of a small tract home in a dusty little suburb where there were only about four different styles of homes, very few trees, and where people worked on their cars in driveways. Bud\u2019s house had an above-average front lawn, trim and green, right next door to a house with a cyclone fence around a grassless yard. Bud was wearing a T-shirt with his khaki pants, holding a beer. \u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d he said, coming out onto the stoop and down the sidewalk toward them. \u201cThere\u2019s my girl. How you been, baby?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cAll right, Bud,\u201d she answered, letting him embrace her. Her arms, Preacher noticed, didn\u2019t quite get into the game. Preacher hung back, holding Christopher\u2019s hand, watching.</p><p>Bud released her and approached Preacher big grin, hand extended. \u201cThis the new boyfriend? How you doin\u2019? How about a beer? You look like a beer man to me.\u201d</p> <p>Preacher took the hand; he concentrated on not squeezing too hard. In fact, he wasn\u2019t much of a beer man. Nor was he much of a boyfriend. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the new\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in. Welcome to the humble home.\u201d</p><p>Preacher caught the inflection. \u201cNice place,\u201d he said, stepping into the living room. He didn\u2019t know anything about decor, but it looked comfortable. Spotlessly clean, with a couch and La-Z-Boy recliner and a real big TV. \u201cNice yard. Bet you work hard on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cGin does most of that. She says she likes it, but I think she\u2019s competing for first prize in the neighborhood.\u201d He didn\u2019t greet Christopher. Bud put a hand at the back of Christopher\u2019s head and seemed to try to physically direct him through the living room and away. \u201cKids are in the playroom, Chris. Go play with the kids.\u201d</p><p>Chris pulled back, clinging to Preacher\u2019s leg.</p> <p>Leaning down, Preacher said, \u201cYou can stay here if you want.\u201d</p><p>Chris said nothing but clung harder.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Bud said. \u201cCome on back. We got snacks, we got steaks. This is nice, sis. Glad you could stop by. Now, what did you say brought you out of hiding?\u201d</p><p>Preacher saw her flinch slightly. \u201cJohn\u2019s friend...He\u2019s in the hospital. He\u2019s a police officer....\u201d</p><p>As they moved into the kitchen, an older woman separated herself from the salad she was making and came around the counter. \u201cPaige,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cOh, Paige...\u201d She was smaller than Paige and very thin. She wore slacks and a blouse, long-sleeved and buttoned high, so conservative that for a split second Preacher was reminded of his own mother.</p><p>They embraced, both of them seeming to get a little misty. And Paige responded, \u201cMom. Mom.\u201d This time her arms cooperated in the embrace. The younger woman followed, having waited for her turn. Again, the embraces were mutual. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cDolores, Gin, meet John, the new boyfriend,\u201d Bud said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the new\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBud Lite okay by you, pal? I figure a guy named Bud drinks Bud Lite. So what about this friend of yours? In the hospital?\u201d</p><p>Preacher accepted the beer and said, \u201cHe\u2019s a cop around here. He was shot in the line of duty. He was hurt pretty bad\u2014so I came down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, did I hear about that on the news, maybe?\u201d Bud asked, giving the neck of Preacher\u2019s bottle a tap with his own. An odd time for a toast, Preacher thought.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard about that, I think. You have a lot of cop friends?\u201d Bud asked, moving to the table. \u201cChris, go play with the kids. They\u2019re in the playroom. So, you have a lot of cop friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the one,\u201d Preacher said, a steady hand on Chris\u2019s shoulder. It was already beginning to reach him\u2014Paige\u2019s brother was a bully. A bossy, immature, irreverent bully. He watched Bud go to the kitchen table, take his seat at the head. In the middle was a bowl of chips and one of salsa. Out the back patio doors he could see a manicured backyard surrounded by a high wall. There was an aboveground hot tub covered with a green leather tarp. A grill, a birdbath, some patio furniture, but no toys. Hadn\u2019t Paige said three kids?</p> <p>Bud indicated a chair with his hand and Preacher took the seat next to him. Bud wasn\u2019t a small guy\u2014probably six feet with some good arms on him. His hair was cut really short, the sleeves of his T-shirt rolled up a couple of notches to bring his biceps into focus. His smile was constant, which was a signal\u2014you only smile when something makes you smile. If you smile all the time, you\u2019re hiding something. He told Chris once more to go play. Preacher pulled Chris onto his lap.</p><p>The women followed like lemmings, sitting at the table with the men. Bud started on the chips and salsa with his beer and said to Paige, \u201cTell me about this place you\u2019re staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirgin River,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s in the mountains, way north. It\u2019s very pretty\u2014lots of big trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019d you end up there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe were on our way to visit a friend and got lost,\u201d she said, her voice just a little quieter than Preacher had grown used to. \u201cChris had a fever, there was a doctor there, and we stayed over.\u201d</p><p>Preacher tried not to frown as he listened to Paige give an almost fictional account of what had happened. This story was accurate enough for her new friends in Virgin River, but there was something so wrong about telling it this way to her family, people who knew her intimately. She had to stay a while because of Chris, she said. She fell in love with the place, the people were so nice, they needed some help in the bar and grill, and she thought maybe it was just the change she needed. She decided to see if it worked for her. Bud asked what Wes thought about that and Paige said, \u201cWell, Bud, he wasn\u2019t real happy about it\u2014but I had made up my mind.\u201d Not real happy? Preacher thought. She and her brother were nibbling around the edges of the real drama. Preacher found himself wondering, Don\u2019t they know anything about her life? About the sad and dangerous state of her marriage? About her flight to save her life? To save her children?</p><p>One of the kids ran through\u2014a little girl about seven or eight. She had a wild look in her eyes. She grabbed a fistful of chips, her father barked at her to go play and she was gone.</p><p>Paige talked a little more about the area, about the redwoods, the people, the simple lifestyle. Bud got up and got two more beers, and when he put one in front of Preacher, Preacher said, \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d But Bud left the beer in front of him.</p><p>Chris reached for a chip, tentatively, and Bud said, \u201cThose are for the grown-ups, son.\u201d And Chris yanked his hand back as though he\u2019d touched fire. Preacher tried not to glare at Bud, but pulled the bowl closer to himself and Chris and said, \u201cHe might be hungry.\u201d He took a chip out of the bowl and handed it to Chris and noticed out of the corner of his eye that Paige watched this action with the slightest smile on her face. He also noticed that Dolores and Gin weren\u2019t talking much and partaking of the hors d\u2019oeuvres, such as they were, sparingly. Cautiously.</p><p>Another kid ran through\u2014another girl\u2014scruffy, her hair wild, her shoes untied. Whatever was going on in the playroom got the kids as gamey as an afternoon outdoors on the playground. She grabbed at the chips, got yelled at to go play and disappeared. Now Preacher might manage a bar and hang out with men primarily, but he was unaccustomed to fathers who pushed their children out of sight. Rudely, at that. In his crowd, families were appreciated. Most of his friends were married with children, and the children were a part of everything. The women were nearly worshiped.</p><p>He was starting to know things were not kind and respectful here. He was already unhappy with the way Bud regarded Paige. Preacher was real close to saying, \u201cThis meeting is over.\u201d Then a child started to cry, from the playroom, presumably, and Bud\u2019s wife, Gin, jumped up and ran. A few minutes later she carried a child of about two into the kitchen. This beautiful child had short blond curls and streaks of tears on her chafed cheeks.</p><p>Bud turned to Preacher and asked him what he did.</p><p>\u201cMe? I\u2019m a cook. My buddy bought a bar. I went up there for some fishing, and stayed.\u201d</p><p>They talked a little about the bar and Preacher was trying. This guy wasn\u2019t his cup of tea, but he didn\u2019t have to love everyone. He thought it was a good idea to get along if he could, for Paige\u2019s sake. This was family; sometimes you\u2019re stuck with family. He was sure good old Bud had his fine points. He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d come in touch with them tonight, however. But they landed on a conversation about how much fishing and hunting there was to do up there, and Bud loved that. He might just come up, check it out. Bud would do a lot more of that, if he didn\u2019t have to work so goddamn hard all the time, but with three kids...Three kids almost never seen, Preacher thought. But, Preacher talked more than he usually did, because he wanted Paige to know he was giving it his best shot. He could be cordial. Friendly.</p><p>During this time, Gin, holding her youngest daughter on her lap, cajoled Chris over to her and acquainted them. Chris was not intimidated by a child younger than he and they began to get friendly. The child came off Gin\u2019s lap and with a little push of her hands, she sent both children off to the playroom.</p><p>\u201cSo, what did you do before being a cook?\u201d Bud asked.</p><p>\u201cI was in the Marines about twelve years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarines!\u201d Bud said. \u201cShould\u2019ve known. Ever been to war?\u201d</p><p>Preacher gave a solemn nod. \u201cCouple of times,\u201d he said. \u201cNo fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the cook,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cLooks more like you should be a bouncer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t usually need a bouncer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of cooking, how\u2019s that salad coming?\u201d</p><p>Paige\u2019s mother and sister-in-law got up from the table and instantly went to the kitchen. Paige rose, too, asking if she could help, but Bud directed her back to her chair, saying, \u201cThey\u2019ll do it.\u201d And she sat.</p><p>Plates were brought out\u2014five of them. Preacher counted twice. \u201cWhat about the kids?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGin\u2019ll give \u2019em something in the playroom. She\u2019s got some dogs, some beans. They love it. Kids. I like to have some grown-up time, sometimes.\u201d</p><p>The salads appeared, as well as another beer each. \u201cYou\u2019re slowing down there, my friend,\u201d Bud said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to catch up!\u201d</p><p>Preacher had his ear tuned in to the \u201cplayroom.\u201d Just as he was sharpening his listening and they were starting on their salads, Bud looked at Paige and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to Wes?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her eyes steadily to her brother\u2019s, but she didn\u2019t answer at once. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s admitted himself into a drug treatment program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Bud asked.</p><p>Again she paused. \u201cFor drug treatment. It\u2019s not unusual for some of those traders to get hooked on...You know...Uppers?\u201d It was stated as a question. And Preacher thought, it was meth. It wasn\u2019t a little bitty innocent drug.</p><p>\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t do anything about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what, Bud?\u201d she returned.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Like help him with that. I mean, what did you have to do?\u201d</p><p>Paige put down her fork and glared into her brother\u2019s eyes. \u201cNo, Bud. I couldn\u2019t help with that. It was completely beyond my control.\u201d</p><p>Bud tilted his eyes toward his lettuce, stabbed a piece with his fork and muttered, \u201cMaybe you could\u2019ve kept your stupid mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Preacher\u2019s fork went down sharply. And Preacher, who rarely used profanity and only in the most heated moments, said, \u201cYou\u2019re fucking kidding me, right?\u201d</p><p>Bud\u2019s eyes snapped up to Preacher\u2019s face. His jaw ground and he scowled. \u201cShe tell you she had six thousand square feet and a pool?\u201d</p><p>Preacher glanced at Paige, Paige glanced at Preacher and then swiveled her eyes slowly to Bud. She spoke to Preacher while she looked at Bud and said, \u201cMy brother doesn\u2019t understand. The size of the house you live in has nothing to do with anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell,\u201d Bud said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, there are times to keep your mouth shut, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. You had it fucking made.\u201d</p><p>It took every red blood cell in Preacher\u2019s body to stay in his chair. He wanted to shout, He beat her up in the street in front of me! He killed their baby with his foot! He was squeezing and releasing his fork with such tension, he was unaware he was bending it. It wasn\u2019t his right to speak out; he was a guest. He didn\u2019t see himself as Bud\u2019s guest, he was Paige\u2019s guest. He got a sick feeling in his stomach at the thought he could\u2019ve dropped her here for a visit, alone. He felt his blood pressure going up; his temples were pulsing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cBud, he was abusive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, you had a few problems. The guy was loaded, for Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d</p> <p>Preacher thought he might explode, his heated blood was expanding so fast. He could hear his own heartbeat. And he felt a small, light hand on top of his coiled fist. He raised his eyes and met the dull, nervous stare of Paige\u2019s mother, pleadingly looking at him from across the table.</p><p>\u201cBud doesn\u2019t mean exactly that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we\u2019ve never had a divorce in the family. I raised the kids to understand, you have to try to get beyond the problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has problems,\u201d Gin said, nodding. Those same eyes. Begging.</p><p>Preacher didn\u2019t think he could do it. Sit through it. He was pretty sure he\u2019d never get to the steak without shoving Bud up against the wall and challenging him to keep his mouth shut through something like his fists. The struggle was, that was like Wes. Get mad, take it to the mat. Beat the living shit out of someone. Someone you could beat into submission real easy.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t problems,\u201d Paige said insistently. \u201cHe was violent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, Jesus Christ,\u201d Bud said, lifting his beer.</p><p>A piercing cry came from the playroom. Preacher was on his feet at the same moment Chris came flying into the kitchen, holding his forearm with his other hand. He ran to his mother, with a look of pain and fear, his mouth open in a wail, tears on his face. Paige instantly drew him in, asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Preacher leaned over, pulled Chris\u2019s hand away, saw the perfect outline of a juvenile mouth, and with an expression of sheer horror and disbelief, leveled his gaze at Bud. \u201cSomeone bit him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, kids. They\u2019ll work it out,\u201d Bud said, waving his hand, as though leaving them completely unsupervised had nothing to do with him.</p><p>Gin said, \u201cI\u2019ll get something for that,\u201d and jumped up.</p><p>Dolores left the table saying, \u201cIce. I\u2019ll get ice.\u201d</p> <p>Preacher gently drew Chris away from Paige and lifted him up against his broad chest. Chris put his head on Preacher\u2019s shoulder and cried. He met Paige\u2019s eyes and he was sure that despite his greatest effort to remain calm, his were ablaze.</p><p>Paige stood, regally, Preacher thought with a touch of pride, and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be going now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Bud said sharply, and Preacher was as close as he\u2019d ever been to coming completely unhinged.</p><p>He passed Chris back to his mother as calmly as he could, then leaned both hands on the table, pressed his face close enough to Bud\u2019s so that Bud actually leaned back a little bit. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw that Paige had her bag over one shoulder and Chris lying against the other, headed for the front door. \u201cWe\u2019re going to miss those steaks,\u201d he said in a very menacing whisper. Then he picked up the fork he\u2019d been squeezing and saw that it was a little bent. He bent it the rest of the way, folding it in half with one meaty hand. He dropped it on top of Bud\u2019s salad. \u201cDon\u2019t get up.\u201d</p><p>By the time Preacher caught up with Paige, she was halfway down the walk toward the truck and already the women were fluttering out the door, calling after her. With no experience at this at all, having never before been in this position, Preacher knew what was going down. They were going to make excuses for Bud, maybe apologize for him, probably beg Paige to come back. He put a soft hand on her shoulder and she stopped, turning toward him. He reached for Chris. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, taking the boy tenderly. \u201cSay goodbye. We\u2019ll get settled.\u201d</p><p>He got Chris in the car seat while Paige and the other women were still on the walk. Each one of them took one of Paige\u2019s hands, but she pulled out of their clutch.</p><p>\u201cLemme see that arm, buddy,\u201d Preacher said to Chris. \u201cAw, that\u2019s going to be all right. Hey, how about pancakes? Breakfast for supper, huh?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and sniffed back tears. Preacher wiped a big thumb under each eye. \u201cYeah, pancakes. And chocolate milk.\u201d Chris nodded again, a slight smile on his lips.</p> <p>Preacher got into the front cab and waited, watching as Paige finally embraced both the women, then walked quickly to the truck. She got in and he pulled away from the curb before she could even get her belt fastened.</p><p>They drove a little then Preacher said, \u201cChris and me, we\u2019re thinking pancakes. And chocolate milk.\u201d</p><p>She sighed deeply. \u201cI really thought about trying to explain them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd why I really didn\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He reached across the console and picked up her hand, holding it, giving it a squeeze. He smiled and shook his head at her. It\u2019s okay, he mouthed silently. He didn\u2019t let go of her hand. \u201cAfter pancakes, I\u2019d like to take a swing by the hospital, see if there\u2019s any change on Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said.</p><p>Another moment of silence, then, \u201cYou know, my mother\u2014she was a little like your mother. Skinny, but stronger than she looked. I was six feet by the time I was twelve. I might\u2019ve been taller than my mother in the fifth grade. But my mother, Church Lady, she had this move\u2014she could reach up and grab the top of my ear and give it a twist. If I swore or spit or showed disrespect, so fast you never saw it coming, she\u2019d wrench that ear and bring me to my knees. She was still taking me down like that the week before she died. I think she learned it from nuns\u2014some of \u2019em were mean as junkyard dogs. But she made her point.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think your mom ever perfected that move.\u201d</p><p>Paige laughed lightly.</p><p>\u201cPaige, the way you just stood up and left like that, I was awful proud of you. Really, you\u2019re stronger than you let on.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI should\u2019ve stood up and left sooner. I was real close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI think maybe we tried too hard with Bud. Both of us. He always act like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s not real quiet and sulky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe get along with Wes okay?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>\u201cBud thinks Wes is awesome. Because he thinks Wes is rich. Wes thinks Bud\u2019s an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Preacher contemplated. He didn\u2019t let go of her hand. \u201cYou think Bud really believes it would be all right to get your head bashed in a few times a year for six thousand square feet and a pool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he does,\u201d she said. \u201cI really believe he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Think he\u2019d like to move into my big house\u2014test that theory?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDo you have a big house somewhere, John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut for Bud, I\u2019d be willing to look around.\u201d</p><p>It had been flowing over Preacher like a steady wave since the very first night she came to Virgin River, and it grew. Being around her gentled him, steadied him. Made him want to be a better man. It also had another, more disquieting effect; when she brushed up against him, when he caught a whiff of her sweet, natural scent, he could almost become aroused.</p><p>The three of them had been in each other\u2019s constant company for weeks, and his attachment to Chris was strengthening, his affection for Paige deepening by the day. By the hour. When he took her small hand in his, she never pulled it away and he loved that. Sometimes he\u2019d drape an arm over her shoulders, just to let her know he was right there, watching, caring, and she would lean into him a little.</p><p>He wanted this to never end.</p><p>They shared a hotel room while in Los Angeles\u2014two queens. Preacher in one bed, Paige and her son in the other. Lying in the same room with her was both blissful and painful. He would hear every soft noise, every little snuffle in the bed, and wonder what it might be like to lie beside her, bring her against him. When he would shower after her in the morning, he\u2019d get heady from the smells of her soap, shampoo and lotion.</p><p>Mike Valenzuela was sitting up and taking nourishment, though still in pain and a little goofy in the head. There was very little hope of him returning to the police force and his recovery and physical therapy was going to be intense. But with the crisis past, the number of cops sitting constant vigil at the hospital was thinning. Zeke and Paul had gone home; Jack and Preacher were talking about getting back to Virgin River.</p><p>At Preacher\u2019s urging, and the last step before leaving Los Angeles, was a trip to Paige\u2019s house. Right after loading a few things into the truck, they would head north. Christopher was dozing in the backseat of the truck in his car seat, for which Preacher was grateful. He had the passing worry that the boy would want to stay home, not understanding the dangers his father posed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re prepared for this, John,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so Bud said. It bother you at all, leaving a big fancy house?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll be quick. There\u2019s really not much I want.\u201d</p><p>They drove through a security gate into an upscale, exclusive neighborhood and Preacher had to keep himself from reacting to the ostentatious setting, but he gulped. The houses within seemed monstrous to him, sitting back on manicured lawns, landscapers at work, cleaning ladies approaching front doors. Paige\u2019s house was a big brick two-story with a wide, curving drive and wrought-iron gates. Like a country estate. They must have rattled around in there like marbles in a tin can. It was enormous.</p><p>Preacher backed into the drive so that the truck bed was handy for her things. \u201cGod, that\u2019s amazing,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThere has to be a part of you that felt, for maybe five minutes, what a big deal that was.\u201d</p><p>She put a hand on his knee, looked up at him and said, \u201cNot for five minutes. I begged him not to buy that house. He was constantly angry about the cost, the bills, but he had to have it. Do you want to come in? Look around?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He was putting her up in a room above a country bar\u2014a bedroom with no amenities. In a little town with no school. \u201cNah, I don\u2019t need to see any more. I\u2019ll wait out here and keep Christopher with me.\u201d</p><p>When she opened the door with her key and went inside, Preacher leaned against the truck and thought, what must it be like for someone like Wes to lose all this\u2014the woman, the kid, the big, fancy house? Would it ever cross his mind that if he\u2019d treated this with care, it might still be his?</p><p>Paige filled four small, soft canvas bags with clothing for herself and Christopher. She packed up some toys and books. As an afterthought, she threw his Big Wheel tricycle in the back of the truck and Preacher drove them out of town. They were a couple of hours out of L.A. when she reached over to Preacher and put her hand over his. \u201cGod, that\u2019s a relief. I hope I never have to walk in that front door again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad, to have all that and lose it. That\u2019s like the American dream. What every man thinks is the perfect life. A family, success, stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your idea of the big dream, John?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cMy idea is a lot smaller.\u201d</p><p>She stared at his profile for a long moment. Then very quietly she said, \u201cI bet it\u2019s not really smaller. But maybe a lot less complicated.\u201d</p><p>And he thought, not anymore. His idea of the perfect life, the best he could have in the universe, was sitting right next to him. So close, yet so far out of his reach.</p><p>Rick had lived in Virgin River his whole life, had gone to school with the same kids for years, and he enjoyed popularity among his peers. He was a senior, on the home stretch, when his high school experience made a drastic detour. Now, every morning, he was picking up a pregnant girl and taking her to school with him.</p><p>Liz was barely recognizable as the girl who had spent a couple of months in Virgin River the year before. In fact, the pregnant sophomore looked younger than the freshman girl in the short skirts and high-heeled boots of the year before. Lizzie had seemed much more worldly then. She was no longer strutting her stuff; she was shy, self-conscious and vulnerable. She was just a little pregnant girl, and totally dependent on Rick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Rick stayed as close as he could, trying to get her to classes. He couldn\u2019t leave her to fend for herself, alone, making her way through the snickering girls, half of whom would\u2019ve done anything for a date with Rick. Sometimes he was late for class because he\u2019d been getting Liz to hers. His teachers weren\u2019t real sympathetic. He didn\u2019t pretend this was some fling or second cousin\u2014he straightened his spine and claimed her. His girl and his baby. He wished he didn\u2019t have to, but he had to. She had no one else.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take too long for him to get into a fight. A loudmouthed, dimwitted junior by the name of Jordan Whitley made a crack about Rick \u201cgettin\u2019him some every night\u201d and it just tipped him over the edge. Rick shoved Whitley up against the lockers and slugged him. Whitley got one off on Rick before teachers pulled them apart, so when Rick went to work that afternoon at the bar, he brought a shiner with him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cSome asshole had an opinion about my love life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right? And you felt you had to get your face bashed in?\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Preach. I decked him. He never should\u2019ve gotten up. I guess I didn\u2019t hit him hard enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan. Feeling a little out of control?\u201d</p> <p>Rick shrugged. Truthfully, he hated that little punk and had secretly wanted to hit him for at least a year. \u201cHe has a real mouth on him. Maybe he\u2019ll keep it shut now.\u201d</p><p>As far as his love life went, it was pretty bleak. Oh, it was true, he was having sex.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t deny that it scratched a certain itch, but it was beyond strange. Liz needed to be touched, to be loved, but the girl who so softly curved to him now was worlds away from the hot little number that squirmed wildly on his lap last year. And not only did these brief sessions often end with her in tears, he could sometimes feel his baby move while he held her, loved her. When she cried, he\u2019d just collect her against him and soothe her, tell her it would be all right, that they\u2019d figure it out. He said that, doubting it constantly.</p><p>And here they were, having a baby and expected to act like grown-ups, with Aunt Connie watching them like a hawk, making sure they weren\u2019t doing anything adult. The only time he could get with her was by taking a detour on the drive home from school to park for a little while, an action that got him all worked up even as he felt guilty about it. Even with everything that had happened between them, they weren\u2019t allowed to lie down on a bed together. God forbid! What if Liz got pregnant or something?</p><p>She wanted to run away and get married. Fifteen and seventeen, holy Jesus. And when they\u2019d made this little error in judgment, they\u2019d been only fourteen and sixteen. It was a real wake-up call. He was holding her back, holding her off, telling her he\u2019d never abandon her, but he didn\u2019t think they should do anything as drastic as marriage\u2014it was too soon to make that leap. The leap they\u2019d made was terrifying enough. Most days he thought he had her convinced they should wait at least until they decided what to do about the baby.</p><p>Doing the right thing, knowing what the right thing was, just seemed to get more confusing all the time. Around Liz, he tried not to let that show. She was having a hard enough time without Rick letting on that he didn\u2019t know what he felt, didn\u2019t know what to do.</p> <p>It was eating him up.</p><p>Ten</p><p>On the drive back to Virgin River, Preacher asked Paige a lot of questions about the missing girlfriends, Jeannie and Pat. He asked, \u201cYou think they did all right when they got married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey picked up on Wes so easily, I assume they had much more on the ball than I did. I met their families\u2014parents, brothers and sisters. They seemed okay.\u201d</p><p>When they got back, Preacher got on the Internet. It was quick, but it took him a few days to work up the courage to present his findings. When she came into the kitchen right after putting Chris in bed for a nap, he put down his chopping knife and said, \u201cI...ah...I hope this wasn\u2019t out of line. I found them. Your friends.\u201d He pulled a slip of paper out of his jeans pocket\u2014their married names, addresses and phone numbers.</p><p>Her mouth actually gaped open as she stared at him, her hand hesitatingly reaching for the paper. She stared at it for a moment, then her eyes went from the page to his face to the page, back and forth. He shrugged and said, \u201cI was getting in your personal business again, but I just thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shrieked his name, threw her arms around his neck and hugged him so fiercely he took a step back and started to laugh. He put his arms around her and held her off the floor in her excitement. She kissed him on both cheeks, several times, making loud smacking noises. He laughed at her, hanging on, hating the thought of letting her go. He had to put her down too soon. Large, liquid green eyes stared up at him, overcome, and on her lips a phenomenal smile. \u201cHow did you do this?\u201d she asked in a breath.</p><p>\u201cIt was easy,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to show you how to work that computer. I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t use a computer before.\u201d</p> <p>She just shook her head and stared at the paper. Wes wouldn\u2019t allow her use of his computer; it would have put her in touch with the outside world too much.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said. \u201cCall \u2019em. Use the phone in my place instead of in here. Have a little time alone with the girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>She got up on her toes and kissed his cheek again, laying her small hand against the other cheek. She looked at him with such gratitude, it melted his heart. Then she whirled and ran to his apartment, gripping that paper like a lifeline.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said to himself, under his breath, nodding. \u201cBet there\u2019s lots of little things I can look up for her. Yeah.\u201d And he went back to chopping.</p><p>Jack came into the kitchen, looked at Preacher and frowned. \u201cWhat are you grinning about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not grinning,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cPreacher, I didn\u2019t know you had that many teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Paige. I looked up something for her, got her all excited. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of looks like it got you a little excited, too. I think you\u2019re flushed. And Jesus, you sure have a mouthful. You never showed me a grin like that.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he thought\u2014big mystery. You put your arms around me and kiss all over me like that, I\u2019ll show you a mouthful\u2014of fist. But he couldn\u2019t stop grinning. He could feel it and couldn\u2019t stop it. Jack just shook his head and left the kitchen.</p><p>There was another by-product, as if all that affection wasn\u2019t enough. Paige had so much to tell him. Pat was still in L.A., working part-time now in a new salon, a real upscale salon, and she had a baby daughter. She even had some celebrities as clients\u2014little celebrities, but her reputation was growing. Jeannie was in Oregon, of all places! And she had her own shop! She\u2019d married a guy twelve years older who\u2019d never been married before. He flew cargo, so he went out on ten-day trips, then was home for at least two weeks. They bought her shop a few years ago and here they were, thirty and forty-two, thinking about a family if she could just get the management of the shop under control.</p><p>\u201cShe offered me a job, can you believe it?\u201d Paige said excitedly. \u201cShe said she\u2019d love to have me there, and would train me as assistant manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cThat must have made you feel pretty good. Think you could do that?\u201d</p><p>She laughed and put her hand on his arm. \u201cI have one or two things to get settled before I even think about anything like that,\u201d she said.</p><p>There were all kinds of details about her old girlfriends\u2019 lives, and she didn\u2019t seem to leave out even the smallest one. They sat in front of the fire until very late. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you. It was so wonderful to talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to them as much as you can. Catch up on things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s long distance, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s not a big deal. Call every day if you want. Think you\u2019ll get to see them soon?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cWell, Pat\u2019s in L.A., and I\u2019m not going back there. The very thought gives me shivers. But maybe when things are resolved a little, I\u2019ll check out Jeannie\u2019s new husband, new shop.\u201d</p><p>Paige\u2019s attorney had filed divorce papers while Wes was still in treatment, warning her that they might not be able to serve him.</p><p>He was as protected as he wanted to be while there. But within a couple of days her lawyer called her to report that the papers had been served, accepted, and the message from Wes was that he had a great deal of remorse and wanted to be cooperative. The only exception to her terms: he wanted at least supervised visits with his son. He hoped to finally be released from treatment with a good report by Thanksgiving.</p><p>Paige asked John to use his apartment to place a long-distance call, but this one was not to one of the girlfriends. She told Brie what she\u2019d learned.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust this for a second,\u201d Paige said.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t. Here are some facts\u2014we have no idea how he\u2019s doing in treatment. There\u2019s no way to find out if he\u2019s committed to recovery or one of their problem children. Also, if I were his lawyer, I\u2019d advise him to be repentant, cooperative, ashamed and docile. I\u2019d tell him if he could cry at his trial and blame the drugs for everything, it would go down a lot better than getting his back up about how bad he\u2019s getting screwed by the woman he knocked into the middle of next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d Paige said.</p><p>\u201cLawyers aren\u2019t all bad. Advice like that often puts the defendant in that mind-set\u2014he has to change his awful ways, be sorry, be nice. It doesn\u2019t always work that way, but often. He can\u2019t get what he wants if he has an attitude with the court. And we might not know what\u2019s happening with him in treatment, but him not getting released with a good report after thirty days is an indication he hasn\u2019t exactly given himself over to the gospel. Two months isn\u2019t bad. He hasn\u2019t screwed himself up yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s his third battery offense,\u201d Paige said. \u201cIt\u2019s automatic prison. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAah,\u201d Brie began. \u201cSentencing requirements vary. He can be charged, tried and convicted, and his sentence can still be less than you\u2019re hoping for. He\u2019s got a good lawyer. It could be light\u2014short time, lots of probation. It\u2019s still a sentence, still a conviction. The judge has the power of discretion as long as he\u2019s within the law. My advice? Deny the visitation and go after this divorce like a bulldog. If he really does clean up, he can revisit the custody issue when he\u2019s proved himself. That\u2019ll take years.</p><p>\u201cMeanwhile,\u201d Brie said, \u201cwatch your back. Stay alert. Remember who this guy is. You know him better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus, is he going to get out of treatment and show up here again?\u201d Paige said in near panic.</p><p>\u201cHe could. But my guess is, he\u2019s going to honor the conditions of his bail to stay out of jail, go with this trial and try to get out of the felony convictions. Or at least plead them down. Freedom, Paige\u2014that\u2019s the big carrot right now. And the trial can come soon, maybe early in the new year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be completely gray by then,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Paige brooded a little bit, hoping it didn\u2019t show too much. Strangely, it wasn\u2019t Wes or the divorce that occupied her thoughts, but John. November came in rainy and cold and she\u2019d been in Virgin River more than two months. There were times she could become lost in the present moment\u2014oddly satisfied with the day-to-day simplicity of her life, content to work alongside him in the kitchen. They were in sync, and it wasn\u2019t rehearsed; he would chop the scallions, she would scrape them into the bowl. He would shred the cheese, she would clean the grater. She\u2019d beat the eggs, he\u2019d make the omelet. He\u2019d mix the dough, she\u2019d roll the piecrust. She loved watching John\u2014his movements so slow and steady, confident. And to talk with him in the evening after closing, even for a while, was like a reward. The sound of his voice as he read to her son, kind of raspy and soft, comforted her as much as it did Chris. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She found herself wondering what it would feel like to be enfolded in those big arms, to feel his lips on her neck. She couldn\u2019t remember last feeling desire. She would have thought that being in his company for so many continuous hours each day, at least some minor faults would be revealed, but she couldn\u2019t find one. He could be so sweet and tender with her, but then at other times\u2014like when they were with her family in L.A.\u2014he was every bit her champion. Now and then she\u2019d ask herself, was she turning a blind eye to his true character? Was he somehow fooling her, reeling her in? But no\u2014there wasn\u2019t an unchivalrous bone in his body. And it wasn\u2019t just her opinion\u2014his closest friends and the entire town trusted him implicitly.</p><p>She was falling in love with him. She couldn\u2019t remember being in love. The delusion of love she\u2019d experienced in the early days with Wes didn\u2019t even come to mind.</p> <p>Sometimes she asked herself if she should brave rejection and tell him. I want to stay right here with you forever. But she was terrified that he\u2019d get a stricken look on his face and explain, in his patient and direct way, that he thought of her as a good friend, that he was just doing the right thing.</p><p>After Chris\u2019s bath in the evening, she went down to the kitchen and said, \u201cJohn, did you want to read tonight, or should I go ahead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to it. Is he ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSqueaky-clean,\u201d she said.</p><p>When John went upstairs, she went into the bar to find Jack wiping down the bar, putting up his glasses for the next day. As she entered, the last two customers went out, giving Jack a wave and thank-you as they left.</p> <p>\u201cPreacher reading?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cYup. If you want to take off, I\u2019ll keep an eye on things. He\u2019ll be down in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You feel okay with that? Down here by yourself?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019ll lock the door. How long do you think it would take John to get downstairs if I yelled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re in good hands. It\u2019s wet out there tonight. I sent Rick home a half hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo visit with your wife,\u201d she invited.</p> <p>She stayed in the bar and it wasn\u2019t long before John joined her there. \u201cHe was asleep before we finished. I guess he was just knocked out.\u201d He took down a glass. \u201cFeel like something tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little quiet. Have been the last couple of days,\u201d he said.</p><p>She leaned her elbow on the bar, her chin in her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot. I\u2019m going to be divorced soon. That\u2019s eerie. Though I have no idea what\u2019s coming next.\u201d</p><p>He poured himself his nighttime drink. \u201cI have something that might perk you up,\u201d he said. \u201cSit tight.\u201d He went back to his apartment and was quickly back with a long white envelope. He handed it to her. \u201cI took a chance on this. If it doesn\u2019t work out for you, no big deal.\u201d</p><p>She opened it up and found two round-trip plane tickets to Portland. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot on your mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI figured you were probably worrying about what\u2019s ahead for you. Might be a good time to visit that old girlfriend\u2014check on that beauty shop of hers. Just in case...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn case you decide to get back to that kind of work....\u201d</p><p>She put the envelope on the bar. When she said she didn\u2019t know what was coming next, she had meant from Wes. Not what she would do, where she would go. She was right where she wanted to be. \u201cJohn, tell me the truth\u2014are you about ready for me and Chris to move on? The truth, John.\u201d</p><p>His expression was stunned. \u201cNo!\u201d he said emphatically. \u201cI didn\u2019t get you the tickets because I want you to leave. Hey, they\u2019re round trip! I just thought\u2014I know you miss her. And I know that eventually...\u201d His voice trailed off, incomplete.</p><p>She bit her lower lip and looked up at his face. \u201cI should know what you\u2019re thinking. What does eventually mean to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige, I don\u2019t kid myself. I know you can\u2019t be happy here for long. I mean, once you get your life back, get on your feet...\u201d</p><p>Tell him, she challenged herself. Tell him the only thing in the world that would make you happy is to be here forever! \u201cRight now I can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d rather do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I got you the tickets, for you and Chris. For a visit. You should have options. I didn\u2019t call her and ask, by the way. And it\u2019s over the Thanksgiving holiday, so I got them refundable. If you have to change dates...\u201d</p><p>She thought for a second. \u201cMaybe I will have something to drink. How about a little red wine? You have something open back there?\u201d</p><p>He looked under the bar and pulled out a bottle of cabernet, showing it to her. She nodded and he poured. After a sip, she picked up the envelope again. \u201cThis was very nice of you. Very expensive of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of it as a Christmas present, if you want. Has Chris ever been on an airplane?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhat if I go to Portland and love everything? How would you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>He smiled sweetly, then leaned across the bar and pressed his lips against her forehead. \u201cNobody I know deserves to be happy more than you,\u201d he said, his voice soft.</p><p>Preacher wanted her to be free to choose, that\u2019s why he\u2019d done it. He wasn\u2019t stupid, he could tell she enjoyed herself in his kitchen, in this little town. It made her feel safe and protected, her son was happy. But she should know if there was something better for her. He didn\u2019t want her to stay because it was the path of least resistance\u2014it had to be her ultimate desire.</p><p>If she left, he was going to lose his mind. If she stayed, he was going to lose his mind.</p><p>She hemmed and hawed about the trip, but in the end she went. She drove herself over to Eureka, left her car at the airport and flew with Chris to her friend. She called when she got there, called a couple of days later to say the city was lovely and Jeannie\u2019s shop was great. They had a dog, a big, friendly Lab, and Chris was in love.</p><p>Preacher concentrated on planning Thanksgiving dinner, a custom at the bar. He was grateful to have a big cooking job ahead to take his mind off things. He was making his lists, getting out his recipes. And he stopped shaving his head the day she left. Within four days a cap of short black hair covered his dome.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with this?\u201d Mel laughed, reaching up and rubbing a hand over his bristly, dark head.</p><p>\u201cHead\u2019s cold,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI like it. Do you grow it in every winter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHead hasn\u2019t been this cold on other winters,\u201d he said. And he hadn\u2019t been infatuated with a woman who had cut hair for a living other winters, either.</p><p>\u201cHave you told Paige you have hair on your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI guess things that pass as news to women are not quite as interesting to men,\u201d she said. \u201cHave you heard from her this week?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShe called. She says they\u2019re having a nice visit. Her friend has a dog and Chris is crazy about the dog.\u201d He wiped down the counter. \u201cYou think a dog would get in the way around here?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cPreacher, what\u2019s that matter? You just miss them so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s all good,\u201d he said. \u201cPaige hasn\u2019t seen her friend in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s killing me,\u201d Mel told Jack. \u201cLook at him\u2014he\u2019s miserable. He\u2019s so in love with her he can\u2019t think. But will he say anything? To anyone? And seeing him without that little blond angel riding his shoulders is kind of like seeing him with an amputation. He needs to call her\u2014tell her he misses her.\u201d</p><p>Jack lifted an eyebrow and peered at his wife. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get into that,\u201d he said. \u201cHe might try to break your jaw.\u201d</p><p>At night, after Jack had gone home and the last customer of the night had left, Preacher went up to Paige\u2019s bedroom above the bar and went inside. That she had left so many of her things behind, including Christopher\u2019s toys, did not encourage him. He couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d come back here. To him. If she returned at all, it would probably only be for her things. He didn\u2019t think he had anything to offer her beyond a safe harbor. Probably Jeannie and her husband could give her that, and more.</p><p>Her nightie was tossed on her bed and he lifted it to his nose. He inhaled the fresh scent of her. It brought tears to his eyes.</p><p>A major cooking event always helped Preacher take his mind off things. It would be just a small Virgin River crowd\u2014but not a small meal. Besides Jack, Mel and Doc, there would be Hope McCrea, Connie and Ron and Liz, Rick and his grandmother, Lydie, Joy and Bruce.</p><p>On Thanksgiving Day Mel and Jack were at the bar by noon to help with the cooking. Mel rolled dough for Preacher\u2019s pies and peeled potatoes while Jack cleaned up cooking pots. They talked about Christmas with his family in Sacramento, about next Christmas with a baby. Preacher was silent, doing his work. He had his recipe books propped up, stuffed a twenty-five-pound bird, whipped cream, filled pie shells and put them in the oven, all the while glum. When he went into the bar to put out plates and utensils, Jack said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with Preacher? He coming down with something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s coming down with something!\u201d Mel whispered back. \u201cPaige and Chris, that\u2019s what. It\u2019s like he thinks she\u2019s never coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s due back Monday, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! He bought her the tickets, told her to go, and it\u2019s killing him. He looks so handsome with hair, I wish she could see him. He did it for her, I\u2019m sure of it. Who knew there was more to his face than that big, bald head and bushy brows?\u201d</p><p>Since Preacher was never a force of personality, his dour mood was only noticed by his best friends. When people started to arrive for dinner, the tables were pushed together into a long one, places set, and Jack started setting up drinks and glasses of wine. Preacher brought out a couple of trays of hors d\u2019oeuvres, put the bread in the warmer and had the turkey out of the oven to sit a minute before carving. Great smells filled the bar and the fire in the hearth was bright and cozy.</p><p>Preacher found himself wishing this were over with so he could be alone. He looked forward to everyone leaving; he\u2019d take his time with the cleanup, have a shot of whiskey and go to bed. Hopefully he would sleep.</p><p>It was minutes before five, about time to carve, when the door to the bar opened, and there, in the frame, stood Paige. She held Christopher\u2019s hand and looked into the room, scanning the faces until she found Preacher. When she spotted him behind the bar, her eyes lit up so much, they glittered. As for that big man, shock settled over his features; his mouth actually gaped, obviously shocked.</p><p>There might as well have been no one else in the room. As she walked toward the bar, he came around it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get here in time to help,\u201d she said.</p><p>Preacher stooped to pick up Christopher, who put his arms around his neck first, then rubbed his head. \u201cYou din\u2019t shabe it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Preacher kissed the little boy on the cheek. \u201cMy head was cold,\u201d he said.</p><p>Paige wrapped her arms around his waist and, looking up at him, said, \u201cI hope you have room for two more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI changed the tickets. I wanted to be here. With you. I hope you missed me a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little bit,\u201d he said. And then he smiled and put an arm around her shoulders and pulled her close.</p><p>The Thanksgiving party broke up a little earlier than planned, everyone in the room being aware of the hot gazes that Paige was sending Preacher and Preacher was clearly receiving even if he didn\u2019t seem to be successfully interpreting them. The women all helped with the dishes, quickly, so that the couple could finally be alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cMaybe they had some kind of fight before she left,\u201d Mel suggested to Jack. \u201cDo you have any idea what\u2019s going on with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore or now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBefore,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I bet that old bar is shaking so hard it\u2019s about to come off its moorings.\u201d</p><p>When the last of the dishes were put up, the floor swept, the Open sign turned off and the door latched, Preacher trudged slowly up the stairs to his old room. When he got there he found Christopher was jumping on the bed while beside it Paige stood holding his pajama top, trying to get him to settle down after his bath. She threw a look over her shoulder with a wan smile that said she was coming to the end of her rope. After all, she\u2019d been trapped in the plane and car with him much of the day.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, cowboy,\u201d Preacher said, coming forward. He took the top out of Paige\u2019s hands and held it for the boy. Christopher slipped his arms in and turned around so that Preacher could snap it up the back. \u201cThat a boy,\u201d he said.</p><p>Paige put a hand on Preacher\u2019s forearm and said, \u201cPlease tuck in the cowboy and I\u2019ll meet you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Christopher lunged at Preacher, jumping on him, arms around his neck and legs around his waist, hugging him tight. \u201cWanna kiss Mommy good-night?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>Christopher leaned around Preacher a little, puckering, but didn\u2019t let go. He got his kiss and Paige left them alone. \u201cIn you go,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cRead,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAw, c\u2019mon. It\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRead,\u201d he said. \u201cOne page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, one page.\u201d Preacher sat on the bed beside him and accepted the book. He read three pages. \u201cNow you have to settle down.\u201d</p><p>He started whining and wiggling around.</p><p>\u201cDid someone give you sugar?\u201d Preacher asked him. \u201cGet into bed. Enough of this.\u201d He tucked the covers around him and kissed his head. \u201cSee you happy in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cG\u2019night,\u201d Christopher said, snuggling down in the bed.</p><p>When Preacher got downstairs he found Paige in the bar, at the table by the fire, and she had poured him a shot and herself a glass of wine. A new log had been added, an unspoken signal they would sit there together for a while. Her silky, light-brown hair caught a shine off the flame; her cheeks were pink and her curved lips soft and inviting. An ache of longing he couldn\u2019t suppress spread through him.</p><p>\u201cI poured your shot. And helped myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a little wound up tonight. I asked him if anyone gave him sugar and then realized, it was me. Pie and ice cream, two helpings. And I think he had a cola, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s exhausted, so as soon as he detoxes, he should be out like a light. It was a wonderful dinner, John. I think you outdid yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you to come back early.\u201d He pulled out the chair and sat down with her. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt was a fantastic visit. Jeannie\u2019s husband is a great guy, great with Chris. She\u2019s working like a dog in that shop of hers, but it\u2019s going to be successful and she\u2019s so proud of herself. Thank you again for doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd guess what?\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cAfter a few days, I missed you. I missed Mel and Jack, some of the others.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI missed the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she offer you that job?\u201d he asked tentatively.</p><p>\u201cShe did. I told her I\u2019d keep it in mind, but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d end up doing that.\u201d</p><p>He was pretty sure he hadn\u2019t heard right. \u201cYou have a better idea?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She lifted one eyebrow. \u201cYou think a string of shops would make it in Virgin River?\u201d she asked him. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m fine. Chris is fine. I\u2019ve asked you before and I\u2019m trusting you, John, to tell me the truth\u2014you say it\u2019s okay I\u2019m here. And when it\u2019s not really what\u2019s good for you, for the bar, I hope you\u2019ll tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige, I wouldn\u2019t lie to you. Have I ever lied to you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo, not really. But you have been known to delay the information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, not so much,\u201d he said. \u201cPaige, does he\u2014does Christopher ask about him? His dad?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe asked about his Big Wheel.\u201d She looked down. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about something, John. Between my brother, who is a copy of my scrappy dad, and Wes, I\u2019m afraid Chris could get cursed with some nasty DNA thing that causes him to be angry, to hit, to hurt people. I\u2019m really scared about it. Maybe you could look it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think you can see, he\u2019s sweet and happy every day. It\u2019s probably a good idea to keep an eye on that, though. I would.\u201d He took a small sip of his drink. \u201cWes,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes he have people somewhere? Family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d she said. \u201cHe grew up real rough. Foster homes, group homes. A lot of bouncing around.\u201d She laughed ruefully. \u201cI thought it was pretty admirable that someone who came up hard made something of himself. I was looking at the outside, ignoring the inside. He didn\u2019t come through it\u2014he brought it with him.\u201d</p><p>He was silent, thinking. \u201cI served with a guy who grew up in foster homes,\u201d he finally said. \u201cHad a really hard time as a kid. Sweetest guy you ever met. His childhood made him want a nicer life. You can never tell about that. Which way it\u2019s gonna go. You just have to try your hardest to raise him right.\u201d He grinned at her suddenly. \u201cI can show you that ear-twist of my mom\u2019s....\u201d</p><p>Paige smiled at him, sipped her wine. She\u2019d had a lot of late-night talks with Jeannie about John, about Virgin River. Jeannie put in real long days at her shop and Paige had tried to help out by cleaning up the house and starting dinner. But her old best friend, though she may have been tired, sat up and listened to the saga of meeting John, of John\u2019s confrontation with Wes, of visiting her family in L.A. and John holding up to them\u2014holding her up. John and Chris. Jeannie saw the bear with the blue-and-gray flannel leg. She had stroked it and said, \u201cOh, God. I\u2019ve never known a guy who does something like this. This is amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the first things that convinced me to stay. The way he is with Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really awesome,\u201d Jeannie said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t stay there forever because of how he is with your child, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t all there is,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s how he is with me. But he\u2019s so quiet. So...reluctant. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s just shy or if he\u2019s a big Boy Scout, doing the right thing and counting the days till I leave and he\u2019s free of this obligation....\u201d</p><p>Jeannie had laughed and said, \u201cMake him tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve completely forgotten how to flirt. No surprise. Let him know you want to be there. You love it there, and he\u2019s the biggest draw. Let him know he makes you feel wonderful. Be coy but get him the message\u2014you\u2019re a girl ready for a guy like him. If you flirt with him a little and he\u2019s not interested, he\u2019s going to set you straight eventually. If he\u2019s really shy, you don\u2019t want to confront him and scare him off. So, what have you got to do in the meantime?\u201d</p><p>Paige said to John, \u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s okay that we\u2019re still here? I mean, with the holidays coming...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she said. She took a final sip of her wine, stood and kissed his forehead. She let her lips linger there. \u201cThis is the only place I want to be. By the way, the hair is sexy. Very sexy.\u201d</p><p>With that, she went through the kitchen and up the back stairs to her room. And he thought, I\u2019m going to pass out.</p><p>Late in the year the salmon and sturgeon fishing on the Virgin was at a peak, and fishermen came in droves to the river, which meant the bar had plenty of visitors. Many of those who traveled to this part of the world had been here before and had at least a passing acquaintance with Jack and Preacher. But they met with delight the new face on the scene.</p><p>Paige was alive with happiness. She delivered drinks and meals, bussed tables, laughed with the patrons and, it did not go at all unnoticed, threw adoring looks at Preacher when they were both in the same room at the same time.</p><p>The conversation in the bar always seemed to center around the size of the catch, the conditions on the river, the weather. But something that also came up was Preacher\u2019s apparent catch.</p><p>A couple of fishermen were seated at the bar where Jack served when Paige took a tray of dirty dishes back to the kitchen. \u201cThis place gets better-looking all the time,\u201d one of them commented to Jack. \u201cBusiness is bound to pick up on account of the new help. Where\u2019d Preacher find this young beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she found him,\u201d Jack said, lifting his coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t he be smiling a lot more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Preach\u2014he doesn\u2019t like to show too much emotion.\u201d</p><p>As for Paige, she thought John was responding to her, in small ways. He certainly wasn\u2019t pushing her away, and she took that as encouragement. Lips touched cheeks and brows more often; there was the occasional embrace. The best part of her day, her life, was that time after the last patron left the bar and John flipped off the Open sign. Christopher was bathed, dishes were done, bedtime story was read, then she and John would spend their private time together. Talking in soft tones in front of a late-night fire. He had begun giving her a very brief kiss on the lips as she headed toward the stairs and he to his room in the back of the grill.</p><p>He was the best thing that had ever happened to her. Soon, she hoped, he would realize that what she felt for him was not just gratitude.</p><p>Jack had been watching Rick closely. He hadn\u2019t expected him to be carefree, but the boy\u2019s troubled frown seemed to grow deeper and Jack was determined he wasn\u2019t going to let Rick be swallowed up by this, his one mistake.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a man who needs to go fishing,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI need to work,\u201d Rick returned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a really good boss,\u201d Jack said, grinning. \u201cI\u2019m willing to keep you on the clock if you\u2019re willing to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m such a mess, a world-class psychiatrist couldn\u2019t straighten me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing you have me, then,\u201d Jack said. \u201cGet your gear.\u201d</p><p>It was their way that they didn\u2019t broach the subject right off. They drove out to the river, got into their waders and began casting. There were a lot of fishermen this time of year, but that wasn\u2019t a problem; they simply staked out their own little piece of river where they could quietly talk without being overheard above the rushing water. After a little while, a little casting, Jack said, \u201cLay it on me, pal. What\u2019s eating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do it, Jack. I can\u2019t give up my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Jack said. He hadn\u2019t prepared himself for that, but probably he should have. Where was Mel when he needed her? \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a freaking clue,\u201d Rick said. \u201cI saw him on the ultrasound, kicking around in there. I saw his penis. My son. I can\u2019t have someone else raising him. Not when I made him. I\u2019d worry all the time. You know?\u201d</p><p>It was not as though Jack had a hard time understanding those feelings. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of adoptions where you can stay in touch, stay involved.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll do it for me,\u201d Rick said. \u201cI know this is crazy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Liz say?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, but it was a hollow sound. \u201cShe wants to quit school right now. Run away and get married. You have any idea how awful school is for her?\u201d</p><p>Jack suddenly felt pretty stupid\u2014of all the things he could focus on, be aware of, it had never occurred to him how terrible it might be for a fifteen-year-old pregnant girl to attend school every day. And since she\u2019d only been in that school a couple of months the spring before, it was practically a new school for her at that. She might as well have a tattoo on her forehead. \u201cAw, Rick,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to be there for her after every class, get her to the next class. I\u2019m late a lot. I\u2019m getting in trouble a lot. It sucks so much.\u201d He sighed deeply. \u201cLizzie is so young. She didn\u2019t seem that young before. Before we got into this mess. She was...I couldn\u2019t keep my freaking hands off her, she was so hot. She was that way with me, too. She seemed so...experienced. But she wasn\u2019t, you know? There wasn\u2019t anyone before me and there hasn\u2019t been anyone after. And now she\u2019s just this scared little girl who would give anything not to have these problems.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cShe needs me so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rick. My mind has been on so many other things, I never thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s not your problem, okay? It\u2019s my problem. If I\u2019d listened to you in the first place...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t kick yourself. You\u2019re not the first guy to have one occasion of unprotected sex. But guaranteed you\u2019re among a very select number to get a girl pregnant on that first and only shot. We\u2019re a small fraternity, for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis happened to you?\u201d Rick said, amazed.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sure did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>Jack turned and met Rick\u2019s eyes. \u201cForty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel?\u201d he said, astonished.</p> <p>\u201cBetween you and me, right?\u201d Jack said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how Mel feels about me talking about it. But yeah, near as we can figure out\u2014first strike. Difference is, I\u2019m an old man, and not sorry. I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. In my case, I really did get lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShew. I guess if a midwife can screw up, I shouldn\u2019t be so embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy screwup, bud. All my adult life, that condom\u2019s been automatic,\u201d Jack said. \u201cNot just because of the pregnancy issue, but because you don\u2019t want to expose a woman to anything. If a woman\u2019s willing to share her body with you, you don\u2019t want to take a chance of giving her some STD you don\u2019t even know you have. And you don\u2019t want to be exposed. I lost my head. I didn\u2019t protect her. If I weren\u2019t so grateful for the baby, I\u2019d feel bad about that. But hell, that stuff happens to people, pal. At least we\u2019re old enough to take it on\u2014and want to take it on. But you? Damn, buddy\u2014you kids sure got hit hard. I can\u2019t imagine how rough this is for you. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life is so weird right now,\u201d Rick said. \u201cI\u2019m in high school, and I\u2019m sneaking around to be alone with the girl who\u2019s got my baby in her. And it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a punishment, being alone with her, you know? But I\u2019m not even doing it for me\u2014she\u2019s the one who needs attention. I can\u2019t refuse to touch her when she needs to be touched, not when she\u2019s going through this. Can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d think you didn\u2019t care about her,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Rick\u2019s voice grew quiet. \u201cSometimes she just cries. We do it...I want it to be nice for her, hold her, keep her safe, and when it\u2019s over, she cries and cries. And I don\u2019t know what more to do.\u201d</p><p>I think I might cry, Jack thought. \u201cI think it has to be up to her,\u201d he said. \u201cNot what you want\u2014what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I think, too. Maybe I should just do it. Talk to my grandma about letting Liz move in with us, into my bedroom. Marry her or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you need somebody\u2019s permission for that.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, laughing. \u201cWe\u2019re having a freaking baby! In less than three months!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want her to give him up. No discussion. It\u2019s best for him, everyone is saying. Even if they can convince her, I don\u2019t think they can convince me. Do you have any idea how hard it is to keep my mouth shut right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man...\u201d Jack was wishing about twenty things at that moment. Top on his list\u2014he wished Rick was his son, so he could step in and help handle things. He understood they were too young to have a baby together, but it was going to happen anyway, and Rick shouldn\u2019t be marrying anyone at seventeen. Still, that baby shouldn\u2019t go away from its mother and father. And how could they do otherwise, at their tender ages? \u201cYou\u2019re the father. Aren\u2019t there papers you have to sign to let him go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. What the hell do I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to Mel,\u201d he said. \u201cSeriously\u2014this discussion is for you and Mel. She does babies, I do other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a part of me that is so sorry I crossed that line like I did and set this up for us, for me and Liz. What a disaster. But there\u2019s another part that saw that little guy on the ultrasound and just wants to hold him. Show him how to catch a ball...\u201d Then he shook his head. \u201cNo matter how much talking people do, there\u2019s no way anyone can get you ready for what happens to your life when you don\u2019t get that condom out of your pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2019m sorry. I let you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I don\u2019t feel let down. I feel really bad for you, but not disappointed in you. You\u2019ve done pretty good with this, all things considered. Now we have to figure out a way for you to get your life back, both of you, before it gets even worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter what you come up with, Jack, I\u2019m never getting that life back. And neither is Liz.\u201d</p><p>As Jack came out of the kitchen into the bar, there was a man seated at the end. He wore a western hat, a shady brady, and as Jack entered the bar he lifted his dark eyes. It took Jack less than five seconds to recognize him as a man who\u2019d been in his bar a few months ago and tried to pay for his boiler-maker with a hundred-dollar bill peeled off a thick wad of bills, all of which carried the skunklike odor of green marijuana. Jack wouldn\u2019t take his money.</p><p>If that alone wasn\u2019t enough to give Jack a bad feeling about the man, he was also the one who had lain in wait for Mel at her cabin to take her out to some hidden grow back in the hills where a woman was giving birth. For that, Jack felt an urge to go a few rounds with him to be sure he knew better than to ever try that again. Instead, he wiped down the bar in front of him. \u201cHeineken and Beam, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood memory,\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cI remember important things. I don\u2019t want to get in the habit of comping you drinks.\u201d</p><p>The man reached into his back pocket and pulled out a thin leather wallet and withdrew a twenty, laying it on the bar. \u201cFreshly laundered for my fussy friend,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jack set him up his drinks. \u201cHow you getting around these days?\u201d he asked. The man\u2019s eyes lifted swiftly to Jack\u2019s face. \u201cI came across your Range Rover,\u201d Jack said. \u201cOff the road, down the side of the hill. Totaled. I told the deputy where.\u201d</p><p>The man threw back his shot. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cMy bad. I didn\u2019t make that turn. Must have been going too fast. Got a good deal on a used truck.\u201d He lifted his beer, took a long pull. \u201cThat everything?\u201d he asked, indicating he\u2019d rather not have a conversation.</p><p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThere was a birth back in a trailer somewhere....\u201d</p><p>The man put down his beer rather sharply, glaring at Jack. \u201cSo much for medical confidentiality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe midwife is my wife. That can\u2019t happen. We straight on that?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, his hand tightening around his cold beer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, cowboy. She\u2019s my wife. So. Are we clear? I don\u2019t want her taking those kinds of chances.\u201d</p><p>He made a lopsided smile. He lifted his beer and took another pull. \u201cI doubt I\u2019ll ever find myself in that spot again.\u201d Jack stared, hard, into the man\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t at risk, but you\u2019re right. She probably shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>After a moment of quiet, Jack said, \u201cClear River might be a better place for a drink.\u201d</p><p>The man pushed the shot glass across the bar. \u201cQuieter, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Jack served him up again, then took the twenty to change it, indicating the man was done here. Then Jack went to his own end of the bar and busied himself wiping it down, straightening glassware and bottles. He lifted his head as he heard the stool scrape back. The man stood, turned and walked slowly out of the bar without looking at Jack. A glance showed Jack he hadn\u2019t left any money behind and, in spite of himself, he chuckled under his breath.</p><p>Then he went to the window to see what kind of truck it was. So\u2014he\u2019d lowered his standards a little. A dark Ford, jacked up, lights up top, tinted windows. He memorized the license plate, but knew that wouldn\u2019t matter.</p><p>It was only a minute before the door opened again and in came Mel. Her jacket stood open and her belly protruded slightly. She wore an odd expression.</p><p>\u201cYou see that guy, Mel?\u201d Jack asked her. She nodded. \u201cDid he say anything to you?\u201d</p><p>She got up on a stool. \u201cUh-huh. He gave me a long up and down look and said congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t talk to him, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him how that baby was. And he said, they have everything they need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Mel...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man never scared me, Jack. There might be lots of scary people out there, in those hidden grows, but something tells me he\u2019s not one of them.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>After two weeks in the hospital, two weeks in a rehab facility and two weeks with his mother, Mike Valenzuela was stir-crazy. He was still crippled in one arm and totally out of his mind with cabin fever. Not to mention shook up by how long it had taken for his mind to come back. Nothing scared him quite as much as memory loss and not being able to find the right word, or looking at the right word and thinking it was wrong.</p><p>Physically, he was getting by, but there was pain. Most of it was in his shoulder, arm, neck and scapula, and at night it could get so fierce he couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t move. At those times, he could barely get out of bed, and the only thing that worked was a big ice pack and a pain-killer. The other pain was still stiffness and weakness in the groin area, and that kept getting better, but he was using a cane for left-sided weakness when he walked.</p><p>When he looked in the mirror he saw a thin and wasted body where a toned and muscled one had been. A man stooped slightly because straightening hurt his groin, his abdomen. His right arm was bent at the elbow and held protectively against his midsection, the hand curled inward and too stiff and weak to open all the way. A head of thick black Mexican-American hair that had been shaved on one side of his head to remove a bullet was barely growing back. A man who, at thirty-six years of age, was retired from the police department with a one-hundred-percent disability. A man staying in his mother\u2019s house because he\u2019d given houses to two ex-wives and given up his rented apartment when he was shot.</p><p>There was another little matter. Something that didn\u2019t show\u2014it was still hard to pee and he hadn\u2019t seen an erection in a long time. And what came to mind was, I pissed away my life and here I am, hardly able to piss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Mike had been into living hard, living on the edge. The fighting Marines, the police department. Women. Lots of guy stuff\u2014lifting, sports, poker, hunting, fishing. More women. Life in the moment. Fun, fun, fun. Ah. Instant gratification. He\u2019d married twice because he was in the mood, married women he wasn\u2019t really committed to, obviously. And he had pursued too many others. That was certainly not going to be an issue now. Maybe you get only so many erections, and I had all of mine, he thought.</p><p>Driving a long distance wasn\u2019t advisable, but he managed. The right leg was good, the left arm worked fine. The doctors disapproved; they had ideas about further rehab and treatment, but he was a stubborn man and desperate to get away from it all. He threw the stuff he needed in the back of his Jeep SUV and headed north. \u201cStay as long as you want,\u201d Jack had said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to stay with us, though. Preacher\u2019s filled up the spare room in the bar. You might remember the woman\u2014the one that Preacher called you about\u2014she showed up in the bar, beat up, running from an abusive husband.\u201d</p> <p>Mike remembered, but vaguely.</p><p>What Mike wanted was a place to go where his family wouldn\u2019t be in his business, hovering, breathing down his neck. Where his buddies from the department wouldn\u2019t keep calling to see how he was doing, because he wasn\u2019t doing that great. The doctor said that he might eventually get back close to a hundred percent of his arm, but it would take a long time and hard work. The other things, the peeing, the erection, that stuff would either return spontaneously or not\u2014nothing they could do about it right now.</p><p>Virgin River had always been a place of good memories for him. Of sanctuary and challenge at once. He and the boys from his squad went a couple of times a year, camped, stayed a week or so, fished every day, did a little hunting, played poker and drank all night, laughed themselves stupid, had a good time. And what Mike had to do was work on the arm, the groin. Get his body back. Then he could think about the future. At the moment, it seemed like the things he wanted were out of his reach.</p><p>The last time he\u2019d been to Virgin River had only been a few months ago\u2014August\u2014not their usual fishing/hunting/poker trip. Jack had called saying he\u2019d had to kill a man\u2014a lunatic from out in the woods had held a knife on Jack\u2019s woman, demanding drugs. Jack got together a couple of guys to go clean out the woods, so Mike had rounded up the boys and, of course, they all took emergency time off from their jobs and were there by the next morning. When one of them called, they rallied. They hadn\u2019t found anything dangerous in the woods except a big, mean, smelly, pissed-off bear.</p><p>And they\u2019d found Jack, their leader, for the first time in his life, hooked into a woman. Mel, a petite, stunning, delicious woman. Jack, who\u2019d always played the ladies with little care and a lot of useless charm, getting ready to commit to a woman. Now Mel was Jack\u2019s wife and carried their child. Mike was amazed this had happened. He assumed Jack had finally stumbled on a woman who could trip him up, catch him. And make him think he was happy to be caught.</p> <p>That, and the three bullets, had set up a real strong sense of regret in Mike. And a longing for a different kind of life. He felt like he\u2019d missed out on something.</p><p>So, he went to Virgin River with his clothes, his guns, his weights, a rod and reel he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d get to use again. He was going to keep rehabing his arm, get some rest and gain some weight back eating Preacher\u2019s food.</p><p>When he got to the bar he honked the horn and Jack came out on the porch. Mike got out of the SUV using his cane for balance. Jack was tough\u2014he didn\u2019t look at Mike as if he was pathetic, thin, limping slightly, his arm crimped and still useless. Instead, he embraced him like a brother would, but more carefully than in the past. And said, \u201cDamn, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mike said. \u201cMe, too. I have so much work to do to get strong. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p><p>Mel came outside. She was showing now, and it made her more beautiful than ever\u2014she was glowing with Jack\u2019s life in her. She wore a smile that was sincerely welcoming and opened her arms to him, as well. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, too, Mike,\u201d she said. \u201cI can help you with that arm. We\u2019ll get it back.\u201d</p> <p>He hugged her with the good arm. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone you haven\u2019t met, even though you helped her.\u201d</p><p>Jack let Mike navigate the stairs up onto the porch himself, obviously resisting the urge to help him. When they were inside, Jack yelled for Preacher and the big man came out, wearing his apron. He cracked a rare grin when he saw Mike and he came around the bar, arms open.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d Preacher said, embracing him. He gave him several pats on the back, causing Mike to wince painfully. Then he held him away and looked at him. \u201cDamn, it\u2019s good to see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, great. Now, never do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man, I\u2019m sorry. You still in pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome, yeah. What\u2019s with this? Hair on my Preacher-man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHead got cold,\u201d he said, ducking shyly. \u201cYou okay? I didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you could set me up a beer. That\u2019d help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, buddy. Coming up. And maybe something to eat, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeer first, okay?\u201d</p><p>Preacher went around the bar and fixed him a draft. Mel and Jack each sat on one side. Mel leaned in. \u201cHow bad is the pain?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s all soft tissue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it can get real...real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you taking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to hang in there with the anti-inflammatory, maybe a beer, but every once in a while I have to cave in to the Percodan. I hate doing that. Makes me weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already weird,\u201d Jack said. \u201cPreacher, let me have a beer with my man here.\u201d When his glass was poured, Jack lifted it toward Mike. \u201cHere\u2019s to your recovery, bud. It\u2019s going to be quick and powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope God heard that,\u201d Mike said, and took a long, refreshing pull. \u201cThe doc said I\u2019d need three months to start feeling better and I\u2019ve only given it six weeks, but...\u201d</p><p>And then she came out from the kitchen. Mike almost choked on his words. She smiled at him and said, \u201cHello. You must be Mike.\u201d She went to stand next to Preacher, and he, with his eyes focused on the shine in Mike\u2019s, dropped an arm around her shoulders, claiming her. God, Mike thought. Preacher has a woman. And what a woman.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mike said slowly. She was gorgeous. Soft, light brown hair fell in silky curves to her shoulders. She had skin like creamy satin and peach-colored lips, a little line, a scar in her lower lip. He knew what that was about, he remembered better now. And warm, sexy green eyes surrounded by a lot of dark lashes and perfectly arched brows. With Preacher\u2019s arm around her, she leaned against him.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Mike said with a laugh. \u201cYou two somehow found the most beautiful, sexiest women in the state right here in the backwoods. Shouldn\u2019t there be at least one of you in Los Angeles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, we were both from Los Angeles,\u201d Mel said. \u201cAnd fortunately, both found our way to the backwoods.\u201d</p><p>No way Preacher knows what he\u2019s holding, Mike thought. And Preacher, knowing Mike\u2019s careless ways with women, just about anyone\u2019s woman, might feel a little threatened at the moment, even given the crippled hand and cane. Little did he know...</p><p>\u201cWell, damn,\u201d Mike said, lifting his glass. \u201cTo your good fortune. All of you.\u201d Then he looked at Jack and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sarge, but I\u2019ve had it. That drive\u2014it was way more than I thought it would be. Do you mind if I...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou can follow me out to the cabin and I\u2019ll help you unload your gear. Take a nap. Maybe you\u2019ll feel like coming back for some of Preacher\u2019s dinner later. If not, I\u2019ll bring you home something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, pal,\u201d he said. He stretched his good hand toward Preacher for a shake.</p><p>Preacher\u2019s expression lightened up. \u201cGood you\u2019re here, Mike. We\u2019ll beef you up in no time.\u201d</p><p>In the mornings, Mike drank the protein shakes that Mel gave him, though they were god-awful. Then he\u2019d lift piddling weights and stretch. By 10:00 a.m., drenched in sweat, he\u2019d need a shower and nap. Lying down always produced the same effect\u2014soreness and pain when he got up. He\u2019d roust himself up, try to ice it out, and if he could, get himself to the bar by three so he could have a beer to tamp it down a little before meeting Mel at Doc\u2019s. Once there, she\u2019d work on him, as vicious as any physical therapist. She would start with a deep massage of his shoulder and biceps and then the exercises would start. It was enough to make him cry like a baby.</p><p>He was lifting a one-pound weight laterally with the right arm and could not yet raise it to shoulder level, yet she praised him for it, but it was agony. Mike still couldn\u2019t lift three plates out of a cupboard. He\u2019d broken a couple, trying, and forced himself to drive all the way to Fortuna to replace them.</p><p>Every once in a while he\u2019d try to lift his 9 mm right-handed and hold it out in front of him, looking over the barrel. No way.</p><p>\u201cI really think we should set you up with an orthopedist. I can find you one on the coast,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cNo. No more surgery,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThis could take a lot longer.\u201d</p><p>But he was worried about trade damage, where they go in to fix one thing and muck up something else. \u201cWhere am I going? Save the orthopedist. I\u2019ll work it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other issues?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe head and groin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said, but he didn\u2019t connect with her eyes.</p><p>Almost two weeks in Virgin River, eight weeks post op, and he still couldn\u2019t do a sit-up. But he had gained some weight and walking straight was easier, so things were looking up somewhat. And his friends, Jack, Mel, Preacher, Paige\u2014they were hanging in there with him, encouraging his every movement.</p><p>Some days, if the sun was out, he could drive out to the Virgin and watch some angling. He particularly loved watching Jack and Preacher casting; he loved it even better when they had the boy Rick with them. They\u2019d trained the kid and he was a master angler. The three of them, side by side, their lines soaring through the air in perfect S-shapes, flies touching down in the river with such grace and finesse, pulling in their catch. It was like ballet.</p><p>Mike had been a damn fine angler himself in days gone by. He\u2019d been pretty good at a lot of things.</p><p>It was in that kind of a mood that Mike found himself a little later than usual at Jack\u2019s. There were only a few fishermen at a table by the fire with a late meal. Mike was up at the bar when Preacher came back downstairs from story time. Jack exited, leaving Preacher to lock up, and Mike asked for another drink. Then he started to grumble. He was frustrated with the arm, the pain, the clumsiness. A few other things.</p><p>Preacher poured himself his closing shot and stood behind the bar, listening to Mike complain, nodding every so often, saying, \u201cYeah, buddy. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t lift the gun, can\u2019t lift a lot of things. Know the true meaning of \u2018weak dick,\u2019\u201d he said morosely. Preacher\u2019s eyebrows lifted and Mike looked up at his face, glassy-eyed. \u201cThat\u2019s right, the old boy\u2019s dead and gone. May as well have shot it off....\u201d</p><p>Preacher lifted his drink. \u201cYou\u2019re the only guy I know who\u2019d complain about not getting laid in a few weeks because he\u2019s been in a coma,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cI guess you thought you could get lucky even while you were unconscious....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you know,\u201d he slurred. \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m unconscious now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cHey, man, there aren\u2019t all that many women around here. You just might have to do without for a bit....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see when you wake up in the morning, Preacher? A nice tent, huh? I see the...the...the great plains.\u201d</p> <p>Preacher frowned. \u201cYou have a pain pill tonight, Mike?\u201d He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cMike? You have a pain pill tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Sit tight. Don\u2019t move. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Sit still? Mike thought vaguely. Like moving was an option...</p><p>Mike might not have even known he was gone when Preacher was back; he was still peering into his drink, babbling to himself, slumped over the bar. It didn\u2019t seem like any time at all had passed when Jack was helping him to his feet.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Mike. There you go. Forget the cane, just lean on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re going to sleep good tonight, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Preacher got the door and as Jack was helping him through, said, \u201cHe might\u2019ve had more than one pill, Jack. I asked him if he took a pain pill and he didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how many drinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot his usual limit, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cA couple, maybe three.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI gave him a couple,\u201d Jack said, Mike kind of lolling against him.</p><p>\u201cI gave him one,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cTell Mel. She\u2019ll know if it\u2019s anything to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Thanks for calling. I got it now.\u201d</p><p>Mike didn\u2019t get to breakfast at the bar the next morning, but by afternoon, right before his appointment with Mel, he was looking pretty decent. He called Preacher and asked for a lift into town where his SUV waited.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you sleep?\u201d Preacher asked when Mike got himself carefully into the truck.</p><p>\u201cProbably good,\u201d Mike said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gotta watch those pain pills and drinks. I think maybe you had a couple pills, a couple of drinks, and went straight to la-la land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, could\u2019a been. Sometimes it gets terrible...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen there\u2019s depression,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cDepression after major surgery is real common, you know that? Especially if it\u2019s heart surgery or something violent. I think you qualify for violent. Three bullets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould qualify,\u201d Mike said evasively.</p><p>Preacher reached in the pocket of his denim shirt and pulled out a folded piece of typing paper. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the morning tent...\u201d he said. \u201cI looked all this stuff up last night. Erectile dysfunction\u2014common after major surgery, after violent crimes, while taking narcotic drugs, et cetera. There was a list of things. Besides waiting until you get better, which you will, you should get checked for chronic bladder infection, which happens after being in the hospital, having those catheter things. You can tell Mel about it, no problem. Mel doesn\u2019t even tell Jack stuff. I printed it out for you.\u201d</p><p>Mike took the paper gingerly, unfolded it. \u201cAw, Jesus, I couldn\u2019t have told you about this....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll come back, I think. If it doesn\u2019t, you can always get a rod put in it. But I don\u2019t know, Mike...I don\u2019t think I\u2019d get a rod put in my dick. I think I\u2019d try prayer first....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, fuck...\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cBut one thing you oughta really think about\u2014something for that depression. Mel can hook you up. And maybe count the pain pills. Man, you were a goner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher, I swear to God, if you ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I say anything? Gimme a break, huh?\u201d</p><p>Mike looked at the printed page. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the computer. You just tell Mel. Or Doc. But I\u2019d tell Mel, even though she\u2019s a girl. She\u2019s a lot more up on some stuff than Doc. I don\u2019t know that Doc sees a lot of this with the sheep ranchers. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you so much right now,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cYeah? You\u2019ll get over it. Probably real soon\u2014when you next want food.\u201d</p><p>It took him a few days of pouting, but then Mike brought up his issues with Mel during one of their rehab sessions. He got a round of antibiotics for a chronic bladder infection and an antidepressant that he\u2019d probably only have to take for a few months. But he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d thank Preacher. Guys just don\u2019t talk about those things. At least sober.</p><p>But he secretly found this rather amazing, coming from Preacher.</p><p>He walked into the bar early one afternoon, between lunch and dinner, and found Preacher seated on a stool with a towel around his shoulders. Paige had scissors in her hand and was trimming him up. He cocked his head and looked at this activity.</p><p>\u201cI was a beautician,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cAnd if John is going to have hair, he\u2019s going to have to keep it decent. I see to that,\u201d she said, smiling. Then, taking a comb to his bushy eyebrows, said, \u201cNot to mention these evil things. I\u2019ve never seen a man with so much hair here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is looking better these days, I\u2019ve noticed,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI figured it was you.\u201d</p><p>Preacher glowered.</p><p>Laughing, Mike ran a hand over his own bizarre head of hair. It was longer on one side than the other, still a little sparse over that temporal scar.</p><p>\u201cWant me to try to straighten that up for you? While I\u2019ve got my stuff out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that would be great. You don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be glad to. John\u2019s done here,\u201d she said, whipping off the towel.</p><p>\u201cOkay if I let your girl touch me with her scissors, Preacher?\u201d</p><p>Preacher merely scowled and stood up from the stool. But he turned toward Paige and placed a small fatherly kiss on her forehead. Just in case there were any questions.</p><p>Then she put a hand on his forearm and looked up at him with adoring eyes. But Preacher seemed not to see it. Mike wondered if Preacher had any idea what was going on here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go see if Christopher is waking up,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Then I\u2019ll be in the kitchen to help.\u201d And to Mike she said, \u201cNext?\u201d</p><p>He sat on the stool and she draped him with the towel.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d she said, \u201cI can work with this. Does this still hurt?\u201d she asked, gently touching the scar.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. But it seems to be having trouble growing hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fix you up. Let me take it a lot shorter, give you a chance to catch up over here. I promise, it won\u2019t be awful. You\u2019d look good with shorter hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what the Marine Corps thought. They thought I was cute as a button as a jarhead. Anything you do is fine. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have been terrified, when it happened,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember anything. Instant lights out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, I guess.\u201d She snipped a bit, black hair falling to his shoulders and onto the floor. \u201cI should thank you, I think. I know that John called you about my...situation. My ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, very recently. I don\u2019t even carry the name anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I guess, if you\u2019re still here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it here. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve felt more...I don\u2019t know, normal. And Christopher is so happy\u2014he loves John so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear how Preach\u2014how John feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cOkay, he\u2019s not the most demonstrative, but you can bet I\u2019ve never seen him act like this before. It\u2019s pretty obvious.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the mirror off the bar and handed it to him. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gifted,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who can get a silk purse out of that mess should have her own chain of shops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in Virgin River, I don\u2019t think,\u201d she laughed. \u201cBesides, I love working with John.\u201d</p><p>Unable to sleep one morning, Mike hoisted himself out of bed, iced down his shoulder and went outside with his 9 mm. He stood on the porch and lifted it with his left arm, peering over the barrel.</p><p>Jack came out onto the porch, dressed to go into town. \u201cIs the wildlife in danger?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Mike turned. \u201cI think I should start perfecting the left hand. In case...You know. In case I don\u2019t get it back.\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cNever hurts to know what you can do. But I wouldn\u2019t give up on the right arm. Not yet. It hasn\u2019t been that long, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating as hell. That\u2019s all.\u201d He holstered the gun. \u201cThere a place around here I can shoot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a range about thirty minutes from here just outside of Clear River. I\u2019ll write down some directions for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou on your way into town?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cHeaded that way pretty soon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Mel out of bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you there,\u201d he said, carefully maneuvering the steps and climbing into his SUV.</p><p>Jack stood there until Mike had driven out of the clearing. Then he pulled off his boots and left them on the porch. In his bedroom, he got down to his boxers and slipped into bed beside his wife, pulling her into his arms. \u201cHmm,\u201d she said, snuggling close. She sniffed. \u201cYou\u2019ve had coffee already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped open and she turned toward him only to find her mouth instantly covered in a blistering kiss. It took her a second to realize what he\u2019d said, and when she did, she returned the kiss. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI watched him leave,\u201d Jack said, smiling down at her. \u201cYou can make as much noise as you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t make that much noise,\u201d she said. She tugged his boxers down. \u201cOh-oh. I might make a little noise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go right ahead, baby. I might, too.\u201d</p><p>Mike pulled up in front of the bar and parked, but he stayed in his car. There, slumped in one of the porch chairs, was a woman. She was a big woman wearing long men\u2019s trousers, boots that hung open unlaced, a plaid shirt and quilted down vest. Her head lolled to one side, her arms dangled over the arms of the chair, and on the floorboards of the porch, an empty bottle.</p><p>He tucked the 9 mm under the seat and left his cane in the car. He had to use the porch rail to assist in getting up the steps. He went to the woman and pressed two fingers to her carotid artery\u2014at least she was alive.</p><p>Mike tried the front door to the bar and found it was still locked. No need to wake anyone. He went back to the SUV and pulled a blanket out of the back. He covered the woman and used a book of matches to light one of the gas space heaters Jack kept on the porch in winter. Then he took a chair on the other side of the porch. Waiting.</p><p>After about fifteen minutes, he got a clue. Jesus, he was stupid sometimes. Suddenly, he began putting the pieces together. Great detective work, Valenzuela, he found himself thinking. At night, when everyone turned in, he could hear them softly talking. He couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying, but their muffled voices in late-night conversation drifted to his room. And in mornings after he\u2019d had trouble sleeping, Mel would usually say something like, \u201cIt was a bad night, wasn\u2019t it? You okay?\u201d Every groan, every flush\u2014it was one big room. They might as well be camping together.</p><p>Just because he wasn\u2019t getting it up didn\u2019t mean no one was. Jack and Mel needed some time alone. My God, they were newlyweds, and Mel\u2019s pregnancy wasn\u2019t too advanced for her to enjoy a healthy, satisfying sex life. He made a mental note to pay attention to that\u2014to find things to do that would free up the cabin. To be sure, they knew he wouldn\u2019t be back for quite a while so they could have a private life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>He could look around for another place to stay and get out of their hair. But Jack was pleased that Mike had come to him. Mel was happy to be helping with his rehab. It would be better if he could just delicately find ways to give them the place to themselves for a few hours here and there.</p><p>He looked over at the woman, wondering who she was and what she was doing here. That bottle could be bar stock. Did Preacher give her the whole bottle and send her on her way so he could lock up? But if she\u2019d been passed out here since last night, she might be frozen by now. The temperatures at night were pretty low; it was getting damned cold. Cold enough to give her some serious hypothermia.</p> <p>It was thirty minutes before Jack\u2019s truck pulled in next to his SUV. When he got out of the truck, his brow was furrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you could tell me,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cPreacher\u2019s not up yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He might be back in the kitchen, but the door is still locked and I didn\u2019t want to take a chance on waking up the house. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack. You don\u2019t have to explain. I should be the one trying to explain. Sometimes I just don\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Mike...\u201d</p><p>Mike tilted his head and laughed suddenly. \u201cHoly shit, are you blushing?\u201d he asked, astonished. \u201cThe woman\u2019s your wife, for God\u2019s sake. I\u2019ve been whoring with you and you never\u2014\u201d</p><p>A strong hand was clamped on his good shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re going to stop talking about it,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cExcept to say, luckily for you, I am now sensitized. You and the comadrona deserve the life of man and wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComadrona?\u201d</p> <p>Mike laughed. \u201cThe midwife. I\u2019ll be a better houseguest from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Getting strong is your first priority. Our first priority.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cThis is when you really know who your friends are,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, who\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Cheryl Chreighton. I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s an alcoholic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wind up here a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is a first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe get that bottle out of your bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We don\u2019t serve her,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t say where she got the bottle. She used to stick to that nasty Everclear, kind of hard to find around here. We\u2019re the only place in town with a bar.\u201d He rubbed a hand along the back of his neck. \u201cWe should probably get her out of here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere you going to take her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d he said.</p><p>The lock on the door moved and it opened. Preacher stood in the doorway, looked out, assessed and said, \u201cOh, crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher, you have coffee yet?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a cup of coffee while we think about what to do with her. She\u2019ll keep.\u201d Jack bent down and picked up the empty bottle to throw away.</p><p>Twenty minutes later Mel came into the bar, her jacket collar pulled up around her neck, hands in her pockets, all that blond hair scrunched up at her shoulders. Mike looked at her appreciatively; her cheeks were rosy with love, her eyes bright, lips bruised pink. \u201cJack, Cheryl Chreigton is kind of weaving down the street with a blanket around her shoulders. You know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means I don\u2019t have to take her home. She was passed out on the porch when we opened up this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack, there must be a way to get that woman some help. My God, she\u2019s only thirty years old!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think of something, I\u2019ll be glad to pitch in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, Mel, her parents have been trying for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re obviously not trying the right things,\u201d she said. She shook her head sadly and left the bar.</p><p>Jack had barely finished splitting logs when Connie was in the bar, visibly upset. \u201cWell, they did it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey ran off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Jesus,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cCould\u2019ve been the middle of the night\u2014I didn\u2019t hear anything. Ron\u2019s out driving around now. I can\u2019t stand the thought of calling my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t,\u201d Jack said. \u201cGive me a minute. Help yourself to coffee.\u201d He went into the kitchen, pulled out the business card that was stuck between the phone and wall, dialed up the sheriff\u2019s department and asked if they\u2019d dispatch Henry Depardeau, the deputy assigned to their area. He called the California Highway Patrol. Both times he gave a description of Rick\u2019s truck and said that family in Virgin River needed to get in touch with the young couple. Then he went back to Connie. He refilled his mug with coffee. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to stay out of this, Connie. But maybe I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Rick\u2019s just got Lydie, and she\u2019s old and not too well most of the time. If Rick has anyone coaching him into manhood, trying to teach him, it would be me and Preacher. Probably not the best father figures in the world, but that\u2019s all he\u2019s got. We should do better by these kids right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Jack, I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. Do you know why they ran off? Because I have some ideas. One is\u2014they don\u2019t want to give that baby away. Holding that hard line with them, even if it seems to make the most sense, might drive them to do more drastic things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they going to do with a baby, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Rick found out there was a baby, he said he was going to make sure Lizzie wasn\u2019t afraid. He\u2019s going to protect her, whatever it takes. He must have felt like he was facing a firing squad\u2014you know any seventeen-year-old boy looking to be a father? Huh? But he said he was going to stick close to Liz. Me and Preach, we were damn proud of him for that. He\u2019s trying to be a man here, take care of the mother of his child. He shouldn\u2019t be protecting her from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, he\u2019s a good boy, but still, Jack...\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cRick\u2019s going to be eighteen in a few months. Young, but not the youngest father on record. But he\u2019s living with his grandma, Liz is living with you, and they can\u2019t even be alone together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, they shouldn\u2019t get any more involved! They\u2019re children!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey made a baby together, Connie. Do you think you can un-shoot that gun? Every day is a hard day for Liz\u2014and sometimes she needs the only person she thinks is on her side to put his arms around her. It isn\u2019t a good time for her to think she doesn\u2019t have love in her life, when it\u2019s growing in her every day. She needs him, Connie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Jack, Lizzie is fifteen....\u201d</p><p>He gave a nod. \u201cI know this, too. Now, Connie, I hope I never say anything about a woman that isn\u2019t gentlemanly, but I\u2019d like you to do a quick memory check. When Rick and Liz got involved, she was only fourteen\u2014fourteen going on twenty-one. Two kids with grown-up bodies and adolescent minds. I don\u2019t know about you, but I think it\u2019s better if they don\u2019t get married just yet. And being in somewhat the same position as Rick, nobody would get my baby away from me. Not at knifepoint.\u201d</p><p>She looked down and shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t have my own kids,\u201d she said. \u201cMy sister shouldn\u2019t have stuck me with this. She told me to watch that they don\u2019t get any more serious, make sure that baby gets adopted by someone who can give it a good home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right there\u2014she shouldn\u2019t have done that to you. But I\u2019m glad she did. Doesn\u2019t sound like your sister has the wisdom or patience for it, and I\u2019ve known you for some time now. I know you\u2019re up to it. It might be better if you start playing by your own rules, not someone else\u2019s. After all, Liz is living under your roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s the right thing, the wrong thing....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do. They\u2019re a couple, Liz and Rick. Unfortunately for them, they got into this so young, we don\u2019t know if they can make it stick, but they\u2019re a couple right now. They should be getting ready for the baby, because I can tell you, that baby\u2019s coming no matter what they decide to do. Even if Liz can be forced to give him up, Rick can\u2019t. Maybe we should put our heads together and see if we can help them be parents and finish school, because the only thing for sure right now is, they\u2019re going to be parents. No matter what we do. We might as well offer up some support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking on a baby full-time,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think my health is up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLotta help around here, Connie. Preacher and I\u2014we\u2019d do anything for Rick. I think Mel and Paige fall into that category, as well. Instead of telling them what they have to do, we better start asking them what they need.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cConnie, if those kids need each other right now, it\u2019s time to back off. She\u2019s not going to get more pregnant. It might keep them from getting married before they\u2019re old enough to vote.\u201d He took a drink of coffee. \u201cUnless we\u2019re already too late.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang and Jack went to the kitchen. He was back in seconds. \u201cWe got \u2019em. Henry Depardeau is holding them out on 99, changing a tire. I\u2019ll go get them if you\u2019ll keep an eye on the bar until Preacher gets out here. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Jack drove down the highway for only about fifteen minutes before he saw the sheriff\u2019s car, and right in front of that the little white truck. He pulled up in front and got out. Rick already had the old tire off and the new one on. The minute Liz saw Jack, she put her hands over her face and began to cry.</p><p>Rick put his arm around her shoulders and she leaned her face into his chest. Jack came up behind her and with strong hands on her upper arms, pulled her back from Rick and into his embrace. \u201cLiz, honey, I want you to stop crying. Everything is going to be all right. Go sit in my truck and let us get this tire changed. Go on, it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Rick held the lug wrench in one hand. He looked at Jack. \u201cYou pissed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Rick applied the wrench to one of the lugs and gave it a sharp, angry twist. Jack noticed, not for the first time, how strong the kid was. \u201cLizzie hit a wall\u2014total panic. Hysteria. She\u2019s afraid of losing the baby. Losing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShew,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou must have felt like you had to do something about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was trying.\u201d He tightened another nut. \u201cI thought if I took her somewhere...Oregon. Married her. She\u2019d settle down. She\u2019s getting kind of close, Jack. I can\u2019t have her all messed up like that. It worries me.\u201d He applied the wrench again. \u201cI should be with her as much as I can. Try to keep her calm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. But you can\u2019t run off. Take her home, sit down with Connie. Tell Connie you need to be in the driver\u2019s seat now. You have to take care of your girl, your baby. I think maybe she\u2019ll listen to you. I had a talk with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Jack hung his thumbs on his belt and looked down. \u201cRick, I know you\u2019re trying to keep everything from spinning out of control. You gotta keep your head, buddy. Before you do something as crazy as running away to marry a fifteen-year-old girl, talk to me. Will you, please? Between us, we can keep things sane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes that seems impossible,\u201d he said, tightening the final lug nut.</p><p>\u201cI know, Rick. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that baby,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cI would, too,\u201d Jack admitted. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on getting this to come out the best we can. I\u2019m on your team, Rick.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know how you could be,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, I didn\u2019t exactly listen to you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never saw it like that. We\u2019ve been over this. You\u2019re not the Lone Ranger on this fuckup. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll I ever wanted was to make you guys proud of me,\u201d Rick said.</p><p>Jack grabbed the kid\u2019s upper arm and gave him a little shake. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever think otherwise. The only thing that could make me more proud is if you were my son.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>There were only four anglers in the river, die-hards. The weather was cold and rainy, the salmon had almost finished running for the season, snow was falling in the higher elevations and Christmas was just around the corner.</p><p>Preacher pulled in his third catch of the day, a good-size fish, and started out of the river, his head down. This was getting ridiculous. It wasn\u2019t as though Jack and Preacher had a lot of long talks, but the glum, preoccupied silence had been stretching out. Something had Preacher on the ropes.</p> <p>Jack, shaking his head, went after him. \u201cHey, Preacher,\u201d he called. \u201cHold up.\u201d Jack caught up with him. \u201cWe have enough fish to clean for tonight?\u201d</p><p>Preacher nodded and turned away, moving toward the truck. Jack grabbed the sleeve of his slicker. \u201cPreacher. I gotta ask you something. What the hell\u2019s eating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he replied, frowning.</p><p>Jack shook his head in frustration. \u201cYou have this beautiful little family under your roof. You watch over them like a papa bear. That kid adores you, you have a sweet, cuddly young beauty to knock boots with every night, and you\u2019re depressed. I mean, you are obviously depressed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not depressed,\u201d he said somewhat meanly. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t knocked boots with anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack said, confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou heard me. I haven\u2019t touched her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe have issues?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cLike the abusive ex or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cI have issues.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYeah? You don\u2019t want her? Because she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Preacher said suddenly. Then he averted his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSure you do, Preacher. You take off your clothes, she takes off her clothes...\u201d</p><p>Preacher snapped his head back. \u201cI know where all the parts go. I\u2019m not so sure she\u2019s ready for that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher, my man, do you have eyes? She looks at you like she wants to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus, she scares me to death! I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll hurt her,\u201d he said, then shook his head miserably. What the hell, he thought. Jack\u2019s my best friend. If I can\u2019t tell Jack, I can\u2019t tell anyone. But he said, \u201cYou say anything about this and I swear to God, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Jack just laughed at him. \u201cWhy would I tell anyone? Preacher, you\u2019re not going to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I do? She\u2019s been through so much. She\u2019s so soft. Small. And I\u2019m\u2014hell, I\u2019m just a big, clumsy lug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Jack said, laughing again. \u201cPreacher, you don\u2019t even break the yolks. You\u2019re\u2014well, you\u2019re big, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re probably big all over,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cBelieve me, women don\u2019t mind that.\u201d</p><p>Preacher\u2019s chin went up and he frowned, not sure whether he\u2019d just been complimented or insulted.</p><p>\u201cListen, buddy, you don\u2019t have the problems you think you have. You have to trust yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it\u2014I don\u2019t. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll go out of my mind. Do something that\u2014I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll break her in half.\u201d He looked down at his hand, fingers splayed. \u201cWhat if I leave a bruise on her? I\u2019d wanna die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you listen to me. Here\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna do. You\u2019re gonna tell Paige what\u2019s been bothering you. Okay? That you haven\u2019t touched her because you\u2019re afraid you might not know your own strength and be too rough with her, and you don\u2019t want to be. She\u2019ll help you, Preacher. She\u2019ll get you through this. Goddamn, man\u2014the girl wants you so bad it\u2019s distracting.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cMan, the way she looks at you, I figured you haven\u2019t let her sleep in two weeks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think either one of us is sleeping....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell\u2014how could you? You gotta get this monkey off your back!\u201d And Jack immediately thought, I can relate. I\u2019ve had a houseguest in the cabin with paper walls for weeks now. It was catch as catch can at his house, and while he was a man who could appreciate a quickie now and then, a steady diet of that wasn\u2019t getting it. He\u2019d give anything to be alone with Mel for a long, slow night. He was just about out of his mind himself. The house he was going to build would be soundproofed.</p><p>\u201cThere haven\u2019t been...I haven\u2019t been with a lot of women,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cSure not a tenth as many as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s a good thing. You\u2019re a serious guy\u2014you get points for that! You just have to be willing to\u2014Jesus, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this.\u201d Preacher frowned blackly. For a second Jack thought, if he hits me, I\u2019m not letting him get away with it again. \u201cOkay, listen. You just have to be willing to pay attention to details. The details, Preacher. The sounds she makes when, you know, you touch her. Tell her to show you what...Argghh,\u201d he growled in frustration. He forced himself to go on. \u201cOkay, you ask her to show you what she likes. Ask, is this okay? Listen to her. You can tell by the sounds she makes if you\u2019re on the right spot. Ask her to put your hand where she wants it. To tell you where she\u2019d like you to touch her. How she\u2019d like the touch. It\u2019s pretty simple. You just want to make her feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaww, man,\u201d he said, helpless.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, I guess someone has to tell you. You need me to dig you out a movie or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Jesus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as well. They don\u2019t do it so well in those movies, anyway. You\u2019ll be better off if you just admit you\u2019re not sure and you want it to be good. You guide each other, Preach. That\u2019s the best way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never had\u2014you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone you loved,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, hanging his head. \u201cGod. It never mattered so much before. I guess I should feel like crap about that, too....But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a grip, Preacher. You\u2019re not rough. You\u2019re gentle, but you\u2019re strong. It\u2019s a great combination, believe me. All you really have to remember is, she goes first.\u201d Preacher frowned. \u201cCome on, man, you know what I mean. You hang in there until you\u2019re sure she\u2019s been satisfied. Then you\u2019re free and clear. That\u2019s the best advice I can give you. That, and you better not wait any longer. I have a feeling you\u2019ve put this off too long already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell anyone about this and I swear to God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re gonna kill me. Shit, Preacher. You better do something about this right away. I mean, Jesus, man, are you at all confused about why she\u2019s still hanging around here? That girl\u2019s been waiting for you and you have to get the job done. Now, come on, let\u2019s go clean fish.\u201d Jack threw his pole and catch in the back of Preacher\u2019s truck. Damn, Jack thought. The poor guy. The poor girl!</p><p>When Mike walked into the bar, no one was there. Well, the place tended to stay pretty empty on rainy afternoons. That was just as well\u2014he only wanted a beer to take the edge off the pain in his shoulder and neck. It was amazing how bad it could get sometimes, and the rain and cold always made it feel worse.</p><p>The fire had begun to die down, so he went to the hearth, leaned his cane against the wall and opened the grate. With his left hand he lifted the poker and stirred the logs a little, sending up a flame. Then, holding his right arm protectively against his middle, he reached for a log to put on the fire. Then another.</p><p>He looked at his watch. Three o\u2019clock. He could pour himself a beer. Jack and Preacher wouldn\u2019t mind. But he walked back into the kitchen. Paige was in there, kneading a big wad of dough, her back to him. \u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p><p>She turned around and, as quickly, turned back. There had been tears on her face. He frowned. What was this? Trouble in paradise? \u201cHey,\u201d he said, walking up behind her, squeezing her upper arm with his left hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said with a sniff.</p><p>He turned her around to face him. He looked down at her pretty face and for the hundredth time thought, that damn Preacher. I bet he doesn\u2019t know what he has here. \u201cThis isn\u2019t nothing,\u201d he said, wiping a tear from her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSure you can. Seems like maybe you\u2019d better. You\u2019re all upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher do something to hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She immediately started to cry and leaned forward, her head falling on his chest. He put his good arm around her and said, \u201cHey, hey, hey. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not okay,\u201d she cried. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you talk to me, I can help. I\u2019m so good with free advice, you\u2019ll be impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...I care about him. But he just doesn\u2019t find me...\u201d</p><p>Mike lifted her chin. \u201cWhat, Paige?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t find me attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesirable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige, that\u2019s nonsense. The way he looks at you, he eats you with his eyes. He\u2019s wacko for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t touch me,\u201d she said, a large tear spilling over.</p><p>That almost knocked Mike down. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>She nodded pathetically.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d Mike said. He\u2019d thought, everyone thought, they were doing it all night long. The way they looked at each other, like they couldn\u2019t wait for everyone to leave so they could be alone, get it on. Those sweet little kisses on the cheek, the forehead. The way they touched\u2014careful, so no one would see the sparks fly, but the sparks were flying all over this bar! The sexual tension was electric. \u201cOh, man,\u201d he said again. He put his arm around her. \u201cPaige, he wants you. Wants you so bad it\u2019s showing all over him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, honey. Preacher\u2019s strange. He\u2019s never been good with women, you know? When we served together, we all managed to find us a woman somewhere. I killed two marriages that way. But not Preacher. It was very rare for him to\u2014\u201d He stopped himself. He was trying to remember\u2014were there women at all? He wasn\u2019t sure; he knew Preacher never had a steady girl. He thought he remembered a woman here, there. It\u2019s not as though he was focused on Preacher\u2019s love life; he was too busy taking care of his own. He probably lacks sexual confidence, Mike thought. It would be hard for him to put the moves on anyone he felt he had to win over.</p><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s scared,\u201d Mike heard himself say.</p><p>\u201cHow can he be? I\u2019ve practically thrown myself at him! He knows he isn\u2019t going to face rejection!\u201d She dropped her gaze, lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cHe has to know how much I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI bet he\u2019s not worried about rejection. Aw, Paige, Preacher\u2019s so shy, sometimes it\u2019s just plain ridiculous. But I promise you, Paige, I\u2019ve known the man a long time\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019d trust you with his life. That he has...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we have that, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s funny with men\u2014you can trust each other with your lives and never talk about anything personal, you know? Sometimes Preacher seems a little naive in the ways of the world.\u201d Then remembering their talk not long ago about depression et cetera, he said, \u201cAnd at other times, he makes the Grand Canyon look shallow.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHe can be a mystery. There\u2019s more to Preacher than...You really care about him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you be patient. He\u2019ll come around. Paige, it\u2019s obvious\u2014he cares about you, too. You and Christopher. I\u2019ve never seen him like this with anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he wants to be sure I\u2019m not just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mike was shaking his head. \u201cHe wants to be sure of himself, Paige. Preacher\u2019s real cautious. I think the man could be terrified of disappointing you. That\u2019s my bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t possibly,\u201d she said, and a tear fell again.</p> <p>Mike wiped it away. \u201cYou just have to trust me on this\u2014he\u2019s a bundle of nerves. He\u2019s really good in a fight, really good in a war, and who\u2019da guessed how good a cook he turned out to be, huh? But with women? Paige\u2014he\u2019s never been a hustler. I don\u2019t know of any women. He\u2019s never been that kind of guy. Just not a tomcat like some of the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I love most,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Mike smiled. \u201cYou give him some time, huh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She smiled weakly.</p><p>Mike dropped a brotherly kiss on her forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah. Just hang in there. Don\u2019t give up on him.\u201d Mike thought, that lucky son of a bitch. This woman adored him. Wanted nothing so much as to make him happy all night long. \u201cGo wash your face. I\u2019m gonna get myself a beer.\u201d He gave her shoulders a final squeeze, and as she turned away from him, Preacher was standing in the back door with his catch.</p><p>Paige skittered past Preacher, keeping her head down so that he wouldn\u2019t see her tears. Preacher scowled at Mike. \u201cNeed something?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI need a beer before I walk over to Doc\u2019s and let Mel torture me. Want me to get it myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d he said, throwing his fish in the big sink.</p><p>Jack came in right behind him. \u201cHey, Mike. How you feeling today?\u201d He threw his catch on top of Preacher\u2019s.</p><p>Mike rubbed his right upper arm with his left hand. \u201cA little better every day. Need a hand? I have exactly one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, but if you want to drink your beer back here while we clean fish, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Preacher had a stuffed trout that was nothing short of amazing. It was a lot of trouble\u2014fileting the fish, stuffing it with a delectable corn dressing, slipping it back into the trout skin and under the broiler. It was one of Paige\u2019s favorites. He served it with spinach souffl\u00e9, warm pasta in a white garlic sauce and bread. It was good to make a meal that was labor intensive; it took his mind off things.</p> <p>He\u2019d seen her leaning against Mike; seen Mike kiss her forehead, smile and whisper to her. Well, he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she fell for Mike. Mike was the sexy one, the romantic one, even when he was a little scraped up. Always successfully wooing women. He\u2019d had more women than he deserved. So, if that was how it went, that wouldn\u2019t surprise Preacher. He\u2019d thought from the beginning that Paige just saw in him a true friend, a man who could protect her against the world. All that business with the sweet smiles, the embraces\u2014she was probably just ready, period. Not necessarily for Preacher.</p><p>Now it embarrassed the hell out of him what he\u2019d said to Jack.</p><p>She made the bread. \u201cYou did good here, Paige,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI did exactly what you said would work,\u201d she said. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I got stuffed up from the rain,\u201d he lied. \u201cIt was so cold out there today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I go get you something. Aspirin or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, forget it. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>There were only a few for dinner, typical for a rainy night. Jack sat at a table with Mel, Doc Mullins and Mike while Paige and Christopher sat at the bar with Preacher standing on the other side, coaching Christopher to eat a little more. Everyone was done before seven and Jack was picking up the plates. Mel went back to the kitchen with him where they started washing up.</p><p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cI got that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost done here. Then we\u2019ll get out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hurry, man. I have sweeping up to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could get that, too,\u201d Jack offered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>In ten minutes, Jack was holding Mel\u2019s coat for her. Mullins was edging out the door and Paige was taking Christopher upstairs for his bath.</p><p>\u201cYou coming, Mike?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be along in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t overstay your welcome,\u201d Jack advised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p><p>When everyone had gone, Mike moved to the bar. Preacher started putting chairs up on the tables so he could sweep. But Mike said, \u201cHey, Preacher, come here a minute, would you, buddy?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Preacher went around the bar. Don\u2019t tell me now, he was mentally pleading. Don\u2019t tell me about you and Paige. I don\u2019t want to hear it. Just let it happen and I\u2019ll live with it. I\u2019ll find a way to live with it. Never really thought I had a chance, anyway.</p><p>\u201cHave a drink with me. A short one. No pain pills today, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Preacher got down two glasses and poured them each a shot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you something, and you\u2019re going to act like you never heard it. You get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Preacher said, throwing back the shot for courage.</p><p>\u201cI caught your girl crying today.\u201d</p><p>Shock settled over Preacher\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, old man. She can\u2019t figure you out. I think she loves you, Preacher. She\u2019s waiting. She needs some attention. You with me?\u201d</p><p>Preacher nodded solemnly. He wasn\u2019t going to go there with Mike.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks you don\u2019t find her attractive. Desirable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s crap,\u201d Preacher said. He poured himself another shot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you. You don\u2019t have any excuses here, pal. If you don\u2019t step up, she\u2019s going to think you don\u2019t want her. Don\u2019t care about her. I\u2019d hate it if she thought that because I\u2019m looking at the two of you, the three of you, and I think it\u2019d be a damn stupid shame if you three lost one another because you\u2019re an idiot. Now, I\u2019m not going to try to guess why it\u2019s not happening for you two. Preacher, buddy, it\u2019s time to make it happen.\u201d</p><p>Preacher threw back that second shot while Mike merely lifted his, not drinking.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were messing with my girl,\u201d Preacher confessed.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was telling her to try to be patient with you because of your, you know, extra-low IQ.\u201d Then he grinned at Preacher\u2019s scowl.</p><p>\u201cYou always used to mess with anybody\u2019s girl,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot just anybody\u2019s girl, Preach. I\u2019d never touch a brother\u2019s woman, you should know that. Even I don\u2019t cross that line. Even if you haven\u2019t made it clear to Paige, you\u2019ve made it clear to everyone else\u2014she\u2019s your girl. Besides, I\u2019m no threat to you. It\u2019s you she wants. Bad enough to make her cry about it.\u201d Mike took in about half his drink and stood up. \u201cDo yourself a favor, Preacher. Your girl needs you and you don\u2019t want to let her down now. Don\u2019t waste another minute.\u201d He left the rest of his drink. He stared into Preacher\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou better take care of business. You copy?\u201d</p><p>Copy, Preacher thought. Cop talk. \u201cYeah. I copy.\u201d</p><p>Preacher went upstairs to put Christopher to bed. Christopher was running around the room bare-assed, dodging his jammies; the kid loved being naked. Preacher grabbed him up, swung him around as he giggled and stood him on the bed. \u201cEnough,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead to me,\u201d Christopher said, bouncing.</p><p>\u201cYour mommy is going to read tonight. Ten minutes. And then lights out.\u201d</p><p>Preacher got him in the pajamas and gave Paige a little slap on the rump. \u201cI\u2019ll see you downstairs in ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, a little surprised by his apparent playful mood.</p><p>Preacher, his insides tight, went to his quarters. He shaved and showered quickly. He put on a pair of sweat-pants and a T-shirt. He looked at his bed and drew the quilt down, folding it. And he thought, I\u2019m going to think of this as something I have to do for a friend. Not for me\u2014for her. That\u2019s what it\u2019ll be.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t come downstairs yet, so he stirred up the fire a little bit and sat on the chair, his feet up in front of the fireplace. When she came into the room he said, \u201cCome here, Paige.\u201d He held out a hand to her and brought her onto his lap. He ran his big hands down her sides to her waist and leaned toward her. She met his lips for a short kiss, but when he didn\u2019t pull back, she went there again, making it long, slow and lovely. His lips opened slightly, and with the back of his hand, his knuckles, he brushed against her breast and felt her sigh against his open mouth. He put his big hand over her breast.</p><p>She rubbed a hand along his cheek. \u201cYou shaved,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I wouldn\u2019t want to go hard on your skin with whiskers. Mmm. Paige, you have any idea how I feel about you?\u201d She just looked at him. \u201cHow much I feel for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t really said....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve said. But I\u2014\u201d He stopped and took a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to put into words, but what it is...This thing I feel for you\u2014it gets stronger every day.\u201d She smiled into his dark eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re so soft. So small compared to me. I want you, Paige. My God. But haven\u2019t been sure if you\u2019re ready...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been worrying. I don\u2019t want to do anything to hurt you. Especially after everything...Everything that came before me. Before us.\u201d</p><p>She was stunned for a moment. Seeing the precious look in his eyes, she pressed her lips against his and kissed him again, lightly. Against his mouth she said, \u201cYou\u2019re the gentlest man I\u2019ve ever known. You\u2019re not going to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not experienced with women,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m never sure of the right things to do. And I never wanted to do the right things more than with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll make up our own right things to do. It\u2019ll be fresh. New.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy buddies, they know a lot about women. I never paid much attention. Until now. Until you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI love that about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me feel really special,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cEven if I don\u2019t know everything I should know about women...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you need to know,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He groaned and pulled her harder against his mouth, kissing her deeply, feeling her small tongue enter even as her arms tightened around him. \u201cYou think he\u2019s asleep?\u201d Preacher asked, a little breathless. \u201cBecause we\u2019re going to have to close the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was almost asleep before I left him. He\u2019s not going to get out of bed, John.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>He kissed her again. And again. And then with his arms beneath her, stood up, lifting her. As he carried her toward his room, he felt her mouth against his neck, pressing soft kisses there, sucking gently at his earlobe, making small, beautiful noises.</p><p>He put her on his bed and she came up on her knees, facing him. His lips against hers, he began to work the buttons of her shirt. She slipped her hands under his T-shirt and ran them over his smooth chest, teasing his nipples. He spread her shirt open and over her shoulders, letting it drop. He looked down at her; bruises healed, her skin was flawless. She reached her hands behind her and unhooked the bra, flinging it away. For a moment he just stared, filling his eyes with her lush, ivory skin, her full breasts. When he met her eyes, she was smiling up at him, pleased to have his eyes on her.</p> <p>Preacher ripped his shirt over his head and pulled her against him. He was already making a nice big tent in his sweats. \u201cPaige,\u201d he said, holding her close. \u201cOh, this could be over way too fast....\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, kissing his neck, his cheeks, his lips. \u201cLucky for us, we don\u2019t get just this one chance.\u201d</p><p>The thought had never even crossed his mind. In his panic about doing the right things, making her happy and pleasing her, it hadn\u2019t even occurred to him that this was the beginning, not the final exam. He could mess it up, like he half expected to, and he could still get a second chance. His hands went to the snap on her jeans and popped it. \u201cI have condoms, Paige.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been screened...since the last time...? Because I was checked after the D and C and I\u2019m on the pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t...\u201d He kissed her again, drowning in her mouth. His hands on her hips, he slowly slipped the jeans down. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been anyone. There\u2019s no chance. Oh, I can\u2019t believe how good you feel. I can\u2019t believe I get to touch you like this....\u201d</p> <p>She closed her eyes, feeling his hands run up and down her sides, over her bottom, along her hips and up again. His hands were so big and powerful, but as she expected, his touch was careful and tempting. Slow and delicious, driving her crazy with longing. She put her hands on his hips; the sweats came down easily, despite the obstruction of an amazing, beautiful erection. \u201cLook at you,\u201d she said in a breath, smiling, taking in his broad, hairless chest, narrow hips. She finally saw the rest of that tattoo on his left upper arm that peeked out from under the snug sleeve of a T-shirt\u2014an American eagle.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you like,\u201d he whispered against her mouth.</p><p>Still kneeling, she directed his lips lower, to her breast. With a soft, easy tongue he circled her nipple and she dropped her head back, sighing. That nipple came to life under his tongue and he pulled her harder against his mouth and gently suckled, drawing a deep moan from both of them. He felt her pull his hand from around her until it was in front of her. With her hand over his, she slid it down, over her belly, past her soft mound and deeper. Her fingers on top of his, she pressed them into her and moved them. \u201cThere,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThere,\u201d she said again. He memorized the place, the sound. The details.</p><p>He would have no way of knowing that his skill as a lover was not an issue with her, but the fact that he wanted only to please her, to make her happy, that was huge. It took only a second of showing him where and how to touch and he was on his own, driving her absolutely mad with desire. Maybe it didn\u2019t occur to him that he wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d been a long time without this pleasure in his life. For Paige, it had been a lifetime. And she was so ready to feel both love and pleasure.</p><p>John pinched his eyes closed and prayed for control. He hoped he would be able to tell when she was satisfied\u2014he wasn\u2019t completely sure how that worked. He\u2019d never paid attention before. A lot of panting and squirming, he assumed. Maybe he\u2019d get lucky and she\u2019d just tell him.</p><p>The sensation of her breast against his mouth, his fingers in her soft, slick folds made him light-headed. Then her hand went to his erection and he groaned miserably. He lifted his head. \u201cYou better not do that yet,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wanted you so bad, it\u2019s lucky we made it to the bedroom....\u201d</p> <p>She let herself slowly drop back onto the bed, pulling him down with her. \u201cNot a problem, John,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI wanted you just as bad.\u201d He held himself over her and she put his finger back on that spot, reminded him how to move it and said, \u201cOohh,\u201d just before she kissed him again, her tongue sweet and strong in his mouth. He worked it a little bit and her moans came stronger, her hips pushing against his hand.</p><p>\u201cTell me what to do. Tell me what you want. I\u2019ll do anything you want,\u201d he said. \u201cI want this to be right for you.\u201d</p><p>She touched him boldly again and said, \u201cJohn, let\u2019s take care of this, right now. Right away. We can experiment later....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to do it for you first,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make you feel really good.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly against his lips. \u201cI do feel really good,\u201d she said.</p><p>She opened her legs for him and he lowered himself over her. As she guided him with her hand, he pressed himself slowly and deeply within her. He was amazed by her strength, amazed that she seemed not at all overpowered by him, but rather a formidable partner as she rose to meet him, pulled him in. \u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is so perfect.\u201d He heard her hum deeply, felt her move her hips beneath him, and he began to pump his hips to her rhythm. He figured he\u2019d be good for seconds, not minutes, and hoped it would be enough. But he remembered then, remembered what brought that deep moan from her and slid his hand between their bodies and down, inching his finger toward that spot that she loved. And he heard it again. \u201cOh, John....\u201d She moved harder, throwing a leg over him and pulling him deeper and deeper. He rubbed that hard little knot while he thrust his hips, and beneath him, she was pounding against him, meeting him with each movement.</p><p>Something happened immediately. Her body tightened around him and he felt a clenching, a squeezing, a pulsing. It startled him, it felt so good. It was so amazing, he was able to hold himself back because he was in a trance. This was a first for him; he\u2019d never noticed this before. Never felt it. He froze as her breath caught and she strained against him, hot spasms closing around him, drenching him in liquid heat. \u201cPaige,\u201d he whispered, overcome. \u201cOh, Paige.\u201d She cried out softly, again and again, grasping him powerfully, lost in her own orgasm, and then her mouth was on his again, devouring him, sucking at his lips and tongue. He rocked with her as she climaxed, while she pulsed with such power, until it felt like there was nothing left in her; then she slowly began to relax beneath him, weak in his arms. Weak and limp and satisfied, all the strength he\u2019d felt a moment ago turned to nothing but softness in his arms. He was in awe of her response. Looking down at her, brushing her hair away from her face, he asked in a hoarse whisper, \u201cWas that it?\u201d</p><p>She smiled dreamily. \u201cThat was it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s incredible,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, John,\u201d she said, moving her hips beneath him. \u201cWe\u2019re not done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI guess we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her legs around his waist, and with his hands on her bottom, he drove himself into her until he let it go, and it was more powerful than anything he\u2019d ever known in his life. It shook him to know he could do this for her, feel this with her. Every muscle in his body flexed, then trembled, and then slowly began to relax. It took him a long time to stop panting; took him quite a while to breathe evenly. He rose above her. \u201cPaige,\u201d he said weakly. \u201cI never felt anything like that in my life.\u201d</p><p>She touched his face. \u201cYou\u2019re just too good to be true, you know that?\u201d she whispered. And kissed him. She knew it would be like that\u2014his every touch was powerful yet sweet, so like him in every way. \u201cJohn, promise me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me anything, John. Never be shy with me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said, and slowly lowered his mouth to her breast, drawing gently on a nipple. And she said, \u201cOooh, John.\u201d He memorized the place, the sound.</p><p>So this was what it felt like when you loved someone, when you wanted to please someone rather than just be pleased. When you paid attention to what made her purr and sigh. He hadn\u2019t known about it. As he held her close, he couldn\u2019t stop kissing her, couldn\u2019t stop touching her, tasting her and exploring her body with gentle fingers. With kisses. With his mouth, his tongue. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can get enough of you,\u201d he whispered to her.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m not tired at all. And your hands on me...Your hands are like velvet. You\u2019re so careful, but you don\u2019t miss anything. It\u2019s how I knew it would be, John. You\u2019re so perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige, is this how it is? Do other men know all about this?\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what other men know. I\u2019m not very experienced, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never...I swear, I\u2019ve never felt like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither have I. You\u2019re a wonderful lover. Wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you could want someone like me,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see yourself at all\u2014I suspected that. John, you\u2019re so beautiful, so smart and kind and strong. You don\u2019t even realize how handsome you are. And you have the most incredible body\u2014so big and hard and fit. Not an ounce of fat or flab.\u201d She ran a small hand over his shoulder, down his biceps. \u201cYour hands are so perfect\u2014powerful and soft\u2014all that kitchen work, I bet. Your hands on me...It\u2019s everything I dreamed it would be. You just don\u2019t see yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it was really me you wanted. I thought maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t you think after the kind of life I\u2019ve had, I know a good man when I find one? How could you doubt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about how I made you feel before,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I didn\u2019t want you. When, God, you were all I\u2019ve wanted since...Since almost the first day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomebody said something,\u201d she said, but she didn\u2019t say it angrily.</p><p>\u201cMike told me I\u2019d better step up, take care of my girl, or I might lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re stuck with me. But just the same, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it so easy,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I wanted was to make you feel good. I didn\u2019t know it was going to be that wonderful for me, too. And when I felt it\u2014your pleasure\u2014I thought I was going to pass out, it felt so good.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on him. He was already rising again.</p><p>\u201cI want to make you feel like that every night for the rest of my life,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI kind of like that idea,\u201d she said. \u201cJohn. I don\u2019t want to scare you away, but I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>He buried his face in her neck, in her soft hair. \u201cBaby, I love you so much, I think I\u2019m going to die of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see, John? This is all I want. You. You loving me. Me loving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d he asked her, her hand on him, his hands on her.</p><p>\u201cNow we do it again. Slower.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>The sun came out, and though the December air was cold, the day was bright and sunny. When Mel got to town, she checked in with Doc to see if anything was going on. Then she went over to the bar to have a cup of coffee with her husband.</p><p>Jack was a definite morning person; it was his best time. He got his exercise splitting logs if the weather was decent, and he did this year round, even in summer when there was no need to lay a fire. He\u2019d leave Mel sleeping and sneak away quietly. He liked to be around the bar first thing in the morning, check on what Preacher planned for food, inventory his supplies, make a list of chores to finish, be sure everything was set for the day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She found him behind the bar with his coffee mug, Christopher sitting up on a stool, a bowl of cereal and glass of orange juice pushed slightly to one side as he colored on a page of his coloring book. His box of crayons was flipped open, at the ready.</p><p>Mel jumped up on a stool beside him and said, \u201cMorning, buddy. How are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm, good,\u201d Christopher said, paying attention only to the page.</p><p>Jack poured her a mug of coffee. \u201cChristopher, tell Mel what you told me this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. About how big you\u2019re getting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m getting big.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Mel agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnd...?\u201d Jack prompted.</p><p>\u201cAnd John says I should have my own bed. My own room. Because I\u2019m getting so big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI suppose you should.\u201d</p><p>Paige popped into the bar from the kitchen. \u201cHi, Mel,\u201d she said brightly. Her cheeks were chafed pink, her eyes twinkling behind sleepy lids, and her smile was a tish secretive. Her lips were ruby, maybe a little swollen from kissing all night long. She seemed to flow into the room, serene. Mel thought, How amazing that you can always tell when someone\u2019s had sex. Lotsa sex. \u201cHow are you doing on that cereal, kiddo?\u201d Paige asked Christopher.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he answered, coloring.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s done,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t touched it since the last time you checked on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, picking up the bowl. \u201cBut please drink your juice,\u201d Paige said, taking the bowl back to the kitchen.</p><p>Mel looked up at her husband. Jack lifted one eyebrow and gave her a half smile. Mel leaned across the bar and grabbed a fistful of Jack\u2019s shirt, drawing him to her. She whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should be pretty obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to take me home this minute and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Jack whispered back.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we have company. And you\u2019re a screamer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, this is ridiculous. I\u2019m so jealous I could spit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t fun, that\u2019s for sure. Well,\u201d he said, throwing a look over his shoulder in the direction of the kitchen. \u201cSome of us are having fun. Finally.\u201d</p><p>Within a few minutes, Mike made his entrance. He said good morning to everyone, ruffled Christopher\u2019s head of floppy hair and accepted a mug of steaming coffee from Jack. \u201cHow\u2019s everyone doing this morning?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful morning,\u201d Jack said, sipping from his cup.</p><p>\u201cSure is. I had a pretty decent night last night.\u201d He leaned his cane up against the bar and went to the kitchen. He poked his head in and found Paige and Preacher in a serious lip-lock. Feeling somewhat the author of this hot embrace, he watched for a minute. Paige had her arms around Preacher\u2019s neck while he had both his big hands on her bottom, holding her close against him. They were completely oblivious to being watched and he couldn\u2019t resist. He cleared his throat.</p><p>Paige jumped and withdrew her arms, but Preacher refused to release Paige, not moving his hands. He looked over the top of her head with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful morning,\u201d Mike said. \u201cWhenever you get a second, could I have breakfast? I\u2019m starving.\u201d He grinned and left them.</p><p>When he got back to the bar, he hoisted himself carefully up onto the stool and picked up his mug. \u201cThings are working out pretty well around here,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one who had a good night last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat a fact?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI just hope I get breakfast before noon.\u201d</p><p>Preacher had taken apart his weight bench and put it in the storage shed behind the bar, keeping back barbells and a couple of weights. There was a small tree there instead, as well as one in the bar. He had taken Christopher out into the woods to chop them down and they decorated them together. Beneath the one in the apartment, ready for Christmas morning, were gifts thoughtfully chosen by Preacher and Paige, some bought together, some individually.</p><p>Mel and Jack left for Sacramento for a big Sheridan family gathering a few days before Christmas and Mike could not be convinced to join them. Neither was he interested in going home to L.A.\u2014not yet. He\u2019d only been in Virgin River a few weeks and promised he would be fine at the cabin, so Mike would be with Preacher and his new family for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.</p><p>Preacher was still in a state of shock and euphoria at the turn his life had taken. It had been more than three months since Paige had happened into his life and a matter of days that they\u2019d been intimate. Nothing could have prepared him for the joy he felt. Working by her side through the day, he found in her a partner in full. They shared everything from the managing of the bar and cooking to the parenting of Christopher with complete compatibility. She was ever at his hand, looking for ways to help him just as he was always near, taking care of her every need.</p><p>And at night, when the little one was asleep, Preacher found he had become a master lover, something that had never in his wildest dreams seemed possible. He had never even considered it. And especially not with a woman like this\u2014a young woman of what he considered stunning beauty with the disposition of an angel.</p><p>In no time at all he had learned every way to draw a sigh from her, to make her cry out. Preacher, so easily embarrassed and quiet, had become bold and daring with Paige. Experimental. He had begun to trust his hands, his instincts, much to her satisfaction. And this idea of paying attention to details, memorizing touches and sounds, asking her what she wanted, what she liked\u2014well, this was pure genius. If he didn\u2019t find this amazing thing he had with Paige to be so private, he might even thank Jack for the advice.</p><p>As he held her against him, flesh on flesh, he asked her, \u201cWill you tell me if it\u2019s too much? If I\u2019m too demanding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, John,\u201d she said, breathless. \u201cWill you tell me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He answered with a lusty laugh. \u201cYeah. Sure. But you\u2019ll have to dig me up to ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do that thing you do...Again,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd again and again and again?\u201d he asked, teasing her.</p><p>\u201cOoh, John...\u201d</p><p>This business of the female orgasm Preacher found to be the best discovery of his lifetime. It had to be better than a man\u2019s; better for a man than his own. The one thing he didn\u2019t even know he was capable of, he\u2019d quickly become an expert at. He was quite sure it wasn\u2019t even as much fun for her as it was for him. He had a dozen methods, but one of his favorites was to torture her delightfully by kissing her whole body, from her eyelids to her toes, spending a little extra time right in the center of her body. He liked to start with soft kisses, end with a strong tongue, and when he sensed, knew that she was ready to explode yet again, he\u2019d get right inside her so that he could enjoy it. There was nothing in this world like it\u2014that hot, gripping spasm that sometimes caused her to cry out his name and grab hold of him as if she was afraid he might float away. When he rocked with her through that miraculous release, more than once he said, \u201cI think I could do this forever. I could do this for a living....\u201d</p><p>He liked to catch her as she fell back to earth, gasping, breathless, weak from an electrifying orgasm. It was so pleasurable for him that he\u2019d hold himself back, delay his own release so that he could bring it to her again. He\u2019d let her have a moment to recover and then begin on her once more, slowly at first, sweetly, gently. Her responses would let him know that it was time for him to be more aggressive, put a little more muscle into it. It was she who determined the pressure and pace\u2014and it made him laugh to think he was so worried that he might break her. She was like finely tempered steel\u2014and she surprised him with her strength. Her power.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t unusual for her to wrap her legs around his waist and refuse to let him go, or push him onto his back and climb on him, treating him to a bit of his own medicine, taking the choice to wait any longer away from him. Giving back what she\u2019d gotten.</p><p>He had no idea his life could be so satisfying. So utterly fulfilling. Nor had he ever considered that it could be so much fun. Their sex was hot, then afterward they could laugh, banter a little, bring the lightness to their life that balanced everything.</p><p>\u201cHow can I love you this much?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOr this often?\u201d she countered, laughing.</p><p>\u201cPaige, I want you to know something. I know it\u2019s too soon for you to think about a whole lifetime, but I\u2019m not fooling around here. I don\u2019t have any expectations, I swear. I just want you to know that. I\u2019m in all the way. Committed. I don\u2019t want you to ever worry that I\u2019m just passing the time.\u201d</p><p>She ran her fingertips through the short hair at his temple. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little afraid you could get tired of me, John?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not that kind of guy. I take it slow\u2014too slow, sometimes. I give things a lot of time\u2014being sure is a good thing. But I don\u2019t change my mind. I know in some things that can be bad. I like things to stay the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hold you to anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just so happy to be here, like this, right now....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else I want to say about that, about us. I\u2019m not the kind of guy who doesn\u2019t want you to talk back or have your opinions or expects you to never have a bad day when you\u2019re all cranky and annoyed. I want all of that\u2014I want you to speak up, make demands, insist on the most exceptional treatment and get pissed off if you don\u2019t get it. I want you to feel safe to yell at me just because you\u2019re in a mood. If I\u2019m not what you want for the long haul, I can live with that. What I could never live with is you being afraid of how I\u2019ll act when you\u2019re just being yourself.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible to keep tears from gathering in her eyes. \u201cJohn...No one\u2019s ever loved me like that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, baby, I do. In fact, that\u2019s the only way I love you. Every part of you\u2014strong and bossy, scared and needy\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter. If I\u2019m gonna have you, it has to be all of you, not some little part that feels safe.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him, quick, on the lips. He brushed a tear off her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI know that baby you lost wasn\u2019t planned, and it still hurt you pretty bad that it didn\u2019t make it. Maybe someday, when you\u2019re ready, you\u2019ll talk to me about adding to our family. Giving Chris a little brother or sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like children?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI never thought I would. But with you, it comes to mind.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIt comes to mind pretty hard. It\u2019ll keep, Paige. It\u2019s just an idea....\u201d</p><p>She gently touched his face. \u201cYou do understand that if there\u2019s a baby between us, you might have to cut back a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d he asked, that frown that she had come to adore drawing his brows together. And she laughed at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re teasing me,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay, you asked for it,\u201d he said, starting on her eyelids.</p><p>She grabbed his face in her hands and stopped him. \u201cJohn,\u201d she said. \u201cI want it, too. Everything. All of you. I\u2019ve never been this happy.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMore where that came from,\u201d he said. \u201cForever, if you want.\u201d</p><p>Mel was so excited about Christmas in Sacramento, she could barely contain herself. All of Jack\u2019s sisters and their families would be around both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, but the bonus was that Mel\u2019s sister, Joey, husband Bill and the three kids were flying in. There was plenty of room at Sam Sheridan\u2019s house for them\u2014Jack\u2019s sisters all having their own homes in town. Mel and Joey, being the only family they had, had been generously and affectionately drawn into the Sheridan clan. This was only Mel\u2019s third visit to Jack\u2019s family, and she already felt as though she was going home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She had left the Hummer for Doc\u2019s use, in the event he had to get someone to a hospital. The back of Jack\u2019s truck was loaded with gifts, many of which they bought when they stopped over in Redding to spend the night and finish shopping. And to enjoy the comforts of a hotel room, which did not have paper-thin walls or one of the Marines across the hall.</p><p>Though they didn\u2019t consider the money wasted by any means, it was not a night of wild passion as it might have been a few months earlier. Mel was now seven months pregnant, a little baby girl literally romping inside of her. Sex was lovely, but way more tame than it had been at the time they conceived this little genius. Instead of crying out Jack\u2019s name with passion in the aftermath of her orgasm she said, \u201cUgh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, if I weren\u2019t an incredibly secure man, that might really bother me,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, darling. My back hurts, my boobs hurt, and I think I\u2019m carrying a marching band, not your baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that kind of eliminates the potential for lots more sex tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s starting to eliminate the potential for lots more sex before spring,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>She lay on her back, her belly sticking up like a mountain on top of her little frame, and Jack couldn\u2019t keep his hands off of it. While there was a time he couldn\u2019t keep his hands off the rest of her\u2014and she had no doubt they would be there again before long\u2014right now it was the antics of his baby within her that occupied him thoroughly. He would let go a loud bellow when her entire abdomen shifted, caving in on one side and protruding enormously on the other. And he especially liked when it appeared a foot was sliding in a large lump up one side. She could actually doze while he occupied himself with her pregnancy. It brought to her mind what he was going to look like rolling a ball on the floor with their baby girl, bouncing her on his knee, twirling her around over his head.</p> <p>\u201cWe should think about naming your new playmate,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI have a suggestion,\u201d he said. \u201cEmma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Emma,\u201d she said. \u201cOld girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother. My mother,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s sweet. I think your mother would be happy you\u2019re finally serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel? Are you nervous about\u2014you know\u2014giving birth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all. You know why, big fella? Because I\u2019m meeting John Stone at Valley Hospital, and if everything goes to hell, I\u2019m having a big fat epidural. Afterward, I\u2019m having a rare steak and a tall beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d he said, running a hand down her hair onto her shoulder. \u201cI want you to have the epidural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014are you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, nervous doesn\u2019t touch it. You\u2019re my whole world. I don\u2019t think watching you hurt is something I can do. But I gotta be there, you know?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and shook her head. \u201cYou know how you always said I should trust you? Well, now it\u2019s time for you to trust me. I know what I\u2019m doing, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, that makes one of us.\u201d</p><p>When they were getting ready to leave the next morning to complete the trip to Sacramento, Mel was drying her hair in the hotel bathroom, which was large and had plenty of mirrors. In their little cabin in the woods there was just that one mirror at eye level. Jack was mesmerized by the sight of her, naked in front of those mirrors. He hadn\u2019t really seen her like that. He\u2019d seen her naked, of course, but lying down or standing almost a foot shorter than he as they showered. Now he bent, looked at her profile and said, \u201cMy God, Melinda. You\u2019re huge.\u201d</p><p>She threw him a look that suggested a different choice of words.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, you look awesome, Mel. Look at that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jack,\u201d she said.</p><p>When they got to Sam Sheridan\u2019s house, Mel preceded Jack up the walk toward the front door while Jack began toting luggage and gifts. \u201cMel,\u201d he called, causing her to turn around to see him smiling brightly. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to waddle,\u201d he said proudly.</p><p>\u201cUh!\u201d she exclaimed, tossing her hair as she turned abruptly away from him.</p><p>Although Christmas Eve wasn\u2019t until the following day, all of Jack\u2019s sisters and at most of the husbands if not all the kids were there to meet them. Mel\u2019s sister and family had arrived ahead of them, so it was, as usual, a teeming throng. When they got inside, the women rushed to her, embracing, examining her growth, exclaiming, \u201cOh, my God, you\u2019re huge!\u201d To which Mel giggled happily, proudly letting everyone rub their hands over her belly. Joey screeched, \u201cYou\u2019re waddling like a duck!\u201d and they all crumbled into hysterical laughter, including Mel.</p><p>Jack was frowning darkly. A couple of the brothers-in-law, Dan and Ryan, came forward and said, \u201cNeed a hand unloading, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his brows drawn together.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cI said exactly those two words to her\u2014huge and waddle\u2014 and she was very pissed about it.\u201d</p><p>The men laughed. Bob clamped a hand on his shoulder. \u201cCome, my brother. Let\u2019s get you unloaded, get you a beer and teach you the facts of life. Out back, where men will be men and the women won\u2019t hear us.\u201d</p><p>Outside on the patio, now too cold for picnicking, there were a couple of large space heaters thoughtfully provided by Sam, who knew the men of the family would want their beer and cigars without interference. And where Sam also wanted to be, while his daughters overran his house and bossed people around. With Mel and Joey, there were six, not to mention granddaughters\u2014a formidable and intimidating group of women.</p><p>It was there that Jack learned from the experience of four brothers-in-law and the occasional comment from Sam, that if having children was a partners\u2019 project, pregnancy was definitely a team sport. The women were the ones who knew the rules. What a man said and what girlfriends or sisters said were viewed from entirely different perspectives. If your sister said you were huge, it was a badge of honor. If your husband said that, he thought you were fat. If your best friend said you waddled, it was adorable. If your husband said that, he thought you walked funny and he no longer found you attractive.</p><p>\u201cAnd look out,\u201d said Joey\u2019s husband, Bill, father of three, \u201cif you try to make love to her, she thinks you\u2019re a pervert, and if you don\u2019t, she\u2019ll accuse you of no longer finding her desirable as she sacrifices herself to bear your child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time we had sex, instead of crying out \u2018Oh, God, Oh, God,\u2019 she said \u2018Ugh.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Ryan spewed out a mouthful of beer and fell into a fit laughter. \u201cBeen there, brother,\u201d he finally choked out.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna know what\u2019s coming, or you wanna be surprised?\u201d Bob asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, please, I can\u2019t take any more surprises,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re coming up on where you love the baby more than her. Everything is about the baby\u2014you consider her your brood mare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for starters, never talk about breeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrovel,\u201d said someone else. \u201cBeg for forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t trip yourself up and claim she\u2019s way more important than the baby, which brings you a whole new set of problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd since you don\u2019t have the big belly and the backache, it would be advisable not to mention that this is all completely natural. She might deck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think a frickin\u2019 midwife could rise above these ridiculous notions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not her fault. There was an estrogen explosion in there\u2014it\u2019s beyond her control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be especially careful about admiring her breasts,\u201d Jeannie\u2019s husband, Dan, said. He took a pull on his cigar. \u201cEspecially since they\u2019re, you know, only temporary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s gonna be so hard. Because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Someone else laughed. \u201cAren\u2019t they great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty soon there\u2019s going to be labor and delivery,\u201d Bill said. \u201cAnd the love of your life, whose back you\u2019re trying to rub and whom you\u2019re doing everything in your power to encourage, to keep comfortable, is going to tell you to shut up and get your fucking hands off her.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed so hard at that, even Sam, that it appeared to be a universal fact.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Jack said, stunned. \u201cDid Mom ever say fuck?\u201d</p><p>Sam drew leisurely on his cigar. \u201cI think about five times,\u201d he replied, throwing the men into a new fit of laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anyone tell you these things before?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat difference would it have made, Jack? You didn\u2019t know you were about to score a pregnancy, anyway. I know, I know\u2014you thought you knew everything there was to know about women. Turns out you\u2019re just as stupid as the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>A few more jokes made the rounds before Jack said, \u201cSomeone\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>Everyone, even Joey\u2019s husband, Bill, seemed to look down. Brie\u2019s husband, almost an ex, was the only spouse not in attendance. Brie was the only sister no longer tethered; the only one without children. And she had so wanted a baby.</p><p>\u201cAnyone seen him?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d someone said, the group shaking heads as one.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe says she\u2019s fine, but she is not so fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to her sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s at the new house with the new woman, who was the old woman in Brie\u2019s life. Having a family Christmas with her and her kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile my sister, who wanted a baby, is here with us,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we have a few more and go over there?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cJust beat him up a little or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish. They\u2019d all secretly love that, and we\u2019d be grounded for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t any of us stand up to those women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d said at least three men in unison.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Jack said, for the millionth time.</p><p>\u201cJack, have you asked yourself, what if you\u2019d been married to someone else when Mel came along? What would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all asked ourselves that,\u201d Ryan said dismally.</p><p>Jack had asked himself, though it was an unfathomable idea. There had been lots of women, yet no one before Mel. He\u2019d been really fond of a few, yet somehow managed to not marry anyone. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019d do the right thing and just kill myself.\u201d He looked at the boys. \u201cShe getting out of this okay? Like with the house and stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Don\u2019t ask that,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t tell me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting the house,\u201d Bob said. \u201cShe\u2019s buying him out. And paying him alimony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were told not to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an attorney, he\u2019s a cop. She\u2019s making the most money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee\u2014we need to go over there, beat him up.\u201d</p><p>Christmas Eve they had ham and potatoes au gratin while Christmas Day it would be stuffed turkey. The clan started to gather at about four and the house throbbed with noise and laughter. They ate, drank, gathered in the family room, stuffed themselves into the family room, and sang carols. The men sang too loudly and off key and the women, to the last one, had to drive home. Mel and Joey steered their husbands to their beds, where they flopped down and would surely live to regret having beer, drinks and then brandies and cigars. The only thing that annoyed Mel more than Jack drinking too much on Christmas Eve was that he couldn\u2019t stand up long enough to shower off the smell of illegal Cubans. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>The kids were tucked in and the men were asleep, to put it politely. Joey was in her pajamas and Mel was in a soft and roomy sweat suit. They met in the family room. Mel brought the quilt and pillows out from her bedroom and they huddled on the couch together, eating ice cream and talking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeling well, except for the heartburn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty wonderful,\u201d Mel said. \u201cFor someone who has an entire gymboree inside of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd things in Virgin River are great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Joey, you should see Preacher and Paige\u2014I\u2019ve never seen a transformation like that in my life. They are so in love, there\u2019s practically a halo around them both. When they look at each other, there\u2019s steam.\u201d</p><p>There was a sound that caused both women to lean forward on the couch and look toward the front door as it opened. Brie came in. She was wearing her coat, her purse slung over her shoulder, tear stains on her cheeks. She stood in front of them and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go home. Alone. On Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby,\u201d Mel said, opening her arms.</p> <p>Mel and Joey instinctively slid apart so that Brie could sit between them. Brie dropped her purse, shed her coat, kicked off her shoes and climbed onto the couch in that little space they provided. And cried.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t gotten people through divorces,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like when the man you love, a man who\u2019s leaving you, asks you to be his friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, what nerve!\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s worse? I hate him for what he\u2019s done\u2014and I still can\u2019t stop wanting him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Brie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he came to me tonight and said, \u2018I\u2019ve made a terrible mistake,\u2019I think I\u2019d forgive him. Do you know he\u2019s asked me for alimony? That he\u2019s going to spend on her and her kids? She\u2019s getting alimony and child support from her husband, and I\u2019m paying them, too, and they both have good jobs. They\u2019re going to make money on the deal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe bastard...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t wait to start hating him for that. But I\u2019m so afraid I\u2019ll start hating him, which closes the door on letting him back. I want him back,\u201d she wept. \u201cI think I still love the son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Mel and Joey put arms around her and held her as she cried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Brie said. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas. And I bet this is the first really good Christmas you\u2019ve had in a while, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe rejoice together. We share our pain. You\u2019re staying right here with us. We\u2019re sleeping on the couch tonight, anyway. I bet it pulls out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you sleeping on the couch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur drunk husbands stink,\u201d Joey said.</p><p>Fourteen</p> <p>Jack rolled over early Christmas morning with a loud moan and a splitting head, and some memory of learning the facts of pregnant women over far too much alcohol. Or was that the previous night? He wasn\u2019t sure. There might have been inappropriate joking in the presence of the women, but he hoped they\u2019d all been too drunk for that. His mouth tasted vaguely like a kitty litter box. He opened one bloodshot eye and saw that the bed beside him was empty. \u201cOh-oh,\u201d he said. The sudden knowledge that the only man in the Sheridan family not in trouble would be Sam did not comfort him much.</p><p>He dragged himself out of bed and looked at the clock\u20146:00 a.m. There was time to mend his fences before the masses descended on them again, but he would first have to find his wife. He hoped she was still in Sacramento.</p><p>He rinsed his mouth and ran a brush over hair that was spiking every which way. The only thought he had was that he really hoped his lousy brothers-in-law were all in worse trouble than he undoubtedly was. Because surely they had done this to him. Bad influences, to the last.</p><p>He still had on last night\u2019s trousers. Not a good sign. However, she had not killed him in his sleep\u2014and that was a good sign. She was probably saving his execution for later, when he could feel it. He stood up straight in front of the mirror. He stuck out his hairy chest. He flexed, popping out tattooed biceps. I am a marine, he said to himself. She is five foot three. He sagged visibly. Who am I kidding? was his next thought.</p><p>He crept out of the bedroom into a silent house. Ah, there they were. Mel, Brie and Joey, on the sofa bed. Brie? Well, he\u2019d find out about that later. He knelt on Mel\u2019s side and gently moved her hair away from her eyes. One eye opened and there was not a smile in it. \u201cBaby, are you pissed?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I might\u2019ve had one too many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I hope you\u2019re in agony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying not to sleep in an ashtray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Brie doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I going to be punished?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. And she closed her eye.</p><p>It turned out that the great lover, Jack Sheridan, didn\u2019t know his way around women nearly so well as he thought. He decided to shower and dress, in an attempt to get some points for effort. That accomplished, he crept quietly to the kitchen to make coffee and take aspirin. He was in no condition to fight; he had a hangover. And within a few hours there would be that huge gang of people back at the house, tearing into presents, yelling, laughing, making his head want to explode.</p><p>Sam met him there. \u201cGonna be fun today,\u201d he said. \u201cYou boys, you sure know how get the women all spooled up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it. Want me to help you get the bird ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we should do that. Then we make brunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with brunch,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you notice Brie is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed that,\u201d Sam said. \u201cAnd I noticed that so far, two of the five married women in this family did not spend the night in bed with their husbands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, save it. Since I\u2019m going to get it later, I don\u2019t need your two cents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, son,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you get in really deep, maybe you can take her back to my office and show her all your medals, tell her how you\u2019ve barely escaped death a dozen times and she just doesn\u2019t scare you.\u201d</p><p>Jack glared at his father. Sam laughed, having far too much fun with this. Then Jack got busy cooking. He saut\u00e9ed onion and celery in butter, washed the turkey, mixed the stuffing, peeled the potatoes. He had noticed that when Mel saw him doing domestic things, it softened her.</p><p>Brie was the next one in the kitchen, cozy in one of Mel\u2019s long flannel nightgowns\u2014the kind she used when she\u2019d be around other people in her nightwear because at home, with Jack, his body heat was so intense, she could hardly bear to wear anything at all. Brie put her arms around Sam and said, \u201cMorning, Daddy. I just couldn\u2019t go home last night.\u201d</p><p>It tore at Jack\u2019s heart and he wanted to kill Brad. Wanted to put his arms around Brie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you were here, honey,\u201d Sam said. \u201cYou know this is always your house. Stay tonight, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said, burying her face in his chest as he held her.</p><p>Next came Mel. She was still in last night\u2019s sweat suit. But when she walked sleepily into the kitchen, she walked right into Jack\u2019s arms and he must have breathed an audible sigh of relief because she whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re still going to be punished. But not on Christmas.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed the top of her head because here was something he thought he knew about women for sure\u2014if there was any kind of delay in the execution, they tended to lose interest. If she wasn\u2019t mad enough to go after him right now, she wasn\u2019t mad enough.</p><p>Christmas in Virgin River was a much quieter affair. For the first time since opening, the bar was closed for the day. Christopher had his gifts in the morning, which left him with plenty to occupy him throughout the day. Preacher turned out a delicious roast duck and all the trimmings while Paige worked on pies. Mike showed up at five with gifts\u2014books for Christopher, a green cashmere sweater for Paige the color of her eyes, and for Preacher, specialty items for the kitchen purchased at Williams-Sonoma. \u201cThis is great!\u201d Preacher said with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what some of that stuff is,\u201d Mike said. \u201cBut it\u2019s guaranteed for someone who loves to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see, we have a mandoline, a thermostatic tray\u2014Jesus, this stuff is incredible. A gravy separator, which I don\u2019t really need \u2019cause my gravy is perfect. A grip-and-flip spatula, scoop-and-strain ladle, micro grater. Good work, Mike,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>As they were sitting down to dinner, Paige came into the bar wearing her new sweater and, Mike noticed, dangling in the V of the neck, a very beautiful diamond pendant necklace. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201csomeone had a very nice Christmas.\u201d</p><p>She touched the necklace, a huge and lovely surprise from her man. Who knew Preacher could buy jewelry? Who knew Preacher knew what jewelry was! \u201cI feel badly, Mike. We had nothing for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing here with you three is Christmas enough for me,\u201d he said, meaning it.</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to your family today?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah\u2014about a hundred of them. All at Mom and Dad\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Preacher set about carving the duck. \u201cYou don\u2019t miss being there, with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said. \u201cNot until I get a little something back, you know? I need the space. They\u2019re Latino and Latina\u2014very demonstrative. Close. Intense, you know? Anxious and annoyingly well meaning. I want to at least be able to cut my meat with my right hand before I visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cYou watch. You\u2019ll have it in no time.\u201d</p><p>After dinner Paige left the men to a game of cribbage in front of the fire while she cleaned up. A little while later Christopher was downstairs, all scrubbed with one of his old books in his hand. He crawled up into Preacher\u2019s lap as if he\u2019d been doing it since he started walking. And Preacher drew him up like a father would. \u201cThis the one you want?\u201d he asked Christopher.</p><p>\u201cHorton,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to try a new one? We read Horton every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMazy the lazy bird...\u201d Christopher pointed out.</p><p>Mike turned his chair toward the hearth and put his feet up, enjoying the sound of Preacher\u2019s voice telling the story by heart, Christopher adding lines that Preacher deliberately left out just for fun. My man Preacher, he was thinking\u2014all soft and sweet, his voice rough and gravelly as sandpaper, holding a kid on his lap like he\u2019d been doing it all his life. This was a guy who you didn\u2019t want to see coming at you with a scowl on his face and his fists up. A picture of him in fatigues, toting an M16, a snarl on his face...The guy could take down a whole army. Mike looked at him now with new eyes. Transformed into a big, cuddly bear. Committed. Devoted. All in.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before he stopped reading, dropped a kiss on the head of his sleeping boy and said to Mike, \u201cPour us a little something. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Mike picked out the whiskey Preacher seemed to favor\u2014a nice mild Canadian\u2014and brought the bottle and two glasses to the table. When Christopher was tucked in and Preacher back, Mike lifted his glass to Preacher. \u201cTo you, old man. I think maybe you have it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to drink to that,\u201d he said, sitting down. \u201cThing is\u2014I really am going to have it all. When all that crap with Lassiter is settled and behind her some more, we\u2019re going to talk about making a lifetime commitment. And children. More children, you know, because we already have a perfect family.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cMan, I never thought this would happen to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Mike was shocked at first, but recovered quickly. \u201cWell, hey,\u201d he said. \u201cCongratulations. I guess everything worked out like it was supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d Preacher said before he could stop himself.</p> <p>Mike chuckled. Good for him, he thought. It\u2019s not as though Preacher hadn\u2019t waited long enough to find this kind of happiness. \u201cShe\u2019s a great girl, Preacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen how good that kid is?\u201d Preacher asked. \u201cBecause she is just an awesome mother, that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019ll be an awesome wife, too,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cWe have a few issues to work out. That business with her ex\u2014it\u2019s still pretty ripe,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>Mike sat forward. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s called here. He\u2019s not supposed to, but he\u2019s called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell anyone about that?\u201d Mike asked, sitting up straighter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we got in touch with her lawyer, who will get in touch with the judge. She didn\u2019t talk to him, but I had to tell her. I\u2019m not going to be keeping things back from Paige. He called a few times, thinking she\u2019d talk to him. He wants to know if anything can be worked out, if he can at least have Chris for weekends or something. Jesus, man\u2014I\u2019d be scared to death of that. I can\u2019t imagine that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige doing okay?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cStirred her up pretty good, but she never caved. The woman is brave. I see it grow, more every day. She refused to get sucked in, even if it did make her shake a little bit. But I gotta tell you\u2014I\u2019d be tempted to take Paige and Chris and run for it if there was any chance the court would turn him over to that brutal lunatic.\u201d He took a sip of his drink and said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t let that happen. I have to do better by Paige and Chris than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI sure understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah? You do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. You have to take care of your woman. Your family. Whatever that takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight after Christmas gets handled, we\u2019re going to call Brie. She knows everything about this kind of monster. And, she knows everyone in California. She\u2019ll have advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Mike agreed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cYou know, I never figured myself for a family man. I thought I\u2019d be fishing and cooking it up for the other fishermen in this little bar for the rest of my life. There aren\u2019t any women around here, not to speak of. What are the chances some woman wanders in here and needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe more than needs you,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed. \u201cShe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Jack,\u201d Mike said with a bit of a laugh. The two most unlikely candidates for domestic bliss Mike could think of. Jack, because he\u2019d always had a woman somewhere, but never one that held his interest long enough for any kind of commitment. Jack used to say, \u201cMe? Marriage? I highly doubt it\u2019s possible.\u201d And then Preacher, who seemed not to notice women existed.</p> <p>\u201cJack,\u201d Preacher said, shaking his head. \u201cYou shoulda been here for that,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cOur Jack\u2014Jesus, I hate to think the number of women he ran through, never lost a minute of sleep.\u201d Preacher looked over at Mike, grinning. \u201cTook Mel about thirty seconds to turn him into a big pile of quivering mush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Mike said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cThen it got fun,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t having any of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute\u2014I was up here last year to fish with the boys. Looked to me like he had a lock on her. Next thing I hear, she\u2019s pregnant and he\u2019s going to marry her. I figured he finally ran into one that could trip him up.\u201d</p><p>Preacher whistled. \u201cNah, it didn\u2019t go down like that. Jack went after her like a bobcat goes after a hen, and she just kept dodging him. He rebuilt her whole cabin for her without being asked, and I think maybe it got him kissed. Sometimes she\u2019d come in the bar for a beer and he\u2019d light up like a frickin\u2019 Christmas tree. And she\u2019d leave and he\u2019d head for the shower. Poor bastard. He was after her for months. I guess no one ever said no before.\u201d</p><p>They used to all say yes to me, too, Mike thought.</p><p>\u201cNow when you look at \u2019em, it looks like they\u2019ve been together since they were kids,\u201d Preacher said. Then more softly, \u201cAnd that\u2019s how I feel with Paige. Like she\u2019s been in my life forever.\u201d</p><p>Mike thought about that for a moment and then said, \u201cGood for you, man.\u201d Mike finished his drink and stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going to let you get back to your girl. I\u2019ll make it an early night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure, man? Because I think Paige is busy putting away Christopher\u2019s gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to head back out to the cabin. Hey, dinner was fantastic. One of your best ever.\u201d He carefully stretched out his back, then his arm. \u201cI\u2019ll see you sometime tomorrow, I guess. Thanks for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Funny the way things work out, Mike thought. Jack and Preacher, two men who thought they\u2019d never hook up, totally down for the count. Their women had them both in the palms of their pretty little hands.</p><p>Now Mike, he thought he\u2019d hook up. Actually, he thought it would be automatic, which probably led him into marriage without him giving it enough serious thought. All his brothers had fat, happy wives and lots of kids. His sisters had made good marriages for themselves, added to the grandchildren. But he\u2019d screwed up his marriages, thanks to that good old Latino prowess, that itch that has to be scratched real quick, without thinking about the consequences. Well, that was no longer an issue.</p><p>But he watched Jack and Preacher and had to wonder about how good it would feel to have someone in his life he\u2019d die for. Damn, what a buzz that would be. He\u2019d never felt that way about a woman.</p><p>He was glad, in a way, that it hadn\u2019t found him. He\u2019d hate to have a beautiful, sexy, devoted wife in his bed and leave her wanting. So\u2014the bullets had decided. He\u2019d be on his own from now on. One thing he had discovered, it was a little easier to be alone here than a lot of other places. There were loyal friends and the air was real good. If he kept at it, kept working and practicing, he\u2019d be able to fish and shoot just fine with the left arm and hand.</p><p>When Jack was driving back to Virgin River, he got off the road right before they got to town. \u201cAren\u2019t we going home?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cOne quick stop,\u201d he said. Then he pulled onto that bumpy, narrow road that went up and up until it opened into a clearing with a view that went for miles.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He reached in front of her and opened the glove box, pulling out a thick document. He handed it to her. \u201cMerry Christmas, Mel. It\u2019s ours. I\u2019m going to build you a house right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, a little breathless. \u201cOh, God,\u201d she cried, tears coming to her eyes. \u201cHow\u2019d you convince them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was easy. I told them it was for you. Do you have any idea how much this town loves you?\u201d</p><p>This was what she\u2019d dreamed of when she decided to come here\u2014good country people who would appreciate her help. \u201cThey all mean an awful lot to me, too. Then there\u2019s you...\u201d</p><p>They sat in the truck for a long time, just looking out over the land, talking about the house. \u201cA great room with a fireplace, a kitchen so big that your entire family can gather in it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cA soundproof master bedroom,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd master bath with two closets and two sinks,\u201d she supplied.</p><p>\u201cThree bedrooms in addition to ours, and maybe a guest house\u2014a one-room guest house with a refrigerator in it, and a roomy bath. In case my father, you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case your father what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEver needs a place with us. In his old age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t he want to be with one of your sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I think he\u2019s been trying to get away from them for years now.\u201d Jack laughed. \u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed how bossy they are? No, you wouldn\u2019t notice because\u2014\u201d He stopped suddenly and she threw him a look. He thought, What am I? Suicidal? \u201cBecause you all get along so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice save,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you need all those bedrooms for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cEmma might be having company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in siblings? Jack, we weren\u2019t supposed to get this one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And yet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll never happen again,\u201d she said. But she shivered.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. Sometimes when I think about that night...That first night...You know, I think she was conceived the second you touched me.\u201d</p><p>He was sure that was accurate. \u201cThus, the bedrooms,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be no dead animals on the walls of my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone!\u201d</p><p>Jack and Mel immediately labored over a floor plan and rendering that they could send to Joe Benson, the Marine architect in Grants Pass, Oregon. After Joe\u2019s first tour in the Corps, he went into the reserves, got his degree and started his business, but then was called up for Iraq, where he served with the others under Jack. He was thrilled to be asked to draw up their plans. In January, the initial plans were complete and Joe brought them down to Virgin River. When he walked into the bar, Mel was there with Jack. Joe had the plans rolled up under one arm and Mel jumped up with an excited gasp.</p><p>Joe stood right inside the door, a smile growing on his lips and a wonderful warmth lighting his eyes as he looked her up and down. \u201cOh, honey,\u201d he said in a breath. \u201cLook at you. You\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Mel laughed. These guys, she thought. To the last one, they loved pregnant women. It was very amazing, very sexy. No one could better appreciate that kind of man than a midwife.</p><p>He dropped the plans on a table and moved toward her with his hands stretched out, tentative.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d she said.</p><p>His hands were on her belly in no time. \u201cAh, Mel.\u201d Then he pulled her into his arms to give her a hug. \u201cRipe and ready,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right back here,\u201d Jack said from behind the bar.</p><p>Joe laughed. \u201cBe right with you, buddy. I have my hands full of woman right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said. \u201cMy woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need your own woman,\u201d Mel said. Another one who was, like her husband, a big, handsome man, an angel of a man, and though he was surely over thirty-five, completely unattached.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. He touched her nose. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you find me one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right on it,\u201d she said, pulling out of his arms and grabbing the rolled-up plans from the table.</p><p>They looked them over together, then Jack and Joe went out to the property to walk it. Before pounding in stakes or painting an outline on the ground, Mel and Jack would take at least a couple of weeks to consider changes. Joe stayed over one night, Grants Pass being a four-to six-hour drive, and had a nice evening with Preacher, Paige and Mike.</p><p>The plans tended to stay at the bar. Every time someone who was interested in their house came in, they asked to see the plans. Doc Mullins said, \u201cLot of wasted space in that kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like a big kitchen,\u201d Mel said. Though for what, she was uncertain, since Jack seemed to do most of the cooking when they were at home and they took the majority of their meals at the bar. \u201cJack likes a big kitchen,\u201d she amended.</p><p>\u201cThat Jack,\u201d Connie said. \u201cYou sure have him trained.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI found him trained,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cLove this bathroom,\u201d Connie said. \u201cWhat I\u2019d give for a bathroom like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll I need in a bathroom is a hole in the floor,\u201d Ron said.</p><p>Jack and Mel spent a lot of their time together looking at the plans, people looking over their shoulders. One morning Mel came into the bar to have coffee with Jack, who was out splitting logs. Preacher and Harv were found poring over the drawings by themselves.</p><p>Mel backed out of the bar and went around back to find Jack. He stopped what he was doing as she approached.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what\u2019s going on in there? Preacher and Harv have our plans spread out and are going over them. Our house has become a community project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Don\u2019t let it worry you. We\u2019re going to do what we want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut does it bother you that everyone has an opinion? That usually disagrees with our ideas?\u201d</p><p>He grinned proudly. \u201cI hired excavation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey start the first week in February. They\u2019ll clear and level the land, widen the road. I\u2019m having them clean and stack the trees for firewood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack? Not even fish. No dead animals.\u201d</p><p>Rick was cleaning out the ice machine under the bar, whistling. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re doing better these days,\u201d Preacher observed.</p> <p>Rick stood up. \u201cYeah, things are a little better. Probably thanks to Jack having a sit-down with Connie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a couple of things ironed out,\u201d he said. \u201cLizzie\u2019s staying with me. I gotta have her close, Preach. Keep her reassured, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course. You gotta keep an eye on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re spending nights with my grandma\u2014I think it makes her feel good to have people there. And my grandma has always said that house will be mine someday, anyway. Not a lot of room there,\u201d he said with a shrug, \u201cbut enough for now. We have a little crib in the room and a couple of things for the baby. Lizzie is helping out at the store during the day. She\u2019s taking a leave from school for a little while. She didn\u2019t go back after Christmas break and she\u2019s a lot happier. Lots calmer. The baby will be here in a couple of months, then she\u2019ll need some time with him. She\u2019ll get a little behind, but I\u2019ll graduate on time. Then we\u2019ll work on her diploma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlanning to keep that baby?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do anything else, man. It\u2019s not going to be easy. I\u2019ll take care of the baby while she\u2019s at school, and when she gets home in the afternoon, I can come in to work till eight, nine, whatever. We\u2019re not going to try to get married till we have a year or two together. And get a little bit older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought about college?\u201d</p> <p>Rick laughed. \u201cNot for a few months now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing at a time, bud. You have a family to think about. Then, there\u2019s always community college when Liz is in high school. All I\u2019m saying is, these things don\u2019t have to come in a hurry. No point in taking on things that will only tip you over the edge. You\u2019re only seventeen\u2014there\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what Jack said....\u201d</p><p>Preacher grinned. \u201cDid he, now.\u201d He and Jack had talked about this. A lot.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Rick said, shaking his head. \u201cYou guys. You\u2019re the best friends I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you, pal. You just have to never panic. Things can fall into place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s right,\u201d Rick said.</p><p>\u201cSure that\u2019s right. You\u2019re doing fine, kid. Give yourself a little credit. You make us old boys real proud.\u201d</p><p>Mel went to the bar in the afternoon, looking for Jack. Preacher told her he was out at their property, shooting with Mike. \u201cWhere\u2019s Paige?\u201d Mel asked, looking around.</p><p>\u201cLying down with Chris, I think. She took him up for a nap and said she might.\u201d</p><p>Mel looked at her watch. She had twenty-five minutes to kill before her next appointment and had been looking for an opportunity just like this. She jumped up on a stool facing Preacher. \u201cPaige seems very happy,\u201d she said.</p><p>The look that came over Preacher\u2019s face was wistful. Angelic. \u201cShe does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt blows my mind.\u201d</p><p>Mel couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cCould I have a ginger ale?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about something....\u201d</p><p>He poured her a drink, put it on a napkin in front of her. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember that time several months ago, after the boys were up to fish and play poker, Jack had that meltdown. Got tanked, passed out, had to be carried to bed. You said sometimes the past snuck up like that and it would take him a while to get his stability back.\u201d Preacher gave a single nod, frowning slightly. \u201cSo\u2014you know what that was, right? I\u2019m sure if you served in combat, the Marine Corps talked about it some.\u201d He just looked at her. \u201cPost-traumatic stress disorder. PTSD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he been having trouble with that?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s been good. I watch, though. I want to tell you a story. A short one. I had a friend back in L.A., in the hospital where I worked. She was an administrator, older than me. A brilliant woman. When I knew her she\u2019d been in her second marriage for twenty years. One night over a glass of wine she told me that her first marriage, a brief marriage, had been extremely abusive. She got beat to a pulp regularly. And while her second marriage was totally kind and loving, sometimes she\u2019d see an expression on her husband\u2019s face or he\u2019d have a tone of voice\u2014completely innocent for him\u2014yet it would conjure something from her previous life with her ex-husband and there\u2019d be a rush of emotions\u2014fear, anger. Terror. It would put her in a funk, depress her, really challenge her ability to cope. She said it was as if her nervous system was programmed to react a certain way, which had helped her to survive the first marriage. But she felt bad about the way her reaction would make her second husband feel. Like he\u2019d done something wrong, when really, the wrongdoing was ages ago.\u201d</p><p>Preacher looked down. \u201cYou mean I could remind her of that shitbag somehow?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really, no,\u201d Mel said. \u201cIt\u2019s way more subtle than that. Something harmless and innocent \u2018suggests\u2019 that earlier time...because...\u201d Mel\u2019s explanation trailed off.</p><p>After a moment of silence, \u201cI can get that,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a war veteran hearing fireworks and suddenly feeling like he\u2019s back in a firefight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the thing about shame. My friend, she told me that sometimes she would be chased by it. It\u2019s hard to understand why a woman who has done nothing wrong and has been abused would ever feel shame\u2014it\u2019s the shame of letting herself get into that situation, at not getting out faster, shame at having let it happen. It\u2019s not a right or wrong thing, it just is. We can\u2019t judge feelings. John, I wanted you to know about this. In case you run into it.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a minute. Finally he said, \u201cIs there something special I should do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cIf you sense a chronic problem, behavior you can\u2019t understand or explain, think about support counseling. Maybe none of this will happen with Paige. I\u2019m only telling you because it can. It might. You should be in the know. I think you do the things that come naturally\u2014be loving. Forgiving. Patient. Understanding. That night with Jack? I held him in my arms and told him it was all right.\u201d</p><p>Again he was quiet for a minute. \u201cThat woman, your friend. Those times her husband did something...Did she stop loving him? Even for a little while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Never had anything to do with love. Plus, he saved her life, loving her in a pure way like that. It had to do with being hurt real bad once. A little time, a reality check on her part, a solid partner...She could always manage to get back on track. Kind of like Jack. Lucky to have good people around. Lucky to be safe.\u201d</p><p>He smiled a small smile.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever sense something is wrong, don\u2019t be too private about it. Let me help you with it. I know a couple of things about this.\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cI have a patient due. I have to go. I just wanted to talk to you about that. You take it easy,\u201d she said. She jumped off the stool.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Wes Lassiter didn\u2019t have to go to court. A plea agreement was reached by the prosecutor and the attorney for the defense, and it did not give Paige any peace of mind. The judge was disappointed in Lassiter for breaching the conditions of his bail by phoning Paige and trying to leverage her, but in the end he sentenced the man to forty-five days in jail, five years of probation, and two thousand hours of community service. Also required, a meeting at Addicts Anonymous every day, the order of protection was enforced and the custody agreement upheld. And he immediately went to jail.</p><p>\u201cI know it doesn\u2019t feel like it, but you\u2019re winning,\u201d Brie told Paige over the phone. \u201cHe\u2019s been compromised\u2014he\u2019s not getting away with anything. Even though the jail sentence is short, it might be enough to modify his behavior. Jail is ugly. Mean and dangerous. And the scuttlebutt is that he has to liquidate to pay his lawyer, which means you\u2019ll be getting your divorce settlement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about that. I don\u2019t care about money. I just want to be safe from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Brie said. \u201cBut in the grand scheme of things, forty-five days with the threat of the judge going bonkers and sentencing him to ten years if he screws up is better than three to five. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it feel that way?\u201d Paige asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re scared,\u201d Brie said. \u201cI would be, too. But this is good. No one\u2019s letting him off. And the chance of him calling or approaching you in that five years of probation and getting hammered for it\u2014that\u2019s a strong deterrent. During that five years, he could actually move on. I don\u2019t hold much hope of him becoming a different kind of human being, but, God help me, he might find a new target. Oh, God really help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s encouraging, or the worst thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Brie said. \u201cSo it goes in our business.\u201d</p><p>Paige was notified that the house was listed for sale, and that her signature was required. Her lawyer sent her papers regarding the liquidation of 401Ks and retirement accounts. The closed checking and money-market accounts were accounted for, as well as the charge accounts and mortgage balances.</p><p>In a quiet moment, Preacher asked her, \u201cAre you worried about money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m worried about never being free of him. I don\u2019t want to be afraid anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I can do about that, besides promising to do everything I can to keep you safe. But, it looks like you\u2019re going to get a few bucks here\u2014maybe something you can put away for emergencies. The being afraid part, we\u2019ll have to take it as we go. I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will, John. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stuck with this basket case who\u2019s afraid of her own shadow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stuck,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt stuck. I live a real simple life, Paige. I\u2019ve never really worried too much about money. Maybe we should talk about that a little bit. Money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we not?\u201d she asked. \u201cMoney and things\u2014it was so important to Wes. It drove him mad, trying to be rich, to have a lot, to look like he was successful. It leaves such a bad taste in my mouth that if a check comes in the mail, I might not even be able to cash it!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to think that if you and Chris are my family, you\u2019d have to worry about your future. His future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I look at the difference between my life then and now, I feel richer now. I have everything I need. Chris and I\u2014we\u2019re so much better off.\u201d</p> <p>Preacher decided to let the matter rest, at least for the time being. He\u2019d never talked to anyone about money. He and his mom had been pretty much lower middle class, maybe poor. They lived in a two-bedroom cinder-block house with a cyclone fence around the yard and roof that wasn\u2019t dependable. There weren\u2019t any sidewalks or streetlights on their block. She kept it real nice, but he couldn\u2019t remember a stick of new furniture in his lifetime. When she died, there was a policy paying off the little house plus a life insurance benefit and a small pension through the church. It was a small piece of suburban Cincinnati real estate in a declining neighborhood plus a modest amount of cash. He was only seventeen and didn\u2019t care about what a sale might bring\u2014he wanted his mom, their home together.</p><p>When he went into the Marines, he had to let it go, had to realize he\u2019d never have that life back. It was a hundred and forty thousand dollars in total, a fortune for an eighteen-year-old kid with no family but the band of brothers he signed on with. He\u2019d felt a little like Paige\u2014like he couldn\u2019t even cash the check. So he did the next best thing. He put it in a safe place\u2014a CD. A few years later he put it somewhere else\u2014a mutual fund. Since he had no attachment to it and it meant so little to him, it caused him no stress at all to move it around a little, here and there. He had his first computer by then\u2014and he was looking things up, his favorite pastime next to fishing, shooting, reading military history. He learned a little about investing on the computer, then began doing some online. In fourteen years his investments had grown considerably\u2014they approached nine hundred thousand dollars.</p><p>The only pleasure Preacher had ever gotten from his nest egg was watching the balance grow\u2014he had no use for it. But now he had a boy who\u2019d be going to college in fifteen or so years. With any luck there\u2019d be more kids needing college. He could keep going\u2014investing and reinvesting\u2014but it occurred to him to stuff a couple hundred thousand in bonds, which were safe, so that by the time it was needed, it would be handy.</p><p>Later, when the time was right, he\u2019d tell Paige that if she couldn\u2019t cash that check from her divorce settlement, it couldn\u2019t matter less. She really did have everything she needed. She just didn\u2019t know it yet.</p><p>Mel\u2019s mind might have been wandering a little\u2014pregnant women were known for that sort of thing. She was in Clear River where she\u2019d been gassing up the Hummer, and while stopped at the only light in town, it turned green and she didn\u2019t move. By the time she looked up to see that it had changed, there was a loud bang and a jolt; the Hummer was pushed into the intersection. When she got out of the vehicle, a hand pressed to her back and her stomach protruding like Mount Kilimanjaro, the man in the pickup truck who\u2019d rear-ended her went completely pale. She recognized that man\u2014he wore the shady brady on his head, and he had all but kidnapped her to deliver a baby in an illegal grow in a trailer a few months ago.</p> <p>Mel looked at the bumper of the Hummer. One side was smashed in pretty good.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, a panicked look skittering across his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus, I really don\u2019t want to have to deal with your husband on this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have insurance. I have a license. I have whatever you need. Just say you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit tight,\u201d she said. \u201cTry not to go nuts on me. Don\u2019t flee the scene or anything really stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said nervously. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>There were no local police in Clear River, so Mel walked back to the gas station and called the California Highway Patrol. She called Jack, assured him she was just fine, knowing that wouldn\u2019t cut any grass with him and he\u2019d be flying across the mountain.</p><p>About thirty minutes later CHP responded, pulling into the intersection, the car lit up to keep the traffic away from the accident. When the patrolman stepped out of his car, he found Mel sitting in the passenger seat of the Hummer, door open and feet in the street, listening to her belly with a fetoscope. He frowned down on Mel\u2019s big belly. \u201cOh, boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, rubbing a hand over her belly. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. You\u2019re awful pregnant,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidwife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess you know what you need,\u201d he said.</p><p>Right at that moment, Jack\u2019s truck came screeching into the intersection and he was out and striding toward them. Mel looked up at the officer. \u201cWell, that\u2019s probably going to be irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>Jack took one look at his old friend in the shady brady and got himself all stirred up. The jaw pulse ticked, his complexion went dark and angry. She put a hand on his arm. \u201cI know it\u2019s technically his fault, but the light had changed and I didn\u2019t go. So try to leave your personal feelings out of this and let the cop do his job.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at the cop collecting the man\u2019s data and said, \u201cIt might be real hard for me to not get personal here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d Mel said. \u201cLet\u2019s shoot for rational.\u201d</p><p>Forty minutes later, she was lying on the exam table in Grace Valley, the ultrasound bleeping beside her. Jack was nearly distraught, but no one else was particularly worried. John said it wouldn\u2019t hurt to check, make sure everything was all right. Clearly the baby was not traumatized; she was bouncing around like a gymnast. June Hudson and Susan Stone were peering over Mel\u2019s big belly, looking at the baby on the monitor while John moved the wand around. Then John said, \u201cWell, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d John\u2019s wife said.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen very often,\u201d June said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack said. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have all these pink things! From Christmas!\u201d Mel shrieked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack said. \u201cWhat the hell is it? Is the baby all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby\u2019s fine,\u201d John said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t Emma, that\u2019s for sure. Look\u2014femur, femur, penis. I blew it. And I\u2019m so damn good, I can\u2019t imagine how that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was probably just on the early side,\u201d June said. \u201cWe should\u2019ve done another one at twenty weeks to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m so damn good,\u201d John insisted.</p><p>\u201cPenis?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Mel looked up into his eyes and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to come up with another name.\u201d</p><p>Jack had a dumb look on his face. Mel didn\u2019t recall having seen that look before. \u201cMan,\u201d he said in a breath. \u201cI might not know what to do with a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we got that news just in time,\u201d June said, leaving the exam room.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right before the shower,\u201d Susan added, following her.</p><p>\u201cI really thought I had it nailed,\u201d John said. \u201cI feel betrayed, in a way.\u201d</p><p>Mel looked up into her husband\u2019s eyes and watched as a slow, powerful grin appeared. \u201cWhat are you thinking, Jack?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cThat I can\u2019t wait to call my brothers-in-law, the slackers.\u201d</p><p>Mel was ready to leave Doc\u2019s for the day, to walk across the street and have dinner with her husband, when Connie came in assisting Liz to the front door. Connie had a hand under Liz\u2019s elbow while Liz was gripping her belly. A dark fluid stain ran down her jeans from between her legs and she was crying. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d she wailed. \u201cIt hurts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey,\u201d Mel said, coming forward and taking the other hand. \u201cLet\u2019s see what\u2019s going on. When did you see Dr. Stone last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of weeks ago. Oohh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she in labor?\u201d Connie asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. We\u2019ll know in a minute. Come into the exam room and let me check you. Then we\u2019ll see if you should go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Mel and Connie helped Liz undress, peeling off the wet jeans and helping her into a gown so she could get onto the exam table. \u201cI\u2019ll take it from here,\u201d Mel told Connie. \u201cI want to see where we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Rick,\u201d Liz cried. \u201cPlease, Aunt Connie! Please! I need him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, honey.\u201d Connie left the room, pulling the door closed behind her. Mel applied her fetoscope to Liz\u2019s belly, though Liz writhed. She waited for the contraction to pass, but it was a long, hard one. Finally her uterus relaxed, not that it gave Liz much relief.</p><p>Liz\u2019s cries became quieter and Mel worked hard at listening, moving the fetoscope all around. Then she hung it around her neck and pulled out the Doptone, a fetal heartbeat monitor. She moved it over Liz\u2019s belly as calmly as possible, despite Liz\u2019s squirming and groaning.</p><p>\u201cIs the heartbeat okay?\u201d Liz asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to hear with the contractions right now. I\u2019ll listen again after I check your cervix.\u201d Next, she put on gloves. \u201cAll right, Liz, let me examine you. Feet in the stirrups, slide down for me. I\u2019ll be as gentle as possible. There you go. Take some slow, deep breaths.\u201d She carefully slipped her hand into the birth canal. Six centimeters. No, seven. Bloody fluid.</p><p>\u201cLiz,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s time. You\u2019re going to deliver soon.\u201d Mel tried with the Doptone again, her heart plummeting. Liz was a little early; she hadn\u2019t even started the weekly visits she would pay to John Stone during her last month. She probably hadn\u2019t had an internal exam since the one Mel gave her when she returned to Virgin River.</p><p>She got a blood pressure and listened to her heart. Normal, under the circumstances. She applied the Doptone again. \u201cHave you been having contractions long?\u201d she asked Liz.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. All day, I guess. But I didn\u2019t know what it was. It just kept getting worse and worse. It wasn\u2019t like those Braxton things. It was like a knife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey. It\u2019s okay. Have you been feeling the baby move a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just my back hurting and lots of...And a stomachache on and off. Gas, I think. Was it gas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, honey. When did you last feel the baby move?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Liz cried. \u201cIs he all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry breathing like this,\u201d she said, demonstrating a deep inhale, slow exhale. But Liz was too far into this. Mel showed her panting, short puffs of air, which seemed to work a little better. \u201cThere you go. I\u2019m going to go make sure your aunt Connie called Rick. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only be a minute. Try the breathing.\u201d</p><p>Mel left the room, pulling the door closed. \u201cConnie, did you find Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack sent him over to Garberville to pick up some beef for the bar. He should be back pretty soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon?\u201d Mel asked. It was her gut instinct to tell Liz immediately\u2014there was no heartbeat, no movement. But she was so young, vulnerable, so dependent on Rick.</p><p>\u201cMinutes, Jack said,\u201d Connie answered.</p><p>\u201cOkay, good. Liz is in labor and she\u2019s dilated. Will you please go stay with her for a couple of minutes? I should call Dr. Stone. It won\u2019t take me long.\u201d</p><p>Doc Mullins caught her in the hallway. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Mel leaned close and whispered. \u201cI have no fetal heartbeat, no movement, seven centimeters and she can\u2019t remember when she last felt the baby move.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>His white brows drew together more and more as Mel spoke. When she was done he said, \u201cGoddamn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go in there and try? Please?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour ears are a lot better than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse the Doptone and try anyway. Please,\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m going to call John. He\u2019s been seeing her.\u201d</p><p>He put his old hand on her shoulder. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have done anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but please try, Doc,\u201d she asked. But she knew he wasn\u2019t going to find anything. The fetus had expired in utero. They could try to transport her to Valley Hospital, but as advanced as her labor was, it wouldn\u2019t do any good\u2014wouldn\u2019t help the baby\u2014and she would be too far advanced in her labor by the time they got there for an epidural, so they couldn\u2019t relieve her from the pain. What Mel was focused on was getting Liz through the labor, get the baby out as quickly as possible. But first she had to call John. Thankfully, he answered the call immediately, and she explained the situation.</p><p>\u201cI saw her about two weeks ago,\u201d John said. \u201cWe were fine then. Is she preeclamptic?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Her blood pressure is okay, and it won\u2019t do any good to check her urine with blood present and I don\u2019t want to use a catheter now, with so much going on. But I\u2019m saying no\u2014I don\u2019t see any edema. She\u2019s had a bellyache, can\u2019t remember the last fetal movement and her contractions are coming on like gangbusters\u2014her uterus is working hard. She was seven a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you can do is get the baby out,\u201d John said. \u201cWant me to come up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cI can deliver for you, Mel. I hate for you to go through this, being pregnant yourself. It\u2019s traumatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get her through it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut damn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, damn,\u201d John said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cAt least this seems to be moving very quickly,\u201d she said before she hung up. Then she immediately called Jack. \u201cI need some help over here,\u201d she said. \u201cLiz is in advanced labor and I can\u2019t get her upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way,\u201d he said.</p><p>Doc came out of the exam room just as Mel was headed there. He was shaking his head sadly. All Mel could think was, Oh, God, could things get any harder for these kids? If having a baby too young wasn\u2019t difficult enough, having a baby that wasn\u2019t alive was horrific.</p><p>Hold it together, she told herself. There\u2019s going to be a lot of crying\u2014hold it together. Someone has to be strong. Someone has to get them through this.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s on his way over,\u201d she said to Doc. \u201cHe can carry her upstairs for us. Send him right in, okay?\u201d Then she went back into the exam room. \u201cLiz, I have to be straight with you\u2014this is going really fast. There isn\u2019t going to be time to get you to the hospital. We\u2019re going to take you upstairs to the bed. I\u2019ll get you through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that pain shot?\u201d she asked, already sweating profusely.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to slow you down or zone you out, honey. I can give you something when we get situated upstairs...But let\u2019s get on with it. I\u2019ll help you with the breathing. And Rick will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>Jack stepped into the room. He was too perceptive for his own good. His expression said he knew that things were not okay, even if he didn\u2019t know precisely what was wrong. Mel stepped away from the exam table and Jack leaned over Liz. \u201cCome on, sweetheart,\u201d he said tenderly. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you upstairs.\u201d As he lifted her up into his arms, the sheet that covered her slipped away, her bare bottom hanging out, but that was the least of Jack\u2019s worries. \u201cHere we go. Nice and easy.\u201d</p> <p>He carried her up the stairs to the room in which Mel had attended her very first birth in this town. Liz was writhing and crying as he gently placed her on the clean white sheets. As he pulled his arms out from under her, one of his sleeves was wet with bloody fluid. \u201cRick?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOn his way, Liz. He\u2019ll be here any second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need him with me,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cOn his way, honey,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Mel was applying the Doptone again, praying for a miracle as she did so, but there was nothing. Nothing but fierce contractions and no life inside.</p><p>\u201cDoc, stay with Liz for a minute, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Doc said. He went to her and lifted her hand into his and started to coach her. \u201cLet\u2019s try some of those panting breaths, Lizzie,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mel stepped into the hallway with Jack and Connie. Jack was rolling up his soiled sleeve as the front door to Doc\u2019s opened and Rick yelled. \u201cLiz? Mel?\u201d</p><p>Mel put a hand on Jack\u2019s arm, gesturing for him to stay. \u201cUp here, Rick,\u201d she called. He came bounding up the stairs, anxious lines etched into his young face. He was all wound up and obviously scared.</p><p>\u201cIs it too soon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Mel took one of Connie\u2019s hands, one of Rick\u2019s and said, \u201cRick, I have something to tell you, and I need you to be stronger than you\u2019ve ever been. For Liz. You\u2019re going to help us get through this.\u201d Jack stepped up behind Rick and put strong hands on his shoulders. \u201cThe baby, Rick. There\u2019s no heartbeat.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother with medical terminology. To this seventeen-year-old boy she said, \u201cHe died, Rick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, confusion wrinkling his brow. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no heartbeat. No movement. Liz is laboring and she\u2019s going to deliver him soon, and he\u2019s not going to be alive.\u201d</p><p>Connie caught it the first time and began to softly weep, her head down, her shoulders shaking. It took Rick a minute. He shook his head, trying to make it not be so. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know, Rick. I talked to Dr. Stone just a few minutes ago\u2014everything was fine when he saw her last. Liz doesn\u2019t seem to have any complications. It\u2019s been a while since she felt movement. It could have been a few hours, a few days.... These things are rare, but it happens. And we\u2019re going to have to tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he was just quiet last night. Was he...?\u201d Rick asked. \u201cLast night, when I held her, I didn\u2019t...No,\u201d he said, shaking his head. His eyes watered, though he stood straight. \u201cNo,\u201d he said again. Mel took him into her arms, this big, solid boy, a father too young, a grieving father too soon. He leaned against her, shaking his head, saying no, no, no, no, over and over. She thought it might be best if he vented a little first, before going to Liz, but then a cry came from the labor room and he raised his head sharply, as though he heard a gunshot. She could see his brave struggle to try to control his own tears.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to need you so much. It doesn\u2019t get any harder than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t. Tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to tell her. It\u2019s her baby. Can you do this with me? Because I really need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, sucking back the tears and wiping a sleeve across his nose. \u201cYeah, I think I can. Oh, God,\u201d he said, briefly losing it. \u201cI did this to her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Rick\u2014this just happened. It\u2019s cruel and it\u2019s horrible, but it isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault. We have to somehow get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we hurry up and take her to the hospital?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It wouldn\u2019t help anything. Come on, let\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never know how much I wish I was wrong. Come with me. She\u2019s getting closer and she has to know.\u201d She took his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be there for her.\u201d She pulled him into the room and, as they entered, Doc left, leaving Mel to do her job.</p><p>\u201cRick,\u201d Liz cried, reaching for him. She was bathed in sweat, her hair damp and her features twisted.</p><p>Rick rushed to her and took her into his arms, holding her against him, silent tears running down his cheeks. Liz was gripped by too much pain to wonder what was wrong with him. When the contraction passed, Mel took her hand and said, \u201cLiz, Rick and I have to tell you something....\u201d Rick lifted his head from her shoulder and looked at her, his expression strong though his cheeks were wet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked weakly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>Rick brushed the hair back from her brow and barely whispered, \u201cThe baby, Liz. He\u2019s not okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>Rick looked at Mel imploringly. \u201cThe baby is no longer alive, Liz,\u201d Mel said, struggling against her own tears.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d she asked hotly, scooting up in the bed, suddenly alert and frightened. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no heartbeat, sweetheart. There hasn\u2019t been.\u201d</p><p>And then she was gripped by another hard contraction.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you give her something?\u201d Rick asked.</p><p>Mel put on a pair of gloves so she could check Liz. \u201cI\u2019ll give her something to take the edge off without slowing her down or blacking her out. But we need to keep this moving,\u201d she told them both. \u201cLet me have a look, honey. Knees up. That\u2019s my girl. There you go. Good\u2014we\u2019re getting close. It won\u2019t take too much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked through sobs. \u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows, baby,\u201d Rick was saying. \u201cA freak of nature\u2014no one knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Rick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, baby. I won\u2019t leave you. I love you, Liz. I love you so much. We\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t anybody do anything?\u201d she shrieked.</p><p>\u201cIf they could, they would. I\u2019m here, baby. I won\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><p>As they cried together, held each other through one painful contraction after another, Mel couldn\u2019t help but feel tragic pride in these two kids, helping each other through what had to be the most terrible experience anyone can possibly endure, at any age.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to want you to push in a minute, Liz.\u201d She went to the door and opened it, finding Doc there, waiting. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s real close to ten centimeters.\u201d</p><p>Back in the room, she coached Liz and Rick through pushing, an arduous process. Liz was heroic, and between every hard contraction, she sobbed uncontrollably. Then John Stone stepped into the room. \u201cI thought you could use some help,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m right here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Mel mouthed a thank-you, then looked back to the field of birth. John donned gloves, set up clamps and scissors.</p><p>Liz pushed a couple of times and clung to Rick between contractions. Mel met Rick\u2019s eyes a few times and saw that, remarkably, he was holding it together. She briefly thought how like Jack the boy was\u2014his eyes were clear, but his cheeks damp, and he clenched his jaw. But as he lowered his lips to Liz\u2019s brow his expression softened and he murmured sweetly to her, telling her he was there, he loved her.</p><p>Mel saw the labia separate and the baby\u2019s head crown. He was going to come out quick; he was premature and smaller than average.</p><p>The baby\u2019s head emerged. Right away she could see the arrested development, the slightly blue tinge, but his skin was intact\u2014this baby had expired perhaps a day ago. \u201cOnce more, Liz, then it\u2019s over.\u201d She edged a shoulder out.</p><p>Mel left the limp, lifeless baby boy on the bed between Liz\u2019s legs while John clamped and cut. Then Mel wrapped the baby in its blanket, lovingly and gently as if he were alive, his face showing. His eyes were shut, his arms and legs floppy.</p><p>\u201cGive him to us,\u201d Liz said. \u201cGive him to us!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Mel passed the baby into Liz\u2019s arms. Rick and Liz held him, wept over him, their heads together. While Rick\u2019s shoulders silently shook, Liz\u2019s cries were wrenching. Then Mel watched as they slowly unwrapped him, touched him, examined every inch of him as though she\u2019d presented them with a living baby. Mel\u2019s vision blurred with her tears; she felt them on her cheeks. Inside, her own baby kicked.</p><p>Mel gently massaged Liz\u2019s uterus for a few minutes, then the placenta came. As she examined it for completeness, it came to mind that this was where the baby had lived, and died. There was no sense to this. When she looked at Liz and Rick she saw that despite the fact tears ran down their cheeks, they were studying the naked baby, touching him with soft, loving strokes, holding his tiny fingers in their hands. Mel looked down, overcome.</p><p>John\u2019s hand was on her shoulder. He whispered in her ear. \u201cHow about I finish up for you here?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded and moved away. Ordinarily, she\u2019d have insisted on completing the cleanup, but the combination of this sudden, intense loss and her own pregnancy put her in a whole different place. She watched as John examined Liz to see if she needed stitches and covered her up. He checked Liz and Rick to make sure they were okay, though neither of them seemed aware of him. Then he dropped an arm around Mel\u2019s shoulders and said, \u201cLet\u2019s give them a few moments. Come on.\u201d</p><p>He pulled Mel out of the room, and once she was outside, she leaned against him and sobbed. John held her while she cried hard tears. While he held her close, he felt her baby move inside her and in spite of his desire to be the strong one, his eyes became wet. At long last she drew a jagged breath and looked up at him. She smiled and wiped some wetness from his cheek. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let you go through that alone,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t alone,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI was with two of the strongest, bravest kids I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>Doc transported the baby to Valley Hospital, where an autopsy would be performed, but it wasn\u2019t unusual in such situations to find no distinct cause of death. Liz had come through the delivery well, despite the devastating outcome. It took Mel a couple of hours, with John\u2019s help, to get everything situated and cleaned up. John gave Liz a sedative and soon after, she slept. By that time, Doc was back and Rick was stretched out on the narrow bed beside Liz, holding her in his strong arms. Mel offered Rick a sedative, as well. \u201cNo,\u201d he said stoically. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay awake for Liz. She might need me.\u201d</p> <p>It was ten when John left and Mel walked across the street to the bar, each foot dragging in depressed misery. When she walked in, she found that not only had Jack stayed, but Paige, Preacher and Mike were still up, waiting this out for her. Jack stood up from the table.</p><p>She walked in, looked at them, and shook her head. \u201cThose poor kids,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jack enfolded her in his arms, and for a moment she laid her head against his chest. Then she said, \u201cI\u2019m so cold inside\u2014I need the fire. And a brandy. Just a swallow of brandy, please.\u201d</p><p>He led her over to the fire and when she sat there, Paige reached for her hand. \u201cBad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby was gone before she delivered.\u201d To anyone else she might have reported it as very sad. To her intimates, she said, \u201cMy heart is in a million pieces, it hurts so bad for them.\u201d</p><p>Jack brought Mel a small snifter of Remy. She lifted it to her lips with a shaky hand and took a sip, then put it back on the table. She pulled her coat tighter around her, her back to the fire. \u201cYou never know where you\u2019re going to find courage,\u201d she said. \u201cMy God, those two kids. They clung to each other and got through the worst day of their lives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least they\u2019re young,\u201d Paige said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, at least that.\u201d</p><p>Then the room was silent while Mel absorbed the heat of the fire, quietly partaking of half her brandy. Then she said, \u201cJack, I want you to go home and get some rest. I\u2019m going to stay with the kids tonight, in case they need me.\u201d</p><p>His back straightened immediately. \u201cMel, Doc can do that. Or you could\u2019ve asked John to stay\u2014Liz is his patient, after all. You\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stay at Doc\u2019s. And I\u2019d like you to go home and try to sleep. Rick\u2019s going to need you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait here in case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s not argue about this. You must know I won\u2019t leave them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve made up my mind, Jack. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Although Preacher offered Jack his bed or at least the couch in his apartment, Jack did as he was told and went to the cabin. Of course he didn\u2019t sleep. On a night like this, he really needed his wife\u2019s belly pressed up against him, feeling his son move around in there, alive. But he understood; Mel was as stubborn as she was strong and had she gone home with him, she\u2019d have worried about Liz and Rick all night.</p><p>At four in the morning, he\u2019d had all he could take. He got out of bed and dressed. He put on his heavy suede jacket and leather gloves and drove back into town. He parked his truck outside of Doc\u2019s, right next to Rick\u2019s, got out and leaned against the door. He could have let himself into the bar and started coffee, but there was no point in waking the house; Preacher and Paige should be allowed whatever sleep they could manage. This would have deeply affected them, as well.</p><p>Jack stood there, unmindful of the cold, his breath swirling in a steamy cloud above him, until the very first rays of winter sun began to creep over the mountain, more than two hours later. He was going to be right there when Mel came out, when she gave up her vigil, and he would get her breakfast and take her home to make sure she got some rest. He spent a lot of time just looking at the ground, wondering how such an unkind thing could happen.</p><p>When the door to Doc\u2019s opened, he lifted his head. It was not Mel but Rick who stepped out onto the porch. All Jack could think was, what a damned awful way to become a man. Rick just stood there for a moment, then he slowly stepped down from the porch into the street. He met Jack\u2019s eyes and there was such pain, such loss.</p><p>Jack stepped toward him and put a hand behind the boy\u2019s neck, pulling him onto his shoulder. He heard Rick let go a deep, painful sigh. Jack put his other arm around him and Rick let it go. He fell against Jack and the tears began. \u201cYeah, buddy. Get it out. I got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I do anything?\u201d Rick asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNone of us could, son. It\u2019s damned awful. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Rick cried softly and mournfully, his shoulders shaking while Jack held him. Through all the challenges of this pregnancy, all the sadness surrounding Liz and Rick\u2019s situation and their struggles to get through it like grown-ups, with a little dignity, nothing could have prepared any of them to face this. The boy who had become a man, who stepped up and took responsibility, leaned against Jack, shattered, quietly weeping in the anguish of grief. His heart was shredded, and Jack\u2019s was aching as he held him.</p><p>A single tear traced a path down Jack\u2019s stubbled cheek.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Liz stayed two nights in Doc\u2019s hospital room, Rick with her the entire time. They did a lot of weeping and holding on to each other. Mel spent a good deal of time there, trying to comfort. She told them that it was important to remember two things: that it was nothing they or anyone else did, and there was no reason to believe that it would ever happen again. It was extremely rare for an intrauterine death not precipitated by eclampsia or another complication of pregnancy, but sadly, it happened from time to time.</p><p>Jack and Mel made the arrangements for the burial of Rick and Liz\u2019s baby. Liz wanted to take him home to Eureka, where she\u2019d grown up and her grandparents were buried. And then Liz wanted to stay with her mother, who had become much more sensitive to the young couple, given their tragedy. She extended to Rick the invitation that he was welcome as much and as often as he wanted to be there, for his support was desperately needed to get Liz through these dark days.</p><p>Mel grieved. It was certainly not the first fatality for her, but medicine and midwifery in a small town made your patients your friends, and these young people were very special to her. Jack, not really knowing what to do for his wife, took her to June Hudson\u2019s house in Grace Valley where John and Susan were present with June and Jim and old Doc Hudson. They had a solemn dinner together, talking about their worst moments, their tragic losses. It was far from cheery, but it got Mel through it\u2014remembering that this was the downside of medicine and that she was not alone.</p><p>During that dinner, Jack had the passing thought that the need for these clinicians to share their war stories was not unlike what soldiers did, what his Marines had done. It was a leveler; it reminded you that everyone had a role in holding one another up, in sharing the victories and the tragedies.</p><p>Rick took his strength from Jack and Preacher, who watched over him closely, spending long hours at the end of the day talking and giving him the sturdiness of their shoulders, the camaraderie of their shared experiences. These men who had been to war had buried those they loved, young lives cut tragically short. Loss was no stranger to them. And Rick had joined their ranks too soon.</p><p>The whole town seemed to suffer for Rick and Liz, but it was clear to Paige that Mel\u2019s pain was unique. As she grew round with her own baby\u2019s birth imminent, a time that should bring her great joy, she was too quiet. Paige was familiar with the story of how Mel came to Virgin River, and just as she was about to flee, an abandoned newborn was found on Doc\u2019s porch and Mel put her own needs aside to stay, to take care of that baby until a home could be found for her. For many weeks and months after LillyAnderson had fostered the baby, Mel had gone to the Anderson ranch to hold her. Their bond was a strong one.</p><p>So Paige went to the clinic one afternoon and asked Mel to go for a ride with her\u2014she had an errand and didn\u2019t want to go alone, she said. She drove up to the Anderson ranch and Mel said, \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood medicine,\u201d Paige said. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Paige put her arm around Mel\u2019s shoulders and led her up the porch. When Lilly came to the door, Paige said, \u201cSomeone needs to hold a living baby.\u201d</p><p>Mel shot her a look, began to shake her head, but Lilly reached for her hand and said, \u201cOf course you do,\u201d and drew her inside.</p><p>Little Chloe was sleeping, but that didn\u2019t matter to Lilly. If there was something Mel needed, there wasn\u2019t a person in Virgin River who wouldn\u2019t move heaven and earth to help her. Chloe was almost a year old now. Lilly lifted her daughter out of the crib and handed her to Mel. Mel held that little life against her, drawing strength from the baby\u2019s cuddle, from her sleepy sighs. It wasn\u2019t quite the same as holding a newborn, a healthy baby pulled from its mother\u2019s womb, but it served its purpose. Lilly left Mel alone in the baby\u2019s room and Mel rocked Chloe for a long time while Paige and Lilly had tea in the kitchen. The warmth of life against Mel\u2019s chest seemed to give some healing. Inside her, her own baby kicked and squirmed, letting himself be known. For each movement, even the ones that were uncomfortable, she gave grateful thanks.</p><p>On the way back to town, Mel said, \u201cHow did you know to do that?\u201d</p><p>Paige shrugged. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long, Mel. It wasn\u2019t a full-term baby, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>For a moment Mel was shocked speechless. Then she reached across the front seat and grabbed Paige\u2019s hand as she drove. \u201cOh, Paige, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mel. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry! We were all so focused on how dangerous your husband was, the fact of losing his baby just didn\u2019t seem...Oh, God, me of all people! That was your baby! Paige, please forgive me. I should have helped with your grief. And instead, you\u2019re helping with mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Paige cast her a sweet smile. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I could help. As for me, I\u2019m going to get another chance. And the next time, it will be safer and easier. Sweeter.\u201d</p><p>Mel squeezed her hand. \u201cHave I told you how glad I am you came to town?\u201d</p> <p>The first week of February arrived, bringing with it the excavation crew. The second week in February brought two baby showers, one in Virgin River at the home of Lilly Anderson and the second one in Grace Valley, hosted by June Hudson and Susan Stone.</p><p>As February aged and Mel\u2019s own time drew near, her step might have become slower, but her eyes were brighter and she glowed. Joe Benson brought the final plans to Virgin River and Mel sat beside her husband in his truck and watched as the foundations for their house and the one-room guest house were laid out so they could be poured.</p><p>As she grew heavier by the day, it became obvious she wasn\u2019t going to be answering many more, if any, emergency calls with Doc. Mel had no babies due, and while she was in town every day, she came later in the mornings. And her husband was never very far from her side.</p><p>When Mel and Jack left the bar together at the end of the day, Paige leaned against Preacher and whispered, \u201cI can\u2019t wait until we\u2019re like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFat?\u201d he asked, chuckling.</p> <p>\u201cFat, full, ready to pop with a new baby. I\u2019m thinking of going off those birth control pills,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnytime you\u2019re ready,\u201d he said, putting his arms around her. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m in all the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, that\u2019s so nice. I\u2019m going to give Christopher his bath while you finish up and close the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be up in a minute,\u201d he said, giving her a loving pat on the rump.</p><p>It was this time of day that Preacher had come to regard as the magic that made his life work. Every little piece of it. He liked the act of cleaning his kitchen and never failed to feel grateful for all that was his. Had he not been here, working the place for his best friend, he would not have found Paige, and Christopher, who had become his son.</p><p>He locked the door and went upstairs to Christopher\u2019s bedroom and, finding him already in the bed, waiting with his book, Preacher sat on the bed beside him. Chris crept closer, climbing up on his lap and touching the pictures in the book while Preacher softly read. Before long, the little guy slept and Preacher was able to kiss him, tuck him in and turn off the lights.</p> <p>In his own room, he found Paige in front of the bathroom mirror brushing out her hair. She wore her pajama top, which came to her thighs. He came up behind her and moved her hair over one shoulder to kiss her neck, running his big hand up her thigh to her hip, finding, much to his liking, that she was naked under there. It wasn\u2019t as though she had to be psychic to anticipate him\u2014he wanted her all the time. She wanted him to want her, and she let him know.</p><p>His hands crept higher under the shirt until he held one breast in each hand. She leaned her head back against him and hummed in pleasure. He pulled his hands out and slowly began unbuttoning her top, watching himself and her in the mirror. Her right arm came up, reaching behind herself to his shoulder, and curled her hand behind his neck. Her top unbuttoned and hanging open, he slipped one hand inside to cup her breast while his other fell over her soft pubic mound. And he looked at their reflection. Her head turned, she rested against his chest with her eyes closed, one arm lifted high above her head to embrace him, the other resting lightly atop the arm that had captured her breast. He never dared hope for this\u2014that he would be half of a couple, a handsome, erotic, loving and perfect couple. And something surprised him\u2014he didn\u2019t look scary at all. He looked like a man in love, a man holding his woman with sure, strong and gentle hands. And his woman leaning into his embrace, filled with desire for him, her lips parted slightly in a soft sigh. Sighs that would soon become powerful as she gave herself over to him completely. Within her adoring, he had flourished.</p><p>Preacher had no idea he could be like this\u2014so sexual, so confident, so deeply in love. He leaned down and kissed the top of her head. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m going to make you feel so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, John,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The night that Mike Valenzuela lay in bed and listened to Jack toss and turn after the loss of Liz and Rick\u2019s baby, he knew it was time. And yet\u2014time for what? He had no interest in going back to L.A., though his family was due a visit. There was nowhere else in Virgin River to stay. But three months in the same small space with Mel and Jack was already too much\u2014though you\u2019d never know they felt a strain.</p><p>That night he knew. They had to have their home back. That had provoked thought, which stimulated ideas.</p><p>He\u2019d come so far\u2014his right arm was stronger, his shoulder pained him less. His hand had a decent grip. He couldn\u2019t cast with the right arm yet, but he saw hope for that because he could now shoot a pistol with his right hand as long as he gave it an assist with his left. Added to that, he had perfected his left-arm aim with both the rifle and the pistol. He could easily keep up with Jack, who was a decorated sharpshooter.</p><p>This was the place for him, he realized without much surprise. He didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do here, but it didn\u2019t really matter, because he could retire if he wanted to. He had his disability, his pension. And it cost nothing to live here. Until something changed in his head, he wanted this easy life in a small, uncomplicated town. By the time Jack was ready to frame his house in early summer, his right arm and shoulder would be strong enough to help. He\u2019d add to the menu at Jack\u2019s with his own fish; he\u2019d help around town where needed. He\u2019d live as Jack and Preacher had lived, at the center of a town that appreciated their good works and loyal friendship.</p> <p>Now when he stood in front of the mirror, stripped to the waist, he saw a muscled chest, shoulders, arms. His right side was still smaller than his left around the shoulder and biceps, but it had come a long way and was barely noticeable. Sit-ups were easy; he had his six-pack back.</p><p>It was easier to pee, thanks to a round of antibiotics prescribed by Mel. But that other thing\u2014it might be gone for good. He\u2019d had two false alarms, waking up with a good pee hard. He\u2019d gripped it like a drowning man, filled with hope. But, nothing. It just went back down, like the docile memory it had become. He was afraid to hope, but being a man, he held out for a miracle.</p><p>So, Mike drove to Eureka, where he bought an RV\u2014his new home. It was his goal to be free and clear of the cabin before the baby came so that Jack and Mel could have their life back. He could park it anywhere he was needed\u2014behind the bar, out at Mel\u2019s cabin, even on the property on which Jack was going to build. When he drove it into town, towing his SUV behind, he pulled it right up to the front of the bar. It was the end of the workday\u2014dinnertime. Preacher and Paige would be cooking, Rick would be working, Jack and Mel would be having that after-work drink with Doc. Friends and neighbors would be gathering soon.</p><p>He extended the bedroom and living room walls with the pop-outs and pressed the switch for the awnings, for the full effect. Once these walls were pushed out, the bedroom and living room became comfortably large. Then he honked the horn, bringing everyone out on the porch.</p><p>He jumped out\u2014sans cane for weeks now\u2014and stood in front of the RV, leaning against it. Mel was the first one out, Jack close on her heels.</p><p>\u201cMy new apartment,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cWhen...? What...?\u201d Mel stammered.</p><p>He reached out his left hand to help her descend the porch steps. When she was down, he dropped an arm around her shoulders. \u201cI wanted to get out of the cabin before the baby\u2014it\u2019s time to put that nursery together and I\u2019ll help do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where are you going?\u201d she asked, looking up at him with eyes that had suddenly grown moist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, sweetheart. I love it here. But I need my own house. More important, you need your own house.\u201d</p><p>And when he said that, she fell against him and wept.</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d he said, putting his good arm around her. \u201cI hope those are glad tears.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and looked up at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want us to lose you,\u201d she whispered. She wiped impatiently at her eyes. \u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry. You have no idea what it\u2019s like to be this pregnant. My emotions are like a landslide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, I\u2019m honored, Mel. You guys\u2014you\u2019ve been everything to me these last few months. I started thinking I\u2019m well enough to go home\u2014then realized that this feels like home.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him tightly around the waist. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to hear you say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant a tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Jack,\u201d she said, \u201cget Preacher, Paige and Rick.\u201d</p><p>When Rick came out on the porch, his face split in a huge grin and it filled Mike up inside. Rick had been coming along real well since his loss, but the goofy kid the Marines had all come to think of as a little brother had been replaced by a somber and quiet young man. \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d Rick asked.</p><p>\u201cMy new digs. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s awesome,\u201d he said, jumping off the porch to join the tour.</p><p>They combed through the RV, admiring the accoutrements. Full kitchen with a nearly full-size refrigerator, freezer, washer and dryer, roomy bedroom with a queen-size bed, large closet that occupied a whole wall, large bathroom with a two-person shower, TVs in both the bedroom and living room with roving satellite reception. Plenty of cupboard and closet space for a bachelor and storage compartments underneath.</p><p>Before long, there were a number of people trailing dirt through the new RV\u2014Connie and Ron, Doc, Hope McCrea, the Bristols and Carpenters. Christopher loved the big bed, tucked back in the end of the RV.</p><p>\u201cWhere you going to park this thing?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably out at Jack and Mel\u2019s, till I get a better idea. I could always park out there behind the bar, near the tree line, where the boys all sit when they come to town to fish. Or, I might even look around for land. But not yet. For right now, I\u2019m just going to hang out. Near my friends.\u201d</p><p>Over dinner they talked about the baby\u2019s room, the spackle, paint and papering Mel wanted done. Mike told them he planned to clear out of his room in the morning and then wanted to help get that room set up for the baby. He\u2019d take Mel to Ukiah where there was a Home Depot to pick out what she wanted. And, he told them, after that room was set, he was going to drive down to L.A. to see his folks, brothers and sisters, so he could be back when Mel delivered. \u201cI figure to be one of the many uncles, so this is where I should be when it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is where you should be,\u201d she said, covering his hand with both of hers.</p><p>Four days later, Mel stood in the doorway of the second bedroom of that little cabin and looked at a room painted yellow, trimmed in blue, papered with tiny hand and foot imprints. A white crib and bureau changing table stood ready to catch the next Sheridan and all the little blankets, onesies, outfits, socks and miscellany had been laundered and lovingly folded away. While she was admiring the room, Jack came into the cabin carrying the most beautiful rocking chair\u2014it seemed to match the cradle given to her by Sam.</p><p>She ran a hand along the edges and arms. She couldn\u2019t wait to rock their baby in this chair.</p><p>The first week in March, Paige received a check for one hundred twenty-some thousand dollars\u2014the balance left after the sale of a three-million-dollar home, the liquidation of 401(k)s and modest liquid cash, minus debts and fees. \u201cI almost can\u2019t touch it,\u201d she told Preacher.</p><p>Preacher stared at the number and thought how pathetic that a man who managed to earn enough to live in a small mansion, put pretax dollars toward retirement and smoke or shoot a lot of white powder could have a net worth so low. Probably the white powder. \u201cPut it aside for a while, but don\u2019t lose track of it,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the shock settles, I can help you find some kind of trust for Chris. You really don\u2019t need it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI hate even having it. All I wanted from that marriage since the honeymoon was out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that. But someday you\u2019ll be practical and see how you can make something good out of it. Use it to help your kids or something.\u201d</p> <p>She handed it to him. \u201cYou keep track of it, then. If I ever get over this, we can make a decision.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long after that conversation that it happened\u2014what they\u2019d been trying to prepare themselves for, but which was inevitable. Wes Lassiter was released from his jail sentence. The district attorney called and reported that he\u2019d returned to LosAngeles to begin his required Addicts Anonymous meetings, probation reports and community service. But the community service hadn\u2019t been selected and approved by the court, the probation meetings hadn\u2019t begun and AA wasn\u2019t likely to cooperate with anyone inquiring about whether he was turning up for meetings.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll watch closely,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be neighborhood watch around here, don\u2019t you worry. This is one nosy town.\u201d</p><p>But Paige got tears in her eyes, ran to their bedroom and cried.</p><p>When Rick came in for work, Preacher was leaning on his work counter, staring down at nothing. \u201cHey,\u201d Rick said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the little guy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNap,\u201d Preacher said shortly.</p><p>Rick\u2019s head lifted, listening. Paige\u2019s sobbing could be heard, though muffled. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d Rick asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>When Rick got into the bar he found Jack behind the counter with his clipboard, marking things off, and Mike up at the bar, giving him some grief about his unwillingness to let Preacher put inventories and receipts on the computer. He walked up next to Jack. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong in the kitchen,\u201d he said. \u201cPreacher\u2019s pissed off and Paige is crying. You can hear her. Like maybe they had a big fight or something.\u201d</p><p>Jack and Mike exchanged glances briefly, then got up and went to the kitchen. They\u2019d also been counting the days. Rick followed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, man?\u201d Jack asked Preacher.</p> <p>Preacher kept his voice low. \u201cHe\u2019s out. They say he went back to L.A., but there\u2019s no way to check. Paige\u2019s scared. Upset. I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet ready for anything,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what we were trained to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but, there\u2019s Chris. We gotta be so careful how we do that. I don\u2019t want him scared, you know. And I don\u2019t want him thinking it\u2019s about his dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can work with that,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe won\u2019t keep a loaded gun under the bar or anything. If there was a robbery the next town over, we could carry sidearms for a while, till it looked like things are cool. Sidearms around here\u2014not even interesting. Chris, he should stick real close\u2014because there was a robbery the next town over, huh?\u201d</p><p>Preacher was shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want him scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mike said. \u201cBut a little nervous is better than a little abducted. We need to play it smart, Preach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Paige is going crazy right now,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cYou should go in there,\u201d Jack said, giving his chin a jut in the direction of Preacher\u2019s quarters. \u201cTell her we\u2019re going to keep a gun or two, but there won\u2019t ever be one set down where a kid could touch it. We\u2019ll do that till it feels better around here, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long\u2019s that, you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI could do it a year without feeling the strain. Can you cook with a sidearm? Just because there was some trouble the next town over?\u201d</p><p>He was shaking his head again, but not in denial so much as frustration.</p><p>\u201cI was gonna go to L.A. for a week to see the family, but I can stay,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI can see them later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, go,\u201d Preacher said quickly. \u201cMaybe you have a contact or two that can tell us if he\u2019s there, doing what he was ordered to do. That might help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can check that out,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI\u2019ll make it a quick trip, see if I can find out anything. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear a gun around the bar,\u201d Rick said. When all three men swiveled their heads toward him, frowning, he said, \u201cWhat? I\u2019m licensed to carry! Why wouldn\u2019t I get in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be sorry when I\u2019m caught without a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mike said calmly. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to storm the bar and get himself shot. If he does anything, he\u2019s probably going to call Paige, try to convince her he\u2019s a changed man, see if he can work a deal with her to get that order of protection lifted, maybe take a new look at custody. His type is manipulative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe attacked her once,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cRight here, in the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, defense makes sense. And watching him makes sense. But remember, that was before he was risking a long-term prison sentence. He\u2019s a badass, but he\u2019s a smart, manipulative badass. Let\u2019s see if he went home....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house is gone,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cSold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Jesus, finding him could be a challenge. But anybody can be found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreach,\u201d Jack said. \u201cGo to Paige. Tell her we\u2019re on board. We\u2019ll do everything we can to keep her and Chris safe. Best-case scenario, we get the message he\u2019s doing his chores in L.A., trying to get his life back, and we can move on. But we don\u2019t quit early, huh? Tell her that. We don\u2019t quit early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Getting used to seeing Jack wearing a gun behind the bar was not easy for Mel. She had adjusted to the fact that everyone in Virgin River owned guns, out of necessity. They had livestock issues, wildlife concerns. Those guns in the racks of pickup trucks were loaded; children were educated in gun safety early. But where she\u2019d come from in L.A., people with guns were either law enforcement or dangerous.</p><p>Paige was understandably upset when she\u2019d learned her ex-husband was released from jail, but a week later and a phone call from Mike in L.A. saying Wes seemed to be making his probation and community service arrangements put her more at ease. It gave her hope that maybe all this precaution could be just an exercise.</p><p>In the meantime, Mel\u2019s baby was lowering and her back was aching. She was a small woman for such a load, and the pressure could be intense. The back pain came and went for a few days. Sometimes if she took a break and lay down for a while, it would go away. She knew she was getting close.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting to look like you should stop working,\u201d Doc said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to look like I\u2019m going to give birth to a whole football team,\u201d she returned. \u201cWhat am I going to do with myself if I don\u2019t come into work? Sit out at the cabin all day and watch fuzzy TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to wish you had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m only wishing for one thing right now. My mouth waters at the thought of that stupid epidural....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a little gin? After you wax me, you can go home and take a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d She got out the cards, but before they could deal, a patient came in. Doc stood up to see who had come in the front door, Mel behind him.</p><p>Carrie Bristol had her hand under the elbow of her thirteen-year-old daughter, Jodie, while Jodie was gripping her tummy. \u201cBad tummyache,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a look,\u201d Doc invited, preceding them down the hall and standing aside so they could enter the exam room ahead of him. A few minutes later, he called Mel to the exam room. \u201cI have a possible positive appy,\u201d he said, meaning inflamed appendix.</p><p>\u201cEw,\u201d Mel said. She went into the room and looked down at Jodie\u2019s squinting eyes. \u201cBad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFever, vomiting, pain,\u201d Doc said.</p><p>\u201cYou tap the soles of her feet?\u201d Mel asked. If that technique jarred the appendix painfully, it was a sign.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Start an IV for me, will you? I think we\u2019ll take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to operate?\u201d Carrie asked. \u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, we often aren\u2019t,\u201d Mel said. \u201cIn fact, surgeons remove a fair number of healthy appendixes simply because to err on the side of surgery is safer than to err on the side of a rupture. If there\u2019s time at the hospital and her appendix isn\u2019t too hot, they\u2019ll do a few blood tests to see if her white count is elevated\u2014that\u2019s a sign it needs to come out. But Jodie\u2019s symptoms are strong\u2014it\u2019s better to just hurry and go. Let the surgeon decide.\u201d</p><p>Mel got out her IV setup and started a line. Before long they were ready to put her on the gurney.</p><p>\u201cWant me to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d Doc said. \u201cCarrie can ride in the back with her. I don\u2019t need a delivery along the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d be going in the right direction,\u201d Mel put in.</p><p>\u201cJust close up the office, go home and take a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least you\u2019re not going in the back of a pickup. Take the Hummer,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cRight. Let\u2019s go. Carrie, you help me with the gurney. Melinda is ready to whelp.\u201d</p><p>Mel walked outside with them and gave Jodie\u2019s hand a pat. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>She stood on Doc\u2019s porch for a few minutes after they were gone. She noticed Cheryl Chreighton weaving around the side of the boarded-up church, an unmistakable bottle in her hand. Mel ran a hand over her belly and silently vowed that after the baby came, she\u2019d find a way to get that woman some help. That she wasn\u2019t a patient was irrelevant. She was a human being in need. When Mel saw a need, she went to work on it.</p><p>The breeze picked up and became a brisk wind and the sky was darkening. A few heavy drops fell on the street in front of her and she thought about how much she\u2019d enjoy a heavy rain on a lazy afternoon. It took Mel only a couple of minutes to decide Doc was probably right\u2014she should take the rest of the day off. Her back was killing her. A hot shower and nap sounded fine.</p><p>She went over to the bar and hopped up on a stool. \u201cHello, gorgeous,\u201d Jack said, leaning across the bar to put a brief kiss on her lips. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuge,\u201d she answered. \u201cHow are things around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm. Quiet. Nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have a ginger ale, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing up. What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc took a patient to Valley Hospital in the Hummer\u2014possible appendicitis. So I\u2019m going to take the afternoon off. Can I borrow your truck? Can you get Rick or Preacher to run you home later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that can be arranged. Want me to take a break and drive you home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet, but I like having the truck. I hate being stuck out there without wheels. If you need it, I can scrounge around for Doc\u2019s keys....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, take it. I\u2019d rather have you in my truck.\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of her ginger ale and lifted her eyes toward the ceiling as there was a loud crack of thunder. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to have a hot shower, put on my flannel nightie and let the rain on the roof rock me to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can come wake you up a little later,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll rub your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s driving me crazy,\u201d she said, pressing a hand against the small of her back. \u201cThis kid must be sitting on my spine. When he\u2019s not dancing on my kidneys.\u201d</p><p>Jack held both her hands across the bar. \u201cI know this has been rough lately, Mel. Pretty soon he\u2019ll be here and you can start to feel better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She smiled prettily into his eyes. \u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t trade this for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the greatest thing anyone has ever done for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d He came around the bar, fishing his keys out of his pocket. He walked her out onto the porch. She took a deep breath. \u201cSmell that air? Don\u2019t you love the smell of rain? It\u2019s going to bring us flowers.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a few hours. See if you can get some sleep. I know you don\u2019t sleep through the night.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a pat on the butt and went down the porch stairs to his truck. She waved as she cut a wide U-turn and drove out of town. Her back started to really throb as the wind along the road picked up steam and was blowing hard, whipping the branches wildly against the truck. Then there were several bright flashes of lightning and the rain pelted the windshield with gale force. She was within a quarter mile of the cabin when a sharp pain ripped across the front of her abdomen, and when she pressed her hand there she felt the rock-hard tightening of her uterus and she thought, shit! You dummy! Who let you be a midwife? You\u2019re in labor! Back labor! All day long! And some of yesterday, too!</p><p>Right in front of her in the road lay a pine, obviously cut down by a lightning strike, and she was too late to stop. Swerving, she at least didn\u2019t hit it head-on, but she ran the left front bumper into it and caused the right front wheel of the truck to veer off the shoulder.</p><p>Distracted by the contraction, she\u2019d almost had an accident. Make that, worse accident. At least the air bag hadn\u2019t deployed\u2014that could\u2019ve been bad, given her advanced pregnancy. She\u2019d go back to Jack; go to the hospital.</p><p>She put the truck in Reverse and the tires spun. She tried again and again, rocking the truck. And now, she thought, I have made a real mess of things. Why didn\u2019t I stay at the bar ten more minutes? Time enough for this first really good contraction to kick in!</p> <p>She had no option but to walk the rest of the way to the cabin and call Jack. It wasn\u2019t far; she wasn\u2019t going to drop this little acrobat on the ground. But, she thought, I am going to be very, very wet. And I\u2019m having a baby a little sooner than I thought.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Mel had to climb over the thick trunk of the tree, heavy with branches, which was a challenge, belly and all. She had her medical bag, the collar of her coat pulled up high. It was necessary to lean into the wind, bending a bit as she pushed forward. She hadn\u2019t gone far when another contraction seized her. Whoa, she thought\u2014the last one wasn\u2019t long ago. But\u2014first baby\u2014there was lots of time. She was no doubt going to labor for hours, then have to push for more than an hour. Don\u2019t panic\u2014there\u2019s plenty of time. But she hated the thought of trying to get back to a vehicle over that tree trunk. Well, she thought, he\u2019ll just have to carry me. Good that I picked me a big, strong man!</p><p>On the porch of her cabin, it happened again. Another contraction. She counted\u2014it was nice and long. Little doubt\u2014this was it.</p><p>When she got inside, she went immediately to the phone before taking off her boots or coat. She lifted the cordless and punched some numbers, then listened. No ring went through. She disconnected and listened. No dial tone. Oh, crap, she thought.</p><p>Now it would be okay to cry, she told herself. She started to snivel a little bit, trying to calculate in her mind where she might be in her labor in a few hours, when it finally occurred to Jack to hitch a ride home. She flicked the light switch. Nothing. Okay, it was definitely okay to cry, she thought. No electricity, no phone, no doctor, only one idiot midwife on the premises. And baby coming. Coming.</p> <p>Mel sat down at her kitchen table, her hand on her abdomen, and tried to collect herself. She took several deep, calming breaths. There was nothing to do but get ready, in case the baby came at home. She was dripping wet from the rain. She\u2019d attempt to check her dilation, which could be a challenge, given the big bulge in the way. But first, she\u2019d find a way to protect her mattress, gather some towels and blankets, basin or pan, medical bag by the bed. She\u2019d take a quick shower\u2014if she could get her boots off. That always proved harder than she thought, and before she had the second one off, the next contraction came.</p><p>She found a couple of plastic trash bags. She stripped off the bottom sheet on the bed and spread them across the mattress. Over the plastic, she smoothed out a couple of towels, then replaced the fitted sheet. A couple more towels on top of the sheet. She pulled extra pillows out of the closet to prop herself up. She gathered up the candles from the kitchen, living room, bedroom and set them up on her dresser and bedside table. Oh, she hoped she didn\u2019t have to deliver herself by candlelight. In the middle of all this, she was hit again\u2014big one. She had to sit on the edge of the bed for a few moments to get through it. Then she got the baby blankets and more towels and put them by the bed.</p><p>Finally set up, she headed for the shower. She started the water so it would get hot, stripped off her wet clothes, kicking them aside, washed her hands thoroughly and waited rather impatiently for another contraction to come and go. When it had, she squatted, legs apart. She held on to the bathroom sink with one hand to keep balance. Slipping one hand under her belly, she slid her fingers into her birth canal, reaching. This was the best she could do. She pushed gently, reaching. This was a damn difficult maneuver. One, two, three fingers and some room\u2014God. Already seven-plus\u2014she was cooked. She knew at that moment, she wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>She pulled out her hand and with it came a gush of amniotic fluid, spilling between her legs onto the floor.</p><p>Okay. No shower.</p><p>She tossed some towels onto the floor to sop up the spill, then tried to dry herself off. If she were attending someone else in birth, she\u2019d have the mother walking, squatting, rocking her hips side to side, using gravity to assist that baby downward and out\u2014but this was a different ball game. She wanted some company\u2014at least Jack, and preferably John Stone or Doc.</p><p>Her flannel granny gown would be a poor choice for a labor garment, so she chose one of Jack\u2019s oversize T-shirts. She pulled the shirt up around her breasts, got into bed atop a couple of thick, soft terry towels, covered her belly with the sheet and hoped to keep back the labor for a while. Long enough for someone to see that truck up against the tree; long enough for someone to try phoning her and discover the lines were down.</p><p>She pulled the fetoscope out of her bag and listened, very gratefully, to the baby\u2019s strong and regular heartbeat.</p> <p>Thank God Jack was a worry wart. It might come in handy for once. She felt another contraction and looked at her watch. Two minutes long. She waited\u2014less than three minutes later, another, and with every one, more amniotic fluid was being pushed out. Another couple of minutes\u2014oh, Jesus, this boy was going to come barreling out of her.</p><p>Jack tried to call Mel, just to be sure she made it back to the cabin without incident, because the storm had really picked up right after she left. But there was no answer. Maybe it took her a little longer\u2014given the rain. He tried again ten minutes later, but there was still no answer.</p><p>\u201cShe pick up yet?\u201d Rick asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. She said she wanted to go home and take a shower, get into bed. She\u2019s probably in the shower.\u201d</p><p>It was nearing the dinner hour and there were a couple of people in the bar. Jack brought them drinks, then went back to the phone. No answer.</p><p>\u201cCould she have turned the phone off?\u201d Preacher asked him.</p><p>\u201cProbably. To keep me from calling her every ten minutes to ask her how she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>Paige was getting rolls ready to put in the oven. She laughed at him. \u201cJack, she\u2019d call you if she needed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. But he dialed. Nothing.</p><p>A little while later he was pacing. \u201cYou think she could be sleeping through the phone ringing?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if she actually slept,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHer back is killing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she isn\u2019t having back labor,\u201d Paige said rather absently. \u201cI had a lot of that with Christopher. It\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d know if she was in labor,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I suppose. But I didn\u2019t,\u201d Paige said. \u201cNot until it moved around to the front, and by then I was pretty far dilated.\u201d</p><p>Jack threw a look at Preacher, at Rick\u2014a stricken look. How long ago had she left? A half hour? Hour?</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019re outta here,\u201d Jack said. \u201cCome on, Rick, let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Jack,\u201d Paige said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, but as he said it, he was rushing for his coat and flying out the back door, Rick on his heels. Jack went to the driver\u2019s side of Rick\u2019s little truck, because he couldn\u2019t ride. He was too wound up, too worried. Rick went along with this, knowing better than to argue with the guy now. He tossed him the keys and Jack started the truck, threw it into gear and tore out of town before Rick\u2019s door was closed.</p><p>It was a long ten minutes to the cabin, and through it all Rick kept trying to talk him down. \u201cShe knows what she\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about Mel\u2014she\u2019d call.\u201d Jack said nothing. He flew down the road, taking those sharp turns real tight and fast. Rick felt his own panic rising, after what he\u2019d just been through. He tried not to let it show. \u201cYou know everything is going to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rick was cut off midsentence as Jack screeched to a stop behind his own truck, the left front of which was rammed into a fallen tree. \u201cGod,\u201d he said, jumping out of Rick\u2019s little truck and running to his own. \u201cMel!\u201d he yelled, opening the driver\u2019s door. Finding the cab empty, he looked for blood, for her bag. Neither was evident, so he took off at a dead run, bounding over the huge tree and racing toward the cabin.</p><p>He blew into the house and slipped on the wood floor, nearly falling on his ass, his boots and clothes dripping wet from the rain and muck. \u201cMel!\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she called back, her voice small and strained.</p><p>He saw a soft glow coming from the bedroom and went toward it. She was propped against the pillows in the bed, sheet drawn over her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s happening,\u201d she said.</p><p>He rushed to her side and knelt. \u201cI\u2019ll take you now. Take you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t take the ride now\u2014I\u2019m too far into this. But you can get John, see if he can come....\u201d She grunted against a contraction, grabbing Jack\u2019s hand. \u201cPhone\u2019s out,\u201d she said. \u201cGo back to town, call John, tell him my water broke and I\u2019m at eight. Can you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d He ran back to Rick and repeated the message, and then the boy was gone. Jack ran back to Mel and took her hand. \u201cTell me what to do,\u201d he said.</p><p>The contraction passed and she let out her breath. \u201cOkay. Okay, listen to me. Mop up your mess before you kill yourself slipping in a puddle, get some dry clothes on, see if you can get a little more light in here and then we\u2019ll see where we are. It\u2019s going to be a while. Maybe John will make it. Whew,\u201d she said, leaning back. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve ever been happier to see you.\u201d</p><p>Her face took on a look of pain and she began to breathe, short and shallow, panting, while he stood looking down at her, helpless. When she recovered, she said, \u201cJack, do what I told you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>He started by going for a towel in the bathroom to wipe up the puddles he\u2019d dragged in and there he found her clothes, hastily discarded, panties a little bloody, and wet towels left in a pile on the floor. He kicked everything aside, clearing a path in the bathroom. He opted for the kitchen mop, cleaning up the trail of water that went from the front door to the bedroom. He left his boots by the front door. Hurrying, he pulled off his jeans and shirt, adding them to the pile of wet towels and clothes, put on fresh, dry clothes and socks, and went again to her bedside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cDo we have any more candles?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNot that I know about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about flashlights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have a couple of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the strongest one. If he starts to come before John gets here, I might be able to hold the light for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor...Me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, there are only two of us here. One of us is going to push him out, one of us is going to catch him. Which job do you want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, going for the flashlight. He took it back to her and demonstrated its strength by shining it right in her eyes. She winced and he turned it off.</p><p>She rubbed her eyes. \u201cOh, brother. Maybe you should push him out. I\u2019m calmer. Yeah, I vote for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He knelt with one knee on the floor beside her bed. \u201cMelinda, how can you be sarcastic right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you own a bar and you don\u2019t keep alcohol at home,\u201d she said, breathless. \u201cI could have had a shot\u2014it sometimes slows labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have some on hand for the next one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep talking like that\u2019s gonna happen,\u201d she said. \u201cHow ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think my record speaks for itself. But, Mel, I just want to make them, not deliver them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear ya, buddy,\u201d she said, and then was gripped by another contraction. She tried to pant through it, but they were getting tougher\u2014longer and closer together. She looked at her watch. \u201cOh, man,\u201d she said, breathless. \u201cThis is going to turn me into a much more sympathetic midwife. Yii.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPull up a chair...Or something. All we do now is labor.\u201d</p><p>Jack went to the nursery and got the rocker, bringing it to her bedside and sitting up on the edge, leaning toward her. \u201cDid you hit the tree?\u201d he asked her, picking up a towel from the bed and wiping it gently across her sweating brow.</p><p>\u201cA little bit. I had a contraction, the first really good one, and it distracted me, and there it was, right in the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that didn\u2019t make you go into labor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I suspect I\u2019ve been in labor all day and didn\u2019t realize\u2014it was all in my back. Killing me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. That\u2019s what Paige said happened to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod bless her, huh? Uh,\u201d she said, grabbing her middle and going with another one. It seemed to go on forever. Finally, she relaxed against the pillows again, closed her eyes and caught her breath. \u201cOh, man, this is harder than it looks. At least he\u2019s off my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I wish I could do this for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment. Two minutes later she was seized by another one. She panted through it. Jack went to the bathroom and wet a washcloth, going back to her to wipe her brow and neck. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou have to wait for John,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing the best I can, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He held her hand and wiped her brow through several more contractions, murmuring, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. It\u2019s okay....\u201d</p><p>And then she snapped, \u201cI know it\u2019s okay! Stop saying that!\u201d</p><p>Oh, he had heard about this\u2014when you\u2019re doing whatever you can, but she hates you, anyway.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s transition talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTransition?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting closer.\u201d When the next one passed she said, \u201cOkay, something is a little different. I think he\u2019s moving down. I feel like in a minute\u2014\u201d Before she could finish her sentence, she was nearly lifted off the bed by the urge to bear down. She seemed to catch herself, stop herself by panting. Two minutes is a long, long time when you\u2019re going through that. When you\u2019re watching someone go through that. When it passed, she collapsed back on the pillows and had trouble catching her breath.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to take a look. Get the flashlight and shine it right on my pelvic floor. See if the birth canal is opening. Tell me if you see him coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will I know what to look for?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cIt has hair,\u201d she said in a very snotty tone.</p><p>\u201cOkay, don\u2019t get pissy, I don\u2019t do this for a living.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her knees and spread them while Jack held the flashlight on her. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he said. He looked over her knees at her face. He looked a little bit pale.</p><p>\u201cShow me how much, like this,\u201d she said, showing him a circle with her thumb and forefinger. He responded by showing her a circle, larger than hers. \u201cHo, boy,\u201d she said.</p><p>He turned off the flashlight. \u201cMelinda, I want you to wait for John....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sick to death of being told to wait for John!\u201d she said meanly. \u201cJack, listen to me. I\u2019m having this baby. Period. And you\u2019re going to pay attention and help. Got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Melinda...\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his wrist and dug her nails into him. \u201cDo you think this is my first choice?\u201d</p><p>He thought briefly about suggesting, again, that she try to hold off. But he knew he was not in the driver\u2019s seat here, plus he was resisting the urge to look at his wrist to see if she\u2019d drawn blood. It was going to be impossible to get her to listen to reason. He\u2019d always been good at following orders\u2014he\u2019d do that again. \u201cGotcha,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Spread out a blanket at the foot of the bed, down there. A small blanket for the baby. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, in my bag here, get out two clamps and a pair of scissors. The suction bulb. We\u2019re going to need a basin for the placenta\u2014a large bowl or saucepan will do. Then go into the bathroom, roll up your sleeves and scrub your hands up to the elbows with soap, lots of soap and the hottest water you can stand. Dry with a clean towel. When you get back, done with that, there\u2019s going to be a bigger circle. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He opened the bag. He had to hold up a couple of things before she confirmed he had a clamp. The suction bulb was a complete mystery. As this process was going on, she reared up again and with a loud and very primal grunt, was bearing down. She held on to her thighs and pushed until her face was red. He took the flashlight on instinct, shining it on her pelvic floor. Oh, Christ, he thought. That circle of hair that was his son\u2019s head was indeed getting larger. He supposed there was no point in telling her to stop that. \u201cHow much time do we have?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGo. Wash. Don\u2019t screw around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he said. But it was awful, standing at the sink sudsing himself while she was in the bedroom, groaning and grunting and pushing his baby out of her. He wanted to yell at her to stop that, but he knew it would only piss her off. When he got back to the bed, he reached for the flashlight and she yelled, \u201cNo! Don\u2019t touch that! Pick it up with a clean towel! Hand it to me!\u201d</p><p>He looked around and upon locating the towels up by her pillow, he took one and passed the flashlight to her. She struggled to sit up a bit and held the flashlight, pointing it down. \u201cHoly shit, Mel,\u201d he said.</p><p>She thought she knew what that meant. She collapsed back on the pillows and looked at her watch. It had been almost an hour and a half since Rick lit out of here. Where the hell was John? \u201cHe\u2019s coming, Jack,\u201d she said weakly, collapsing against the pillows.</p><p>He took the flashlight from her with the towel and said, \u201cGimme that.\u201d He propped it on a rolled-up towel so that it shone on the field of birth and said, \u201cOkay, now you can think about one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving birth?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo things,\u201d he amended. \u201cGiving birth and telling me what to do.\u201d</p><p>On the next contraction, she pulled herself up, grabbing her thighs, and the baby\u2019s head, crowning, grew larger. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d Jack said again. Three more pushes and the baby\u2019s whole head emerged. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJack, look for a cord around the baby\u2019s neck. It\u2019s purple and ropey. Ahhh,\u201d she said, struggling against another contraction. \u201cUse your index finger to see if you can feel anything around the baby\u2019s neck. Ahhh!\u201d</p><p>Right at that moment, the front door slammed open with a bang.</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d Jack yelled. \u201cJohn, come on!\u201d</p><p>John, soaked and coming into the bedroom at a pace far too leisurely for Jack\u2019s tastes, appeared. Jack started to stand and John said, \u201cGet back in there, man.\u201d He peered into the field. \u201cGood. You feel for a cord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but what the hell do I know?\u201d</p><p>John let his coat fall off his shoulders. He grabbed the flashlight and brought it in closer. \u201cNice,\u201d he said. \u201cJack, get your hands in there\u2014she\u2019s going to bring him out. Be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your fucking mind?\u201d Jack asked, really at the end of his tether with this business.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re there, Jack. Now.\u201d He looked over Mel\u2019s raised knees. \u201cLittle push, Mel,\u201d John said.</p><p>Mel gave a grunt and a shove and the baby came sliding out, neat as pie.</p><p>\u201cHold him face down, your hand on his chest, and rub his back,\u201d John said. Before Jack had even accomplished that, the baby was crying. \u201cAh, good,\u201d John said. John spread a blanket on Mel\u2019s abdomen. \u201cGood work. Put him down right here. Let\u2019s get him dried off and wrapped nice and warm.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s hands were shaking as he did so, wiping the muck of birth from his son\u2019s little body. Mel was straining up to see him, her fingers reaching toward him to touch him. For a moment Jack was paralyzed. Trans-fixed. Before he could close the blanket around him, he stared at him in sheer wonder. His son. Brought right out of his wife\u2019s body. Naked, covered with muck, squalling, and the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen. His little arms and legs were flailing, his mouth open in a wail. He was so tiny, Jack was thinking, when John said, \u201cJesus, Melinda, he\u2019s big. Where were you keeping him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThat feels so much better.\u201d</p><p>John was finally in the ball game, gently massaging Mel\u2019s uterus. \u201cWhat a woman,\u201d he said. \u201cNo stitches necessary.\u201d He applied the clamps to the cord, handed Jack the scissors and told him where to cut. Jack, finally numbed by an event in which he\u2019d felt entirely helpless, did as he was told, freeing the baby from his moorings.</p><p>\u201cGood work,\u201d John said. \u201cLet Mel have her baby, Jack. I\u2019ll wash and help with the cleanup.\u201d</p><p>John disappeared into the bathroom while Jack lovingly lifted the baby. Mel was tugging at her T-shirt as Jack was handing her the baby. She held the baby\u2019s cheek against her warm breast, running her fingers over his perfect head. The baby stopped crying and appeared to be looking around. Mel glanced up at Jack and gave him a little smile.</p><p>\u201cCome on, little guy,\u201d she cooed, serene, totally focused on her son. \u201cDo your job here. Stanch the bleeding, bring out the placenta.\u201d She pinched her nipple to fit the baby\u2019s mouth, trying to entice him with it. Jack felt a river of emotion run through him. He didn\u2019t know if he was about to burst into song or faint. He dropped to his knees to be closer and watched Mel tickle the baby\u2019s mouth and cheek with her nipple and then the baby turned his head instinctively and clamped on, took hold, suckled. And Mel said, \u201cOh, my! You\u2019re very good at this.\u201d Then she looked at Jack, who knelt by the bed, dazed. She smiled weakly and said, \u201cThank you, darling.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer to her, his face next to his son\u2019s head. \u201cMy God, Melinda,\u201d he said in a breath. \u201cWhat the hell did we just do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>An hour later the lights came on and Preacher was on Jack\u2019s front porch, looking for information. John had helped clean Mel up and washed the baby, helped Jack get clean sheets on the bed and was ready to leave them. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in taking them out in this weather,\u201d John said. \u201cThey\u2019re in good shape. You need a sedative, man?\u201d he asked Jack, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI could use one, yeah. Got a good single malt in that bag there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be convenient?\u201d He slapped a hand on Jack\u2019s back and said, \u201cYou did a good job, buddy. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What choice did I have? It was all her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow Uncle Preach the baby. I\u2019m going home. And I think you have like tons of laundry to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTons.\u201d Jack laughed.</p><p>Jack carried the baby to the living room and let Preacher have a peek. \u201cYou deliver him?\u201d Preacher asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Preacher grinned hugely. \u201cLooks like you did okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking to do it again, however,\u201d Jack said. But he smiled. Where\u2019s Paige? Chris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick\u2019s standing guard,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cWearing my sidearm. He\u2019s a little too happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, you better get back there. Disarm him.\u201d</p><p>Jack put the baby back in the cradle next to Mel, whose face had resumed those soft, beautiful lines that had been there prior to her hard work. He went around the house collecting clothes, towels, sheets. He laundered, he cleaned, he set the house back in order. At nine o\u2019clock there was a soft knock at the door and he opened it to find Preacher had returned. He lifted a bottle. \u201cJohn said you might need a sedative,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Come on in. Be real quiet.\u201d</p><p>Jack found a couple of glasses and Preacher tipped the bottle over them. Then he lifted his glass, Jack lifted his, and Preacher whispered, \u201cCongratulations, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Jack threw back the shot and when he brought back his head, his eyes were misting over. \u201cMy wife,\u201d he said in a whisper. \u201cYou have no idea the strength that took. She was amazing. I watched her face\u2014she went to a place of power I\u2019ve never been. And then, when I handed her the baby, when she put my son against her breast...\u201d He took another swallow. \u201cWhen she nursed my son, she was in another place\u2014there was such peace and love.... God,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cThat was God.\u201d Preacher opened his arms and gave the man a huge hug, patting his back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that in my life,\u201d Jack whispered.</p><p>Preacher clamped strong hands on Jack\u2019s upper arms, giving him a little shake. \u201cI\u2019m real happy for you, man.\u201d And then he left, Jack quietly closing the door behind him.</p><p>At midnight, Jack blew out most of the candles and sat in the rocker by her bed. By his bed. He lifted the baby to Mel at two in the morning and watched, mesmerized, as she nursed him for a few minutes on each side, burped him and handed him back to Jack with sleepy instructions to change him. Which he did.</p><p>At 5:00 a.m. he repeated the process of lifting his crying son to his mother\u2019s arms, again watching as she breast-fed him. Again, changing him and cleaning him up. He held him and rocked him for an hour before putting him back in his cradle. At eight in the morning, it happened again, a feeding and changing, and Jack had not taken so much as a nap. He had watched every rise and fall of his son\u2019s chest, each breath, frequently reaching out to gently touch his perfect little head.</p> <p>At nine in the morning he heard the sound of saws and he went to the front porch. He couldn\u2019t see that far down the road because of the fallen tree, but he knew what was happening\u2014Preacher was having the road cleared.</p><p>At noon, Mel got out of bed. He was astonished by the fact that she sat up, put her feet on the floor, stood up and stretched. \u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I\u2019ll have a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI feel so much better.\u201d She put her hands in the small of her back. \u201cMy back doesn\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d She walked into his arms, hugged him close and said, \u201cThank you, Jack. I couldn\u2019t have done it without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think you could have.\u201d He looked down the length of her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter seeing what you did last night, I can\u2019t believe you can stand.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it? The way a woman\u2019s body can open up and deliver a child that size? You don\u2019t realize it yet, but that was a very wonderful experience you had. Delivering your own child.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her brow. \u201cWhat makes you think I don\u2019t realize it?\u201d</p><p>She touched his face. \u201cHave you slept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m still too wired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe you do realize it. I\u2019m going to get cleaned up a little, then I have things for you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d he asked. \u201cI did my laundry.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cJack, we haven\u2019t eaten anything. And you have phone calls to make. You have to go into town. I heard saws\u2014you think your truck will be pulled out by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sitting in front of the cabin.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis place. The way people just act on instinct, without being asked. Okay, I\u2019m starving. I\u2019m going to clean up.\u201d</p><p>When she got out of the shower, he had a bowl of hot soup waiting for her. \u201cYou sure you\u2019ll be all right here by yourself?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI can take it from here, cowboy,\u201d she said, diving into her soup.</p><p>Jack hurried through his phone calls while Paige and Preacher packed up a nice takeout for him\u2014a scrumptious stew, bread, some sandwiches, fruit and pie. He quickly foraged for some groceries from the kitchen\u2014eggs, cheese, milk, juice. Jack couldn\u2019t be away from them for long\u2014he hurried back to the cabin. He found Mel and the baby napping, so he stoked the fire and leaned back on the couch, his feet stretched out in front of him on the chest that served as a coffee table. A kind of mellowness had settled over him, almost like having had a tranquilizer. He thought he might be visiting heaven, it was so sweet.</p><p>A couple of hours later, he felt her fingers threading through his hair and he opened his eyes. She was sitting on the couch beside him, holding the baby. \u201cHas he eaten?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd eaten and eaten and eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him to me,\u201d he said, reaching for his baby. He kissed his head. \u201cGod,\u201d he said. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it. You know how I feel? Like I\u2019ve never been happy before in my life, because this is so...This is just so much bigger than the happiest I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d He touched her cheek. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever done anything this great for me, Melinda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know, Jack,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he said, leaning toward her. She obliged him, covering his lips in a deep and loving kiss.</p><p>\u201cDid you make your phone calls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Joey\u2019s coming, but I hope you don\u2019t mind\u2014I asked her to give us a few days. I want to be here with you, alone, for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Till you come down to earth. How about things at the bar? Aren\u2019t you needed there for Paige?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRon and Bruce are taking turns, hanging around. Am I going to come down to earth? It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I hope not right away. I really like you like this. All sweet and overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like me like this, too.\u201d</p><p>After school, Rick went to Mel\u2019s cabin instead of to work. He tapped softly at the door and it was opened by Mel. She smiled sweetly. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wonderful,\u201d she said in a whisper. She put a finger to her lips and reached for his hand, drawing him inside. \u201cBe very quiet,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She led him into the living room. Jack was asleep on the couch, his feet up on the trunk. She gestured to the chair. \u201cGive me your jacket and sit,\u201d she said. He shrugged out of it, handing it to her, and did as he was told while Mel left the room. She was back in seconds, carrying the little bundle. She took the baby to Rick and put him in his arms. Then she went down on one knee, very nimbly for a woman in her condition, and put her arm around Rick\u2019s shoulders, her face near his face.</p><p>Rick held the new life, Jack\u2019s son, and admired the handsome round head, the little, pink, heart-shaped mouth. The baby squirmed a little in his arms, making precious little noises.</p><p>Jack opened his eyes but didn\u2019t move. He looked the short distance across the small room and saw Rick holding the baby and Mel holding Rick. There was a slight glistening on Rick\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cThis is how it\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d Rick whispered.</p><p>\u201cThis is how it will be,\u201d Mel whispered back. She pressed a soft kiss to Rick\u2019s cheek. \u201cAll in good time.\u201d</p><p>Then she went to the couch and curled up next to Jack. His arm lifted automatically to bring her close against him, and they remained like that, the four of them, for almost an hour.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Mike Valenzuela had a friend in Parole and Probation, a man he\u2019d used as a source of information when he was in the gangs unit. It was an excellent way of keeping tabs on gang members who\u2019d been released from prison and were back on the street, with parole obligations. Even though he was no longer on the job, it was still a simple matter to ask questions about someone meeting probation requirements. Mike had been a highly respected officer. He was trusted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s making his weekly appointments, bringing in his chits for attending daily meetings at AA,\u201d Mike told Paige and Preacher. \u201cHe\u2019s working two nights a week in a soup kitchen and trying to get his old job back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoup kitchen?\u201d Paige asked. She shook her head. \u201cHard to imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will be easier for you to imagine. He\u2019s already trying to get his community service commitment bumped down and his probation appointments dropped from weekly to monthly. And...he\u2019s living with a woman he met in treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Paige said. \u201cBrie said something like that might happen....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s predictable, in fact,\u201d Mike said. \u201cThey discourage any kind of involvement during the first year of sobriety\u2014involvement with anybody, but especially another addict. Yet it happens all the time. Paige, it\u2019s impossible to believe he\u2019s forgotten about you, but his focus seems to be on lightening his sentencing burden right now. And maybe, a new woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t called or anything,\u201d she said. \u201cYou thought he might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Mike said. \u201cIf his mission was still custody or having you reconsider the relationship, I would have expected a call before anything else, the reason being a phone call could really annoy the judge, but if he sets foot in Virgin River to harass or threaten you in any way, he\u2019ll serve time. It\u2019s a pretty good deterrent\u2014especially to a man who\u2019s been in jail. It ain\u2019t pretty in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think we can relax?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust a little, maybe. Try to be alert. I think he\u2019ll turn up again someday. Guys like him, they nurse grudges, rarely abandon obsessions, and I don\u2019t believe they change. But he\u2019s pretty busy right now. It could be ten years before you have to deal with him again.\u201d</p><p>Preacher put his arm around her, pulling her close against him. \u201cJust the same, will you check sometimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Mike promised. \u201cEvery week.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Preacher would have expected Paige to be at least somewhat relieved; there was no question Mike had delivered good news. But he found her to be sullen. Maybe a little depressed. When the day was at a close, their special time together, and he pulled her against him, he lifted her chin and asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you a little bit happy? Is it because you can\u2019t trust him? Wes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can\u2019t. We can\u2019t. But it\u2019s the idea that I might never be really free of him, and I brought this into your life. Insanity and trouble. Maybe even danger. Oh, John...What a bad deal you got with me.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled at her, touched her lips with his. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe for one second that\u2019s how I feel. Paige, I don\u2019t care if you have an army of loaded Huns on your tail. The day you and Chris came into my life, that was the biggest miracle of my life. I wouldn\u2019t trade you for anything.\u201d</p><p>She tightened her arms around him. \u201cDo you know you\u2019re the sweetest man who ever lived?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cSee, that\u2019s the thing. Until you, I was just a fisherman and cook. Look at me now.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cNow I\u2019m not only the sweetest man alive, I\u2019m like the world\u2019s greatest lover.\u201d</p><p>That was the beauty of John. He could turn her mood that fast, by simply speaking his mind. If there was one thing she understood about him\u2014he said what he felt. \u201cYou think so, huh?\u201d she asked, smiling back at him.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see if I\u2019m getting any better. How about that, huh?\u201d</p> <p>Joey had been the first to arrive when the baby, David, was only five days old. Then Grandpa Sam, who tried very hard not to impose but found that he couldn\u2019t stay away. Mike, still parked out by Mel and Jack\u2019s, took the sofa in the RV and gave Sam his bed. Then, one at a time, Jack\u2019s sisters and a few nieces. Day after day, nearly every resident of Virgin River paid a call, bringing a covered dish or cake or plate of cookies. Weeks of visiting and celebrating seemed to pass quickly. The only member of Jack\u2019s family who hadn\u2019t yet arrived was Brie, who was in the middle of one of the biggest trials of her young career\u2014a rape trial that had become a media circus.</p><p>May brought a bright sun and flowers and deer in the yard. And a baby who was held so often, he barely needed the sheets changed in the cradle. Jack was starting to wonder if other women had had babies before Mel, because he had never seen a transformation quite as startling. Quite as distracting. She dropped a lot of that baby fat quickly, thanks to the miracle diet of breast feeding. The first thing to happen\u2014her beautiful face returned to its former oval shape with high cheekbones and she glowed with happiness. Everything about her seemed brighter. Although she complained that she had a long way to go to regain her figure, from his perspective, she\u2019d never been sexier. He worshiped her body, especially after helping her deliver their son. Her belly slowly flattened out and her breasts were full and high; her laugh was quick and contagious. And when she held and nursed his son, she seemed to shine as though there was a light within her. To Jack, she was a vision. He was dead in love.</p><p>Jack was dying. He was splitting a lot more logs and trying to avoid seeing Mel in the shower. She was having a terrible effect on him. Without that baby between them, he found himself longing for the days when he would swoop her off her feet, up into his arms, bear her quickly to the bed and fall on her, hungry. Starving. And have her meet that hunger with her own, which was impressive. He found himself fantasizing about being a little wilder, ready to revisit that heat and power they had in the beginning, before she began to swell with little David; before he felt he had to protect her from the strength of his desire.</p><p>When he kissed her these days, when she opened her mouth under his and let his tongue inside, he would groan with such depth that she knew. And she would whisper against his lips, \u201cSoon, Jack. Very soon.\u201d</p><p>Not nearly soon enough, was all he could think. It had turned him selfish and impatient. Then Brie\u2019s trial ended and she arrived. She needed a rest to recover from the trial that had gone badly for her; she needed to bond with her brother, sister-in-law and new nephew. While Jack was always happy to see his sister, especially to see her recovering very well from a difficult and disappointing trial and regaining her own former confidence in life since her divorce, the one thought that came to his mind was, now it\u2019s going to be at least another week.</p><p>Brie found that life had changed in her brother\u2019s little cabin in many ways. Mel and Jack were keeping the baby next to their bed, and in the night and in the early mornings, she could hear him stir, fuss, and then the soft murmurings of her brother and sister-in-law. She should have known that Jack would be awake for every feeding, often getting up with David, changing him, taking him back to the bed to Mel.</p> <p>Another new development was that RV in the clearing. In the predawn hours, she would stealthily sneak out of the cabin and sit in one of the Adirondack chairs on the porch and listen to the soft melody of the Spanish guitar that came from the open window across the yard. He didn\u2019t know she was there, that she listened, that the music stirred her. His right hand was still a little tentative as he pressed down against the strings, but with his left he plucked and strummed with skill. He stopped often to start over. She imagined that once his strength was completely restored, his guitar music must be nothing short of magnificent.</p><p>Sometimes she would lean back, close her eyes and imagine that he played for her. Mike. She\u2019d first met him years before in Sacramento during Jack\u2019s last leave before he left for Iraq, Jack\u2019s final assignment. Brie was newly married then. She had seen him again at Mel and Jack\u2019s wedding\u2014they almost qualified as old friends. His name was really Miguel\u2014she knew that. Although born in the U.S., he had managed to stay close to his cultural roots, the romance of his country. You could hear it in the music. That sexy Spanish guitar.</p><p>It had been more than six months since Brad had walked out on her. Soon she would be ready for a little attention from a man. But she would be more careful this time. She wasn\u2019t going to get hooked up to another man who lacked the power of commitment. Brie knew all about Mike\u2014he\u2019d been around Jack a long time and he was a consummate flirt. He probably fancied himself the great Latin lover; she had heard he\u2019d been though two wives and a hundred girlfriends. Small wonder. He was handsome and sexy. They probably fell at his feet. She would enjoy the music and the fantasy; the man was clearly poison.</p><p>Brie was having a wonderful visit. With baby in tow, she and Mel drove around the redwoods, went to GraceValley to see their friends, shopped in the coastal towns, visited with the locals. Mel handled the baby with such ease, wearing him in a sling around her body. And when she felt like a break, she would lengthen the straps on that baby carrier so that they fit Jack just right and pass his son to him. People in Virgin River were getting accustomed to being served a drink by a man with a baby slung around him.</p><p>On a typical dinner hour at the bar, Mel left Brie and Mike at the table and handed off her son to her husband so she could visit the powder room. Every time she passed David to Jack, his eyes would grow soft and warm, filled with love and pride as he took the baby. And then as he watched his wife walk away from him, another expression would creep into his features. The angle of his gaze lowered to her butt, and there was tension in his jaw.</p><p>\u201cMy brother,\u201d Brie said to Mike one day as they sat companionably together in the bar. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see him like this, with a wife and son. He seems beyond happy. Though every once in a while I think I see a worried look on his face. Maybe he\u2019s just overwhelmed by responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing,\u201d Mike said, having just watched Jack\u2019s face. \u201cI have four married brothers. Men talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do they talk about?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>Instead of answering, he asked, \u201cHow old is David now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost six weeks. Why?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and covered Brie\u2019s hand. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come fishing with me tomorrow? You can borrow Mel\u2019s gear and her waders. We could stay out on the river for hours.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand out from under his. \u201cOh, thanks, but Mel and I were going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could tell Mel and Jack that you\u2019re going to be out on the river for hours,\u201d he said. \u201cHours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cBrie, you\u2019d have a good time. I guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>She leaned closer. \u201cListen, Mike\u2014understand something. I\u2019m here to see Mel and Jack and the baby, not to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the bar and saw that Mel was back, retrieving the baby. \u201cWe should get away from them for a few hours. Believe me, I wasn\u2019t thinking about us. I was thinking about them.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder at her brother and sister-in-law. They kissed just briefly over the baby\u2019s head. She glanced back at Mike. \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen that look before. If you go fishing with me tomorrow, you\u2019re not going to see that look on your brother\u2019s face after you get back. Most of those tense lines will be gone. I\u2019m pretty sure of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t much like fishing?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cJust say you\u2019re going fishing. We\u2019ll think of something else to do. Something that takes hours.\u201d</p><p>She leaned close to him. \u201cWill you bring the guitar?\u201d she whispered. She was answered by a look of shocked surprise.</p><p>When Mel came back to the table, Brie said, \u201cMel, would you be terribly disappointed if I went fishing with Mike tomorrow? If I borrowed your gear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. Gee, I didn\u2019t know you liked to fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to get a free lesson,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ll be gone most of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cYou about ready to head home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Brie said. \u201cWhat time, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about ten? I\u2019ll get Preacher to pack us a lunch.\u201d</p><p>When the women left, Mike wandered up to the bar. \u201cHow about a coffee?\u201d he asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d he said, pouring a mug.</p><p>Preacher brought a crate of glasses out of the kitchen and slipped them under the bar. \u201cHey, Preach, can I get a favor?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take Brie out to the river tomorrow. A little fishing. Can I get you to pack us a lunch? Something nice\u2014so she thinks I\u2019m debonaire? Maybe put a bottle of good wine in the basket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Preacher said, grinning.</p><p>Jack picked up a glass and used a dish towel to wipe out any water spots. \u201cYou thinking of messing with my little sister?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause she\u2019s been through a tough time and doesn\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jack.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not messing with anyone, trust me. But I figured if I kept her busy for a few hours, maybe you could mess with the baby\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Mike sipped from his mug. \u201cI\u2019ll keep her out there through nap time,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe a couple of nap times.\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned closer to Mike. \u201cYou\u2019d better not screw around with my little sister. Remember, I know you and your ways with women, and this is my sister we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cYou think I\u2019m looking to get shot again? Buddy, all that\u2019s in the past. I promise you, I\u2019ll treat Brie as a sister. You have nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the past, huh? And what brought that on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree bullets.\u201d He drank a little of his coffee, left the mug on the bar and stuck his head in the kitchen. \u201cPreach,\u201d he called. \u201cI\u2019ll be by to get my lunch at about ten tomorrow. Okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Jack found it strange that he felt even less confident about winning his wife\u2019s affection now than he had back when he\u2019d been pursuing her. He greatly regretted that he hadn\u2019t said anything to her about the fact that they could have some time alone together\u2014a major tactical miscalculation. He should have gotten an answer from her, because he dreaded going out to the cabin, lusty, all steamed up, only to have her tell him it was too soon, that she wasn\u2019t ready.</p><p>But he\u2019d said nothing, opting for a more romantic approach, surprising her in the middle of the day, wooing her, seducing her. She had also known that Brie would be out with Mike for most of the day, and Mel was not shy. She could have suggested they take advantage of the opportunity. And she hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>How does a guy know when his wife is ready for sex, right after having a baby? He knew the postpartum bleeding had long since stopped because he was the guy who threw the daily trash into the back of his truck to take into town to pitch in the Dumpster. Those little Peripads had dwindled and disappeared, replaced by more of the neat little disposable diaper bundles. And Mel\u2019s movements had gone from slow to spry; she had stopped complaining about soreness and there were no more bathtub soaks as of at least three weeks ago.</p><p>The closer he got to the cabin, the more thought he gave this adventure. She was having her appointment with John Stone in less than a week to be sure everything was all right after the birth\u2014she was undoubtedly waiting for that. When he got there, he found her finishing up with David\u2019s bath in the kitchen. \u201cWell, well,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t often see you in the middle of the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s real quiet at the bar,\u201d he said idly.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m finished here, I have to feed David and put him down,\u201d she said. And then she cooed and smiled and made faces at the baby, consumed by his needs. \u201cThen I\u2019ll get to you,\u201d she said. Again, she had her face in David\u2019s, kissing him, making funny little noises at him.</p><p>Jack went out onto the porch. He sat on the steps and hung his head. He felt like a brute. Like a horny bull who was about to steal the milk out of his baby\u2019s mouth. This was no way to claim your conjugal rights\u2014by jumping on the first opportunity you saw to take advantage of your own wife.</p> <p>He took a deep breath and lectured himself. Have a cup of coffee with your woman, he said to himself. Spend a little time with her, talk to her, work into the conversation in a soft and gentlemanly manner that you can\u2019t wait for her to be ready to take you into her bed again, in that meaningful way. Ask her if she was waiting for an all-clear from her doctor, and for God\u2019s sake, take it slow. Give her all the time she needs\u2014everything will be better that way. Being too hot to handle wasn\u2019t going to win any points now\u2014she had a baby to think about.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out there?\u201d</p><p>He turned to see her standing in the cabin door, wearing only his shirt. His heart was going to explode. He took in her full chest, her slim legs.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even have your boots off. I could have sworn you showed up to get reacquainted with your wife\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cIs that gonna happen?\u201d he asked tentatively. Hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNot a moment too soon,\u201d she said. And she turned and walked back into the house.</p> <p>His boots were off on the porch, his shirt was off in the living room, his pants were down and kicked away in the bedroom doorway.</p><p>Mel lay back on the bed, barely covered by his shirt. She began to slowly unbutton it, starting at the top. Easy, boy, he told himself. You\u2019d better find out what you\u2019re dealing with. She did just have a baby. He lay down beside her, brought her against him and, kissing her, holding her, he asked, \u201cAre you okay with this? You\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2019ll never be exactly as I was before the baby. My body has changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right? Your body is amazing to me. After what you did\u2014I\u2019m almost envious, in a weird way. I worship this body.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cYou know the last two or three months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the things we would have done if we hadn\u2019t been so incredibly pregnant? If we hadn\u2019t just had a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you please do all those things to me now? One at a time. Until you\u2019re almost dead from exhaustion. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah!\u201d</p><p>She opened the shirt to reveal her naked body, the sight of which he drank in greedily. She was fuller, rounder, so lush; there was a new richness to her shape that blew his mind. \u201cGet started, big boy. I am insane, I want you so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelinda,\u201d he said, filling his hands with her sweet body. \u201cHave I told you how much I like being married to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. Just show me.\u201d</p><p>Mike hadn\u2019t asked that the wine be packed in the picnic to get Brie relaxed or talking. He\u2019d just thought it would be a nice touch, since he was pretty sure they wouldn\u2019t be fishing. And he was right about that. Instead, they drove through a redwood grove and down to the lower, more shallow, end of the river where the bank was wide and peppered with large rocks. He spread a blanket against a huge boulder near the river\u2019s edge, under the canopy of tall trees. And there wasn\u2019t much to do on a picnic besides talk, and at her insistence, attempt the guitar. His music was so rusty, he hated subjecting her to it, but she seemed not to notice his many mistakes. She leaned back against the boulder and closed her eyes, her lips curved in a half smile, listening to him play. In years gone by, Mike would\u2019ve had her down on the blanket by now\u2014but those were years gone by.</p><p>It was hard to imagine this tiny, young-looking woman as one of the toughest prosecutors in the Sacramento Valley. She was a little thing in slim jeans and moccasins, a light blue chambray shirt tied at the waist. Her hair was loose, a thick, light-brown mane that fell down her back almost to her waist. She had the most flawless ivory skin that would feel like silk under a man\u2019s hands. As he played, she let her warm brown eyes drift closed; her rosy lips tilted in appreciation.</p><p>Brie shivered in the breeze and Mike put aside the guitar. He went back to the car and got his jacket out of the backseat. He took it to her, spreading it over her shoulders, and watched, his eyes warming, as she pulled it tighter around her. Then he saw her sniff the collar and he grew weak. He did not think of her as a sister.</p><p>\u201cJudging by your music, the arm is almost fully recovered,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAlmost back,\u201d he said, sitting on the blanket again. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to recover one hundred percent, or damn close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd everything else is healed, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything,\u201d he surprised himself by saying. \u201cEvery once in a while I have trouble getting the right word and I worry about my brain\u2014but I notice that more than anyone else, so I could be overreacting. And I was shot in the groin. Bad spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. He could tell she didn\u2019t want to ask.</p><p>\u201cNothing life-threatening,\u201d he said. Nothing for you to worry about, he wanted to add. You don\u2019t have to go to Jack and ask if they shot it off.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re thinking of staying here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cMy friends are here. It\u2019s quiet and peaceful. There\u2019s no pressure.\u201d He laughed a little. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of that. I\u2019ve lived in your world. When I was on the job, I worked with a lot of D.A.\u2019s. You\u2019re what\u2014thirty? Thirty-one? And locking people up for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs many as possible. And I\u2019m thirty. Thirty and already married and divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s not exactly a scar on your face, Brie. The way Jack tells it, it didn\u2019t have anything to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does Jack tell it?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>Mike looked down. Blunder number two, he thought. First, the shot to the groin, then the divorce tales. He raised his eyes. \u201cJack said that Brad wanted the divorce. That you were devastated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad cheated on me with my best friend,\u201d she said. \u201cHe left me and moved in with her and I pay him alimony. Her husband pays her alimony and child support. I gave him a big check for his half of the house and you know what he said? He said, \u2018Brie, I hope we can be friends.\u2019\u201d She gave a little laugh that carried all the weight of her anger.</p><p>\u201cAh, Dios,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that happened. Tu no mereces esto. You don\u2019t deserve that,\u201d he translated.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with some men?\u201d she asked him angrily. \u201cWhy would a guy do something like that?\u201d</p><p>He laughed ruefully. \u201cAt least I never did that,\u201d he said, mostly to himself. And then he wondered how he had managed to escape that indiscretion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have a multitude of things to be forgiven for,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Brie? I made so many mistakes, I can\u2019t even count \u2019em. And I know better than to think I\u2019ll ever be forgiven. If I made a million mistakes, I had at least that many excuses. Brad might end up like me\u2014really sorry. And really too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCops,\u201d she said with some disgust. \u201cYou guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on\u2014it\u2019s not just cops. Although, I\u2019ll grant you, a lot of guys with slick uniforms and a gun can make it with the girls pretty easy. But if that\u2019s the kind of guy he turned out to be, you\u2019re better off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your ex-wives better off without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he answered with an embarrassed shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cSmall comfort,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBrie, you\u2019re beautiful and brilliant and strong. A man who would cheat on someone like you, just flat-ass doesn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d He reached out and covered her hand with his. \u201cYou are too valuable, Brie, to be stuck with a man like that.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand out from under his. \u201cAnd what did you do to screw up your marriages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was completely irresponsible,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew how to be a lover, not how to love. Men take such a long time to become men, I think. Women have it easier\u2014you at least grow up before you\u2019re old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ve finally grown up, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cNearly getting killed tends to get your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you could start over? What would you change?\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment. \u201cFor starters, I wouldn\u2019t marry so fast. Not until I found the right woman, the kind of feeling that leaves no doubt. Jack did it right\u2014he avoided commitment until the real thing came along. So did Preacher, although I\u2019m not sure he did that on purpose. It\u2019s obvious they found that lifetime thing, that forever thing, though it didn\u2019t come to either of them early. Or easily. I didn\u2019t wait for that. I prowled and hunted, but I think the hunt was more important to me than what I would catch.\u201d He lifted his dark brows. \u201cI admit I was stupid. Oh, mija, you don\u2019t know what I\u2019d give to start over.\u201d He leaned toward her and said, \u201cIf I had a woman like you in my life, I think I would know what I had.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cGood God, you\u2019re so obvious. You\u2019re coming on to me!\u201d</p><p>Some habits die so hard, he thought. But he was close enough to smell her sweet perfume and it addled his brain a little bit. \u201cDios, no! I wouldn\u2019t dare! I\u2019m admiring you, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can stop admiring me\u2014I\u2019m never getting within a hundred miles of another one of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother one of\u2014me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been through two wives and a million other women. Not exactly a good r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Mike.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back on his hands and smiled at her. \u201cFor a little while, I thought you liked me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She lifted her eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m not about to be tricked by a flirtatious man.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIf you are, it will be kept in confidence, Brie,\u201d he said, smiling at her.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a beautiful place,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy are there no fishermen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too shallow here for the bigger fish. This is where the young people come to be alone,\u201d he said. \u201cDown here where the grass is soft, the trees tall, and there are a few large boulders to hide behind. The river whispers past them while they whisper to each other. That old rock you\u2019re leaning against\u2014it has seen some delicious things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most delicious thing it\u2019s going to see today is Preacher\u2019s lunch,\u201d she said, but she smiled when she said it.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he said, teasing. \u201cI admit, I was pretty worried. I wondered\u2014if I gave you wine and music and you began to seduce me, how would I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of it?\u201d she asked, amused.</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly, mija.\u201d He grinned. \u201cHow would I keep Jack from killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, Mike, it\u2019s not personal, but Jack isn\u2019t in charge of what I do. He thinks he is. But he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig brothers,\u201d Mike said. \u201cVery annoying people...\u201d Then he sobered and said, \u201cI am sorry about the divorce, Brie. And the trial. I don\u2019t know many of the details, but Jack said it was a terrible experience for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse than terrible,\u201d she said. She pulled her hair out of the collar of his jacket and shook it down her back, looking upward. He found himself hoping a few strands would remain when he reclaimed it. \u201cThere are a lot of scary people out there to put away, some worse than others. It was a hard one to lose...one of the biggest trials of my career\u2014a serial rapist\u2014and I lost. He walked, and he\u2019s guilty as hell. That\u2019s not going to happen to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy witnesses, my victims ran like rabbits. I can\u2019t prove it, but I suspect he threatened them. If I ever get another crack at him, I\u2019m going to put him away for life. But that kind of criminal just pulls a territorial. He\u2019s going to get out of town\u2014it\u2019s what they do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt took a lot of strength to take that on,\u201d he said in admiration. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d He stood up and put out his hand to her. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to come back in a little while and break my heart, mija,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now, let\u2019s go back to town. Let\u2019s grab a cup of coffee and give the lovers another hour together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreaking a few hearts interests me,\u201d she said, putting her hand in his to stand. But when they were both standing, she didn\u2019t pull her hand away.</p><p>He should have let go and stooped to gather up their blanket, but he didn\u2019t want to release her hand, small and soft but strong in his. He smiled at her. \u201cI think the last time I had this feeling come over me when a girl held my hand, I was thirteen. You\u2019ll be good at it, I think. Breaking hearts.\u201d Still, she didn\u2019t pull away, didn\u2019t break the spell. It was he who finally let go, stooping to close up their basket, pick up the blanket. He handed her the folded blanket. \u201cThank you for today, Brie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a nice day,\u201d she said, her smile genuine. \u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to have any trouble finding the right word.\u201d</p><p>And, Mike thought, there are no words for what I\u2019m starting to feel....</p><p>Paige walked out the bar\u2019s back door with a plastic garbage bag in her hand, tied off tightly so as to not let a whiff of garbage escape to tempt the wildlife. She went across the wide dirt yard where she, John, Jack and often Rick liked to park their vehicles. The Dumpster sat under a big old tree and was used by everyone on the street, not just the bar. She lifted the heavy lid, but before she could toss the bag in, her wrist was grabbed in a vicelike grip and she was pulled around to the side, out of sight of the bar or the street. The garbage bag dropped to the ground and she felt something hard and cold under chin. She gasped, staring into the lethal eyes of her ex-husband, the business end of a rifle lifting her chin.</p><p>\u201cYou made this easy,\u201d Wes Lassiter said, his voice low and dangerous. \u201cI thought I\u2019d have to go in after you. We have two choices. You can come with me right now, nice and quiet, or we can walk back in through that door, do a little shooting in the right places, and get my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGod. No.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did this to me, Paige. You could always find a way to provoke me, to make me crazy. You sent me to fucking prison!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged softly. \u201cAnything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, Paige. Try me. It\u2019s just you, right now. Or the three of us, and him out of the picture.\u201d</p><p>She blinked once, tears squeezing out of her eyes and running down her cheeks. Instead of praying John would hear and come, she prayed he wouldn\u2019t. If it was just her, Christopher would be all right. John would never let anything happen to him, would raise him right. She let herself be led to an old truck that sat behind the Dumpster. He pushed her in through the driver\u2019s door, slipping in next to her.</p><p>\u201cWes,\u201d she said, her voice shaking, tears running down her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to make this so much worse. Not just for me, but for you.\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her, his eyes narrowed, but even so she could see that his pupils were pinpoints. He was high. He laughed cruelly. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Paige,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m finally going to get out of this mess.\u201d He started the truck, cut a U-turn behind the Dumpster and drove in the opposite direction of the bar rather than past it. Paige strained, but didn\u2019t see a single person on the street, no one on their porches. And no one saw her as far as she could tell.</p><p>She knew better than to try to reason with him. This surpassed any nightmare of her life. She knew that John wouldn\u2019t let very much time pass before looking out the kitchen\u2019s back door to see that bag of trash lying there, abandoned. She made up her mind\u2014she would throw herself from the truck and if she survived it, she\u2019d run. But not until they were farther away from town. Not until John had time to see something was terribly wrong and could protect himself and Christopher.</p><p>Wes didn\u2019t speak. The rifle lay across his lap and he sat forward in the truck, gripping the steering wheel. That tense jaw and the narrowed eyes that she remembered too well bore down on the road as they trundled along. The shocks on the truck were bad, the seat hard, bouncing her around. They were driving down the mountain, heading in the direction of Highway 101, which could take them to any of the local cities where they bought supplies\u2014Garberville, Fortuna or Eureka. Or even as far south as L.A. if he kept going. They only passed a few vehicles, and none that she recognized.</p><p>After ten minutes of a silent drive, he exited at Alderpoint and went back up the mountain in the direction of Virgin River. This road could take them not through Virgin River, but around it. At least she knew roughly where she was. In a sudden and desperate move, she grabbed at the handle on the door and furiously tried to open it. She looked around for a lock, pushing on the door at the same time, but it wouldn\u2019t give. She popped the little button on the door next to the window\u2014up and down, up and down, moving the handle, pushing. Nothing.</p><p>Her upper arm was gripped hard and she turned her watering, terrified eyes toward Wes. He scowled blackly, then his frown dissolved into mean grin. \u201cJammed, Paige. How stupid do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and asked, \u201cDo you plan to leave our son without a mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said with terrifying calm. \u201cBut not until I\u2019m sure I\u2019m leaving him without a potential stepfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she whispered weakly. \u201cWhy, Wes? John hasn\u2019t done anything to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he asked. \u201cOnly took my family away from me. Got my family to turn against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what happened, Wes. I ran from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you did, Paige. And if it wasn\u2019t for that guy, you\u2019d still be running. Running and running, and I would find you and find you. But what you did\u2014ending it forever and sending me to fucking prison, that was his doing. We both know you don\u2019t have the guts for that.\u201d He turned his head toward her and grinned meanly. \u201cHe\u2019ll come after you, you know he will.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m bait, she thought. Nothing but bait.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind a piece of that other one, either,\u201d he said. \u201cSheridan.\u201d</p><p>Something came over Paige. It seemed to rise within her from her core. You don\u2019t have the guts for that.... The thought that this dangerous lunatic would ruthlessly, without conscience, hurt John and his own son sizzled inside her like boiling oil. Her fear slowly gave way to rage. \u201cYou\u2019re going to burn in hell,\u201d she whispered. But he couldn\u2019t hear her above the noise of the old pickup.</p><p>When Brie and Mike walked into the bar it was deserted, but they could hear Preacher in the kitchen, and even muffled, his voice sounded riled up. Mike walked back to the kitchen to find him pacing with the phone in his hand, talking faster than Mike could ever remember; Preacher never said much, and when he did, it was measured and slow. Not so now. Before he could get a grasp of what Preacher was saying, he heard, \u201cMike\u2019s back. Come on, then. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Preacher hung up the phone and looked at Mike. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. Something happened. Paige. She took out some trash and she\u2019s gone. It\u2019s lying out there on the ground by the Dumpster and she didn\u2019t come back in. I\u2019ve got Chris sleeping upstairs and can\u2019t leave. I called Jack\u2014he\u2019s coming back to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call Connie\u2019s? Doc\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long ago?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cFifteen minutes or less. I would\u2019ve looked outside sooner, but I was rolling dough and thought maybe she\u2019d slipped by me and just went to our room. I gotta go down the street, see if she\u2019s around....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. I\u2019ll go, too,\u201d Mike said. \u201cBrie will stay here, stay with Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wrong,\u201d Preacher said, shaking his head. \u201cThis is all wrong. She doesn\u2019t do things like this. She always says where she\u2019s going. She\u2019s real, real careful.\u201d</p><p>Mike and Brie connected eyes. Brie frowned. \u201cGo check with the neighbors.\u201d She slipped a hand inside her purse and pulled out a wallet. She opened it and withdrew a business card and lifted the phone off the hook. Preacher was out the back door, fast.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>She leveled her steady gaze on him. \u201cThat it\u2019s wrong, like he said. Go on, and hurry back. Maybe you can get one of the neighbors to help you knock on doors. I\u2019ll make a couple of calls. See if I can learn anything.\u201d</p><p>Mike went the other direction, back to his SUV. He unlocked the glove box and pulled out his revolver, just to be ready. He hooked it on his belt and caught up with Preacher down the street. By the time they got down to Joy\u2019s house and the Carpenters\u2019, they had two women who were willing to do the door-knocking so they could go back to the bar. \u201cBe sure to ask, everywhere you go, if any strange vehicles have been seen, if any unusual noises were heard,\u201d Mike instructed.</p><p>Just as they returned, Jack was getting out of his truck followed by Mel with the baby bundled against her. Rick pulled up behind the bar, reporting to work after school. They all walked in together to find Brie standing behind the bar, a very unhappy look on her face. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cThe A.D.A. is contacting the sheriff and local police in the larger towns. Someone is going to try to locate Lassiter in L.A., see if he can be found. I\u2019ve reported Paige missing. Maybe this can be cleared up with a few phone calls. Meanwhile, let\u2019s see if we can find her around here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Preacher\u2019s face fell. \u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d he said in a breath. \u201cHe did this. I know he did this....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that he came here, Preacher,\u201d Brie said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that could\u2019ve happened. Paige wouldn\u2019t disappear like that. Her car\u2019s here, f\u2019chrissakes. Her purse. Her son!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of a crime. Yet,\u201d Brie said. She reached into her purse again, this time pulling out a Glock 9 mm. She slid it out of its holster and checked it for a full magazine and one in the chamber, then returned it, tucking it into the holster and her purse. \u201cYou men should go look around town, call the outlying farms and ranches from Connie\u2019s and Doc\u2019s to keep this phone clear. Somebody look in that old church, very carefully,\u201d she said. \u201cMel and I will stay here with Chris, and if we have any trouble, I can take care of it. I\u2019ll answer the phone here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re carrying?\u201d Mike asked, stepping toward her.</p><p>\u201cHmm. It was necessary,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yes, I know how to use it. And no, I\u2019m not afraid to do so.\u201d</p><p>Preacher was already out the door when Jack said, \u201cNecessary?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all that unusual to be threatened,\u201d she said. \u201cNot for a person in my job. The people I prosecute are dangerous, often violent. And...I no longer have an armed husband in the house, you\u2019ll remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said unhappily. The idea of his baby sister being threatened just added to the tension he was suddenly feeling. He agreed with Preacher\u2014something bad was going on. Paige had relaxed quite a bit, but she was still very skittish about being far from Preacher\u2014it had only been about eight weeks since Lassiter got out of jail. He went to use Doc\u2019s phone to get Jim Post en route to Virgin River from Grace Valley, in case they had to extend their search. Jim had worked undercover for the DEA before retiring and marrying June Hudson and he knew a lot about hidden camps back in the mountains.</p><p>In an hour nothing turned up in town, nor had anyone on the ranches and farms they called seen or heard anything. But then the bad news came via phone. A couple of calls had revealed that Wes Lassiter had purchased airfare to Eureka from L.A. the day before. He couldn\u2019t possibly have carried a firearm with him unless it had been secretly and illegally packed in checked baggage, but he had rented a car. And there had been one truck theft in Fortuna in the early hours of the morning. A farmer\u2019s \u201983 Ford, tan, went missing. There had been a rifle in the rack.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got her,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cThat\u2019s it, he\u2019s got her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf that\u2019s true, they\u2019re going to find that rented car not far from the farmer\u2019s property,\u201d Brie said. \u201cFortuna police are taking a look around immediately.\u201d</p><p>Preacher went straight to his quarters while everyone stood around, looking at one another. Within five minutes he was back, putting a couple of vests, rifles and sidearms on one of the tables. He also had jackets and flashlights, because night would come and it would get cold and dark. He was ready to move, whether or not he had more information.</p><p>Mike went to his vehicle and came back with his own rifle, bulletproof vest and down vest. There was no reason for him to carry a bulletproof vest in his vehicle, but when he worked gangs he always had it with him, in case anything that included gunfire was going down when he was in the area. Ever since Lassiter was released, he\u2019d been at the ready.</p><p>Jack shook his head and left to fetch gear from the back of his own truck. When he\u2019d been throwing stuff in the back of the truck, he\u2019d been thinking\u2014she\u2019ll turn up. It\u2019ll end up she was down the street, sitting on Lydie Sudder\u2019s porch, having tea, enjoying the afternoon sunshine. But Preacher didn\u2019t overreact, and on the off chance something sinister was going on, Jack wanted to be prepared. Mel had said, \u201cOh, for the love of God! Isn\u2019t this a little over the top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d he had said. \u201cI really hope so.\u201d</p><p>When he got back inside, Rick was putting on one of the bulletproof vests. \u201cUh, Rick. I\u2019m thinking the women could use someone here in town....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet Doc,\u201d Rick said, pulling on the vest, very big on him because it was one of Preacher\u2019s, and slapping the Velcro straps tight. \u201cDoc can help over here. He\u2019s a fair shot.\u201d</p><p>Now, shrugging into his own flak jacket, Jack said to Preacher, \u201cTell me your plan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jack. My head is empty. I just know I have to try to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Okay, here\u2019s the deal. The sheriff, Highway Patrol and Department of Forestry will be getting descriptions of vehicles and Paige. They\u2019ll have control of the roads, so we\u2019ll concentrate on going back in the woods. We\u2019ll look for old logging roads or broken-down brush indicating a vehicle passage. If he has that old truck, he won\u2019t be off road\u2014he\u2019ll need a road to traverse. We\u2019ll wait for Jim Post. He knows the area pretty well\u2014maybe better than we do. We\u2019ll concentrate on finding campsites, evidence of movement, maybe a hidden vehicle....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could be far away by now,\u201d Rick interrupted.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not going far,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cHe can\u2019t get away, not with Paige. Paige has changed since him\u2014she doesn\u2019t go along quietly anymore. This show-off guy with the three-million-dollar house\u2014he\u2019s not running back to L.A., to some cheap-ass hovel with the woman he thinks is his woman. If he\u2019s got her, he had to kidnap her. He\u2019s not running. He\u2019s hiding. He\u2019s gonna do something bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher could be right,\u201d Mike said. \u201cRick, we need maps of Trinity and Humboldt counties. Run over to Connie\u2019s and get some. We\u2019ll plot a course, select rendezvous points. That way we can get back here for new information. Jack, got a couple cases of bottled water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher, are there pictures of Paige somewhere? Maybe in her wallet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see,\u201d he said, going immediately.</p><p>People started moving again, getting things handled. About forty minutes had passed as they gathered up weapons and studied maps when Jim Post walked in, already fully dressed out\u2014the flak jacket under his shirt obvious, wearing sidearms. He took a glance at the search rings and rendezvous points when the phone rang in the kitchen. Brie went to answer it and came back into the bar, grim-faced. \u201cIt\u2019s not good news. Fortuna found the rented car. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s got to be him. In the truck.\u201d</p><p>Preacher went to Mel, who stood nervously jiggling the baby against her shoulder. \u201cMel, Chris is gonna be up from his nap pretty soon. You can keep him from getting worried, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. She put her small hand against his face and said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed briefly. \u201cIt\u2019s already not okay, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn?\u201d came a small voice. There, standing in the doorway from the kitchen, was Chris with his favorite snugly toy, the one with the blue-and-gray plaid flannel leg. \u201cWhat\u2019cha doing, John?\u201d</p><p>Preacher\u2019s face melted into a soft smile and he went to the boy. He lifted him into his arms. \u201cHuntin\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a little huntin.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mom?\u201d</p><p>Preacher kissed his pink cheek. \u201cShe\u2019ll be back pretty soon. She\u2019s off on errands. And you\u2019re going to stay with Mel and Brie while we\u2019re huntin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>While Wes drove, he talked. He didn\u2019t look at Paige\u2014his eyes were roving a little wildly, as though looking for something he\u2019d misplaced. She wondered if it was drugs or if he was lost back in these hills, for he often seemed to be driving in circles. He\u2019d start up a road, then either turn around or back out. But while this was going on, she listened.</p><p>She learned how much he hated his life in L.A.; the woman was just a means to an end\u2014she had a place he could stay. There was no way he was going to check in with some state flunky every week, go to those stupid meetings every day, but he knew how to play the game. And they had random drug tests, he said. \u201cDid you know that? They want my pee on a regular basis.\u201d Then he laughed. \u201cThere\u2019re a lot of places to get good pee.\u201d And that\u2019s when she knew\u2014he\u2019d managed to stay one step ahead of them for at least two months. He was using something, and if he wasn\u2019t already just plain crazy, the drugs were helping it along.</p><p>Paige didn\u2019t respond. She listened and watched. Not only was it dark back here in the trees on these winding roads, but the sun was lowering. Although it was May, it was cold in the forest at night and she shivered. She had no idea where they were.</p><p>\u201cYou have any idea what it\u2019s like in jail?\u201d He turned his face sharply toward her. \u201cEver see a prison movie, Paige? It\u2019s worse than the worst prison movie you ever saw.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin, thinking, Do they beat you, Wes? What\u2019s that like? Huh? But she said nothing.</p><p>\u201cStill can\u2019t believe you did that to me. I just fucking can\u2019t believe it! Like you didn\u2019t know how much I loved you! Jesus, I gave you everything. Ever think you\u2019d live in a house like the one I built you? Ever think so? I took you out of that dump you were in and put you in a decent place, a place with some class. What did you ever need that I didn\u2019t give you?\u201d And on and on he ranted. While she listened, the first thought that came was that he was so delusional, it was as shocking as frightening. He really believed that a nice house, some material things, could make the abuse tolerable.</p><p>She thought about John\u2014kind, loving John. She remembered what he\u2019d said about being afraid. They teach you to fake brave. Every muscle in her body seemed to tremble with her rising anger. She would be damned if she\u2019d let this delusional maniac take that sweet man away from her, away from Chris.</p><p>And the next thing that occurred to her\u2014he never mentioned Christopher. Not since earlier, as he was abducting her\u2014and that was only to leverage her, not because he wanted his son. He\u2019d never wanted a son, never wanted children at all. He hadn\u2019t touched her sexually while she was expecting; it was as if a baby coming disrupted his focus. It was always supposed to be just the two of them.</p><p>She should have known those fierce beatings had been intended so that she\u2019d lose the baby. It was a miracle she had Chris.</p><p>He drove up a spiraling road that ended at the top of a small rise with only a few trees. Looking down, she could see not only the road that wound its way upward, but the connecting road below. She noted a truck down there, whizzing past and disappearing around the mountain.</p><p>\u201cThis should be fine,\u201d he said, putting the truck in Park and killing the engine.</p><p>\u201cFine for what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He looked over at her, and while his expression was mean, he put his hand against her cheek. Gently. She shuddered at his touch. He hadn\u2019t hit her yet, and that\u2019s what he did best.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just run?\u201d she asked in a whisper. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want to face court again, or the possibility of prison, why didn\u2019t you run? You have money, Wes. You might\u2019ve gotten away.\u201d</p><p>He gave a huff of laughter. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand much about probation, do you, Paige? My passport was confiscated. Besides, the more I thought about it, about you and me, I decided it would go better like this. We\u2019ll just end it like this.\u201d He gave her a half smile, then reached under the seat and grabbed on to a roll of heavy duct tape. \u201cCome on, Paige. We\u2019re getting out here.\u201d</p><p>Jack, Preacher, Jim Post, Mike and Rick lit out at about four, an hour after Paige went missing. They left a rough map behind showing the same rendezvous points as the ones on the map Jack carried. They\u2019d cut widening circles around Virgin River. If they didn\u2019t find anything right away, they planned to swing back through town by eight, and again by midnight, to see if Paige had turned up or been recovered by police. But none of them planned to quit before she was found. They left in two trucks, drove first north of town into the hills. They parked along a wide curve in the road and, with flashlights, went into the trees on foot, looking for any kind of trail to track. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Whenever they came across a home or vehicle, they stopped and showed a picture of Paige and gave descriptions of the stolen truck and Wes Lassiter.</p><p>When they went back to Virgin River at eight, they found Buck Anderson and his three grown sons, Doug Carpenter and Fish Bristol, Ron and Bruce, and a few other men. Everyone took a glance at the map and this time they headed toward Highway 36, winding up into the mountains of Trinity County. Brie was able to tell them that the sheriff\u2019s department and CHP had nothing new to report.</p> <p>While the majority of the trucks of men pressed on, Jack, Preacher and Jim stopped in Clear River. While Preacher and Jim talked to people on the street, Jack went into an old, familiar haunt of his\u2014a little bar served by a waitress he\u2019d been seeing before Mel came into his life. He viewed sentimentally the way her eyes lit up when she saw him enter. Charmaine was a handsome woman, older than Jack by about ten years, and one of the most kindhearted women he knew.</p><p>\u201cHiya, Bub. It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharmaine,\u201d he said with a nod. \u201cI\u2019m not here on a social call. Woman from our town has gone missing,\u201d he said, flashing a picture. \u201cWe suspect an abusive ex-husband, recently released from jail. The woman, her name is Paige, is my cook\u2019s girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw Jesus, Jack, that\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s out looking. Can I get you to spread the word to anyone who happens in here for a drink?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou bet I will.\u201d</p><p>So Jack described the missing truck, the ex-husband, and explained they weren\u2019t positive of the connection, but it was likely he had her\u2014Paige was afraid of him and wouldn\u2019t have gone off. Her car and purse were left behind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell anyone who\u2019ll listen,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He turned to go and then turned back. \u201cI\u2019m married now.\u201d</p><p>She gave a nod. \u201cI heard that. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a new baby. A son. About six weeks ago.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cIt worked out, then.\u201d</p><p>He gave a nod.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have been worth a damn if it hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the God\u2019s truth. Anything you can do about this, Charmaine, I\u2019d consider it a personal favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be doing it for you, Jack. We all help one another out in times like this. Bet it\u2019s cold out there, even though it\u2019s almost summer. I hope she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>When he left, a man in a denim jacket who wore a shady brady on his head slid down from the other end of the bar, sidling closer to Charmaine. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk now?\u201d she asked with a smile, giving the bar a wipe. \u201cYou probably heard\u2014a woman from Virgin River\u2019s gone missing. They suspect her ex-husband, just out of jail, maybe driving a stolen \u201983 Ford truck. Tan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat a fact?\u201d He finished his beer, put down a ten dollar bill, touched his hat and quit the bar.</p><p>Paige understood what was happening now. Wes sat her on the ground, her back up against a tree, and with duct tape, bound her hands in front of her, her ankles together, and put a strip across her lips. \u201cThat looks good on you, Paige,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk back for once.\u201d</p><p>He positioned a couple of flashlights on her to bring her into sight in the dark. Then for the better part of an hour, sat on the ground not far from her and talked about the disappointments of his life, from the unhappy childhood he\u2019d suffered to the short jail term, which to hear him describe it could\u2019ve been years. He had many complaints about their marriage\u2014apparently in his mind, the strife had been entirely her fault. She drove him to abuse with her needling, her dissidence. But he spoke slowly. He had the calm and stoic composure of a suicidal man.</p><p>He had decided that Paige would draw John in search, and perhaps Jack, as well; they weren\u2019t far away from the town, which was why it had seemed he was driving in circles. Up here, he would see their vehicles approach. When Wes was done talking, he left the truck on the top of the hill in plain view, close to where she sat, flipped on the flashlights and went into the trees from where he could watch the approach of any rescuers. He planned to shoot John, then Paige and himself. \u201cI\u2019m done with this charade,\u201d he said. \u201cYou win.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>Though Paige, tape across her lips, couldn\u2019t respond, he couldn\u2019t stop her from thinking. And what she thought was, you have no idea about John. John and his friends. They\u2019re not only stronger than you, they\u2019re smarter. And then she closed her eyes and prayed, Please let them be the most clever they\u2019ve ever been.</p><p>By the time the moon was rising, the search party was up to more than twenty men, some of whom were grumbling about the wisdom of searching the dense wood for Paige at night when she could already be in San Francisco or even headed for Los Angeles. And if she were being held in the wood, it could be impossible\u2014she might be lost in the vast acreage and never found.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about not finding her, Preach?\u201d Rick asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about finding her too late,\u201d he said.</p><p>They had traversed mountain roads, old logging roads, paths and trails, shone strong flashlights into ravines and gullies, but there was nothing. In the back of Jack\u2019s truck were harnesses and ropes in case they saw something down a hill and had to rapell down the steep glide to get close, but so far that had not been necessary. Most of them were fighting exhaustion, but Preacher was driven, and as long as he was driven his friends hung in there with him.</p><p>A man who had no name other than Dan had been having a drink at a bar in Clear River when he overheard the details of the search in the area and he thought he\u2019d seen the truck earlier. There was probably more than one old tan Ford around these hills, but there had been a man and woman inside; the man was gripping the wheel pretty intensely, glaring through the windshield, driving nervously. Dan was a trained observer and he had taken note of that before even hearing of the suspected abduction.</p><p>Dan was a known illegal grower in the area. He\u2019d gotten a little friendly with other growers over time; they were a real tight-knit group. Slow to trust. They could sniff one another out easily\u2014they bought the stuff growers bought, they carried chicken manure to their grow sites in the back of trucks, pulled wads of stinky bills out of their pockets, but they never showed one another their sites or plants. After about three years, he\u2019d gotten into their circle.</p><p>Most of them lived with their grow, but Dan preferred hired help. That gave him the freedom to move around at will, rather than being stuck in one place. It also allowed him to set up a lot of grow sites all around the three counties. And live somewhere else, away from all those folks he\u2019d worked so hard to get tight with.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t offer to join the search\u2014they might have a problem with that. Nor did he mention he\u2019d poke around on his own. But he\u2019d been in that Virgin River bar a few times and had seen the woman, the cook\u2019s girl. The owner\u2019s wife, the local midwife, had done him a favor a while back; a woman who worked for him had surprised him with a baby coming and he thought he\u2019d better get some help. Turned out to be a damned good thing he had. Without Mel Sheridan\u2019s help, that baby wouldn\u2019t have made it. That was not to mention that he\u2019d rear-ended the midwife not so long ago and they\u2019d been real civilized about it.</p><p>He\u2019d spent a lot of time roaming back here in these mountains and knew his way around. He decided to have a look in places maybe no one else would think of. If anything turned up, maybe he could return a favor. Anonymously.</p><p>He knew exactly where to hide his truck off the roads, exactly where the abandoned logging roads and hidden trails were. He didn\u2019t always wear a sidearm, but on this mission he did. If the woman had indeed been taken by a dangerous ex, it could get ugly. The night was dark, but he knew where he was going and kept the flashlight on dim, pointed down. From time to time he\u2019d see that search convoy whir by in a fleet of trucks, so he knew they weren\u2019t looking where he was looking and that alone kept him going.</p><p>That young woman, the cook\u2019s girl, she seemed a nice young woman, about the same age and size as Dan\u2019s own wife. Ex-wife now, but he really couldn\u2019t imagine what he\u2019d have done if she\u2019d been taken from him like that. He\u2019d probably go crazy.</p><p>The moon was rising when he came upon the truck and the woman. One look told him something bad was going down. What was the point in leaving a woman tied up against a tree, flashlights illuminating her, the vehicle in sight, unless it was some kind of trap. He thought maybe she was dead and booby-trapped, but then he saw her move. She lifted her head, shivered and leaned her head back against the tree. Maybe she was alive and booby-trapped, and that made him sick to even think about it. As far as he could see, there was no one else there. He peered into the truck windows and bed\u2014no one.</p><p>He tucked the flashlight into his belt and backed soundlessly down the dirt road. All the way down, until he could curve around to the left and start back up. The most obvious place to look would be right in front of her. Once he reached the bottom of the trail and prepared to start up, he was faced with two major challenges. One, he couldn\u2019t use a flashlight and it was darker than Hades. And two, he couldn\u2019t trip or slip in the dark and make a noise, in case he was right, and there was someone watching her.</p><p>He planned to cut a wide perimeter around the woman, and if he found nothing, no one, he\u2019d move closer to her and assess. Look for some trap attached to her.</p><p>He\u2019d barely begun the climb back up when the moon, high and full, cut a brightened path, for which he was incredibly grateful. Every time that nighttime breeze sifted through the branches of the tallest pines, creating a whispering and groaning effect, he\u2019d cautiously place a foot. A couple of times he cracked a twig, and when that happened, he froze and listened. He was stone still; he didn\u2019t even breathe.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t very far up the hill when he could see there was someone at the top, hiding behind a tree. He heard the distant approach of vehicles and lifted his head. Under the cover of the engine noises, he rapidly made his descent back to the road. He chose his place under the cover of forest to stand in the road and, whirling his flashlight, flagged them down.</p><p>Jack lowered his window. \u201cWhat the hell...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d Dan said quietly. \u201cPass this hill slowly so it looks like you\u2019re moving on, and up there on the left, there\u2019s a wide space in the road. Take your trucks off road up there, come back on foot and I\u2019ll take you up. Kill the flashlights. They\u2019re up there,\u201d he said, giving his head a jerk toward the hill. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Preacher leaned forward. \u201cShe okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, so far. Come on, come on, let\u2019s not get his attention. Pass the hill.\u201d</p><p>Jack threw the truck into gear and drove on, the man by the road directing the second truck with his flashlight.</p><p>Dan waited a few moments and then he could hear them coming on foot. When there were five men gathered around him, he said, \u201cHe\u2019s got a plan. The woman is bound and in plain sight and I caught a glimpse of him in the trees, hiding. I couldn\u2019t see him, but I bet he\u2019s got a weapon on her, waiting. This old road goes to the top where he\u2019s parked the truck. Someone can follow me up the back side of the hill\u2014but there\u2019s no path. Anyone here good at stepping light and soundless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Jim said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep your back\u2014I\u2019m pretty good,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019ll circle up. You boys, take this road up nice and easy. Maybe one flashlight, dimmed, on the ground. Give us a head start\u2014we don\u2019t have a road. With any luck, we\u2019ll meet up there.\u201d</p><p>Before he could lead Jim and Mike around to the backside of the hill, he found his jacket grabbed up in Jack\u2019s fist. \u201cWhy you doing this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cHey, I was in the bar in Clear River when you came in,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cI know the hills back here pretty good. You don\u2019t think I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jim Post put a big arm between Jack and Dan and said, \u201cLet\u2019s do this. C\u2019mon. We\u2019ll sort it out later.\u201d</p> <p>And with that the team separated\u2014Jack, Preacher and Rick up the road, single file, Preacher in front, moving a little too fast, Mike, Jim and Dan rounding the foot of the hill to go at Lassiter\u2019s back. The climb was easy for Preacher\u2019s group, not so swift for Jim and Mike, being led up an overgrown hillside with no path.</p><p>Once Preacher reached the top of the hill, he spotted the old truck. He stopped in his tracks and crouched, sneaking up on it, Jack and Rick close behind him. And not far from it, he saw her sitting against a tree, her chin dipped down to her chest. She could be dead or asleep.</p><p>The second Preacher saw Paige up against that tree, her name came out of him in a stunned whisper. He started blindly toward her. Jack whispered to him not to go and grabbed for his shoulder, but missed. The second Preacher\u2019s footfalls began hammering toward her, she lifted her chin, her eyes wide with fear, and the next thing he knew there were a pair of arms around his ankles and he was on his way down. Midway there was a gunshot, a sharp, knifelike, stinging pain across his left biceps, and he hit the ground like a boulder, rolling with Jack.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a second shot, but there was a disturbance in the trees. Rick stayed behind the truck, his weapon at the ready with nowhere to aim. The sounds heard in the trees suggested Lassiter could be on the run, hopefully only to be caught on his way down by Mike and Jim.</p><p>Preacher kicked out of Jack\u2019s tackle and belly-crawled toward Paige with incredible speed. He got behind the tree and reached long arms around, grabbing her arm harder than he ever had, and pulled her, still completely bound, to safety behind the tree with him. He put his fingers first on the tape that covered her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna hurt, baby,\u201d he whispered, then gave a sharp, quick yank.</p> <p>She pinched her eyes closed tightly and held bravely silent. Then she said, \u201cJohn, he\u2019s been waiting. He means to shoot you and me.\u201d</p><p>Preacher pulled his Swiss Army knife out of his pocket and made fast work of the bindings around her wrists and ankles. \u201cCrazy son of a bitch,\u201d he whispered, while slicing through the tape. He peered around the tree; someone was definitely on the run down that hill. Maybe even already caught and trying to fight his way out.</p><p>She touched his shoulder, the very top of his arm. Blood ran down his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He put his finger to his lips and they froze, listening. The noise in the trees had weakened to a rustle; the night was otherwise silent.</p><p>A tense minute passed, then there was a shout. \u201cHey! Your bad guy\u2019s down! We\u2019re bringing him out!\u201d</p><p>Paige whispered, \u201cThat\u2019s not Wes.\u201d</p> <p>Preacher peered around the tree again. He saw Jack lying on his belly, his rifle up and trained in the direction of the trees. The man who\u2019d led Jim and Mike up the hill had lost his shady brady, but he hauled Wes by the belt at his back, neatly folded in half, unconscious, through the trees. Wes dropped in a flop; the man wiped off his forehead with a hand. Then he shook his head. \u201cComplicated,\u201d he said. Preacher helped Paige to her feet and, keeping her behind him, cautiously approached.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do?\u201d Jack asked, getting up on his knees, then his feet.</p><p>\u201cAh, shit. I should\u2019ve known you couldn\u2019t hold off till we could get up on his back. Didn\u2019t I tell you to wait? Till we could get up that hill?\u201d He crouched, pulled handcuffs off the back of his belt and, yanking Wes\u2019s hands behind his back, cuffed him. Jim was next out of the trees, holding two rifles, his and their guide\u2019s. Right behind him was Mike, both of them panting.</p><p>Jack looked down at him. \u201cHe dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He still gripped his flashlight. \u201cBut he\u2019s gonna have a headache. Pretty good thing he didn\u2019t see me\u2014I can\u2019t be in this. For obvious reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be counting on a lot of people covering you. Someone might just accidentally tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shit happens. Won\u2019t be the first time I\u2019ve had to relocate. But I\u2019m telling you\u2014life\u2019s good right here, right now. I\u2019d rather be left out of this.\u201d</p><p>Wes Lassiter lay facedown on the ground, unconscious. Mike Valenzuela stepped toward Dan, still trying to catch his breath.</p> <p>\u201cYou whack him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your man there provided diversion, and I couldn\u2019t see good enough to shoot him....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou carry handcuffs?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>Dan grinned. \u201cYeah. You know. Kinky sex\u2014you should try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink I will,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>Dan looked at Jack. \u201cWhat if we made a trade here? Flashlights?\u201d He pulled a rag out of his pocket and wiped his prints off his flashlight.</p><p>\u201cNot this one,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI used this one to deliver my son.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a midwife.\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed. \u201cI figured I owed you one. At least one. But seriously\u2014I shouldn\u2019t be in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake mine,\u201d Jim Post said, and this made Jack just slightly more attentive. Jim tossed Dan the flashlight, received the replacement by a toss.</p><p>Dan touched his forehead. \u201cLost my damn hat,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay now. He\u2019s going away forever. No more trouble on that. I hear kidnapping\u2019s huge.\u201d He turned and moved down the hill, through the trees.</p><p>Silence reigned for a few moments while the sounds of his descent down the hill faded. The man on the ground began to squirm and moan. Preacher growled and pulled back a foot, but caught himself and didn\u2019t kick him with a boot behind which there was two hundred fifty pounds of pure rage.</p><p>Jim Post tilted his head toward the departure of the man who traded flashlights. \u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe came into the bar for a drink with stinky Bens in a big wad. Then he took Mel out to a grow site to deliver a baby and I thought I\u2019d lose my mind, it scared me so bad. Next time I saw him I told him that just can\u2019t happen.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cHe said she wasn\u2019t in danger, but it wouldn\u2019t happen again. Now this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d Post said.</p><p>\u201cThe craziest part of our relationship so far,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cWell, he was making that climb a little faster than we were,\u201d Jim said. \u201cHe must\u2019ve heard you make the top of the hill, because he dropped his gun and took off up the hill at a run, through the growth. I heard the shot, then the struggle. He was taking a big chance there. If this guy was any better with a weapon, he could\u2019ve turned on our man. Our friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good friend of mine,\u201d Preacher said. Paige came around him and Preacher lifted his good arm to drop it over her shoulders, the other dangling at his side, blood running down it.</p><p>Jim made eye contact with each of the men and Paige, one at a time. \u201cI hit this guy in the back of the head, okay? We all good on that? Because your cowboy buddy there\u2014I think he\u2019s not what he appears to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t the law decide that?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Jim Post had been undercover in these mountains, in the cannabis trade, when he met and fell in love with June. \u201cLeave that on me, okay? I still know a couple of people. Let it go. We owe him one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least one,\u201d Paige said.</p><p>Wes Lassiter awoke from his head injury in the hospital, cuffed to the bed, with no idea who had struck him. He claimed no memory of abducting his wife and was, of course, a victim, not a perpetrator, in his eyes.</p><p>But there were many witnesses\u2014from Paige to the search party to the man who found him pointing a gun at the location where Paige was bound and held, Jim Post. A witness testimony that would, strangely, never be required. The assistant district attorney promised they wouldn\u2019t accept any plea agreements\u2014for numerous probation violations from possession, breaching an order of protection, kidnapping and attempted murder\u2014but in the end he did. Twenty-five years without parole for kidnapping, the other felony charges to be sentenced later with possible parole on those\u2014but he would be a very, very old man before it became even possible for parole. If he\u2019d gone to trial, it was possible for him to get life without parole. Paige and the town of Virgin River were extremely grateful.</p><p>Often Paige would awaken in the night with a cry on her lips, shuddering, trembling, shivering in fear. John would pull her close and say, \u201cI\u2019m here, baby. I\u2019m here. I\u2019ll always be right here.\u201d</p><p>She would calm. She was safe. \u201cIt\u2019s really over,\u201d she would whisper.</p><p>\u201cAnd we have the rest of our lives,\u201d he always whispered back.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Rick had taken an afternoon off from the bar after his high school graduation to go over to Eureka and visit Liz. He asked Jack and Preacher if they\u2019d be around the bar till closing\u2014he\u2019d like to talk to them when he got back to town. It was almost nine by the time he walked in. \u201cThanks for hanging around, Jack,\u201d he said. \u201cPreacher still in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. How\u2019s Liz doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting by. She\u2019s back in her old high school\u2014summer school to catch up\u2014and she\u2019s getting some counseling there.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cShe has some real sad days, but she seems to be holding it together. Better than I thought she would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear that,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Rick got up on a stool. \u201cI\u2019m eighteen now,\u201d he said. \u201cNot quite legal, but how about we have a drink together. You, me and Preach. Can we do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe celebrating something?\u201d Jack asked, getting down three glasses.</p><p>\u201cYeah. We are. I signed up.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s hand froze in midair. He had to force himself to complete the move, bring down the glasses. He banged on the wall that separated the kitchen from the bar to bring Preacher.</p><p>\u201cWe could\u2019ve talked,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything to talk about,\u201d Rick answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Preacher started, having come quickly from the kitchen with a pretty scattered look on his face.</p><p>\u201cRick signed up,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>His face fell from startled to stricken. \u201cAw, Rick, what the hell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to drink to it, if you can get under control,\u201d Rick said.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t gonna be easy for me to drink to that, man,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>Jack tipped a nice whiskey over three glasses. \u201cWant to tell us what was going through your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I have to do something hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t wake up every morning hoping that maybe today I\u2019ll be a little less sad. I need something tough. Something that will show me what I\u2019ve got. Show me who I am again.\u201d He focused clear eyes on Jack\u2019s face, then Preacher\u2019s. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick, we could have found you something hard that wasn\u2019t quite as dangerous. This is a warring country. They\u2019re fighting Marines. They don\u2019t all come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes they don\u2019t even make it out of their mother\u2019s womb,\u201d Rick said softly.</p><p>\u201cAw, Rick...\u201d Preacher said, hanging his head. \u201cIt\u2019s been a real hard year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I thought about a lot of things. School, bumming around the country for a year, logging, construction. I could beg Liz to marry me\u2014but it turns out she\u2019s still only fifteen.\u201d He smiled lamely. \u201cThis is the only thing I can do, Jack. Preach. It\u2019s kind of what I was raised to do, if you think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now it\u2019s not bad enough you\u2019re doing it, you\u2019re going to blame it on us?\u201d Jack said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Rick grinned. \u201cIf I do okay, you\u2019ll take all the credit.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet for a moment, then Jack said. \u201cYou giving notice?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot really, Jack. I\u2019m going right away. I was hoping you\u2019d take me to the bus in Garberville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took the oath?\u201d he asked, and Rick nodded. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have time to send you off?\u201d</p><p>Rick shook his head. \u201cAll I wanted was to make sure Liz is okay. That I can go and she\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not thrilled, but she\u2019s gotten pretty tough. She says she\u2019ll write to me, but you know what? She\u2019s so young. When I\u2019m out of the picture awhile, she\u2019ll have a chance to start over without this thing we went through together hanging all over her like a dark cloud. I\u2019ll almost be happier if she doesn\u2019t write to me. That would mean she\u2019s moving on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want her to move on, man?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I have to do something like this. I don\u2019t know that, either. Who knows what me and Lizzie had? Besides a baby that didn\u2019t live.\u201d He looked down. \u201cI was working so hard at doing the best I could, I never had time to check, see what I\u2019d be feeling if there wasn\u2019t any pressure. And neither did she. That\u2019s just not fair to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about college, Rick?\u201d Preacher asked. \u201cI thought between the three of us, one would go to college at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s time, if I want to do that. I didn\u2019t sign up for life. I signed up for four years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust one thing,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some idiotic idea you got in your head to make us proud, is it? Because you know we\u2019re proud. You know we couldn\u2019t be more proud. You get that, right?\u201d</p><p>Rick smiled. \u201cYou guys being proud is what got me through. Nah, it\u2019s not about that. I think if I grieve this anymore, I\u2019ll die inside. I have to go. Do something. Start something important. I have to push on something that\u2019ll push back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSemper, she\u2019ll push back, Rick,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cShe\u2019ll push back real hard, like you want.\u201d</p><p>Jack lifted a glass. \u201cDo we drink to hardness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work,\u201d Rick said. \u201cSay you support me. Say you respect my choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a man, Rick. You thought it through, made a decision. Here\u2019s to you.\u201d</p><p>They drank. Preacher ducked his head away and gave a sniff. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me, man,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rick reached across the bar and grabbed the big man\u2019s good arm, giving it a shake. He swallowed hard. \u201cWill you guys look after my grandma? Make sure she\u2019s all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did she say about this, Rick?\u201d Jack asked him.</p><p>He lifted his chin bravely. \u201cShe said she understands. She has a lot of pride, you know. She doesn\u2019t want me hanging out here, taking care of her. And she knows this has been really tough for me\u2014that I have to get past it. Any way I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good woman,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cWe\u2019ll watch out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Rick stood from the bar stool. \u201cYou guys gonna be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe\u2019re tough. What time do we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven in the morning. I\u2019ll be down.\u201d</p><p>The morning came way too soon for all of them. Rick showed up with his packed duffel, but couldn\u2019t escape the gathering at the bar. Mike was there to send him off. No way Mel was going to let him go without a tearful hug. Nor Paige nor Doc. Even Chris was up bright and early, and while still in his pajamas, he grabbed Rick\u2019s neck and had to be pried loose. Connie and Ron were there, emotional at the parting. Preacher almost killed him with his one-armed bear hug. \u201cGod,\u201d Preacher said, \u201cyou better be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s just Basic. They can\u2019t do too much to me at Basic. But yeah, Preach. I\u2019ll be real careful, you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>It was pretty hard to talk on the way to Garberville. Jack was feeling a powerful ache in his chest. And a lump in his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m excited about this, Jack. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been excited in months. You remember how you felt when you first went in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared shitless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve got some of that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick, they\u2019re going to try to pound the stuffing out of you. You\u2019re going to think it\u2019s personal. It\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to want to quit, and you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to fight, you know. There are two Corps\u2014the fighting Marines and the support staff. You don\u2019t have to fight if you\u2019re not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you sure?\u201d Rick asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, son.\u201d Jack looked at him. Rick sat tall. Strong. \u201cNo, Rick. I wasn\u2019t sure till I was trained, and then I still wasn\u2019t sure. It just felt like what I wanted to do at the time, and I went that way knowing I might be wrong. But I went that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m at. Just a feeling. But damn, it\u2019s good to have a feeling again. One that doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said in a breath. \u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>At the bus, there was one last hug. \u201cI\u2019ll see you after Basic,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou\u2019ll do good. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Rick said. And although Jack\u2019s eyes were moist, Rick\u2019s were cool. Driven and confident, once again. Maybe a little bit like Jack had been a while back, when he was about that age.</p><p>Rick threw his duffel to the driver and climbed on. Jack stood on the sidewalk until the bus was gone. Then he walked down the street and found a pay phone. He plugged a pocketful of quarters into the phone and dialed. Sam answered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Dad?\u201d Braced against the phone box, he leaned his head on his arm. \u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I think I know how you must\u2019ve felt. Back when I left for the Marine Corps. You must\u2019ve wanted to die.\u201d</p><p>It was early June when the entire Sheridan family came to Virgin River en masse. They had rented RVs, brought fancy tents, campers and toy haulers. Also in evidence, the Marines\u2014this time some of them brought their families. Zeke brought Christa and four kids, including a brand-new baby. Josh Phillips brought Patti and the babies. Corny brought Sue and the two little girls. Tom Stephens came from Reno but had to leave the family home. Joe and Paul were there from Grants Pass. Everyone was camping at the new Sheridan home site; quads and dirt bikes had come along for the entertainment of the pack. Flatbed trucks had brought picnic tables a few days before, plus a couple of huge barbecues and portable toilets. Jack had spent the past two months getting lumber ready for framing, and yesterday, amid much food, drink and celebrating, the men erected the frame of Mel and Jack\u2019s new home.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t all that was taking place during this reunion. Since everyone was present, there was another special occasion. A wedding day.</p><p>Paige and Chris were at Mel\u2019s while Paige primped and donned a sweet and simple floral sundress and high-heeled sandals. While she was getting dressed, the men and Sheridan women were sweeping out the foundation of the framed house and stringing garlands along the beams. Rented folding chairs were brought in and set up\u2014one hundred of them\u2014and that wouldn\u2019t be quite enough. Most of the town would turn out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you look more beautiful,\u201d Mel whispered to Paige. \u201cNervous?\u201d</p><p>Paige shook her head. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you know?\u201d Brie asked her. \u201cWhen did you know for sure he was absolutely perfect for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right away,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI wanted no part of a man who claimed he could take care of me, for obvious reasons. But John moves real slow.\u201d She laughed. \u201cReal slow. It was all in the way his frown would slowly go away when he looked at me, the way his voice would get all tender and soft when he talked to me. His caution, his shyness. It takes a lot for a man like John to make a move. He has to be sure of everything. By the time he got around to telling me he loved me, I thought I\u2019d die waiting for him. But he\u2019s a careful man\u2014and he doesn\u2019t change his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d he do it?\u201d Brie wanted to know. \u201cPropose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She thought. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve talked about this for a while\u2014about making a commitment when things got under control. He told me at Christmastime he wanted to be with me forever, add to the family, and I wanted that, too. But when you come down to the exact, official proposal, he was peeling potatoes. He stopped what he was doing and looked across the kitchen at me. My hair was stringy, I was sweating from the heat of the stove and doing dishes, and he said, \u2018Whenever you\u2019re ready, I want to marry you. I\u2019m dying to marry you,\u2019 he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Brie said, unimpressed. \u201cThat must have knocked you right off your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it did,\u201d she said in a sigh. \u201cJohn\u2019s the only person I\u2019ve ever known who could look at me in my worst physical and emotional state and think I\u2019m perfect.\u201d</p><p>Mel took her hand. \u201cCome on. We\u2019re almost late. We have to go now.\u201d</p><p>The women loaded Chris and baby David in the Hummer and drove out to the home site. The widened road was lined with cars and trucks, and at the top of the hill, more vehicles, RVs and trailers. Mel drove all the way to the top and parked right near the structure that would one day be her house. Picnic tables were laden with food, the framed house was strung with flower garlands and the chairs on the foundation were full with people standing around behind them and out in the yard. Smoke rose from heated barbecues and children ran about. A ceremony, a picnic, a party, and some playtime. And for once, Preacher would do none of the cooking.</p><p>Paige, Mel and Brie got out of the Hummer. Someone immediately handed them simple bouquets and took David from Mel so she could attend the ceremony; a boutonniere was pinned onto Christopher\u2019s shirt and he clutched Bear under his arm.</p><p>There was no music, but this was not to be a traditional wedding, not meant to resemble other weddings, because John and Paige wanted this day to reflect who they were\u2014simple, grateful people who loved each other more than the event. The bar was not big enough and the church had been boarded up for years. It was John who had said, \u201cOnce we get the frame of Jack\u2019s house up, not only will everyone we care about be there, there will be lots of room.\u201d Who gets married in a framed house? was Paige\u2019s first thought. Her next immediate thought was\u2014people like John and me do.</p><p>But looking at it now, strung with flowers, it was so beautiful that for a second she couldn\u2019t breathe. To the left was a view that went on forever, to the right, the majestic mountains. It had become an outdoor church, filled with friends.</p><p>Chris walked in front of her toward the plank that led up to the foundation, and Mel and Brie each held one of her hands. She smiled at the people\u2014far more than she expected. They hadn\u2019t sent invitations\u2014they posted a notice in the bar that anyone interested should attend, and they were here in droves. Of course it touched her to think how much respect they\u2019d paid her, but even more deeply she felt the honor they paid to John, Preacher. He did right by everyone he met, not just her.</p><p>The foundation of the house being raised, she could only see the seated and standing wedding guests. Chris ran ahead, up the plank and down the aisle. She walked up the plank to the foundation carefully, her bridesmaids right behind her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Then she saw him. Standing up front, at a place where a fireplace would eventually be erected. Chris stood in front of him; John\u2019s hands were on his shoulders. Jack and Mike stood beside him. Even from her distance she could see the light brighten his eyes. He was a pillar of a man, probably six-six in his boots. Today, for the first time ever, he wore a linen shirt with a button-down collar and she suspected his jeans were new, but she doubted he\u2019d ever owned a tie. Before she could even make the walk to meet him at their makeshift altar he broke away from his groomsmen and strode toward her, reaching out a hand to take her the rest of the way. He didn\u2019t move slowly anymore, not where she was concerned. This man had saved her life, changed her life. To his very core, he was all goodness. He was so strong, so authentic.</p><p>He was so magnificent. </p>  </body></html>"]
