This wasn\u2019t actually news and shouldn\u2019t have come as any surprise. Didn\u2019t come as any surprise. She\u2019d seen the signs, as recently as this morning. These days Grant was inventing excuses to call her.</p><p>Six years ago her world had imploded when her husband confessed that he\u2019d fallen in love with another woman. With barely a backward glance, Grant had walked out\u2014out of their home, their marriage, their lives. And now he wanted back in.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d Annie asked, toying with her fork. She watched her mother intently.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She swallowed the soup and lowered her spoon for another taste.</p><p>Annie, it seemed, had forgotten. But not Bethanne.</p><p>The morning Grant told her he wanted a divorce would stay in her mind forever. He couldn\u2019t seem to get away from her fast enough. He\u2019d retained a lawyer and advised her to do the same, then coldly informed her that all future communication would be through their lawyers. The less contact with her and their children, the better, he\u2019d said. A clean break was best.</p><p>Grant\u2019s decision had struck Bethanne with the force and unpredictability of a hurricane. She\u2019d stumbled blindly through the next few months, trying to hold her family together, clinging to the semblance of normality while her world disintegrated around her. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have anything to say?\u201d Annie prodded.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bethanne said shortly. She swallowed another spoonful of soup and reached for the herb scone. \u201cWhat disturbs me is that your father would let you do his talking for him.\u201d</p><p>Annie had the grace to look chastened, but she pushed her food away as if she\u2019d suddenly lost her appetite.</p><p>At one time Bethanne had dreamed Grant would regret what he\u2019d done, that he\u2019d seek her forgiveness and come crawling back to her. She\u2019d wanted him to suffer for the way he\u2019d treated her, for the hurt he\u2019d inflicted when he\u2019d turned his back on their children.</p><p>But in the years since the divorce, Bethanne had gradually found her footing and, in the process, discovered a self she didn\u2019t know existed\u2014a stronger, independent Bethanne, a woman forged in the fire of despair. Now her two children were on their own; her oldest, Andrew, was engaged to be married in a few weeks, following his graduation from law school. As for her daughter, Annie was a year from obtaining her MBA. She worked part-time with Bethanne on the creative end of the party business Bethanne had established in the wake of her divorce.</p><p>During her twenty years of marriage, Bethanne had become known for her lavish and inventive parties. She\u2019d taken pride in making Grant look good by hosting unforgettable events for clients and potential clients\u2014an invitation to Grant\u2019s home became a sought-after privilege in certain circles. Her birthday parties for Andrew and Annie were legendary. But never once had she dreamed that her party-giving skills would eventually be parlayed into such a success.</p><p>She\u2019d started the business, which she called simply Parties, as a way of making enough money to continue living in their family home, although she\u2019d had to take out a substantial second mortgage to get Parties off the ground. Grant had paid the required support, but depending on that would\u2019ve meant moving to a smaller house in a different neighborhood. If ever her children needed stability, she knew, it was in the period after the divorce. She\u2019d since paid off both mortgages.</p> <p>To Bethanne\u2019s astonishment, the business had taken off immediately. She\u2019d started small, with themed birthday parties for children. The Alice in Wonderland Tea Party had been the most popular of the dozens of concepts she\u2019d created. With busy schedules, parents were looking for an easy, economical way to make birthday parties special. Bethanne\u2019s company had filled that need.</p><p>Currently, there were five Parties stores in the Seattle area, including the original location, and she was considerating a deal that offered national franchising opportunities. The key was to keep the ideas fresh and the prices reasonable. This past winter she\u2019d added a \u201cbirthday party in a box\u201d\u2014more scaled-down, do-it-yourself versions of her trademarked theme parties.</p><p>A year earlier Bethanne had hired Julia Hayden as her corporate operations manager. Julia was efficient, dedicated and gifted. She loved the job and had begun overseeing the company\u2019s day-today activities, freeing Bethanne to focus on creative development. Annie worked with her, and the two of them had recently developed birthday party ideas for cats and dogs, which was now a popular trend, especially among childless, affluent professionals. They\u2019d expanded into other types of parties, too\u2014anniversary and retirement celebrations, Christmas and even Halloween events.</p><p>Bethanne signaled for the check, and they went their separate ways with a quick hug and a wave. Annie was walking back to the office, while Bethanne headed for Blossom Street and A Good Yarn. Knitting had become one of her favourite activities. When she needed to think, nothing helped more than sitting down with a knitting project. She felt a sense of happy anticipation as she parked in front of the yarn store, which was owned by her dear friend Lydia Goetz.</p><p>With the wedding only six weeks away, she\u2019d wanted to knit something for Courtney, her almost-daughter-in-law, to wear during the wedding.</p><p>The wedding. It was why Grant had called her two weeks ago\u2014their son\u2019s marriage had given him a legitimate excuse\u2014and he\u2019d called twice since then, including this morning.</p><p>Other than the occasional joint decisions they\u2019d made regarding their children, they\u2019d had little personal contact since the divorce. Then Grant had phoned her with a question about a wedding gift for Andrew and Courtney. He\u2019d been friendly and relaxed. And this week, he\u2019d asked her to dinner.</p><p>Dinner. She and Grant. After six years?</p> <p>She\u2019d heard from Annie that his marriage to Tiffany had ended in divorce the previous year\u2014after a brief separation\u2014and felt genuinely sorry for him. This was a second divorce for Tiffany, as well. In fact, Bethanne had briefly dated Paul, Tiffany\u2019s first husband, shortly after the divorce, although date wasn\u2019t exactly the right word. They\u2019d been more of a two-person support group, helping each other grapple with their betrayal by the people they loved.</p><p>Unfortunately, Andrew\u2019s relationship with his father remained cool. Her son had met his father\u2019s desertion with a bitter resolve that only seemed to harden as he grew older. Andrew was polite but kept an emotional distance from Grant.</p><p>For Annie, sixteen at the time, the divorce had been nothing short of devastating. Always a \u201cdaddy\u2019s girl,\u201d she\u2019d acted out her shock and pain as only a willful teenager can. Annie blamed Tiffany for stealing her father away and had done everything she could to sabotage the marriage. But Bethanne was also a target for her rage during those early months. Annie had railed at her for being too \u201cboring\u201d and \u201cclueless\u201d to keep her father happy. Bethanne had never responded to Annie\u2019s accusations about her failures as a wife, afraid to reveal how close to home her words had hit. Eventually, Annie had adjusted to the new reality, although she still referred to Grant\u2019s second wife in sarcastic tones as \u201cthe lovely Tiffany.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne thought about her conversation with him that morning. His excuse for calling this time was so flimsy Bethanne couldn\u2019t even remember what it was. He\u2019d kept her on the line, relating office gossip as if she was still intimately familiar with the goings-on at his workplace. After several minutes of chatter, he reminded her that she hadn\u2019t given him a definite answer regarding his dinner invitation.</p><p>\u201cGrant,\u201d she\u2019d said bluntly. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>For a moment there was silence on the other end. When he spoke, any hints of lightheartedness were gone. \u201cI made a mistake, Bethanne.\u201d His voice caught, and for once he seemed at a loss for words. \u201cA major one.\u201d He left the rest unsaid, but she knew what he meant. He wanted things back the way they used to be.</p><p>Well, good luck with that. Bethanne wasn\u2019t the same naive woman he\u2019d divorced, and she wasn\u2019t interested in retracing her steps.</p><p>After six years on her own, she\u2019d discovered she didn\u2019t want or need a man complicating her life. Years ago she\u2019d read somewhere that \u201cit takes a hell of a man to replace no man.\u201d At first, that remark had seemed merely humorous; she hadn\u2019t completely understood what it meant. She did now.</p><p>While she was flattered that Grant wanted to reconcile, the situation wasn\u2019t that simple. He\u2019d had his chance. He was the one who\u2019d deserted her, who\u2019d left her floundering and shaken. Without ever thinking about the consequences of his actions, he\u2019d ripped apart their family, betrayed her and their children, robbed them all of their security.</p><p>Now he was sorry. Fine. He\u2019d seen the error of his ways and realized what a terrible mistake he\u2019d made.</p><p>So of course he wanted her back. She was a successful businesswoman with a growing company that received lots of media and corporate interest. In six short years she\u2019d made a name for herself. She\u2019d been interviewed by Forbes and the Wall Street Journal. A piece had been written about her in USA Today. Her ex had his nerve.</p><p>Contrition was all well and good. Bethanne felt a certain vindication in hearing Grant admit how wrong he\u2019d been, a certain sense of righteousness. She\u2019d forgiven him to the best of her ability, refusing to let herself be trapped in the mire of resentment. He had a new life and so did she. But forgiveness, she\u2019d learned, was tricky. Just when she felt sure she was beyond rancor, she\u2019d find herself wallowing in indignation. Like the night three years ago when the pipe burst in the basement and she couldn\u2019t figure out where to turn off the water. If Grant had been there he would\u2019ve known what to do. By the time she found the tap she\u2019d been shaking with anger, and as unreasonable as it seemed, she\u2019d blamed Grant. This was all his fault. He should\u2019ve been there. How dared he do this to her and, worse, to their children!</p><p>She should reject his invitation, she told herself now. Laugh in his face. Tell him to take a hike.</p><p>To her astonishment she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>It had taken courage for Grant to approach her, courage and, yes, nerve. She\u2019d give him that. Crazy though it might be, Bethanne realized she still had feelings for Grant, feelings she\u2019d pushed aside for the past few years. She didn\u2019t love him, not in the all-consuming way she had when they were married. Back then, she\u2019d been blind to his flaws and his weaknesses, blind to what should\u2019ve been obvious, especially after he\u2019d started the affair. His betrayal had revealed that the man she\u2019d married was selfish and shallow. And yet he hadn\u2019t always been like that. She couldn\u2019t forget the companionship\u2014and the passion\u2014of their early years together....</p><p>She loved him.</p><p>She hated him.</p><p>Both emotions warred within her.</p><p>\u201cDinner for old times\u2019 sake,\u201d he\u2019d almost pleaded. \u201cBesides, we need to talk about Andrew\u2019s wedding.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Six years ago Bethanne had been desperate for him to come home. Her pride was gone. What she\u2019d craved was exactly what Grant wanted now\u2014for everything to go back to the way it had been. At the time she\u2019d believed she could fix whatever was wrong. They\u2019d been happy, and could be again.</p><p>When it became apparent that his affair with Tiffany wasn\u2019t a fling and Grant fully intended to go through with the divorce, an all-consuming rage had taken root. She couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t eat. At night she lay awake plotting revenge. One day Grant would be sorry. He\u2019d beg her to take him back and she\u2019d laugh in his face. He would pay for what he\u2019d done.</p><p>Then, several months after the divorce was finalized, she woke with that familiar ugly feeling in the pit of her stomach and realized this corrosive, soul-destroying bitterness couldn\u2019t continue. As the saying had it, the best revenge was living well\u2014living a successful, independent life. So Bethanne had dedicated herself to her business.</p><p>Gradually, she\u2019d stopped thinking about Grant. She embraced her new life, her new identity. Indirectly, she had Grant to thank for her flourishing business, her circle of loyal new friends, for the strength and confidence she\u2019d never known she had. It felt odd to her now that she\u2019d once been content to be simply Grant\u2019s wife, looking after his social affairs and staying in the background.</p> <p>Dinner for old times\u2019 sake? Just the two of them?</p><p>In the years since the divorce, Bethanne had dated a number of men. Besides Tiffany\u2019s ex, a couple of them stood out in her mind. But she\u2019d been so focused on building her business that neither relationship had lasted more than six months. She wasn\u2019t ready or willing to make a serious commitment to anyone. Those relationships, albeit short, had boosted her depleted ego. She\u2019d enjoyed them but she wasn\u2019t looking for a long-term commitment.</p><p>Bethanne had concluded their phone call without giving Grant an answer. She needed to ponder her ex-husband\u2019s newfound contrition, and there was no more effective way of doing that than knitting. It was both productive and contemplative; you created something while you meditated on your problems. That was why she\u2019d stopped at Lydia\u2019s\u2014to pick up yarn for the elegant fingerless gloves she\u2019d make for Courtney\u2019s wedding.</p><p>Lydia glanced up from the display she was working on and smiled when Bethanne entered the store. \u201cYou got my message! The cashmere yarn\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne smiled back. \u201cI can hardly wait to get started.\u201d Knitting had seen her through the darkest days of her life. Annie was the one who\u2019d signed her up for classes, because even dialing the phone number for the yarn store was more than she could manage back then; the smallest tasks had seemed insurmountable. In retrospect, Bethanne knew she\u2019d fallen into a dangerous depression.</p> <p>Annie had enrolled Bethanne in a beginners\u2019 sock-knitting class. Meeting the other women had been a turning point for her. Her new friends gave her courage and the determination to emerge from her ordeal a stronger woman. Not only that, it was through the knitting class that she\u2019d met Elise, and through Elise, Maverick. He\u2019d ended up being the \u201cangel\u201d who\u2019d helped her launch Parties. Her classmates had reminded Bethanne that she wasn\u2019t alone, rebuilding her confidence one stitch at a time.</p><p>That class was the beginning of Bethanne\u2019s new life. And Part Two turned out to be better than Part One had ever been. Was it possible to knit the two halves together again? Did she want to?</p><p>\u201cThe pattern isn\u2019t difficult,\u201d Lydia told her as she brought the yarn to the cash register. \u201cOnce you do a couple of repeats, I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t have a problem, but if you do, just stop by and I\u2019ll help you figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne paid for the purchase, grateful that Lydia had wound the yarn, saving her the effort. At first, she\u2019d considered knitting Courtney\u2019s veil, but there wasn\u2019t time. Although a bit disappointed, she knew fingerless gloves were a far more manageable project. Her hope was that the gloves would be beautiful enough to become a family heirloom, passed down from one generation to the next.</p><p>\u201cAlix was in this week and brought Tommy with her,\u201d Lydia said as she handed Bethanne the yarn. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how much he\u2019s grown. It\u2019s hard to believe he\u2019s nearly a year old.\u201d</p><p>Alix, a friend of theirs, was employed as a baker at the French Caf\u00e9 across the street. \u201cShe\u2019s gone back to work?\u201d</p> <p>Lydia nodded. \u201cJust part-time. Now with Winter pregnant...there must be something in the water over there.\u201d Lydia grinned. \u201cOr the coffee.\u201d</p><p>So many changes on Blossom Street, and all of them good.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Casey?\u201d Bethanne asked about Lydia\u2019s adopted daughter. A couple of months before, when Casey turned thirteen, Bethanne had planned her birthday party.</p><p>\u201cCasey\u2019s fine,\u201d Lydia assured her. \u201cShe had a few academic challenges and will be attending summer school again. It\u2019s not the end of the world but Casey tends to get down on herself. We\u2019re working on that.\u201d Lydia leaned against the counter. \u201cThe poor kid came to us with a lot of baggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt about that.\u201d Bethanne had to admire Brad and Lydia for opening their hearts and their home to the troubled girl.</p><p>\u201cIt helps that she\u2019s so close to my mother.... My biggest fear is what\u2019ll happen once Mom is gone,\u201d Lydia said, her voice subdued.</p><p>\u201cIs your mother doing okay?\u201d</p><p>Lydia rubbed her eyes. \u201cNot really.\u201d She gave a small, hopeless shrug. \u201cShe\u2019s declining, and that\u2019s so hard to watch. You know, she sometimes forgets who I am but she always remembers Casey. I think it\u2019s one of those small miracles. It makes Casey feel important and loved, which she is. Everyone at the assisted-living complex adores Casey. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they hired her once she\u2019s old enough to have a job. Her patience with Mom and Mom\u2019s friends is amazing. She loves hearing their stories.\u201d</p> <p>Bethanne nodded sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cNo one seems to have enough time for the elderly anymore....\u201d Lydia shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m guilty of rushing visits myself, but not Casey. She sits and listens for hours and never seems to get impatient, even when Mom repeats the same story over and over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Margaret?\u201d Bethanne noticed that Lydia\u2019s older sister, who often worked with her, wasn\u2019t in the store.</p><p>\u201cShe took the day off. Wednesdays are slow, and she had a dentist\u2019s appointment at eleven. I told her to enjoy the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Margaret was a store fixture and so different from Lydia that new customers often didn\u2019t realize they were sisters. Margaret was good-hearted but tended to be gruff and opinionated, and took a bit of getting used to. \u201cHow\u2019s business going?\u201d she ventured, aware that she was the only person in the store at the moment.</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly well.\u201d Lydia cheered visibly. \u201cPeople turn to domestic pursuits during recessions, and lots of people want to knit these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Anne Marie and Ellen since they moved?\u201d</p><p>Lydia returned to arranging the yarn display. \u201cPractically every day. Ellen didn\u2019t want to leave Blossom Street but I see her as much as ever. She has plenty of friends in her new neighborhood and has definitely made the adjustment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for her.\u201d A young widow, Anne Marie had adopted the girl after volunteering at a local grade school. Although Lydia had never said so, Bethanne knew that Ellen\u2019s adoption had influenced her and Brad to make Casey part of their family.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a few minutes for tea?\u201d Lydia asked.</p><p>Bethanne checked her watch. \u201cSorry, no, I\u2019m on my way to the office. I\u2019m supposed to meet with Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon, then.\u201d Lydia waved as Bethanne opened the door.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Bethanne promised.</p><p>\u201cStop by if you have any trouble with that pattern,\u201d she called over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>As she unlocked her car, Bethanne looked over at the French Caf\u00e9 and was startled to see her ex-mother-in-law, Ruth Hamlin, sitting at an outside table eating her lunch.</p><p>Despite the divorce, Bethanne had a warm relationship with Ruth. For her children\u2019s sake she\u2019d kept in touch with Grant\u2019s mother and his younger sister, Robin. But as Lydia had so recently reminded her, no one had enough time for older people anymore. Bethanne felt guilty as charged. She rarely saw Ruth these days, and it had been several weeks since they\u2019d talked.</p><p>Ruth had been horrified by Grant\u2019s decision to walk away from his family. She hadn\u2019t been shy about letting her son know her feelings, either. She\u2019d always been generous and supportive to Bethanne, making her feel like a beloved daughter in every way. Ruth had stood at Bethanne\u2019s side through the divorce proceedings, convinced that Grant would one day realize his mistake.</p><p>Bethanne rushed impulsively across the street. She really didn\u2019t have time and the ever-punctual Julia would be waiting. As it was, Bethanne had spent far longer with Lydia than she\u2019d intended. In addition, she had a tight afternoon schedule that included a meeting with her managers. But Bethanne was determined to make time for the woman who\u2019d once been such an enormous encouragement to her.</p><p>\u201cRuth?\u201d</p><p>Her mother-in-law looked up from her soup and sandwich plate and instantly broke into a smile. \u201cBethanne, my goodness, I never expected to see you here.\u201d</p><p>The two women hugged. \u201cI was picking up some yarn I ordered. What are you doing in this neighborhood?\u201d Bethanne pulled out the chair opposite Ruth\u2019s and sat down.</p><p>Her mother-in-law placed both hands in her lap. \u201cRobin suggested we meet here for lunch. It\u2019s not that far from the courthouse, but you know Robin...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she left already?\u201d Bethanne looked around, then down at Ruth\u2019s barely touched plate.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t show up,\u201d Ruth said, coloring slightly. \u201cI\u2019m sure she got stuck in court....\u201d Robin was with the Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s office in Seattle, and frequently dealt with violent crime.</p><p>Bethanne frowned. \u201cDid you call her?\u201d</p><p>Ruth shook her head. \u201cI refuse to carry a cell phone. They\u2019re an intrusion on people\u2019s privacy and\u2014well, never mind. Although I will admit that at times like this a cell would come in handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, would you, dear?\u201d Ruth squeezed her hand gratefully. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Digging in her purse, Bethanne found her cell. She had Robin\u2019s number in her contacts and, holding the phone to her ear, waited for the call to connect. Robin\u2019s phone went directly to voice mail, which meant she was probably still in court.</p><p>\u201cI think you must be right,\u201d Bethanne told Ruth.</p><p>The older woman exhaled. \u201cI was afraid of that. I don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll have a chance to meet again before I leave.\u201d Ruth straightened and picked up her sandwich. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really matter, because my daughter is not going to change my mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChange your mind about what?\u201d</p><p>Ruth lifted her chin. \u201cRobin wants to talk me out of attending my fifty-year class reunion.\u201d She took a determined bite of her turkey-and-bacon sandwich.</p><p>Why would her sister-in-law do such a thing? \u201cI hope you go,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cI am, and nothing she says will convince me otherwise.\u201d Bethanne had never seen Ruth so fired up.</p> <p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d She watched in amusement as her ex-mother-in-law chewed with righteous resolve.</p><p>Swallowing, Ruth relaxed and sent Bethanne a grateful smile. \u201cAnd I intend to drive to Florida by myself.

I\u2019d spend days planning the route, and I\u2019d write all my friends to tell them we were coming. Then invariably something would come up at Richard\u2019s work.\u201d Her lips tightened at the memory. \u201cHe canceled the trip three times until I finally gave up.\u201d</p><p>Richard was a workaholic who hardly ever took vacations. He spent most weekends in the office of his engineering firm, missing countless baseball games and piano recitals. In fact, he died in that very same office. How long had he been gone now? Seven years, maybe eight, by Bethanne\u2019s calculations.</p><p>Grant had taken his father\u2019s death especially hard. They weren\u2019t close but Grant had looked up to his father and respected his work ethic. As for Robin\u2014well, she\u2019d been cut from the same cloth as Richard. She\u2019d married right out of law school, but divorced three years later. Robin was wedded to her job; there wasn\u2019t room for anything or anyone else. Even her desire for a family had faded next to the demands and rewards of her meteoric career. The only time Bethanne actually saw her sister-in-law was at Christmas and that hadn\u2019t happened in years, not since before the divorce. They did chat by phone every now and then, and Robin remembered to send cards and checks on Andrew\u2019s and Annie\u2019s birthdays. But she wasn\u2019t involved in their lives\u2014or anyone else\u2019s, it seemed, except her colleagues\u2019.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting any younger, you know,\u201d Ruth went on, interrupting Bethanne\u2019s musings. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to see the country, I don\u2019t feel I can delay it anymore. I wanted to ask Robin to accompany me but we both know that would be a waste of breath. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s taken more than a week off in the past ten years.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne had nothing to add. Ruth was right; Robin would never go on a road trip with her mother, would never devote two or three weeks to family.</p> <p>\u201cIn all these years, I\u2019ve only been back to my hometown three times.\u201d Ruth\u2019s words were tinged with longing. \u201cFor my parents\u2019 funerals and then once for a brief vacation. But I\u2019ve kept in touch with several of my high school friends. Diane and Jane both came out to Seattle with their families to visit. When we were together, it was like we were teenagers all over again! I enjoyed it so much, and the reunion\u2019s the perfect opportunity to see them. I\u2019m determined to go.\u201d She leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms.</p><p>Bethanne could tell that she wasn\u2019t going to dissuade her. \u201cThen you should do it,\u201d she said mildly.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Ruth insisted. \u201cI\u2019m leaving the first of June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d Bethanne raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYes, the reunion\u2019s on the seventeenth and that gives me plenty of time to see the sights. I\u2019ve always wanted to visit Mount Rushmore and the Badlands. My grandparents originally settled in the Dakotas, you know.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t want to discourage Ruth, but she did feel a twinge of anxiety about her traveling that distance by herself. She\u2019d be an easy mark, especially alone.</p><p>Ruth fixed her with a stubborn glare. \u201cBefore you say anything, I want you to know I\u2019ve rented a car since I\u2019m planning to fly back, and I\u2019ve already booked my flight from Florida to Seattle. So don\u2019t even try to talk me out of this.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne gave up the idea of arguing with her and instead patted the older woman on the arm.</p> <p>\u201cNo one takes the time to travel by car anymore,\u201d Ruth said plaintively. \u201cLife is \u2018rush here\u2019 and \u2018rush there.\u2019 My children are grown, and I\u2019m sorry to say they\u2019re both a disappointment to me. I hardly ever see either Robin or Grant. I\u2019m sixty-eight years old and\u2014\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cI am not old and I refuse to be treated like I\u2019m too fragile to know my own mind.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne reached across the table and clasped Ruth\u2019s hand. She thought of Casey Goetz and the close relationship she had with Lydia\u2019s mother. In a few years it might be difficult for Ruth to drive cross-country. It was either take this trip now or give up her long-held dream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Bethanne said in a soft voice.</p><p>Ruth\u2019s head shot up. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t taken a vacation in years.\u201d Aside from a few trips with the kids to visit relatives, her last real vacation had been with Grant. They\u2019d gone to Italy to celebrate their tenth anniversary.</p><p>Ruth continued to stare at her, obviously at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cIt would do me good to get away for a few weeks,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cI have some decisions to make that I\u2019d like to mull over. Getting away will give me a chance to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious? You\u2019d drive with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Bethanne smiled at Ruth\u2019s excitement.</p><p>\u201cI want to see New Orleans!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Branson, Missouri...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, me and the Oak Ridge Boys,\u201d Bethanne said, laughing now and feeling energized by her spur-of-the-moment decision.</p><p>\u201cAnd Andy Williams,\u201d Ruth moaned, crossing her hands over her heart.</p><p>\u201cFine, Andy Williams, it is.\u201d Bethanne was gratified by Ruth\u2019s reaction. \u201cIt might take me a couple of days to clear my desk,\u201d she warned. Thankfully, Julia was more than capable of filling in for her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to leave until after Memorial Day,\u201d Ruth said, eyes bright with unshed tears. \u201cOh, Bethanne, you don\u2019t know how happy this makes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy, too,\u201d she said, and she was. This spontaneous decision felt incredibly right. She needed time away to think about Grant\u2019s recent overtures. She didn\u2019t know if it was possible or even desirable for them to reconnect; after everything she\u2019d been through, she could hardly imagine him in her life again. And yet... She couldn\u2019t help wondering whether her feelings for Grant, the love that had survived the divorce, would be enough to sustain a second attempt at marriage. Could the woman she\u2019d become find a place for him in the very different life she\u2019d created?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d Ruth pressed.</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>Ruth studied her, frowning slightly. \u201cYou aren\u2019t doing it out of pity, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bethanne tried to hold back a smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s pity or not. I\u2019m just grateful to have you along.\u201d</p><p>And then she clapped her hands like a schoolgirl.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Annie cried the instant Bethanne walked into Parties\u2019 Queen Ann Hill headquarters. The retail store was her very first location, and she\u2019d quickly taken over the offices on the second floor. \u201cWhere have you been? Julia\u2019s been waiting for half an hour, and the other managers are arriving in fifteen minutes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry...\u201d Bethanne mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer your cell.\u201d Annie was pacing Bethanne\u2019s office like a fretful cat.</p><p>\u201cI was with Grandma Hamlin.\u201d</p><p>Annie stopped pacing. \u201cShe\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever better.\u201d Bethanne went into the supply cabinet and grabbed a yellow pad. Although Julia was already in the conference room, she picked up the messages on her desk and shuffled through them. She paused when she saw Grant\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cDad phoned,\u201d Annie said from behind her. \u201cI talked to him.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne turned to face her daughter. To her relief, Annie and Grant had mended fences in the past couple of years; their once-close relationship had reemerged. Father and daughter had always been so much alike, both of them charmers, both of them stubborn to the point of inflexibility. Their reconciliation had really begun when Tiffany left Grant. Annie certainly hadn\u2019t shed any tears over the breakup of that marriage. In fact, she\u2019d had difficulty hiding her joy.</p><p>\u201cI feel like Dad\u2019s himself again these days,\u201d Annie said earnestly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Bethanne responded, returning her attention to the stack of phone messages.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s working really hard to make it up to Andrew and me.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne met her daughter\u2019s gaze squarely. \u201cHe\u2019s your father, and you two are the most precious things on earth to him.\u201d She doubted Grant understood how close he\u2019d come to losing his children during the years he\u2019d made Tiffany his priority.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to call him back?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>The slip was at the bottom of her pile. \u201cI\u2019ll do it when I have time,\u201d Bethanne said firmly. \u201cNow, I can\u2019t keep Julia waiting any longer.\u201d</p><p>As they hurried down the hallway, Annie said breathlessly, \u201cVance called this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Vance was her daughter\u2019s college boyfriend. They\u2019d dated on and off for almost three years. Bethanne knew Annie was serious about him, but she felt they were both too immature to even think about marriage. Despite her age and accomplishments, Annie still seemed so young to Bethanne. Perhaps it was a result of the divorce, but Annie\u2019s attachment to both her and Grant struck her as a bit excessive\u2014seeking them out for advice and approval at every turn. Bethanne wondered if she\u2019d been that dependent on her parents when she was Annie\u2019s age. She didn\u2019t think so. However, she hadn\u2019t had to cope with the disintegration of her family or the anger and grief it caused.</p><p>\u201cVance calls or texts at least six times a day,\u201d Bethanne said. That might be an exaggeration but they seemed to be in constant communication.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to dinner at the Space Needle!\u201d Annie was practically vibrating with excitement.</p><p>Bethanne arched an eyebrow. \u201cAre you two celebrating a special anniversary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I remember. And trust me, if anyone would remember, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne agreed. Like her father, Annie had extraordinary recall when it came to dates, facts and figures; she\u2019d always been a top student in math and history. Bethanne thought of the endless memory games Annie and Grant loved to play on long car trips, egging each other on to greater and greater feats of recall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the occasion?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to ask me to marry him,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Bethanne did an admirable job of hiding her dismay. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Annie nodded. \u201cWhen I mentioned something last week about Andrew and Courtney\u2019s wedding, he told me he\u2019s a big believer in marriage and family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFamily is important,\u201d Bethanne said noncommittally.</p><p>\u201cYes, and we agree on practically everything\u2014family, church, politics. Those are the important subjects, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Annie searched Bethanne\u2019s face for confirmation.</p><p>\u201cI do, but a single comment on the subject doesn\u2019t mean Vance is ready to propose, Annie.\u201d Bethanne\u2019s voice was gentle, but inside she marveled at her daughter\u2019s naivet\u00e9. She didn\u2019t want Annie to set herself up for disappointment. A mother never outgrew her protective instincts, she realized.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know, but Nicole saw him at a jewelry store in the University District. It only makes sense that he was looking at engagement rings. Why else does a guy go to a jeweler?\u201d</p><p>For any number of reasons, but Bethanne couldn\u2019t bring herself to burst her daughter\u2019s bubble. \u201cWhen\u2019s the hot date?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFriday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous. I hope everything works out.\u201d Either way\u2014engagement or not\u2014she had concerns, but this wasn\u2019t the time to discuss them.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d Annie just about skipped down the hall toward her own office.</p><p>\u201cAnnie,\u201d Bethanne called out, stopping her. \u201cI have a bit of news myself.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter turned back, anxiety clouding her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw your grandma, she told me she\u2019s planning to drive to Florida next week. I\u2019ve decided to go with her.\u201d</p> <p>Annie\u2019s mouth sagged open. \u201cYou and Grandma are driving to Florida?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t say it like that. We\u2019re two mature women who can look after ourselves. Your grandmother\u2019s wanted to make a road trip across the country nearly her entire adult life, and for one reason or another it\u2019s always been put off. She\u2019s determined to go\u2014and I can\u2019t let her go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Aunt Robin?\u201d As soon as the words were out, Annie shook her head. \u201cNever mind. Aunt Robin wouldn\u2019t take the time for that.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne nodded. \u201cIt was a...sudden decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the business?\u201d Annie nodded in the direction of the conference room, where the various store managers would soon be gathering.</p><p>\u201cJulia can handle whatever comes up in the next few weeks,\u201d Bethanne said calmly. \u201cI\u2019ll be accessible by phone and email, if she really needs me.\u201d</p><p>Annie stared at Bethanne. \u201cWow, Mom, taking off on the spur of the moment\u2014that isn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I\u2019ve got a lot to think about right now, and this will give me a chance to weigh my options.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes Dad know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Bethanne said, waving as she hurried to the conference room. \u201cI\u2019m sure your grandmother will tell him when the time is right.\u201d</p><p>The meeting with Julia was abbreviated due to the arrival of the managers. Afterward, Julia and Bethanne parted with a promise to catch up the following day. When she finally made it back to her office to return phone calls, Bethanne saved Grant\u2019s for last. The commercial real estate market was still depressed across the country, but it had recently started to pick up in the Seattle area. As the broker in charge of one of his company\u2019s most successful offices, Grant had significant responsibilities.</p><p>His assistant connected her immediately. \u201cBethanne,\u201d he said, sounding grateful to hear from her.</p><p>\u201cHello, Grant. Annie told me you called.\u201d She got right to the point; they were both busy people.</p><p>\u201cTell me, when did our little girl become such a dynamic young businesswoman?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne smiled. \u201cI believe she inherited her talent from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d Grant countered. \u201cYou\u2019re the business powerhouse these days.\u201d</p><p>Grant had always been skilled at making everyone feel special\u2014like the most important person in the room\u2014and it had served him well in his career. Now he was turning that charm on her, something he hadn\u2019t done in years.</p><p>\u201cI called about dinner on Friday. You never did say if you were available.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need a reminder; his invitation had been on her mind for the past three days.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d go to that little Mexican restaurant we used to like so much,\u201d he went on, obviously\u2014and correctly\u2014interpreting her silence as hesitation.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still at the same location, can you believe it?\u201d He laughed nervously. \u201cWhat do you say? You and me, for old times\u2019 sake?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne closed her eyes, her knuckles white around the receiver. She was decidedly tired of that expression. \u201cNot all our old times were that happy, Grant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he was quick to admit. \u201cBut we do need to discuss Andrew\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do that just as easily over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could...\u201d Grant conceded. \u201cBut I\u2019d much rather do it over a margarita.\u201d She heard him sigh. \u201cYou used to like yours on the rocks. Do you still prefer them that way?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne couldn\u2019t recall the last time she\u2019d even had a margarita. Too many hours in the office and not nearly enough fun. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, will you have dinner with me Friday night?\u201d He wasn\u2019t pleading, but she thought she detected a note of yearning in his voice.</p><p>She exhaled and, with her arm hugged tight around her middle, finally said, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the restaurant at seven,\u201d she interjected, far more comfortable providing her own transportation.</p><p>\u201cSeven,\u201d he repeated, not bothering to hide his enthusiasm. \u201cSee you then.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>Bethanne sat at her desk late Friday afternoon and reviewed the latest figures Julia had given her on the other five stores. She was fortunate that in a struggling economy, Parties continued to thrive. Julia had various suggestions she wanted Bethanne to consider, and in the past months Bethanne had come to rely on her more and more. If it wasn\u2019t for her operations manager, she wouldn\u2019t be able to take time off to travel with her mother-in-law.</p><p>In the years since the start-up of Parties, her business had experienced steady growth and, according to Julia, there was huge potential for the future as long as they were judicious about their finances and their expansion plans.</p><p>One of the benefits of her success was the knowledge that she could travel anyplace in the world she desired, something she\u2019d long dreamed about. This was heady for Bethanne. She had good business instincts, as well as basic skills she\u2019d learned watching her husband and his colleagues. Because her ideas were so innovative, she\u2019d received more than her share of attention from the press. She kept copies of the articles written about her novel approach to parties.</p><p>Reaching for the folder, she leafed through it, scanning each news clipping and magazine article with a sense of pride and accomplishment. She paused at last year\u2019s photograph of herself smiling at the camera, standing outside this building, which housed the original Parties. The photo was flattering. She was at her leanest, her shoulder-length brown hair turned up slightly at the ends. Not bad for forty-seven.</p><p>When she\u2019d seen the picture, her thought had been that she looked happy. It was at that moment that she\u2019d realized she was over Grant. Life did go on.</p><p>Soon after that photo was published with a profile of her in USA Today, Annie told her that Tiffany had left Grant and filed for divorce. A few days later, Grant had called to give Bethanne the news himself; it was the first time they\u2019d spoken in months. He\u2019d sounded depressed, and Bethanne had felt sympathetic. After all, she\u2019d been there....</p><p>Grant. Her thoughts had turned to him often since his call earlier in the week. After years of forcing him from her mind, she found it uncomfortable to be entertaining memories of him now.</p><p>Bethanne checked her watch. If she was going to be on time to meet her ex-husband at Zapata\u2019s, she needed to leave the office now. Because it was the start of the Memorial Day weekend, she was caught in heavy traffic and arrived at the restaurant ten minutes late.</p><p>As she entered the dining room, the scent of fried tortilla chips and spicy salsa triggered a wave of nostalgia. When they were first married, this hole-in-the-wall restaurant had been their favorite. They could order a bean burrito, plus two tacos with rice and beans, and split the dinner for $5.50, including tip. If they had extra money, they bought a single margarita with two straws.</p><p>It had been important to them both that Bethanne stay home with the children until they were in school. Once Annie went into first grade, Bethanne had been prepared to finish her degree and rejoin the workforce, but Grant had asked her not to. She was his partner, his support\u2014and he liked having her available to manage the day-to-day tasks that allowed him to focus on his career. Bethanne had agreed; by then he was doing well financially and he always let her know how much he appreciated her support.</p><p>Seeing her across the room, Grant stood and waved. The small restaurant was crowded. Almost every seat was taken and the wait-staff angled between tables, carrying trays of drinks with chips and salsa. Mariachi music blared from the speakers.</p><p>Bethanne made her way over to Grant, who\u2019d remained standing. He immediately helped her remove her jacket. He\u2019d always been attentive about those gentlemanly details. He would open a door for her or pull out her chair as a matter of course\u2014but he didn\u2019t hesitate to rip out her heart.</p><p>Stop.</p><p>She refused to let the old bitterness overtake her. She\u2019d never been the vindictive type, and she\u2019d worked hard to put the past behind her.</p><p>\u201cI ordered you a margarita,\u201d Grant said as he slid her chair under her. She felt his hand graze her shoulder, lingering just a second beyond casual.</p><p>The warm chips and salsa were already there. Bethanne\u2019s stomach growled as she reached for one, wondering if the salsa was still as spicy as she remembered. One bite assured her it was.</p><p>\u201cThe menu\u2019s almost unchanged after all these years,\u201d Grant said as he sat down across from her. He held her look for a moment before opening his menu again.</p><p>Obviously, this place brought back memories for him, too.</p><p>\u201cI see the prices have changed,\u201d she remarked, scanning her own menu. A picture of the Mexican general adorned the plastic front.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWell, I guess we can afford it now.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t recognize any of the staff. The waitress brought two margaritas over ice, each with a thick ring of salt around the rim of the glass.</p><p>\u201cAt least we can have two drinks this time around,\u201d Grant said, watching her lick the salt off her glass and take a sip.</p><p>His familiar use of we made it sound as if they were a couple again, but she didn\u2019t react. \u201cI hope the same holds true for dinner,\u201d she said mildly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI believe anything you order will fit into my budget,\u201d Grant murmured, still studying the selections.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever told you I don\u2019t like bean burritos,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d He sent her a shocked look over the top of his menu. \u201cBut...but we ordered it every time we came here.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne said nothing. In their dozens of meals at Zapata\u2019s, not once had he asked why she never ate her half of the burrito.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were just being generous,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know\u2014saving more for me, the way you did for the kids.\u201d He set down the menu, genuinely crestfallen. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bethanne, for being so oblivious.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne was relieved that the waitress returned at that moment for their order. She chose the Tex-Mex salad, while Grant ordered chicken enchiladas and a bean burrito combination plate.</p><p>As soon as the waitress left the table, Bethanne took a long drink of her margarita, savoring the warmth spreading through her. She sat back in her chair and waited. Grant had asked for this meeting. She was curious to hear what he had to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met Courtney a couple of times now,\u201d he began, referring to their son\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. \u201cI like her a great deal. She\u2019s very down-to-earth, a good match for Andrew, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too,\u201d Bethanne murmured.</p> <p>\u201cI understand that Andrew and Courtney are planning the wedding themselves, and that you\u2019re helping them, which makes sense.\u201d It was rare to see Grant visibly nervous, but he seemed to be so now, fiddling with his silverware and avoiding eye contact. He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019d like to contribute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to take that up with Andrew and Courtney,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>He nodded absently. They both knew that Andrew had ambivalent feelings toward his father. Bethanne felt a pang of sorrow for Grant. She knew he hoped the wedding would provide him with a means of getting closer to Andrew. \u201cSo, is there anything I can do?\u201d Grant asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.... I\u2019ve given Andrew and Courtney contact information and steered them toward people I trust.\u201d The couple had made their own decisions, and while Bethanne had offered suggestions, this was their wedding. She\u2019d walked a fine line, trying to advise them without being controlling.</p><p>\u201cWeddings are expensive,\u201d Grant observed.</p><p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d Bethanne had seen people spend upward of thirty thousand dollars.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to help financially.\u201d He rested his hands on the table.</p><p>She sipped her margarita. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of you, Grant, but you should be telling Andrew and Courtney this, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been generous with the children,\u201d Bethanne conceded. A slight exaggeration, but close enough to the truth.</p><p>\u201cI almost lost them,\u201d Grant muttered, staring at his hands. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure, you know, if it was a good idea to tell Andrew I wanted to help financially... I thought it might be better coming from you.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne waited until he met her eyes. \u201cNo, you tell Andrew,\u201d she said. \u201cHe loves you, Grant. You\u2019re his father.\u201d</p><p>Grant bowed his head in a gesture of agreement or maybe just avoidance.</p><p>\u201cIs that the reason you asked me to dinner?\u201d she asked. Might as well be blunt\u2014it would\u2019ve saved her a lot of angst if he\u2019d come right out and said so.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t answer for a moment. \u201cI have something else I\u2019d like to discuss,\u201d he said quietly. She strained to hear him over the raucous mariachi music.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the wedding...do you think\u2014\u201d He hesitated. \u201cWould you object if the two of us sat together at the church? As Andrew\u2019s parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSat together?\u201d Bethanne kept her expression neutral.</p><p>\u201cMost divorced couples don\u2019t,\u201d he acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to present a united front to our guests and, more importantly, to our families and our children.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to grimace. He hadn\u2019t been concerned about this \u201cunited front\u201d when he\u2019d abandoned them. Oh, why was it so hard to truly forgive? She was shocked by how easily her anger still surfaced, when she\u2019d assumed that she\u2019d moved past the pain.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be awkward, if you think about it,\u201d Grant reasoned. \u201cYou haven\u2019t remarried and I\u2019m single again. Wouldn\u2019t it feel a bit odd for the two of us to sit separately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re single now, but you haven\u2019t always been,\u201d she said tartly.</p><p>Grant stiffened. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking is that you consider it. We\u2019d sit together during the ceremony and stand together in the receiving line. If you agree, I\u2019d appreciate it, but if not...\u201d He took a deep breath, as if to calm himself. \u201cWell, if not\u2014I\u2019ll understand. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say, and doing a rather poor job of it, is that I\u2019ll accept whatever you decide.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne couldn\u2019t suppress her retort. \u201cIn other words, you want the world to know all is forgiven? That we\u2019re still friends? That\u2019s a noble thought, but I\u2019m not sure it sends the right message.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his drink. \u201cI know it may not be possible for you to ever completely forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne felt a twinge of shame. She sighed heavily. \u201cI apologize, Grant,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you. Really.\u201d She\u2019d given him twenty years of her life. He was the father of her children. And there was a part of her that still loved him.</p><p>Grant\u2019s eyes flickered with hope. \u201cCan we do that? The two of us together for Andrew\u2019s sake on the most important day of his life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask,\u201d he said, and didn\u2019t raise the subject again.</p><p>Their meals arrived shortly afterward. Grant spooned salsa over his enchiladas. Bethanne remained silent as she waited for him to hand her the bowl.</p><p>\u201cI understand Annie\u2019s got a hot date tonight,\u201d he said.</p><p>Although Annie rarely mentioned her conversations with her father, Bethanne knew the two of them spoke regularly these days.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your impression of Vance?\u201d Grant asked, sliding his fork under the steaming enchilada.</p><p>Bethanne finished spooning salsa over her own dish as she gathered her thoughts. \u201cHe\u2019s a good kid...a bit immature, I\u2019d say.\u201d She paused. \u201cBut then, so is Annie.\u201d She took another sip of her drink. \u201cHe\u2019s an archaeology major and graduated this year. As far as I know, he\u2019s going to graduate school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie seems to think he\u2019s about to pop the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she said.\u201d Bethanne set her fork down. \u201cFrankly, I feel they\u2019re both too young for marriage. If they do become engaged, I hope they decide on a lengthy engagement.\u201d</p><p>Grant frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel Vance is a good choice for our daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you implied.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne\u2019s gaze was direct. \u201cNo, what I said is that I hope she\u2019d have the sense to wait before making that kind of commitment.\u201d</p><p>Grant took a bite of his enchilada. \u201cWere we too young?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, uncertain how to answer. Like Annie and Vance, Bethanne and Grant had attended the same college. He was a business major and she\u2019d been pursuing a degree in education. They\u2019d met over the summer between her junior and senior year. From their first date, Grant Hamlin had become her entire world. They were engaged by Christmas, and while her parents liked Grant, they\u2019d wanted them to delay the wedding until after Bethanne graduated.</p><p>Waiting, however, felt impossible. Grant was out of school and job-hunting. He was hired by Boeing in their corporate office, and with his first paycheck bought her an engagement ring.</p><p>Against her parents\u2019 wishes, Bethanne dropped out of school just six months shy of graduation. From that point forward she\u2019d dedicated her life to being a good wife and mother. She\u2019d worked briefly in a department store, but only until Andrew\u2019s birth.</p><p>\u201cToo young?\u201d she repeated his question. \u201cPerhaps...\u201d</p><p>They finished their meal quickly after that, avoiding awkward subjects. When they left the restaurant, Grant walked her to her car.</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed dinner,\u201d he said, standing beside her. \u201cDid you?\u201d The driver\u2019s side door was open and she\u2019d already thrown her purse on the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your dinner companion?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a warning look: don\u2019t push it. \u201cTonight brought back a lot of memories,\u201d was all she said.</p><p>\u201cIt did for me, too.\u201d He touched her car, tracing patterns in the dust. \u201cWe were happy, Bethanne,\u201d he said, so softly she almost missed it.</p><p>She nodded, suddenly sad. \u201cWe were,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAt one time.\u201d</p><p>He tentatively raised his hands to touch the curve of her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019d give anything to take back the past six years,\u201d he said, staring down at her.</p><p>\u201cMake that seven,\u201d she added. His affair with Tiffany had been going on long before he\u2019d asked for the divorce.</p><p>\u201cSeven,\u201d he amended, and exhaled slowly. Then something in him seemed to deflate, and she read the regret in his eyes. \u201cTell me...is there any hope for us?\u201d</p><p>As she considered his question, she saw him tense, as if anticipating a blow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, shaking her head. Everything was just so confusing....</p><p>\u201cWould it be possible to put the past behind us\u2014forget about the divorce and pretend the past seven years never happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispered brokenly. \u201cIf I could take away what I did to you and the kids, I would. I\u2019d pay whatever it cost. If you wanted blood, I\u2019d bleed. I\u2019m miserable without you, Bethanne.\u201d His words were heartbreaking in their sincerity. \u201cTell me you\u2019d be willing to let me have a second chance. All I need is a sliver of hope.\u201d</p><p>He wanted an answer...but as hard as she tried, Bethanne couldn\u2019t give him one.</p><p>A lump formed in her throat. She had loved Grant...still did in certain ways that were tied to their shared past, to the memories of their marriage, the years of struggle and sacrifice, the happiness of companionship. And despite everything, they were linked forever through their children.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He smiled then, and his shoulders relaxed. \u201cThat\u2019s enough for now.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Annie rummaged around inside her mother\u2019s closet looking for the silver chain belt that would go perfectly with her Mexican-style skirt. When Vance came by to pick her up for dinner, she wanted him to be awestruck by her beauty. It wasn\u2019t every day of the week that a girl got a marriage proposal\u2014if that was what he intended. Annie thought so; all the evidence pointed to exactly that. Dinner at an expensive restaurant, being seen in a high-end jewelry store. What else was she to think? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She located the belt and wrapped it around her waist, checking her reflection in the full-length mirror that hung on her mother\u2019s bathroom door. The mirror also reflected the queen-size bed her parents had once shared. Even after six years of living alone, her mother still slept on the right-hand side. Not in the middle.</p><p>Silly as it sounded, this gave Annie hope that her parents would one day reunite. It was what her father wanted most in the world. What Annie wanted, too. Her parents were meant to be together. Her father had made a terrible mistake, but he was sorry. More than anything he wanted to make it up to the family, and in Annie\u2019s opinion they should let him.</p><p>It felt good to be close to her dad again. Now that the lovely Tiffany was gone, Annie felt there was real hope for a reconciliation between her parents. It just seemed wrong for them to live apart. The problem was getting her mother to recognize how sincere he was and take him back. Annie loved them both so much, and all she wanted was for them to be happy. What they did with their lives wasn\u2019t really up to her, as Andrew pointed out with annoying regularity, but sometimes she felt she understood them better than they understood themselves.</p><p>The security alarm beeped, indicating that someone had entered the house. \u201cIs that you, Mom?\u201d Annie called down from the second-story hallway.</p> <p>\u201cAnnie? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Annie had her own apartment near the University of Washington campus. \u201cI came to borrow your silver belt. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you and Dad finished with dinner already?\u201d she asked as she walked down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYes, it didn\u2019t take long.\u201d Bethanne hung her jacket in the hall closet and smiled over at Annie. \u201cYou look fabulous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Confirmation from her mother meant everything.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is Vance picking you up for dinner?\u201d her mother asked, glancing at her watch.</p><p>\u201cEight-thirty. Our reservation isn\u2019t until nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little late for dinner, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Annie nodded. \u201cVance said that was the earliest he could get us a table. Every tourist visiting Seattle wants to eat at the Space Needle. Vance must have pulled a few strings to even get a reservation.\u201d</p><p>Her mother considered the comment. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize Vance knew anyone with strings to pull.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom,\u201d she protested. \u201cVance had classes with Matt, remember? And Matt buses tables at the Space Needle. Matt must\u2019ve put in a word for Vance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have.\u201d Her mother walked into the living room, where she kept her knitting.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re Courtney\u2019s wedding gloves coming along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far so good.\u201d Bethanne settled into her favorite chair. She had the pattern on a clipboard, held there by a magnet that marked her row. Her mother picked up her glasses, perching them on the end of her nose, and her knitting, which only had a few rows completed.</p><p>This was a far more complicated project than anything Annie would ever undertake. \u201cI want you to knit something for my wedding, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of doing anything else\u2014when the time comes. If you want, you can take a look at the dress and veil I wore when I married your father. It\u2019s yours should you choose to wear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Mom, could I really wear your wedding dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about the same size, so I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d</p> <p>Her parents\u2019 wedding picture used to hang on the stairway wall. Annie had seen it practically every day of her life until after their divorce. She didn\u2019t know where the photograph was anymore. The last time she\u2019d noticed it, the glass had been cracked. She assumed her mother had broken it the morning her father announced he was in love with the lovely Tiffany.</p><p>Annie couldn\u2019t quite remember what the wedding dress looked like. What she did recall was the joy on her mother\u2019s face. She\u2019d been such a young woman\u2014younger than Annie\u2014and a beautiful bride. Her father had been young, too, and so handsome. Annie had loved that photograph.</p><p>\u201cIt would make me happy if you decided to wear my wedding dress when you do get married.\u201d Then, as if her mother wanted to change the subject, she said, \u201cOh, and thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not mentioning to your father that Grandma Hamlin and I are taking this road trip.\u201d</p><p>Annie felt uneasy about the whole plan. The thought of her mother and grandmother traveling unescorted across the entire country, from Washington to Florida, sent chills down her spine. \u201cI still don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d Her mother leaned forward and, using a yellow pen, marked off the row she\u2019d just finished.</p><p>\u201cYou told Dad, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Annie asked. She hadn\u2019t said anything about it because she was sure her mother would.</p><p>\u201cActually, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Annie couldn\u2019t believe her mother would keep this a secret. \u201cDad has a right to know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne glanced up from her knitting. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...because he might object.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie, sweetheart, I stopped listening to your father\u2019s objections a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re going with Grandma!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she can tell him.\u201d</p><p>What her mother said made sense, but Annie had the feeling her grandmother wasn\u2019t going to let Grant or Aunt Robin know what she intended, either.</p><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to say anything, then someone needs to let him know.\u201d</p><p>Her mother heaved an exasperated sigh. \u201cDo what you want, but as far as I\u2019m concerned it isn\u2019t any of his business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Mom, how can you say that?\u201d Annie grabbed her sweater. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. Wish me luck.\u201d She held up her left hand and wiggled her ring finger, then rushed out the door.</p><p>Vance picked her up right on time and looked great in his slacks and plaid shirt with a button-down collar. He didn\u2019t have a tie\u2014he hated them\u2014but that was fine. He\u2019d wear a tuxedo for the wedding.</p><p>Annie had narrowed her bridesmaid choices down to five. She\u2019d ask Courtney, her sister-in-law-to-be, and Libby, Belle, Jazmine and Maddy. Ideally, she\u2019d like six or seven bridesmaids, but that would require the same number of groomsmen and make for an impossibly large wedding party. In any case, with everything she knew about organizing social gatherings, their wedding would be the event of the year.</p><p>Vance seemed unusually quiet as they drove to the Space Needle. He didn\u2019t use valet parking, so they walked the short distance from the closest lot.</p><p>\u201cOh, Vance, this is a lovely idea,\u201d she said, clutching his hand. He could be such a romantic.</p><p>He responded with a weak smile.</p><p>His hand was sweaty, and Annie realized Vance was nervous. She longed to hold on to every detail of this special night and keep them close to her heart. One day she\u2019d tell their children about the evening their father proposed. These were the moments of which family stories were made.</p><p>After the elevator ride to the top of the Space Needle, they were seated at a table overlooking the city. The restaurant did a slow rotation, so that during the course of the meal, they\u2019d be treated to a full view of Puget Sound, the Cascades to the east and the Olympics to the west, along with the Seattle city lights.</p><p>Staring at her menu, Annie was convinced she wouldn\u2019t be able to eat a single bite until Vance got up the courage to propose. From the way he kept looking uneasily around and drinking from his water glass, she figured he might need some help.</p><p>\u201cTonight\u2019s special, isn\u2019t it, Vance?\u201d she said as she set aside her menu.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d He smiled, but his eyes refused to meet hers.</p><p>\u201cAre you...nervous about something?\u201d This part would make a great addition to the story when she repeated it to their children. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVance, there\u2019s no need. We know each other so well, there isn\u2019t anything we can\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her as if to gauge the truth of her words. \u201cYou\u2019re sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositively sure.\u201d She offered him one of her brightest, most encouraging smiles.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should have dinner first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you enjoy the meal if you put this off?\u201d she asked gently.</p><p>He shook his head and his shoulders sagged. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t we discuss what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d Maybe it would help if she told him she knew what he intended, but she decided not to ruin his moment. \u201cI believe I know why you\u2019re trying to make this night so special,\u201d she said instead, hoping she didn\u2019t sound coy. \u201cPlease, Vance, don\u2019t be intimidated. Just ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you\u2019re sure.\u201d He braced his forearms on the edge of the table. \u201cFirst, you know you\u2019re the one for me, right?\u201d</p><p>Annie\u2019s heart beat just a little faster. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the man for me.\u201d She stretched her arm across the table and Vance took her hand. His thumb stroked her wrist.</p><p>Thankfully, the waiter seemed to recognize that now was not the time to take their drink order. He started toward their table, then did a quick about-face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why this decision has been so difficult,\u201d Vance continued.</p><p>\u201cDifficult?\u201d Annie didn\u2019t understand why giving her an engagement ring would be the slightest bit difficult.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to go to Europe for a year.\u201d The words came out in a rush as if he were gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cEurope? A year?\u201d she repeated in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWith Matt,\u201d Vance elaborated.</p><p>\u201cMatt? The same Matt who got you the reservation for tonight? That Matt?\u201d</p><p>Vance nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about it for months,\u201d he said excitedly, \u201cand we both felt that if we were ever going to do it, this is the time. I\u2019ve got my graduation money and Matt\u2019s been saving up what\u2019s left over from his paycheck. We plan on staying in hostels and traveling from country to country by train. There\u2019s even a chance we might be able to work on a dig near Ephesus. That\u2019s in Turkey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where Ephesus is,\u201d she said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cRight...sorry. You\u2019re not upset, are you?\u201d</p><p>This was a joke. It had to be. Only, she wasn\u2019t laughing and Vance seemed about to bolt.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure you know I love you,\u201d Vance went on. \u201cAnd...and I didn\u2019t want you to hear from anyone else that Jessie Olivarez is going with us. She\u2019s Matt\u2019s girlfriend and an archaeology major, too, but I didn\u2019t want there to be any misunderstanding. Like, I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m dating Jessie because I\u2019m not. I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie?\u201d Vance and Matt were taking a girl with them. \u201cJessie Olivarez is traveling with you?\u201d They\u2019d met twice, and Annie found her clingy and immature.</p><p>\u201cI knew you couldn\u2019t take that much time out of your life,\u201d Vance said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your brother\u2019s wedding and another year of school. Besides, you\u2019re working with your mom, and that would make it hard to leave for so long.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou could have asked!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to, but...well, you know, you\u2019ve got responsibilities and you\u2019d constantly be on the phone checking in with your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting my mother and I are joined at the hip?\u201d Talk about adding insult to injury!</p><p>\u201cNo...no. Annie, please, there\u2019s no need to raise your voice.\u201d He glanced nervously around them.</p> <p>Seething on the inside, Annie closed her eyes in an effort to control her raging emotions. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening,\u201d she finally muttered.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a shock and everything,\u201d Vance responded, sounding calm now, \u201cbut I brought you here because I wanted our goodbye dinner to be special.\u201d After what was obviously meant to be a significant pause, he said, \u201cI feel our love is strong enough to wait a year, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer right away. She could barely take in that he didn\u2019t have an engagement ring in his pocket, let alone the fact that he planned to travel in Europe with his friend and another woman.</p><p>\u201cYou went to University Jewelers,\u201d she mumbled. She\u2019d assumed that meant he was going to propose. She\u2019d assumed\u2014</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d He frowned and then relaxed. \u201cOh, yeah. My mom asked me to drop off her watch for repair. It was still under warranty.\u201d</p> <p>Annie wadded up the linen napkin on her lap. \u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d She would be adult about this. Okay, fine, he wasn\u2019t asking her to marry him. Instead, he wanted her to twiddle her thumbs for a year while he explored Europe with Matt and Jessie Olivarez. Jessie Olivarez!</p><p>\u201cActually...the three of us are flying out tomorrow night. Do you think you could drop us off at the airport?\u201d</p><p>He was out of his mind.</p><p>\u201cMatt\u2019s father was going to do it, but he forget and made other plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to drive you and another girl to the airport?\u201d The insensitive jerk!</p><p>\u201cIf you could. It\u2019d be a big help and that way you can see me off.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d see him off, all right. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said, then leaned down and reached for her purse.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Clearly Vance had talents she never knew. Now he was a mind reader as well as a jerk. \u201cWhat was your first clue?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cBut you said there wasn\u2019t anything we couldn\u2019t discuss! Come on, Annie, it\u2019s only a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than the fact that you\u2019re going to Europe, Vance. You\u2019ve been planning this for a long time. Didn\u2019t you even think to mention it to me?\u201d By his own admission, this trip had been in the works for months.</p><p>He did look slightly guilty. \u201cI wanted to tell you, but Matt said it would just cause problems. I can see he was right.\u201d</p><p>Annie stood and threw her napkin on the table. \u201cHave a great time, and when you get back, don\u2019t bother to call. We\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie,\u201d he cried, \u201cyou don\u2019t mean that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d They had the attention of half the restaurant. The entire room seemed to go quiet. Not wanting to be the subject of anyone\u2019s dinner conversation, Annie ran toward the elevator. A line had formed, waiting to be taken down to street level.</p><p>Vance hurried after her. \u201cI was afraid you were going to be upset. I wanted to tell you, I really did, but Matt said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know what Matt said.\u201d Annie crossed her arms and stared fixedly at the elevator door, willing it to open. Pressing her lips together, she did her best to ignore him. There was nothing Vance had to say that she wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Annie. I hate leaving when you\u2019re upset with me.\u201d</p><p>She turned her back and looked in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cAnnie, please.\u201d</p><p>What was taking the elevator so long? All she could think about was escaping Vance as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, be mad.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need any encouragement from him.</p><p>\u201cGive me the silent treatment. See if I care.\u201d</p><p>She pretended not to hear.</p><p>\u201cAll I want to know is if this means you won\u2019t be driving us to the airport.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around, shocked that he could even ask.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d He spoke with an air of defiance.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, Vance, I won\u2019t be driving you to the airport, but have a nice trip. In fact, have the time of your life because that\u2019s certainly what I intend to do.\u201d</p><p>The elevator arrived and, after it emptied, the line moved forward. Annie stepped inside and, just before the doors closed, she took one last look at Vance, standing in front of her, still holding the black linen napkin in his hand. She gave him a short, sarcastic wave.</p><p>\u201cTa-ta,\u201d she said as the door glided shut.</p><p>Five</p><p>The phone rang, waking Bethanne from a sound sleep. No one called in the middle of the night unless it was an emergency. Caller ID indicated her daughter\u2019s name. With nervous, uncooperative fingers Bethanne answered. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Annie wailed.</p><p>Shifting into a sitting position, Bethanne rubbed her eyes. \u201cAnnie, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Annie tried to speak but Bethanne couldn\u2019t understand a word she said. And what she did grasp made no sense. \u201cVance is going away?\u201d Bethanne asked.</p><p>\u201cTo Europe with Jessie.\u201d</p><p>This came out in a screech, which led Bethanne to believe Jessie was most likely a girl. So tonight\u2019s dinner at the Space Needle wasn\u2019t the marriage proposal Annie had so eagerly anticipated. While Bethanne was grateful, she hurt for her daughter.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... He actually wanted me to drive them to the airport. Can you believe that?\u201d The anger was coming through loud and clear.</p><p>\u201cHe said he couldn\u2019t ask me to go to Europe with him because I had another year of school and...and responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has responsibilities,\u201d Bethanne said, stifling a yawn.</p><p>\u201cI... Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what it was like when Daddy told you about...the lovely Tiffany, isn\u2019t it? You didn\u2019t know, you didn\u2019t even suspect. You were completely oblivious to what was going on right in front of you. Well, so was I.\u201d She sniffed loudly. \u201cI feel so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Annie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could Vance be so insensitive?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne remembered the shocked, numb sensation that had come over her when Grant left. Unlike her, Annie didn\u2019t have a twenty-year marriage; still, she\u2019d just been given a small taste of what Bethanne had experienced.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I go to Florida with you and Grandma Hamlin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bear to stay here alone.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne resisted the urge to remind her that Grant and her brother would be in town. And she had lots of friends. Annie was far from being alone. On the other hand, having her accompany them wasn\u2019t a bad idea. \u201cI\u2019m sure your grandmother will be fine with it, and I\u2019d love to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom,\u201d she said, still sniffling.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come home and sleep in your old room?\u201d Bethanne asked, thinking that what Annie really needed was to feel loved and protected.</p><p>\u201cNo...I\u2019ll be okay now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could, I\u2019d give you a big hug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re the best mom in the world.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne smiled sleepily.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom... Would you call Grandma in the morning and ask her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling Dad, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, go ahead.\u201d Bethanne had no objection to Grant\u2019s knowing her plans but she felt no obligation to tell him herself.</p><p>They spoke for a few more minutes and then Bethanne replaced the phone. Resting her head on the pillow, she closed her eyes, trying to go back to sleep.</p><p>This would be a fascinating trip across the country now that both her ex-mother-in-law and her daughter were coming.... Well, interesting at any rate. Bethanne drifted off as she began to make mental lists of the clothes she needed to pack and the people she needed to call.</p><p>Saturday morning she woke later than usual. Although it was a holiday weekend, she had a hundred things to take care of at work if they were going to head out early Wednesday morning.</p><p>After showering and dressing, she set off for the office. She\u2019d wait until after ten to call Ruth regarding Annie.</p><p>While she was driving in Seattle traffic, her cell phone rang. The readout on her dashboard showed Ruth\u2019s name and number.</p><p>Bethanne pushed a button on her steering wheel to answer the phone, and Ruth\u2019s voice came through.</p><p>\u201cBethanne, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in my car. What can I do for you, Ruth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be too much trouble to stop by the house this morning sometime...soon? I really hate to bother you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no bother. I\u2019ll leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will that take you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, about ten minutes, fifteen at the most. Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I...think so.\u201d Her voice wavered slightly, indicating that everything wasn\u2019t all right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ruth whispered gratefully.</p><p>When Bethanne pulled up to the Hamlin family home, she saw two cars in the driveway. The first belonged to Grant, and the second she guessed was Robin\u2019s. Brother and sister were double-teaming their mother. The poor woman needed backup.</p><p>Bethanne rang the doorbell, then let herself into the house. \u201cHello, anyone home?\u201d she called out.</p><p>Ruth appeared immediately, and the relief that spread over her features the instant she saw Bethanne was almost comical. The older woman rushed across the room to grab Bethanne\u2019s elbow. \u201cThank goodness you\u2019re here,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBethanne,\u201d Robin said in the tone she probably used to intimidate witnesses in the courtroom. \u201cTell me you aren\u2019t serious about driving cross-country on some ludicrous scheme of my mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>At one time Robin might have intimidated her, too, but no longer. With a cool smile, Bethanne faced her. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think attending a fifty-year class reunion is all that ludicrous.\u201d</p><p>Grant stood by the fireplace and seemed content to let his sister do the talking.</p><p>Robin didn\u2019t give up. \u201cYou two don\u2019t have a clue what you could be getting yourselves into. It isn\u2019t safe out there. You\u2019re both much too trusting. I simply can\u2019t allow my mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask your permission,\u201d Ruth told her daughter stiffly. She raised her chin to signal that she wouldn\u2019t be browbeaten, nor would she change her mind. Robin could disapprove all she liked.</p><p>\u201cMother, for once be sensible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSensible?\u201d Ruth repeated. \u201cI\u2019ve been nothing but sensible. It\u2019s my life, and at sixty-eight I should be able to do what I want, when I want. If I choose to drive to Florida, then I will.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m accompanying her.\u201d Now might not be the best time to mention that Annie was tagging along, so she held back that information. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a thing to worry about. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Robin looked up at the ceiling as though her patience had reached its limit. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m hearing this.\u201d Then, turning to Grant, she added, \u201cA little help from you certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you were doing well enough without me,\u201d he said, grinning at Bethanne and his mother.</p><p>Ruth and Bethanne stood side by side, with their arms linked.</p> <p>Ruth looked at her children. \u201cReally, there\u2019s no reason to worry. I have the route planned out, I joined AAA and I\u2019ve made hotel reservations. I\u2019ve rented a car, which I\u2019m dropping off in Florida, and we\u2019re flying back. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve thought of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a list of your medications?\u201d</p><p>Ruth frowned. \u201cI take one blood-pressure pill and that\u2019s it\u2014oh, and I have eyedrops. It isn\u2019t like I need a permission slip from my physician to travel. You\u2019re grasping at straws. Furthermore, you\u2019re treating me like a child. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe roads aren\u2019t safe,\u201d Robin insisted, \u201cespecially for two women traveling alone.\u201d</p><p>Again Ruth frowned. \u201cIf someone does kidnap and murder me, as you seem to expect, you can rest assured that I died happy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, honestly, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Bethanne?\u201d Grant asked. \u201cIf she\u2019s kidnapped and murdered, how would you feel then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had three karate lessons,\u201d Ruth said facetiously. \u201cI\u2019ll defend her.\u201d</p><p>Grant burst out laughing. Robin, however, didn\u2019t seem to find anything her mother said the least bit amusing.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Robin pointed an accusing finger at Bethanne. \u201cJust know that if anything happens to my mother because you were foolish enough to fall in with this crazy scheme of hers, I\u2019m holding you directly responsible.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne tightened her hold on Ruth\u2019s arm. \u201cI accept full responsibility for your mother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Ruth protested. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for myself. Besides, if anything did happen, it would be just like my daughter to file a lawsuit against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she won\u2019t,\u201d Grant said, glaring across the room at his sister.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it,\u201d Robin said, glaring right back. She crossed her arms as if waiting for them to capitulate. In that case, Bethanne hoped Robin was a patient woman because she had no intention of backing down. And she was sure Ruth wouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>After a tense moment, Robin dropped her arms. \u201cOkay, fine. Risk your life. Grant, if you weren\u2019t going to support me in this, you should never have come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I think I should be the one to drive them,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d If Ruth agreed to that, Bethanne was counting herself out right then and there. She wanted to get away, reflect, consider the possibility of a future with Grant. She could only do that if he wasn\u2019t trying to influence her. Having him along was out of the question.</p><p>Ruth looked from one to the other. \u201cYou\u2019d do that, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d need to make arrangements with the office and I might have to change the dates, but if this is important to you, Mom, I\u2019d make it work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t need me,\u201d Bethanne said, starting to withdraw her arm from Ruth\u2019s.</p><p>Her mother-in-law held her tight. \u201cCheck that computer phone thing you always have with you,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cTell me when you\u2019d be free for two entire weeks to drive me all the way across the country.\u201d</p><p>Grant took out his iPhone and scrolled down the screen. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019d need to make a few phone calls, rearrange some appointments...\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThe second and third weeks of August would be manageable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too late,\u201d Ruth told him. \u201cThe class reunion is June 17 and I\u2019m going to be there.\u201d She looked pointedly at Robin. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what scare tactics you use. I won\u2019t let tales of renegade truckers and biker gangs intimidate me. Bethanne and I are leaving on schedule and nothing you say is going to change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Mom, you can fly out for the reunion and we can drive back again in August,\u201d Grant suggested. \u201cThat way\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ruth shook her head. \u201cI heard all those promises from your father. Year after year he said we\u2019d drive across the country, but something always interfered. It did with Richard and it will with you. No, Grant, my mind is made up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so is mine,\u201d Bethanne added for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cThen I say\u2014\u201d Grant turned to his sister with a shrug \u201c\u2014that we let them go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike either of them could stop us,\u201d Ruth muttered.</p><p>Bethanne grinned and, leaning close, whispered, \u201cAnnie wants to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie,\u201d Ruth said aloud. \u201cWhy, that\u2019s a wonderful idea!\u201d</p><p>His daughter\u2019s name instantly caught Grant\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about Annie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe phoned last night and asked to come with us.\u201d</p><p>Instead of objecting, as she\u2019d half expected, Grant broke into a wide smile. \u201cI agree with Mom. Bringing Annie with you is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>This was an interesting development. Bethanne had assumed that once he learned Annie intended to accompany them, it would be all the excuse he needed to demand they fly.</p><p>Robin stared at her brother as though he\u2019d taken leave of his senses. \u201cI give up,\u201d she said, grabbing her briefcase and her purse. \u201cI can see I\u2019m fighting a losing battle. I have a meeting, so I won\u2019t waste any more time here.\u201d She stalked toward the door.</p><p>\u201cRobin,\u201d Bethanne said, halting her progress.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she snapped, whirling around.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to wish your mother and me a good trip.\u201d</p><p>But Robin just rolled her eyes and left the house, slamming the screen door on her way out.</p><p>As soon as his sister was gone, Grant started laughing. \u201cWell, she was in rare form, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne hugged Ruth, who had begun to tremble. \u201cEverything\u2019s okay, Ruth. We\u2019re going on the trip of a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>Grant waited until they\u2019d finished hugging before he spoke. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention this last night when we had dinner.\u201d The comment was filled with accusation.</p><p>\u201cWas there any reason I should?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re planning to drive across the country with my mother,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you think Robin and I were entitled to know?\u201d</p><p>This was a repeat of the conversation she\u2019d had with Annie. \u201cIt was up to Ruth to mention it, not me,\u201d she told him, unwilling to be chastised by her ex-husband.</p><p>Grant\u2019s response was a raised eyebrow, but he didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid Robin would make a fuss,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cI wish now I\u2019d kept my mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne agreed it would\u2019ve been preferable had Ruth waited until they were on the road, but that seemed a bit underhanded.</p><p>\u201cIf I can, I\u2019d like to ask one thing of you,\u201d Grant said, obviously deciding on a more conciliatory approach. \u201cI\u2019d feel better about the three of you being on the road if you\u2019d call me at least once a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could do that,\u201d Ruth said, eager to make peace with her family.</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d Grant posed the question to Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Ruth and Annie would be happy to keep in touch,\u201d she said curtly, reluctant to add her name to the list. The idea of calling her ex-husband didn\u2019t sit well with her, despite his unexpected support.</p><p>Grant held her look. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to relax if I don\u2019t know that the three most important women in my life are safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll check in,\u201d Bethanne eventually promised.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne drove to the office a few minutes later, but for the rest of that day, she couldn\u2019t get Grant out of her mind. She had to appreciate the fact that he hadn\u2019t joined forces with his sister against them. His concern for Ruth, Annie and her seemed genuine. She\u2019d given him a glimmer of hope that a reconciliation was possible; the idea didn\u2019t seem as repugnant to her as it once had and that, she guessed, was a good sign.</p><p>At her desk, she made all the necessary arrangements to leave the office for a few weeks. She went home at five that afternoon, slightly depressed at the prospect of an empty house, and wondered what it would\u2019ve been like if Grant had been there waiting for her with a glass of wine and a welcoming smile.</p><p>Six</p><p>\u201cFinally! We\u2019re actually on the road,\u201d Ruth marveled as they reached the summit of Snoqualmie Pass, crossing the Cascade Mountains. They were a little more than an hour outside Seattle, heading due east.</p><p>Ruth had the map supplied by AAA spread out on her lap and acted as navigator while Bethanne drove. Annie had claimed the backseat; she\u2019d been suspiciously quiet since they\u2019d left Seattle. Bethanne knew Vance had deeply hurt and disappointed her daughter. The fact that he\u2019d decided to travel in Europe for a year\u2014and hadn\u2019t bothered to tell her\u2014could only feel like a betrayal. Bethanne hoped that spending these weeks with her grandmother and with her would help. Annie was still young. In time she\u2019d recognize that Vance\u2019s leaving was the best thing that could have happened.</p><p>She remembered when she\u2019d told her parents she wanted to marry Grant. Her family, especially her father, had urged Bethanne to complete her education first. With just one semester to go before she obtained her degree, he\u2019d argued that it made sense to put off the wedding. Bethanne, however, had been unwilling to listen, unwilling to wait a day longer than necessary to be Grant\u2019s wife. And she\u2019d refused to be separated from him; the university was in the town of Pullman in eastern Washington, while he was working in Seattle. She\u2019d finish school later\u2014only she never had.</p><p>In retrospect, it had all worked out, but if she\u2019d had her teaching degree who knows how different her life might have been. One thing was sure; with a career of her own, or at least the qualifications for one, she wouldn\u2019t have felt so completely vulnerable when Grant asked for a divorce.</p><p>Annie\u2019s situation was different to that extent, anyway. She\u2019d graduate the following year with a business degree. She\u2019d gotten practical experience working at Parties and that would serve her well.</p><p>Annie stirred in the backseat, sitting up and yawning. She removed the iPod earbuds and stretched her arms to the side, arching her back. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust over the pass,\u201d Bethanne told her.</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I was,\u201d Annie murmured sadly. \u201cI haven\u2019t had much sleep the past few nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVance, Matt and Jessie got off okay,\u201d she muttered with no degree of pleasure. \u201cThey ended up getting a cab. He sent me a text from the airport and said he\u2019d keep in touch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bethanne suspected Vance\u2019s effort to communicate wouldn\u2019t last long. If the tone of Annie\u2019s voice was any indication, she\u2019d figured that out, too. Vance would stay in touch for the first few weeks, and then all his good intentions and promises would fall by the wayside. Frankly, Bethanne was just as glad, although she\u2019d never tell Annie that.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we spending the night?\u201d Annie asked, leaning forward and thrusting her head between Bethanne and Ruth in the front seat.</p><p>\u201cI have a reservation in Spokane,\u201d Ruth answered.</p><p>\u201cSpokane?\u201d Annie repeated. \u201cThat\u2019s only five hours from Seattle. Can\u2019t we drive farther than that?\u201d</p> <p>Ruth looked over at Bethanne. \u201cWhen I made these arrangements I intended to travel alone. I estimated that between four and six hours on the road would be my limit. I wanted to make it a leisurely trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been to Spokane at least a dozen times,\u201d Annie complained. \u201cI\u2019ve seen everything there is to see.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne had, as well. \u201cThis is your grandmother\u2019s trip, Annie,\u201d she reminded her daughter. \u201cIf Grandma Hamlin wants to spend the night in Spokane, then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Annie slumped back and folded her arms. \u201cDoes the hotel have a swimming pool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Ruth flipped open her itinerary.</p> <p>\u201cTell me the name of the hotel and I\u2019ll look it up on my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d Ruth sounded impressed.</p><p>\u201cAs long as they have a website I can.\u201d</p><p>Ruth gave Annie the hotel name, and Annie immediately started clicking away. Judging by her sigh, the hotel was pool-less.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have lunch, and then check out the local attractions. There\u2019s a mall close by, isn\u2019t there, and a movie theater? No reason we have to stay in the room.\u201d Bethanne offered what she hoped were helpful suggestions.</p><p>She assumed they\u2019d reach Spokane a little after one. The truth was, Bethanne agreed with Annie. She was certainly willing to drive beyond Spokane. However, this was Ruth\u2019s trip, as she\u2019d pointed out, and she was reluctant to do anything that would diminish her mother-in-law\u2019s enjoyment. Ruth had waited years for this opportunity, so Bethanne refused to cheat her out of even one second of her carefully planned adventure.</p> <p>\u201cI...I suppose we could go a bit farther,\u201d Ruth murmured after a while. \u201cI\u2019m anxious to get to Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from anyone there?\u201d Bethanne asked.</p><p>\u201cJust Jane and Diane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, fifty years,\u201d Annie said. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Ruth nodded slowly. \u201cThe funny thing is, it doesn\u2019t seem that long ago\u2014it really doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many years has it been for you, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see. I graduated in...\u201d Bethanne quickly calculated the years, astonished that it\u2019d been twenty-nine years since she\u2019d left high school. \u201cTwenty-nine years,\u201d she whispered, hardly able to believe it.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever go to your reunions?\u201d</p> <p>Annie certainly seemed to be in an inquisitive mood. \u201cNo. Your father\u2014\u201d Bethanne paused, about to lay the blame at Grant\u2019s feet. While it was true that Grant hadn\u2019t been enthusiastic about attending her high school functions\u2014or, for that matter, his own\u2014she\u2019d consented. She could\u2019ve gone by herself, and hadn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t like Eugene, Oregon, was all that far from Seattle. \u201cNo, I never did,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her father, an English professor now retired, had taught at the University of Oregon. Her mother had died a couple of years ago. Bethanne was proud of the way her father coped with being a widower. Despite his grief he hadn\u2019t given up on life; in fact, he was currently in England with a group of students on a Shakespearean tour.</p><p>They spoke and emailed regularly, and she\u2019d recently learned that he was dating. Her father had a more active social life than she did, which actually made her smile.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t Dad born in Oregon?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, in Pendleton,\u201d Ruth confirmed. \u201cRichard and I were newlyweds, and he was working on a big engineering project there. I don\u2019t remember exactly what it was now. We moved around quite a bit the first few years we were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far is Pendleton from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see the town where Dad was born,\u201d Annie said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t we spend the night there instead?\u201d She reached for her phone again. \u201cIt would mean we\u2019d need to change our route, but it wouldn\u2019t be that much out of our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were only in Pendleton for the first year of his life,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any friends living there?\u201d Annie pressed, but before Ruth could answer, she asked another question. \u201cI\u2019ll bet it\u2019s been ages since you connected with them, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was forty-nine years ago. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are their names?\u201d Annie\u2019s fingers were primed and ready as she held her cell phone. \u201cI\u2019ll look them up and find out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie,\u201d Bethanne warned. Her daughter seemed to be taking control of the trip.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll shut up and we can spend the night in Spokane and sit around the hotel room all afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne cast Ruth an apologetic look.</p><p>\u201cI had a friend by the name of Marie Philips.\u201d Ruth\u2019s voice was tentative, uncertain. \u201cShe was married and a young mother herself. Her parents owned a small caf\u00e9 on the outskirts of town. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s long gone by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to eat, don\u2019t we?\u201d Annie said triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cThe caf\u00e9 might not even be in business anymore,\u201d Bethanne felt obliged to remind her.</p><p>\u201cIs her name listed on that computer phone of yours?\u201d Ruth asked, sounding more interested by the minute.</p><p>Bethanne could hear Annie typing away.</p><p>\u201cP-h-i-l-i-p-s?\u201d Annie spelled it out. \u201cWith one L?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The caf\u00e9 was where the bus stopped, too. They served the most wonderful home cooking. Marie was a real friend to me, but we lost contact after Richard and I moved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the name of the caf\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d Ruth shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t remember, but I do know where it is...or was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, can I see the town where Dad was born?\u201d Annie asked eagerly. \u201cEven if we spend the night in Spokane, I\u2019d still like to visit Pendleton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why we couldn\u2019t,\u201d Ruth said, apparently catching Annie\u2019s enthusiasm. \u201cMy goodness, I haven\u2019t thought of Marie in years. She had a son around the same age as Grant. I wonder what became of him. Marie had an older boy, as well. Like I said, she was so helpful to me. She\u2019s one of those salt-of-the-earth people.\u201d Ruth seemed immersed in her memories.</p><p>Bethanne continued driving in silence. They passed Ellensburg and were headed toward the bridge that spanned the mighty Columbia River, on the way to Moses Lake. All of this was familiar territory. If they made the decision to go to Pendleton, they\u2019d need to change course after crossing the bridge.</p><p>Annie was still typing. \u201cThe Pendleton directory lists a Marie Philips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does?\u201d Ruth\u2019s voice rose excitedly. \u201cLet\u2019s call her.\u201d</p><p>Annie called and left a message on the woman\u2019s voice mail. When she\u2019d finished, she asked, \u201cDo you want me to see about changing our hotel reservations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already made a deposit at the hotel in Spokane,\u201d Ruth lamented.</p><p>Bethanne hated to admit it, but even she was disappointed. She was enjoying the drive and it did seem a waste of time to arrive in Spokane for lunch and call it a day.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chain hotel,\u201d Annie said. \u201cIf there\u2019s one in Pendleton, I bet they can switch reservations without a penalty.\u201d</p><p>Ruth was quiet for a moment. \u201cOkay, call and see if the hotel is willing to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, give me the phone number.\u201d</p><p>Ruth rattled it off. Annie got through right away and made the arrangements. She disconnected, saying, \u201cDone. The manager told me it wasn\u2019t a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Bethanne said, pleased her daughter was so technologically savvy. She had the same phone as Annie and Grant but couldn\u2019t do nearly as much with it. The problem was that she hadn\u2019t made the effort to learn. It seemed that whenever she got comfortable with her phone, it was time to upgrade and she\u2019d have to learn a whole new process.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what Marie\u2019s doing these days,\u201d Ruth said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll find out,\u201d Annie responded.</p><p>\u201cWe can have a light lunch when we hit the Tri-cities,\u201d Bethanne suggested, \u201cand once we reach Pendleton we can look for the caf\u00e9 your friend\u2019s family owned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Ruth said, \u201cbut we all know there\u2019s no guarantee the caf\u00e9 will still be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, but we can look, can\u2019t we?\u201d Annie said. \u201cThen, after we eat, can you show me the house you lived in when Dad was born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Ruth said, \u201cbut again you have to remember that was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t understand Annie\u2019s sudden interest in her father\u2019s birthplace. Ruth, however, seemed happy to stroll down memory lane. Annie was encouraging her, and this exchange of questions and anecdotes was probably good for both of them.</p><p>Annie\u2019s cell phone rang when they stopped for lunch in Richland. They found a chain restaurant off the freeway and each ordered soup.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Dad,\u201d Annie said, and her gaze immediately went to Bethanne. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re in Richland.\u201d She smiled and added, \u201cWe made good time. Mom\u2019s driving\u2014and guess what?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne was determined not to listen, but she couldn\u2019t avoid hearing Annie\u2019s side of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s right here. Do you want to talk to her?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne shook her head vigorously. Annie ignored her reaction and handed over the cell.</p><p>Reluctantly, Bethanne accepted it. \u201cHello, Grant,\u201d she said without enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYou turned your cell phone off,\u201d he said, although his words lacked any real censure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving,\u201d she pointed out. The rental car didn\u2019t have a Bluetooth connection.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Annie said.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She resisted telling him that they\u2019d left just that morning and were only about two hundred miles from Seattle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this I hear about you spending the night in Pendleton? Did you know I was born there?\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d forgotten, she\u2019d received plenty of reminders in the past few hours. \u201cAnnie mentioned it.\u201d Bethanne wondered if Grant had put their daughter up to this. She was well aware that Annie had her own agenda. But then, perhaps she was becoming paranoid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hoped you\u2019d call and check in every now and then,\u201d he said in a hurt-little-boy voice that was meant to elicit sympathy.</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to Annie or your mother,\u201d she told him. \u201cIf you\u2019d like, I\u2019ll remind Ruth to check in with you or Robin every day so you can rest assured that all is well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your mother.\u201d She passed the phone across the booth to her mother-in-law.</p> <p>Annie waited until their soup arrived before she spoke. \u201cHonestly, Mom, you could be a bit friendlier to Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You know how he feels.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne did. \u201cThis is about more than feelings, Annie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least let him prove himself. You don\u2019t need to be so...\u201d She couldn\u2019t seem to find the right word. \u201cUnfriendly,\u201d she said, repeating herself.</p> <p>\u201cDid I sound short with your father?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne looked at Ruth, who shrugged. \u201cJust a tad, honey.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne exhaled and forced herself to remember that she was traveling with two of his staunchest advocates.</p><p>\u201cIs there any possibility the two of you might reconcile?\u201d her ex-mother-in-law asked, eyes wide and hopeful.</p><p>\u201cOf course there\u2019s a chance,\u201d Annie answered on Bethanne\u2019s behalf. \u201cThere\u2019s always a chance, right, Mom?\u201d</p> <p>Bethanne took her time answering, apparently longer than Annie liked, because both her daughter and Ruth stopped eating and stared at her intently. \u201cYes, I suppose there is,\u201d she finally agreed.</p><p>Seven</p><p>\u201cLook, the caf\u00e9\u2019s still there!\u201d Ruth called from the backseat. Annie had been driving since Richland, with Bethanne knitting beside her. Ruth leaned forward, thrilled about the opportunity to see her old friend again. When she\u2019d met Marie, she\u2019d been pregnant, away from family and friends, and in a marriage that hadn\u2019t started out in the most positive way.</p><p>They\u2019d moved to Pendleton because that was where Richard\u2019s first job was. He\u2019d wanted to make a good impression on his employer; he\u2019d been young, ambitious and eager to prove his worth. Her husband of less than a year had worked long days, abandoning Ruth to countless hours alone in a rental house in this town where she didn\u2019t know a single soul. Meeting her neighbor, Marie, had been a lifesaver. Ruth had needed a friend, a connection with someone. She hadn\u2019t really been prepared for the pregnancy, and she suffered from violent bouts of nausea that lasted through most of the day.</p><p>Not only did Marie become her friend, she\u2019d taken Ruth under her wing, recommended her own obstetrician and driven Ruth to and from her first few appointments. She\u2019d shared baby clothes and maternity outfits with her. Best of all, she\u2019d taken time for long afternoon chats, despite the fact that she had children of her own and often helped her parents at the roadside restaurant.</p><p>Ruth had lived in Pendleton for only a couple of years, but she never forgot Marie, even though her own life had changed\u2014and improved\u2014soon after. The effort to stay in touch lasted several Christmases but eventually they\u2019d lost contact. Still, Marie\u2019s friendship had brought her comfort and support all those years ago.</p><p>The caf\u00e9 sat back from the road, surrounded by a gravel parking lot, just outside the Pendleton city limits. The white paint had long since grown dingy, and the windows looked like they hadn\u2019t been cleaned in months. A sign out front announced Home Cooking.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s still in business,\u201d Ruth said, unable to keep the excitement out of her voice.</p> <p>I told you this was a good idea,\u201d Annie said. \u201cYou\u2019re glad we came this way, aren\u2019t you, Grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery glad,\u201d she said, and it was true.</p><p>\u201cThe sign on the building says it\u2019s Marie\u2019s Caf\u00e9,\u201d Annie pointed out.</p><p>\u201cShe must\u2019ve taken over from her parents,\u201d Ruth commented. She grabbed her purse and was practically out of the car before Annie had pulled to a complete stop. She didn\u2019t wait for the others.</p><p>The caf\u00e9 door creaked as she opened it\u2014and then came to an abrupt halt. It was as if she\u2019d stepped back fifty years. The caf\u00e9 was the same as she remembered, right down to the aluminum paper napkin dispensers and the tabletop jukeboxes. The booths had the identical red vinyl upholstery, but surely the seats had been recovered, probably more than once. The plastic-covered menus were tucked behind the ketchup and mustard containers, which stood next to the salt and pepper shakers.</p><p>More afternoons than she could recall, Ruth had sat in one of these very booths with her infant son at her side as she drank a cherry soda and talked over life\u2019s challenges with her friend.</p><p>At one stage, soon after Grant\u2019s birth, Ruth had been ready to admit her marriage was a huge mistake. She wanted to end it. Marie had listened and been sympathetic to her tales of woe. Richard spent so little time with her and their son that Ruth was convinced he didn\u2019t love her, that he never really had. Their marriage was a sham, she\u2019d told her friend, and it was better to own up to her mistake and get out now before their lives became even more complicated.</p><p>Marie didn\u2019t attempt to talk her out of her decision; all she\u2019d really done was ask Ruth a few questions. As she answered, Ruth realized how important it was to do whatever she could to make this marriage work. Not only because of their son, but because marriage was supposed to be a partnership and that required something from her, too. An honest commitment, a genuine effort... In the back of her mind, and it embarrassed her now to admit this, she\u2019d felt she could always go home, back to Florida....</p><p>Back to Royce Jameson. She suspected Bethanne had picked up on the fact that there was more involved in this reunion than meeting her high school friends, much as she looked forward to that. Royce would be there, too; Jane had written her with the news. The possibility of seeing him again had everything to do with wanting to return to Florida. They\u2019d been high school sweethearts\u2014an old-fashioned term, perhaps, one Annie might have scoffed at, but it was true. They\u2019d been so young and so deeply in love. But she\u2019d hurt him terribly and even after all these years she wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d forgiven her.</p><p>The last time they\u2019d stood face-to-face was the summer after their high school graduation. They\u2019d held each other and they\u2019d kissed, vowing that nothing would ever come between them. He was leaving for boot camp and she was heading off to college. They\u2019d promised to love each other forever and ever. Six months later she was engaged to Richard.</p><p>Their final conversation had been horrific. Ugly. She\u2019d taken the coward\u2019s way out and written him from college that she was marrying Richard. Back then Royce was in the marines and stationed in California before being deployed. When he received her letter he\u2019d phoned her at her college dorm, angry and hurt. She\u2019d listened while he accused her of terrible things. The conversation was one of the most painful of her life, and she\u2019d sobbed for hours afterward.</p><p>All she knew of Royce\u2019s life in recent years was that, like her, he hadn\u2019t attended any of the previous reunions. And, like her, he\u2019d lost his spouse.</p><p>In the end, of course, Ruth had stayed with Richard and later given birth to Robin. She\u2019d heard from Diane, her high school friend, when Royce had married. It\u2019d been a good time in her own marriage and she was happy for him. She wished him well.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d A woman in her late sixties or early seventies hurried out from the kitchen, wearing a white apron. Yellow rubber gloves covered her hands; she appeared to be the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cMarie?\u201d Ruth asked tentatively. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>Marie came a step closer. \u201cRuth? Ruth Hamlin?\u201d</p><p>They both gave a shout of recognition and advanced toward each other, arms outstretched, laughing and talking at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d recognize you anywhere,\u201d Marie claimed.</p><p>\u201cYou look wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an old bat,\u201d Marie countered, still laughing.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>They embraced like long-lost sisters, hugging each other and clinging hard.</p><p>Bethanne followed Ruth into the caf\u00e9 and watched the two women embrace. When Annie had suggested they spend the night in Pendleton, Bethanne had her doubts. She was loath to disrupt Ruth\u2019s careful plans. Yet from the moment they\u2019d crossed the Columbia River, her mother-in-law had been animated, reminiscing about the early years of her marriage, the cities in which she and Richard had lived and the friends she\u2019d made.</p><p>\u201cBethanne, Annie,\u201d Ruth said, turning to them, her face aglow. \u201cMeet Marie. She was one of my dearest, dearest friends all those years ago.\u201d She shook her head, then hugged Marie again. \u201cAnnie\u2019s my granddaughter and Bethanne, her mom, was married to Grant.\u201d She lowered her voice but Bethanne could hear every word. \u201cOfficially, they\u2019re divorced, but I have high hopes of a reunion now that my son has come to his senses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Annie said, and raised her hand in greeting.</p><p>Bethanne decided to pretend she hadn\u2019t heard Ruth\u2019s comment and smiled at the other woman, who seemed five or ten years older than Ruth. Marie\u2019s hair had gone completely white and her face was heavily wrinkled. The years hadn\u2019t been nearly as kind to her as they had to Ruth.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d Ruth asked, looking around the caf\u00e9. Many of the tables had yet to be bused. The counter was cleared, but a couple of syrup bottles remained, standing in sticky puddles.</p><p>\u201cWhen Richard and I lived here, there wasn\u2019t a seat to be had, day or night. Don\u2019t you remember we used to quote Yogi Berra? We said the place had gotten so popular, no one went there anymore.\u201d She giggled like a schoolgirl and so did Marie.</p><p>\u201cEveryone wants to stay close to the freeway these days,\u201d Marie lamented. \u201cThank goodness the bus still stops here. Otherwise, I\u2019d be out of business for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s chicken-fried steak was the best I ever ate,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever tasted gravy that good, before or since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still on the menu. A heart attack on a plate, as they say, but it\u2019s my bestseller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about to close up shop,\u201d Marie said, drying her hands on her apron. \u201cMaggie phoned in with the flu and my dishwasher\u2019s out sick, too. I don\u2019t have any choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the bus stopped by every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does, but I can\u2019t cook, wait tables and wash dishes all by myself.\u201d She frowned, shaking her head helplessly.</p><p>\u201cHas the bus come by today?\u201d Ruth asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Marie glanced at her watch. \u201cIt\u2019s due in another forty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Annie tugged at Bethanne\u2019s sleeve and whispered, \u201cWe could pitch in.\u201d</p><p>Marie stared at them. \u201cCould you? I mean, I\u2019d be willing to pay you. I\u2019m afraid if I close for even one day, the bus company might not renew my contract and then I\u2019d be flat out of business.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ruth shoved her sweater sleeves up past her elbows. \u201cI\u2019m a champion dishwasher, at your service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can bus tables,\u201d Annie offered.</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d Bethanne hesitated. She was thinking she should wash dishes.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mom, you\u2019d make a great waitress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing like a pretty girl to build up business,\u201d Marie told her, grinning as she said it. \u201cAnd I could certainly use the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d be delighted.\u201d The last time Bethanne waited tables had been the summer after she graduated from high school. She\u2019d gotten a job working at the local Denny\u2019s. The experience had convinced her that she wasn\u2019t waitress material. It\u2019d been hard work, lifting heavy platters and busing tables. In addition, she\u2019d discovered that people could be demanding, rude and insensitive. But she\u2019d be able to manage for a few hours.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got another apron in back. Let me get it for you.\u201d And Marie bustled into the kitchen, with Ruth close behind.</p><p>\u201cI hope I don\u2019t spill coffee on anyone,\u201d Bethanne worried. \u201cOr mix up all the orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, like Grandma always says, don\u2019t borrow trouble. We\u2019ll do great.\u201d</p> <p>As little as ten minutes ago, Bethanne had been sitting quietly in the car knitting a wedding gift for her future daughter-in-law. Now she wore a pink apron with a frilly starched border. She looked like a character in some movie about a diner, and since she wore the uniform, she might as well play the role. She purposely tucked the pencil behind her ear, then reached for the order pad and slipped it in her apron pocket.</p><p>\u201cThe specials are listed on the chalkboard outside,\u201d Marie explained. \u201cIt might be a good idea to memorize them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Bethanne said, and walked outside. She studied the blackboard. Ham and redeye gravy was first, followed by macaroni and cheese. The third special was pot roast with mashed potatoes and gravy. Apparently, Marie was fond of smothering food in sauce.</p><p>She\u2019d finished familiarizing herself with the specials when she heard the roar of motorcycles in the distance. The sound was deafening as it drew closer. \u201cWhat is it about men and motorcycles?\u201d she muttered as she went back inside.</p><p>\u201cHow long before the bus gets here?\u201d Annie asked. She wore her own apron and carried a cleaning rag and a gray plastic tub piled high with dirty dishes.</p><p>\u201cAbout twenty minutes,\u201d Marie called from the kitchen. \u201cListen, you might fill the water glasses now. It\u2019ll save you time later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d Bethanne said. She found a pitcher and set about pouring water into each glass. While she was at it, she figured out how to work the coffee machine. Meanwhile, Annie washed the counter, cleaned the tables and put out silverware.</p><p>The roar of engines thundered to a stop just outside the caf\u00e9 and, shortly after, four burly men dressed in leather vests and calf-high boots walked in as if they owned the place.</p><p>Bethanne stared at them. They paused by the door and looked around. Bethanne wasn\u2019t easily intimidated, or so she\u2019d always thought, but these men seemed like the real thing. Road warriors. They were everything Grant\u2019s sister had warned them about. Not that Bethanne knew anything about biker culture, but to her inexperienced eye, two of them looked halfway decent and the other two looked suspicious. She certainly wouldn\u2019t trust any one of them with her daughter. Come to think of it, they were four women alone...</p><p>A prickle of fear went down her spine and she stood there paralyzed, unable to move or even breathe. She could imagine the headlines now. Four Women Raped and Murdered. Biker Gang Suspected. If anything happened, Robin would blame her. Not that it mattered, seeing as she\u2019d most likely be dead.</p><p>Annie\u2019s eyes connected with hers. Deciding not to give in to her overactive imagination, Bethanne straightened. \u201cYou gentlemen can sit anywhere you want.\u201d</p><p>The older one, with the short, skinny ponytail, said, \u201cWe generally do.\u201d</p><p>The others laughed. The four of them slid into a booth and studied her as though she were a fresh piece of meat and they were hungry wolves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your order in just a minute,\u201d she said, pretending to ignore their menacing demeanor.</p> <p>Annie held her mother\u2019s gaze and then scurried into the kitchen. Bethanne trailed her at a more leisurely pace, unwilling to show how intimidated she actually felt.</p><p>\u201cDo you know those men?\u201d Ruth asked her friend, peering into the caf\u00e9 from the kitchen entrance. \u201cThey look like they belong to some rough-and-tumble gang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBikers stop by here all the time. Don\u2019t let them scare you,\u201d Marie said. \u201cThey all like to act tough, but underneath they\u2019re pussycats.\u201d She was busy stirring a pan of gravy and didn\u2019t even glance out. \u201cBesides, their money is as green as anyone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Trying not to reveal her fear, Bethanne removed the order pad she\u2019d stuck in her apron pocket, took the pencil from behind her ear and headed back out.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you boys?\u201d she asked, forcing herself to act as if she was in a theater production. Or one of those diner movies. All she needed was a wad of gum to go with the attitude.</p><p>\u201cBoys?\u201d Again it was the older man with the ponytail who responded. \u201cDo I look like a boy to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a figure of speech,\u201d she said, holding her ground. \u201cWould you like separate checks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The one who answered was the most tanned of the group, which suggested he\u2019d been on the road the longest. He had intense brown eyes and wore a leather bandanna tied at the base of his neck. His leather vest looked well-worn and he had on fingerless gloves. She almost mentioned that she was knitting a similar pattern for her son\u2019s fianc\u00e9e\u2014but she didn\u2019t. It was a good bet that he wouldn\u2019t be interested in her latest knitting project.</p><p>\u201cCheeseburger, with double pickles and no onion,\u201d the man sitting across from Ponytail told her.</p><p>Bethanne wrote that down. She looked over at the biker next to him, who ordered macaroni and cheese. Leather Bandanna ordered a bowl of chili and Ponytail wanted the pot roast special.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have those out for you in a few minutes.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until she gave Marie the order that she realized she hadn\u2019t asked if they wanted anything to drink. The coffeepot was full, so she carried it over to the table, and when they all righted their cups, she did her best to fill them without letting her hand shake. She didn\u2019t want these men to know how nervous they made her.</p><p>Bethanne started to turn away when Ponytail stopped her. \u201cWhere\u2019s your name tag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...I left it at home. I\u2019m Bethanne.\u201d As soon as she said it, she regretted not giving him a fake name.</p><p>\u201cBethanne,\u201d he repeated, then nodded as though he approved.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go by Rooster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRooster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the John Wayne movie,\u201d one of the other bikers explained.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay,\u201d Bethanne murmured. \u201cTrue Grit, right? The original version.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>The biker pointed across the booth at the two other men. \u201cThat\u2019s Willie and the good-looking one is Skunk. This here is Max,\u201d he said, nudging the man beside him.</p><p>\u201cBethanne,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>The two men across from Rooster nodded. Ignoring her, Max looked out the window. The two other bikers were adding cream to their coffee. Rather than encourage further conversation, Bethanne retreated behind the counter. Her hand trembled slightly as she returned the coffeepot to the burner.</p><p>The door opened again, and a steady stream of customers filed into the caf\u00e9. Bethanne glanced outside, seeing that the bus had arrived ahead of schedule. She\u2019d been too distracted by the bikers to notice. She grabbed the coffeepot again and moved toward the counter, which had filled up first. Annie had taken on waitress duty, as well, and the two of them were running from one end of the caf\u00e9 to the other. In no time the two coffeepots were empty.</p><p>\u201cI need coffee down here,\u201d an ill-tempered man shouted from the rear of the caf\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cComing right up,\u201d Bethanne promised. She started taking orders and shuffled them to Marie as fast as she could. Once the coffee had finished brewing, she hurried to the grouch by the window. He had an entire booth to himself.</p><p>\u201cIs this decaf?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo...I don\u2019t believe so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me some decaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to brew that. It\u2019ll be a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of joint is this?\u201d he complained loudly.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to take your order?\u201d she asked, thinking charitably that he was probably hungry and tired.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want my decaf coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said pointedly, \u201cand the longer you stand here arguing with me, the longer I\u2019m going to have to wait for my coffee. I have to get back on that bus, you know.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne realized she should have automatically brewed a pot of decaffeinated coffee. There was simply too much to remember.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Annie called out, and hurried toward the coffee machine.</p><p>Bethanne was still taking orders when she noticed the decaffeinated coffee was ready. Dropping off more orders with Marie, she picked up the coffeepot and rushed over to the complainer. He sat with his arms crossed, scowling. He didn\u2019t bother to right his cup so she did it for him, and filled it to the brim.</p><p>\u201cYou overfilled it,\u201d he snarled. \u201cNow there\u2019s no room for cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She reached for a second cup and poured again, leaving it three-quarters full.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only half a cup!\u201d he nearly shouted. \u201cI suppose you intend to charge me for a full one?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne started to add more coffee when she felt a hand on her shoulder. Rooster, the older biker, stood directly behind her.</p><p>\u201cListen, buddy,\u201d he said, and the threat in his voice made her shiver. She couldn\u2019t see his face but she saw the reaction of the man with the coffee and he seemed to cower in the booth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m real hungry, and when I get hungry I get cranky. You\u2019re delaying my meal. Trust me, you don\u2019t want to see what happens when I get cranky.\u201d</p><p>The other man didn\u2019t move. In fact, it looked as if he\u2019d stopped breathing. The rattle of dishes died down and conversation fell to a soft hush. Soon the whole caf\u00e9 had gone silent as Rooster bent over the man in the booth.</p><p>\u201cThat coffee\u2019s just fine now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Rooster asked.</p><p>The other man nearly jerked his head off in his eagerness to assure Rooster it was.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Rooster gently patted Bethanne\u2019s arm as he returned to his friends.</p><p>\u201cI think your order\u2019s up now,\u201d she said. He winked as he passed by, and Bethanne did her best to disguise a smile but knew she hadn\u2019t succeeded.</p><p>Still grinning she walked back to the kitchen and placed the orders for the four bikers on a large tray and delivered them to the table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do that for you,\u201d Rooster said, fork in hand. \u201cI like my mashed potatoes and gravy hot.\u201d</p><p>She was about to turn away when she became aware of Max, the man who sat beside Rooster, watching her. His eyes, dark and sober, met hers for a long moment. His look seemed to go straight through her and Bethanne felt herself flush. Her reaction embarrassed her but she didn\u2019t know how to explain it. She wasn\u2019t seeking any connection, romantic or otherwise. She was there to do a job\u2014help Ruth\u2019s friend\u2014and that was it. Glancing away, Bethanne hurried back to the kitchen.</p><p>Eight</p> <p>\u201cMom,\u201d Annie said from the backseat of the car. \u201cHave you ever been to Vegas?\u201d This trip was turning out better than she\u2019d hoped. But then, her expectations hadn\u2019t been that high.</p><p>When her grandmother announced the day before that they were going to spend the night in Spokane, Annie had wanted to scream with frustration. Spokane? It was an all-right town, but it sure wasn\u2019t exciting.</p><p>Well, visiting Pendleton, Oregon, wasn\u2019t exactly like being in Paris. To be fair, they\u2019d had a decent afternoon. She\u2019d actually had fun waiting tables at the caf\u00e9, which wasn\u2019t nearly as easy as it looked. The next time she ate in a restaurant, Annie knew she\u2019d see the waitress in an entirely different light.</p><p>She\u2019d suggested Pendleton because of her father. A little while ago, he\u2019d mentioned that he\u2019d been born there, although Annie couldn\u2019t remember why they\u2019d even been talking about it. That part wasn\u2019t important, anyway. The one thing that did matter was getting a feel for what her mother was thinking about her father. Driving to Pendleton was Annie\u2019s way of casually bringing him into the conversation. She wanted her mother to be thinking about him, to miss him and to consider reuniting the family.</p><p>Unfortunately, Annie hadn\u2019t been able to figure out how her mother really felt. Of course, they\u2019d been too busy at the caf\u00e9 to discuss much of anything. Then, after Marie closed for the night, they\u2019d toured the town. There\u2019d been a lot of talk about her grandparents\u2019 early years. Annie had listened politely and so had her mother. Bethanne seemed interested but Annie noticed she didn\u2019t ask many questions.</p> <p>The first place Marie took them was the old neighborhood. Annie saw the house where her grandparents had lived when Grant was born. It was small and drab and nothing like she\u2019d expected. True, it was nearly fifty years older now, but she could hardly imagine her father living in such a tiny house. The yard was overrun with grass and thick with weeds. The sidewalk leading to the front porch was cracked. Someone had left a red wagon outside, along with a tricycle, so another young family occupied the house these days.</p><p>While Annie loved her grandmother\u2019s stories, her attention was repeatedly drawn back to her cell phone.</p><p>Vance had texted her twice. His first message said he\u2019d landed safely in Rome. Well, good for him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t text back.</p><p>Then, less than three hours later, he sent her another message.</p><p>Miss you.</p> <p>As far as she was concerned, he didn\u2019t miss her nearly enough\u2014or he wouldn\u2019t have left. She didn\u2019t answer that one, either, although it boosted her ego considerably that he\u2019d attempted to contact her.</p><p>Nevertheless, Vance was out of her life. He\u2019d taught her a valuable lesson and she was determined to learn from it. She was hurt by what he\u2019d done and embarrassed by how oblivious she\u2019d been. He\u2019d lied to her, keeping his plans a secret. She should\u2019ve known, though. In retrospect, there\u2019d been clues, like his lack of interest in doing anything with her this summer and his frequent visits to Matt\u2019s place\u2014without her. What was that clich\u00e9 about hindsight being twenty-twenty? She understood it now.</p><p>This thing with Vance was kind of eerie because it reminded Annie of when her father moved out. She\u2019d commented on that to her mother, who\u2019d agreed. Bethanne had been shocked when it happened; even Andrew hadn\u2019t seen it coming.</p><p>Annie had been shocked at first, too, but when she thought about it, the signs had been there. Just like with Vance, but more obvious. Her father often got home late from the office and always seemed in a hurry to leave again. He\u2019d bought her a new computer, too, for no reason. It wasn\u2019t until much later that she\u2019d realized his gifts were motivated by guilt, which proved he did have a conscience. Later, Annie had purposely ruined the computer, but that was beside the point.</p><p>Her mother had been totally blind to what her father was doing. That had infuriated Annie, who thought Bethanne should have recognized that her marriage was in trouble. A woman who\u2019d been married for twenty years, who supposedly knew her husband...</p><p>Back then it\u2019d been easy to blame Bethanne. Annie got over that fast enough, but some of her residual anger had lingered.</p><p>Until the night Vance dumped her.</p><p>Well, he didn\u2019t officially dump her, but that was how it felt. Actually, she almost wished he\u2019d ended the relationship completely. A clean break and all that.</p> <p>Well, it didn\u2019t matter because she was finished with Vance. He could send her all the text messages he wanted but she had no intention of responding. What she needed now was to have fun.</p><p>A lot of fun.</p><p>She looked down at the map a second time. Vegas wasn\u2019t that far, but she\u2019d have to convince her mother and grandmother to head toward Nevada instead of South Dakota. Mount Rushmore wasn\u2019t going anywhere. She\u2019d let all her friends know where she was and eventually the news would reach Vance and then he\u2019d regret what he\u2019d done.</p><p>The taste of this small revenge was sweet on her tongue. Vance might think Rome was fun, but Annie could guarantee Vegas was a whole lot more exciting than touring some museum.</p><p>Annie\u2019s question caught Bethanne by surprise. Vegas?</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to Vegas?\u201d Annie asked again.</p><p>Where was this coming from? Bethanne was driving while Ruth napped beside her and her daughter sat in the backseat.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, your father and I were in Vegas years ago.\u201d Grant had taken Bethanne to a Realtors\u2019 convention. They\u2019d stayed at one of the gigantic hotels on the Strip, and she remembered those three days fondly. Because of the divorce it was sometimes difficult to recall the good times she\u2019d had with Grant. Like all married couples, they\u2019d experienced ups and downs through the years. Every marriage did. It was easy to forget the laughter they\u2019d once shared when her memories were tainted by Grant\u2019s betrayal.</p><p>\u201cYou awake, Grandma?\u201d Annie leaned forward to peer around Ruth\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been to Vegas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, never,\u201d Ruth admitted. \u201cRichard went there on business any number of times but I was always busy with the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go to Vegas!\u201d Annie said, as if this was the idea of the century. \u201cThe three of us. We\u2019d have a hoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do that one day,\u201d Bethanne agreed. Their second day on the road, and so far, everything had gone well. They\u2019d deviated from their plans once already, but this was Ruth\u2019s trip, not Annie\u2019s. Or Bethanne\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI mean we should go now,\u201d Annie said. \u201cReally, how many road trips do the three of us expect to take together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d Bethanne asked. \u201cYou mean today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly today. It\u2019s a ways yet. I\u2019ve got the map here, and if we head south on Highway 93 at Twin Falls we can reach Vegas tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d Bethanne reminded her daughter for probably the fifth time. \u201cYour grandmother has carefully planned our route and we\u2019re going to South Dakota to see Mount Rushmore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but wouldn\u2019t it be more fun in Vegas?\u201d</p><p>Ruth didn\u2019t comment one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s boring on the freeway,\u201d Annie continued. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to drive all the way across the United States, it\u2019d be a lot more interesting on the highways and byways than the interstate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVegas,\u201d Ruth murmured.</p><p>\u201cRemember, you specifically mentioned Mount Rushmore,\u201d Bethanne said mildly, not wanting to put pressure on her former mother-in-law, but not wanting her to be disappointed, either.</p><p>\u201cI know I did,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cBut that old mountain will be there until the end of time. Annie\u2019s right. It isn\u2019t every day that I have the opportunity to visit Las Vegas\u2014and with two of my favorite people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean we can actually go to Vegas?\u201d Annie didn\u2019t seem capable of containing her excitement.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Vegas!\u201d Ruth shouted.</p><p>\u201cAnd what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\u201d Annie returned, laughing.</p><p>Bethanne had to smile, too. Vegas did sound like a lot more fun than elbowing her way through the tourist crowds anxious for a better view of Rushmore.</p><p>\u201cJust promise me,\u201d Ruth said, \u201cthat you won\u2019t say a word about this to Grant or Robin. I promised them we\u2019d stick to the freeway the entire trip, but Annie\u2019s got a point. This is pretty dull driving. If we\u2019re going to see the country, we need to get off the interstate. We should explore a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at the map and tell me where you want me to go,\u201d Bethanne said. This was turning into far more of an adventure than she\u2019d ever anticipated. Her stint as a waitress at Marie\u2019s caf\u00e9 yesterday had been quite an experience. Bethanne had nearly forty dollars, her share of the money they\u2019d made in tips. Gambling money. The biggest surprise had been Max, the biker who sat next to the older man who called himself Rooster. It was Max whose eyes had connected with hers, Max who\u2019d looked at her so...knowingly.</p><p>After the busload of customers left, Marie had prepared dinner for them all. Ruth said the chicken-fried steak was even better than she remembered. The two older women sat, chatting over coffee, while Annie and Bethanne finished the cleanup. Later that night, after Marie had given them a quick tour of town, Bethanne had crawled into the hotel bed, exhausted and oddly exhilarated as she closed her eyes. As soon as she did, the image of the biker filled her mind. Max. He hadn\u2019t spoken a word to her, other than to place his order. It\u2019d been that brief look they\u2019d exchanged. A couple of times Bethanne had tried to shake the memory and found she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She was getting fanciful, she\u2019d thought. Downright silly. She had absolutely nothing in common with this biker, and it was highly unlikely she\u2019d ever run into him again, which was just as well. She\u2019d mumbled a prayer for him\u2014there was something about the sadness in his eyes\u2014and then she\u2019d fallen almost immediately into a deep and peaceful sleep.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about an hour away from Twin Falls,\u201d Ruth said, breaking into Bethanne\u2019s musings. She glanced up from the map, which Annie had handed over to her. \u201cI\u2019ll need to cancel my hotel reservation again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should probably cancel them all,\u201d Annie advised. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve already changed Grandma\u2019s plans once, and now we\u2019re doing it again. It\u2019s way more fun making plans as we go along, don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to have the two of you with me. This is much better than driving alone.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne smiled. Annie had added spontaneity and adventure to the trip. If it\u2019d just been Ruth and Bethanne, she would\u2019ve gladly followed her mother-in-law\u2019s itinerary.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we spend the night?\u201d Ruth asked, unfolding the map on her knees.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you suggest?\u201d Bethanne asked.</p> <p>\u201cHmm. There aren\u2019t too many big towns on the way into Vegas. I think our best bet is Ely. Maybe Annie could check the internet for a hotel and make a reservation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Bethanne inserted.</p><p>\u201cHow far is Ely from Twin Falls?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d Ruth paused, as though calculating the distance. \u201cI\u2019d say about three or four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll make nine hours in the car, Ruth,\u201d Bethanne said, a bit concerned. \u201cIs that too long for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Ruth insisted.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stop in Wells and pick up lunch and find somewhere to eat along the way,\u201d Annie suggested. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of small lakes, but I heard someone mention one called Snow Water Lake. I don\u2019t remember who, but they said it was absolutely pristine. We could have a picnic there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a great plan,\u201d Ruth concurred. \u201cI\u2019d like to stretch my legs and be somewhere cool and refreshing.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne agreed, content to let Annie handle the details.</p><p>They purchased sandwiches, sodas and chips in Wells, Nevada, and turned off the interstate onto Highway 93. They gassed up there, too. Bethanne decided to continue driving. The car turned over a couple of times before starting, which worried her, but she didn\u2019t have a problem after that.</p><p>The two-lane highway was far more relaxing; it was a relief not to have to deal with so much traffic. She drove at a moderate speed and absorbed what she could of the scenery.</p> <p>\u201cI do prefer highway travel over the interstate,\u201d Ruth said after a while. \u201cThere\u2019s more character along the highway.\u201d She gave an exaggerated shudder. \u201cI can only imagine the lecture we\u2019d get if Grant or Robin ever heard about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell them,\u201d Bethanne reassured her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to tell Dad we\u2019re in Vegas, though,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>Despite the thought of Grant\u2019s disapproval, Bethanne smiled. She could guess what he\u2019d say once he learned that they were visiting Sin City. And while she was there, Bethanne fully intended to have fun. She wasn\u2019t much of a gambler, but there\u2019d be shows to see and casinos to visit. She\u2019d heard so much about them. The Wynn, Mandalay Bay, the Venetian...</p><p>\u201cCan we spend more than one night in Vegas?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cWe can take as long as we like with one stipulation,\u201d Ruth told her. \u201cI have to be in Florida before my reunion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Grandma. I\u2019ll make sure we\u2019re exactly where you need to be with time to spare.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne wasn\u2019t quite sure how Annie had taken over their itinerary, but she didn\u2019t object. And apparently neither did Ruth. Although she\u2019d hoped to have a chance to think, consider her options, decide what she really wanted, it felt good to simply enjoy this time with her daughter and mother-in-law. Ex-mother-in-law\u2014but who cared?</p> <p>There was nothing pressing on either the home front or at the office. She\u2019d talked to Julia and been assured that all was well at Parties.</p><p>As for Grant... Reuniting with him wasn\u2019t a decision she had to make this week or the next. That, too, could wait. She\u2019d give them six months to become reacquainted. In six months she\u2019d see how the relationship had progressed. What she found most difficult was how badly her family\u2014well, Annie and Ruth\u2014wanted her to go back to Grant. In a perfect world she\u2019d fall in love with her ex-husband again and they\u2019d all return to being the ideal family they\u2019d once been. Except maybe it hadn\u2019t been so ideal... Besides, this was far from a perfect world and there was more to consider than making Annie and Ruth happy.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how long they drove; she didn\u2019t look at the dashboard clock or her watch. The scenery was engaging and kept her attention. Thankfully, the rental car was air-conditioned because the Nevada heat was brutal, even in the mountains.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mom, slow down,\u201d Annie eventually said, studying the map. \u201cThe turnoff for Snow Water Lake should be coming up soon.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne would have missed the arrow if Ruth hadn\u2019t pointed it out. \u201cHow far is the lake from the road?\u201d she asked Annie, turning off the highway onto the narrow paved road.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell on the map, but it can\u2019t be more than a few miles. Five at the most.\u201d</p><p>That seemed reasonable, although she had to wonder if they were heading toward a designated picnic area or invading personal property. Well, they\u2019d find out soon enough.</p><p>Minutes later, they reached the lake. There wasn\u2019t a picnic table\u2014or a picnicker\u2014in sight. They saw the remains of a campfire someone had made some time ago, but no other evidence of anyone\u2019s presence. Using the hood of the car as a table, Ruth spread out their feast and they stood in the shade and ate their sandwiches and chips. Lingering over sodas, Annie and Bethanne walked along the lakeshore.</p><p>Annie removed her shoes and waded in the water. \u201cWow, this is cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t called Snow Water Lake for nothing,\u201d Bethanne teased.</p><p>\u201cCome on in, Mom,\u201d Annie said, and kicked her feet at the water\u2019s edge, splashing onto the shore.</p><p>Although they\u2019d been out of the car for less than thirty minutes, Bethanne roasted in the early-afternoon heat. Sitting on the sand at the lake\u2019s edge, she slipped off her shoes and waded ankle-deep into the chilly water. After the initial shock she quickly grew accustomed to the cold.</p><p>She got up and, with her arm around Annie\u2019s waist, ambled through the water.</p><p>\u201cI should probably call Dad,\u201d Annie said. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to know we\u2019ve changed our plans.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cDad talked to you about Andrew\u2019s wedding, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Annie asked. \u201cWe can sit together as a family, can\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne hadn\u2019t given Grant her final answer. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Annie rested her head on Bethanne\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI want us to be a family again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, honey,\u201d Bethanne said in a soothing voice. \u201cAnnie, you have your own life now. Your own place, a promising future... And your dad and I both love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But nothing\u2019s been the same since Dad moved out.\u201d</p><p>Moved out, divorced her, remarried and gone through a second divorce, Bethanne added to herself. The man who\u2019d walked out the door wasn\u2019t the same person anymore, nor was she. A lot had changed, and Bethanne wasn\u2019t sure either of them could return to the past. Perhaps that was a good thing; she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s different,\u201d Annie continued, almost as if she\u2019d been reading Bethanne\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWe both are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s learned his lesson. He\u2019s humbled. You know that can\u2019t be easy for him.\u201d</p><p>What Annie said was true. With Grant\u2019s pride, it had taken a great deal for him to admit he\u2019d made a mistake and seek a reconciliation.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I call him, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>Annie reached for her cell and punched a couple of buttons. After a moment, she muttered in frustration. \u201cWe don\u2019t have coverage here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can wait. In fact, if you call him now he\u2019ll only worry. Why don\u2019t we call once we\u2019re in Vegas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>By the time they returned to the car, Ruth had cleaned up their leftovers and they were ready to go back to the highway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>Bethanne was happy to relinquish the wheel. If she was going to finish the wedding gloves, she\u2019d need time to knit. She\u2019d made progress their first day on the road, but none today. She was counting on the trip to afford her knitting time she didn\u2019t generally have.</p><p>Ruth climbed into the back, while Bethanne sat in the passenger seat next to her daughter. Annie inserted the key and the engine turned over once and then quit.</p><p>Frowning, Annie looked at Bethanne. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne\u2019s heart slowed as she remembered what had happened at the gas station in Wells. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>Annie did, and the engine caught right away. Bethanne relaxed, giving her daughter a reassuring smile. The last thing they needed now was to get stuck in the middle of nowhere with a broken-down vehicle and no cell coverage.</p><p>The car lurched forward and died again.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Ruth asked anxiously from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>Annie tried again. Nothing. When it became apparent that no amount of cranking was going to start the engine, Bethanne placed her hand over her daughter\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>Bethanne\u2019s head was spinning. They didn\u2019t have a lot of options. \u201cHow far are we from the main road? Isn\u2019t it about five miles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Farther than I\u2019d want to walk,\u201d Annie said, \u201cespecially in this heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. It\u2019s too far to walk in this heat,\u201d Ruth said emphatically.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re stuck until someone comes along.\u201d Annie dropped her hands from the steering wheel. \u201cDoes anyone know anything about fixing cars?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cI left all that to Richard. After he died I had to learn how to fill my own gas tank. But that\u2019s about all I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could be here for days,\u201d Annie moaned.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we wait until it cools down and then walk to the highway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all my fault,\u201d Ruth wailed. \u201cI was so eager for adventure that I put us in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the one who suggested we eat lunch by the lake,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Bethanne told them both. \u201cThis isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault. We\u2019ll be fine. There\u2019s nothing to worry about. Besides, there are worse things than being stuck by a beautiful lake on a summer afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Annie said, instantly perking up. \u201cLet\u2019s go swimming. We have our swimsuits, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I didn\u2019t bring one,\u201d Ruth confessed. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to see my fat thighs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuth,\u201d Bethanne said, rolling her eyes. She was on her way to Florida and some of the most beautiful beaches in the world\u2014and she was worried about showing her thighs. \u201cWho\u2019ll even notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Mom?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>Bethanne\u2019s smile faded. \u201cI don\u2019t own a suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d Annie said, staring up at the car ceiling. \u201cOkay, you two, I don\u2019t care if you have your bathing suits or not, we\u2019re going swimming.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Ruth said, \u201cbut I\u2019m staying out of the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself, Grandma, but Mom and I are getting in the water.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne hesitated. \u201cYou go on and I\u2019ll join you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMo-om,\u201d Annie groaned. \u201cOkay, if it\u2019ll make you both feel better, I\u2019ll swim in my underwear.\u201d</p> <p>Annie shucked off her shorts and cotton top, leaving them at the water\u2019s edge, and walked into the lake with her arms raised. \u201cOh, boy, this is cold.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne kept a keen eye on her daughter. The cool water lapped at her bare toes, and she felt the sweat roll down her neck. The sun was even fiercer now. Annie, meanwhile, was floating on her back.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming in or not?\u201d she shouted to Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cComing in.\u201d Bethanne carefully removed her own clothes and waded into the water in her bra and underpants. The lake seemed even colder than before and shock made her gasp.</p><p>Ruth strolled down to the shore, watching them more intently than a lifeguard at the baby pool.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Ruth,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cYou wanted adventure. Well, this is it!\u201d</p><p>Her mother-in-law paced the shoreline. \u201cI\u2019ve never done any thing like this in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be shy,\u201d Annie said. \u201cWe could be here for hours. We might as well enjoy ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Ruth cast them an anxious look. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell anyone, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross my heart,\u201d Annie said, standing up to make the motions.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Bethanne encouraged her again, waving her in. \u201cThe water\u2019s fabulous.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth took off her clothes and folded them in a neat pile. Then she walked straight into the water. Unlike Annie and Bethanne, who took time to adjust to the cold, Ruth plunged ahead. Maybe she feared one of them would comment on her thighs, Bethanne thought with amusement.</p><p>The three frolicked and played like schoolchildren splashing one another and diving under the water. Bethanne couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d swum in a lake. She was enjoying herself so much, she didn\u2019t immediately hear the noise that attracted Ruth and Annie\u2019s attention.</p><p>Both of them got to their feet and stood there, unmoving.</p><p>Bethanne turned around and was instantly overwhelmed by the sound of motorcycles moving toward them.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Annie said, grabbing Bethanne\u2019s arm. \u201cI remember where I heard about this lake,\u201d she cried. \u201cIt was from the bikers at the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>The motorcycles roared right to the edge of the lake, and lined up side by side.</p><p>Shivering in the water Bethanne huddled close to Ruth and Annie. No one seemed to know exactly what to do or how to react. The water suddenly went from comfortable to below freezing. All three of them crossed their arms, although Bethanne realized their efforts to hide themselves were futile.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Robin say something like this would happen?\u201d Ruth wailed. \u201cWe\u2019re goners for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body,\u201d Bethanne said from between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d Ruth muttered. \u201cHow will I ever explain this to Grant? This is all my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no one\u2019s fault,\u201d Bethanne said. She wasn\u2019t about to let these men intimidate her or her family. Squaring her shoulders, she began marching toward the shore, her legs making rippling, splashing movements in the water.</p><p>Annie tried to grab her arm. \u201cMom, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask them for help,\u201d she said. If she treated them with respect, then they\u2019d do the same. She hoped.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d came Annie\u2019s plaintive cry as Bethanne pulled her arm free.</p><p>With her back straight, Bethanne ignored Annie and Ruth\u2019s pleas and the teasing catcalls from the bikers. She was all too aware that her wet underwear concealed nothing. Scooping up her capris, she tried to pull them on, slipping one leg in. Because she was wet, the fabric stuck and she lost her balance. She would\u2019ve tumbled to the ground if not for one of the bikers who reached out and caught her.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>The biker removed his helmet.</p><p>Bethanne blinked twice. It was the same man she\u2019d served in the caf\u00e9 less than twenty-four hours earlier. The one who\u2019d stayed in her mind, the biker named Max. Their eyes met again, his dark gaze unreadable.</p><p>Rooster removed his helmet next; so did the other two bikers, Willie and Skunk, if she remembered correctly.</p><p>By then Bethanne was fully dressed, although her clothing clung to her, soaked as it was from her underwear.</p><p>Annie stepped out of the water and quickly dressed, too. That left Ruth, who stubbornly remained in the water. She squatted down so only her head was above the waterline and refused to budge.</p><p>\u201cGrandma, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Annie told her. \u201cYou can come out. We know these guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay where I am until those...those men turn around and stop gawking at me.\u201d</p><p>Rooster threw back his head and howled. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got anything I haven\u2019t seen before, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d Ruth barked. \u201cAll of you. I don\u2019t need any Peeping Toms staring at me.\u201d</p><p>To Bethanne\u2019s amazement, all four bikers did as Ruth demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d appreciate your help. Our car won\u2019t start,\u201d Bethanne said, as much to distract the four men as to secure their assistance.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t flood the engine, either,\u201d Annie added.</p><p>\u201cI had a problem starting it earlier.\u201d Bethanne led them to the rental vehicle. \u201cThis is a relatively new car, so I\u2019m surprised we\u2019re having trouble,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that much about cars,\u201d the guy she remembered as Willie said with a shrug. \u201cI can fix a motorcycle with a bobby pin but cars baffle me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d Skunk chimed in.</p><p>Rooster and Max exchanged glances. \u201cI\u2019ll take a look at it for you,\u201d Rooster offered.</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t immediately find the hood release. \u201cLike I said, this is a rental car...or I\u2019d be more familiar with it.\u201d As soon as she managed to release the hood, both Rooster and Max bent over the engine.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to detect the problem, which according to them was something to do with the carburetor. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need a tow truck,\u201d Rooster said. \u201cWith a bike any of us could lend a hand, but these engines aren\u2019t what they used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have cell coverage out here,\u201d Annie told him. \u201cWe\u2019d have phoned for help earlier if it was that easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo any of you ride?\u201d Willie asked.</p><p>\u201cNo...afraid not,\u201d Bethanne said, answering for all three.</p><p>\u201cThen one of us will need to take you into Wells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on just a minute here,\u201d Ruth said, wagging her index finger at them. She\u2019d dressed, putting her blouse on inside out, although Bethanne wasn\u2019t about to tell her that.</p><p>\u201cBefore we do any such thing, the three of us need to talk.\u201d Ruth steered Bethanne and Annie away from the bikers. They stood several feet away, forming a tight circle. Ruth glanced over her shoulder and lowered her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of one of us leaving with a biker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Grandma, what else are we going to do?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think we can trust these men?\u201d Ruth pinched her mouth into a thin line and frowned. \u201cThey\u2019re...riffraff.\u201d</p><p>In normal circumstances Bethanne wouldn\u2019t have considered riding with any of them, but at the moment their options were few. \u201cDo we have a choice?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe could always stay right here and stick to our original plan,\u201d Annie suggested. \u201cOnly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly what?\u201d Ruth whispered.</p><p>\u201cWell, I heard them talking at the caf\u00e9 yesterday...and I\u2019m afraid this might be a biker hangout. At least we\u2019ve met these guys before, and even though they might look a bit intimidating, they seem decent enough.\u201d</p><p>Ruth shook her head. \u201cI still don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d Ruth insisted. \u201cIf anyone goes, it\u2019ll be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ride on the back of a motorcycle,\u201d Bethanne reminded her.</p><p>Ruth paled. \u201cI...I can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, it makes far more sense for me to go,\u201d Annie said, as if it meant nothing.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bethanne refused to even discuss it. She wasn\u2019t about to put her daughter in any additional danger.</p><p>Cutting off further argument, Bethanne broke away from the others and approached the bikers. They stood with their arms crossed, waiting. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, walking toward them, hands held out. \u201cIf one of you would take me into Wells, we\u2019d deeply appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s real big of you.\u201d Willie\u2019s voice was sharp with sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her.\u201d This came from Max.</p><p>His offer appeared to surprise Rooster, who shrugged and stepped back. \u201cYour call.\u201d</p><p>Max started toward his Harley and Bethanne followed. \u201cYou ever ridden in the\u2014\u201d he hesitated \u201c\u2014buddy seat?\u201d</p><p>Willie and the other two bikers broke into hoots of laughter.</p><p>Bethanne turned back, not understanding what they considered so humorous.</p><p>Max silenced them with a single look. He was an intense man who rarely spoke, she\u2019d noticed, and never seemed to smile. He wasn\u2019t especially big. About six feet, with broad shoulders. He seemed to be her age, possibly older.</p><p>Rooster handed Bethanne his helmet.</p><p>\u201cMom, are you sure about this?\u201d Annie asked anxiously.</p><p>Bethanne nodded, although she wasn\u2019t sure of anything. She set the helmet on her head and draped her purse crossways over one shoulder. Max climbed onto the bike. Apparently, it was up to her to find her own way onto the Harley. She managed, but it wasn\u2019t pretty.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bethanne,\u201d Ruth cried, covering her mouth with her hand. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised. She didn\u2019t like this any better than Annie and Ruth did, but someone had to ride into town and she was the logical choice.</p><p>The only instruction Max gave her was to hold on. It wasn\u2019t like there was an extra pair of handlebars for her to grab. Her one option was Max and, not knowing what else to do, she slipped her arms around his middle\u2014and clung for dear life.</p><p>The first turn nearly unseated her. She cried out in alarm, but if Max heard, he gave no indication. Even with the helmet, the noise was deafening; the roar sounded as if she were next to a jet engine. It seemed to take forever to reach the town of Wells. By then she was so tense and stiff she found it difficult to breathe. Thankfully, Max knew where he was going. He pulled into a garage and turned off the engine, then braced his feet on the pavement and set the kickstand in place.</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t dare move. She pried her fingers loose, one by one. It occurred to her that her stranglehold might have been uncomfortable for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max took off his helmet and climbed down; she did, too, with a lot less grace. \u201cWere you able to breathe?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The merest hint of a smile touched his mouth. \u201cBarely. I think I might have a couple of cracked ribs.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t know if this was a joke or if he was serious. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He entered the garage and she trailed after him. The mechanic brightened the instant he saw Max, came forward and thrust out his hand. \u201cMax! Good to see you again. I got that widow\u2019s car running and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, Marv, I need a favor,\u201d Max said, cutting him off.</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d the other man said without hesitation. \u201cI owe you. I didn\u2019t need even half the money you gave me to fix that old Ford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me a thing.\u201d</p><p>The mechanic obviously knew and trusted Max. That was a good sign as far as Bethanne was concerned.</p><p>He nodded at Bethanne. \u201cName\u2019s Marvin Green.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBethanne,\u201d she said. \u201cBethanne Hamlin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you send a tow truck out to Snow Water Lake?\u201d Max asked his friend.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Marvin went into a small windowed office and picked up a phone. Max and Bethanne waited outside.</p><p>\u201cIs there a rental car place in town?\u201d Bethanne asked, since they\u2019d need to exchange vehicles.</p><p>\u201cI only ride,\u201d he said, which she guessed was his shortcut way of telling her he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t talk much, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI generally don\u2019t have a lot to say.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t believe him but didn\u2019t respond, either.</p><p>Max walked over to the soda machine, inserted a couple of dollar bills and bought two sodas, bringing her one.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, accepting it gratefully. Her throat was parched. They wandered over to a row of plastic chairs and sat quietly, side by side, while Marvin made phone calls.</p><p>After several minutes of discomfort, Bethanne found herself breaking the silence. \u201cI thought about you last night.\u201d The confession popped out before she could censure it. She had no idea what had prompted the comment and instantly regretted it.</p><p>His gaze shot to hers. She could tell she\u2019d surprised him.</p> <p>Instead of dropping it the way she should have, she made matters worse. \u201cActually, I said a prayer for you.... I didn\u2019t used to pray,\u201d she added awkwardly, feeling she needed to explain herself. \u201cNot until recently.\u201d The words just kept coming. Normally Bethanne would never have blurted out something this personal. She hardly ever talked about politics or religion and never with someone who was basically a stranger.</p><p>He stared at her as if he didn\u2019t know how to take her ad mission.</p><p>She\u2019d started down this road, so she might as well continue. \u201cI always believed in God. I went to church and all that, but, well...after my husband left me, I backed off for a while. I feel differently now....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re divorced?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSix years now. Annie\u2019s my daughter and Ruth\u2019s my\u2014mother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-mother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, you\u2019re right. But I don\u2019t think of her in those terms. Grant divorced me, but I chose to keep Ruth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Max said.</p><p>\u201cEx-husband,\u201d she corrected, and to her astonishment, Max laughed.</p><p>Marvin glanced their way and lifted his chin. Max stood, joining the mechanic in his office. The two men spoke for a while; she finished her soda before Max returned.</p><p>\u201cMarvin found a tow truck willing to drive out to the lake.\u201d</p><p>That was a relief. \u201cWould it be okay if I rode back with the driver rather than on the Harley? No slight intended, but I think we\u2019d both be more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Once again they sat in silence. Finally, Max leaned forward, his forearms resting on his thighs. \u201cWhy did you feel you needed to say a prayer for me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Bethanne wasn\u2019t sure what to tell him. She couldn\u2019t very well admit he\u2019d remained in her thoughts\u2014and that she didn\u2019t understand why. \u201cI...asked God to keep you and your friends safe on the road. Of course, at the time, I didn\u2019t know I was going to be riding, uh, buddy with you in the very near future.\u201d She tried to make light of it and realized she was saying far more than necessary. Maybe it was because he didn\u2019t speak much that she felt this compulsion to fill the void with chatter.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked again after she\u2019d stopped talking.</p><p>Bethanne closed her eyes and settled back against the hard chair. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly know.\u201d She wasn\u2019t being completely honest. At the caf\u00e9 she\u2019d been aware that he was watching her as she moved about, waiting tables, delivering meals, doing her best to keep up with customers\u2019 demands. A couple of times their eyes had met. She\u2019d smiled, but he hadn\u2019t. His lack of response hadn\u2019t intimidated her; instead, she saw something in him...something she recognized in herself. Pain. She sensed that he\u2019d suffered the same kind of wrenching emotional pain she had. Ultimately that was what had prompted her to pray for him.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I asked you a question?\u201d She looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cThat depends. You can ask, but I might not answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>Max walked over to the vending machine as if he needed to put distance between them.</p><p>Bethanne stood and followed him. \u201cDid your wife leave you?\u201d she asked in a low voice.</p><p>He turned and faced her and seemed to be studying her intently. Bethanne held his gaze.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said after a lengthy moment.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep her foot out of her mouth with this man.</p><p>\u201cKate died three years ago.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne wanted to tell him how sorry she was but instinctively knew he\u2019d find no comfort in her condolences. \u201cYou\u2019ve been on the bike ever since, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned and then nodded.</p><p>Bethanne wasn\u2019t sure how she knew it, but she did. Living the life of a drifter probably meant he didn\u2019t have children. No roots. No ties. Free to roam wherever the wind took him.</p><p>\u201cGrant married Tiffany,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she left him.\u201d</p><p>Max smiled. So did Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to say it served him right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cServed him right,\u201d Max echoed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s divorced now and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants you back.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne gaped at him. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense. Are you going to take him back?\u201d</p><p>That was the million-dollar question. \u201cI don\u2019t know...I just don\u2019t know.\u201d Bethanne wasn\u2019t an indecisive woman; she\u2019d learned not to be in the six years since Grant had walked out. This question, however, left her stomach in knots and her mind in a state of confusion. Fortunately, an answer wasn\u2019t immediately required. She had time.</p><p>Before she could say more, the tow truck rounded the corner. \u201cMax?\u201d she whispered. \u201cListen, I might not get a chance later but I wanted to thank you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Unable to stop herself, she briefly, gently, touched his hand. Despite their physical contact on the bike, this was different. More intentional, more...personal. She felt the urge to at least try to comfort him, to show him how sorry she was about his wife\u2019s death.</p><p>From the look on his face she could see that her gesture had jolted him. He stared down at her and frowned.</p><p>Then, just as she removed her hand from his, Max stepped toward her.</p><p>Tentatively, he circled her waist with his arms and she returned his embrace. His pulse thundered in her ear. Slowly, ever so slowly, his hold tightened. She felt him inhale deeply and closed her eyes at his touch. She wanted to weep; she didn\u2019t understand why.</p><p>Max\u2019s hands moved over her back, caressing her.</p><p>\u201cIt gets easier,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI promise you it does.\u201d</p><p>Max brushed his lips against her hair, then dropped his arms and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, feeling foolish and sentimental.</p><p>The tow truck driver climbed out of his rig and walked toward them but before she left, Bethanne had one last thing to say. She couldn\u2019t meet Max\u2019s eyes. \u201cYour Kate must have been very special,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Max reached for his helmet. He didn\u2019t speak for a long time and then murmured, \u201cShe was.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this. I don\u2019t like this one bit,\u201d Ruth told her granddaughter as Bethanne left riding behind that biker. For all they knew, Max could be some kind of...hoodlum. She\u2019d read about motorcycle gangs, and while she doubted that these four belonged to any organized group, she was sure they couldn\u2019t be trusted.</p><p>\u201cWhat alternative do we have?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>Ruth feared they\u2019d been far too quick to let Bethanne leave with Max. They knew absolutely nothing about these men, other than the fact that they weren\u2019t capable of fixing a carburetor. \u201cWe should\u2019ve done what we originally planned\u2014waited until dusk and then walked to the highway.\u201d In retrospect, Ruth regretted not insisting they do exactly that.</p><p>\u201cAnd take our chances hitchhiking into Wells?\u201d Annie shook her head. \u201cI doubt that people who pick up hitchhikers can be trusted, either, Grandma. At least we\u2019ve seen these men before.\u201d</p><p>Annie could be right. Hitchhiking into town didn\u2019t sound too appealing and it could make them even more vulnerable. She tapped her fingers nervously on the car\u2019s hood while she worried about Bethanne alone with that biker.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I listen to Robin?\u201d Ruth muttered. She\u2019d assumed Robin was being overprotective. Because of her experience in court, dealing with criminals day in and day out, Robin had a polluted view of humanity. She trusted no one and seemed to look for the bad in people, to expect it. All with good reason; Ruth understood that, but it saddened her.</p><p>Ruth\u2019s job now, she felt, was to protect Annie in case these men decided to take advantage of her granddaughter. She drew Annie away from them to stand beneath the shade of the only tree, which happened to be several feet off.</p><p>\u201cWe should make contingency plans,\u201d she whispered, although there was little chance the men could overhear their conversation.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case...\u201d Ruth didn\u2019t want to say it. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>Annie gave her an odd look. \u201cYou mean we should dismantle their motorcycles so they couldn\u2019t come after us if we ran away?\u201d</p><p>Ruth hadn\u2019t thought of that, but it was an excellent idea. \u201cGood plan,\u201d she said approvingly.</p><p>Annie rolled her eyes. \u201cGrandma, I was only joking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be our insurance.\u201d</p><p>Annie frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what Robin would suggest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Aunt Robin\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ruth already knew what her granddaughter was about to say. She agreed, but they didn\u2019t have time to discuss Robin. If they were going to act, they had to do it now. \u201cI\u2019ll distract the men and then you do whatever one does to make motorcycles refuse to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what that is?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d So much for that. Ruth bit her lip as she searched for another idea. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a way to protect ourselves.\u201d Her gaze fell to the ground as she began pacing. \u201cAnd your mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Mom\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so,\u201d Ruth said, her mind whirling. \u201cWhat would we tell the police? These bikers don\u2019t even have real names! Who ever heard of men named Rooster and Skunk? If something did happen, God forbid, how could we tell the police we let your mother drive off with someone named Rooster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Max, not Rooster. Nothing\u2019s going to happen, Grandma. You\u2019re getting yourself worked up for no reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the police,\u201d Ruth continued. \u201cWhat am I going to tell your father?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGrandma, repeat after me. Nothing is going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Ruth ignored that. \u201cGrant will be so upset with me,\u201d she went on. \u201cHe\u2019ll say it\u2019s all my fault and I can\u2019t blame him. I\u2019m responsible for this mess. I should\u2019ve insisted I be the one to go. I\u2019ve lived my life. You and your mother are young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to see your high school friends again, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Ruth sighed. She desperately wanted to see Royce, too. Just once, so she could tell him how sorry she was, how deeply she regretted having hurt him. But if she had to give up her life in order to save her daughter-in-law and granddaughter, Ruth wouldn\u2019t think twice. A small part of her wondered if she was overreacting, but she decided she simply couldn\u2019t take the risk.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any ideas?\u201d she asked her granddaughter. Annie was smart and sensible like Bethanne. The girl would come up with something.</p><p>\u201cIn my opinion, we should just wait this out. If Mom isn\u2019t back in, say, another hour\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnother hour?\u201d Ruth interrupted. That seemed far too long.</p><p>\u201cGrandma,\u201d Annie said, \u201cit\u2019ll take time to get into Wells and then more time to arrange for a tow truck. We should wait a minimum of ninety minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we...I don\u2019t know, regroup, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d However, Ruth didn\u2019t like it. She checked her watch so she\u2019d know exactly when those ninety minutes were up and prepared to wait.</p><p>To distract themselves they discussed Las Vegas and what they\u2019d do when they got there.</p><p>After ten interminable minutes, Ruth chanced a look at the bikers and to her shock saw the three of them swimming. Their clothes, all of them, were piled along the shoreline and...oh, my goodness, they\u2019d gone in the water nude. She felt herself flush. While she\u2019d been talking to Annie, those men had stripped naked.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a thing to worry about,\u201d she told Annie. Ruth had the perfect plan. \u201cI\u2019ve got everything under control.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d As casually as possible, Ruth strolled toward the lake.</p><p>\u201cGrandma,\u201d Annie called after her. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>She whirled around and pressed her finger to her lips, shushing Annie.</p><p>\u201cGrandma,\u201d her granddaughter called again, this time in a harsh whisper. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything...silly.\u201d</p><p>Ruth waved off her concern. As fast as she could, she gathered up the men\u2019s clothes. Clasping them to her chest, she ran toward Annie.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Rooster shouted.</p><p>Facing them, Ruth said loudly, \u201cI\u2019m taking your clothes and I\u2019m not giving them back until Bethanne is returned safe and sound.\u201d She clutched the clothes even tighter, unwilling to surrender a single item.</p><p>All three men laughed as though they thought her hilarious.</p><p>Without another word, Rooster started walking to shore and the other two followed. Soon vital body parts were fully exposed. Ruth gasped and backed away. Clearly the threat of not having their clothes meant nothing to them.</p><p>\u201cThat scares us, Grandma. That really scares us.\u201d</p><p>Ruth dropped the clothes and, feeling more than a little ridiculous, hurried over to Annie.</p><p>They heard the roar of a motorcycle in the distance.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s back!\u201d Annie cried.</p><p>The weight of worry and responsibility instantly lifted from Ruth\u2019s shoulders\u2014until Max rode into view.</p><p>He was alone.</p><p>Ruth grabbed Annie\u2019s arm. \u201cYour mother isn\u2019t with him,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably with the tow truck driver,\u201d Annie said, not revealing the slightest alarm. \u201cAnd where is the tow truck?\u201d she asked. A chill went down her spine. Hands on her hips, Ruth marched up to Max and waited until he\u2019d turned off that blasted ear-splitting engine. \u201cWhat have you done with my daughter-in-law?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Max slowly removed his helmet.</p><p>\u201cI want to know right this minute where Bethanne is,\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cGrandma, Grandma,\u201d Annie hollered. \u201cThe tow truck is here.\u201d</p><p>Ruth wagged her finger under Max\u2019s nose. \u201cYou\u2019re fortunate Bethanne is safe. Otherwise...otherwise, you would\u2019ve been sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, he\u2019s shaking in his boots,\u201d Rooster said, then practically collapsed with laughter.</p><p>Ruth was pleased to know she was such a source of amusement. The tow truck parked, the passenger door opened and Bethanne climbed down. Ruth ran over to her.</p><p>\u201cI was so worried,\u201d she blurted as she pulled Bethanne into her arms and hugged her hard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Ruth, just fine.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne stretched out one arm to Annie and they held hands. \u201cI talked to a mechanic who\u2019s going to fix the car. We\u2019ll need to spend the night in Wells, but we should be able to leave sometime tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Annie nodded. \u201cAs soon as we\u2019re somewhere with cell coverage, I\u2019ll find us a hotel room and cancel our reservations in Ely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m thinking we shouldn\u2019t go to Vegas,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cWe went off course and look what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot go to Vegas?\u201d Annie wailed. \u201cOh, Grandma, we can\u2019t change our plans now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Annie turned to Bethanne. \u201cMom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking forward to seeing Vegas and so was Annie,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cI\u2019m sure everything will be fine now. We\u2019ll pick up a new rental car while we\u2019re there and continue on our trip.\u201d</p><p>Ruth seemed unconvinced. \u201cI don\u2019t know....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Grandma,\u201d Annie begged. \u201cVegas will be fun, and after today that\u2019s what we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right.\u201d She felt she\u2019d succumbed far too easily, but it wasn\u2019t in her to disappoint Annie or Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Bethanne returned to the tow truck and removed a large white bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cI got the driver to take me to a fast food place so I could pick up burger-and-fry combos for the guys,\u201d she said. \u201cI can hardly imagine what we would\u2019ve done if they hadn\u2019t stopped by the lake when they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bought them burgers?\u201d These were the men who\u2019d frightened her out of several years of her life, and her daughter-in-law wanted to feed them?</p><p>Bethanne brought the bag over to the bikers who were, thankfully, dressed by now. At least Bethanne had been spared that sight.</p><p>\u201cYou should know Grandma there tried to abscond with our clothes,\u201d Rooster said as he helped himself to a burger and a bag of fries. His eyes twinkled with merriment. \u201cShe assumed that was a major threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe showed her,\u201d Willie said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d Ruth snapped, unwilling to be the butt of their jokes. \u201cYou did show me\u2014you exposed yourselves. There\u2019s laws against that. I should\u2019ve made a citizen\u2019s arrest.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne grinned, and Ruth decided it would be best to simply drop the matter.</p><p>Annie distributed the rest of the food, and the men sat together while the three women went off to relax under the tree.</p><p>Ruth hadn\u2019t realized how thirsty she was until she drank a bottle of the water Bethanne had brought back. They\u2019d already eaten lunch, but even if she\u2019d been ravenous, she couldn\u2019t have managed a bite\u2014and the thought of a greasy burger was singularly unappealing. Not so with the bikers and the tow truck driver, who wolfed down their food so fast it made her feel nauseous.</p><p>Bethanne and Annie thanked everyone for their help. Although the men on bikes hadn\u2019t turned out to be ax murderers, Ruth let the other two women do the talking.</p><p>Fortunately, the tow truck had a backseat so they could all fit inside. During the ride into town Bethanne seemed unusually quiet and Ruth could only speculate on what she was thinking.</p><p>\u201cThose bikers weren\u2019t so bad, now, were they?\u201d Annie said.</p><p>Ruth nodded reluctantly. \u201cThey weren\u2019t as bad as I feared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Grandma, admit it. They were cool guys, helping us like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool guys?\u201d Ruth glanced at Bethanne. She could do with some reinforcement in case her daughter-in-law hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><p>\u201cActually, Max was a real gentleman,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cA gentleman?\u201d Well, okay, maybe she\u2019d been wrong, but Ruth always figured it was better to be prepared.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much to recommend Wells, Nevada, as a tourist destination. The entire town consisted of two casinos, gas stations, a fast-food joint and a few watering holes. After the vehicle was repaired, with the promise of a replacement once they reached Las Vegas, Bethanne, Ruth and Annie found a room for the night.</p><p>\u201cI think we should call Dad,\u201d Annie said, sitting cross-legged on one of the two queen-size beds. \u201cHe should know where we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can if you want,\u201d Bethanne told her daughter. She propped her suitcase up on the luggage holder, unzipped it and took out what she needed for the night.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be too happy with us,\u201d Annie murmured, looking thoughtful. She nibbled on her lower lip. \u201cMaybe I should wait until we\u2019re in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne made a noncommittal sound.</p><p>\u201cWe might as well face the music,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cGet it over with.\u201d She sat on the edge of the bed, obviously worn-out from their unexpected adventure. \u201cGuaranteed, Grant will mention it to Robin and then we\u2019ll all get read the riot act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe riot act, Grandma? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s an expression based on an old English law. It just means Robin\u2019s going to be furious\u2014and she\u2019s going to let us know it. I don\u2019t care. She can say what she wants. We\u2019re safe now and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Ruth set her pajamas on the second bed and sank into the mattress. \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you, after a day like this, I\u2019m completely exhausted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Bethanne said. Both Ruth and Annie had questioned her repeatedly about the time she\u2019d spent with Max. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t have an answer, because she did. Her thoughts, however, were ones she wanted to keep to herself. Although she was unlikely to see Max again, she couldn\u2019t help being curious about him. She\u2019d wanted to ask about his wife, Kate, and what had compelled him to take to the road three years ago\u2014and stay there.</p><p>Annie glanced from one to the other and frowned, disappointment flashing from her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to bed? Now? Don\u2019t you want to go downstairs and gamble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d Ruth asked. \u201cNot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Bethanne concurred.</p> <p>\u201cYou mean we\u2019re spending the night in a casino hotel and no one wants to play the slot machines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, sweetie,\u201d Ruth said again, and yawned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait until Vegas,\u201d Bethanne added. She was tired; besides, she\u2019d already promised herself a forty-dollar limit, the money she\u2019d earned in tips, and didn\u2019t want to start spending it yet. \u201cBut, Annie, if you want to check out the casino, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d her daughter muttered, but she didn\u2019t sound enthusiastic. In fact, she stayed where she was, her expression perplexed and a bit glum.</p><p>Ruth took the first shower and Bethanne went next, brushing her teeth and changing into her pajamas. When she came out of the bathroom, Annie was on the phone, talking to Grant.</p> <p>With her cell against her ear, Annie paced the room, looking guilty as soon as she saw Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s here now. Do you want to talk to her?\u201d</p><p>Apparently, Grant did, because Annie thrust the phone at her. Bethanne hesitated, then reluctantly took it. She didn\u2019t owe Grant any explanations and she didn\u2019t plan on listening to his complaints, either.</p><p>\u201cHello, Grant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems the three of you had quite an adventure,\u201d he said. Although his comment was mild enough, Bethanne sensed his concern, mingled with irritation.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBethanne, don\u2019t you realize what a crazy risk you took?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, we\u2019re fine. Nothing happened.\u201d She didn\u2019t want or need a lecture from him.</p><p>\u201cYou rode off with a biker? A biker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Max, and like I told your mother and Annie, he was a perfect gentleman.\u201d</p><p>Grant was silent for a moment, as though weighing how best to continue. \u201cAnnie suggested they might be Wild Hogs. You remember the movie? Businessmen escaping the corporate world? She even said they went skinny-dipping, just like in the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know about that. What I do know is that they came to our rescue and I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>Again he paused. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t do anything that foolish again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant, I\u2019m not a child.\u201d She appreciated his concern but at the same time found his reaction condescending. She hadn\u2019t been in any danger; her instincts told her as much. Grant still didn\u2019t seem to grasp that she was an independent woman now. While she understood his feelings, she wasn\u2019t about to let him scold her.</p> <p>\u201cI know that, and it\u2019s your business if you want to take those kinds of risks. But don\u2019t drag Annie and my mother into it.\u201d</p><p>The tightness of his words told Bethanne that he was struggling to hold on to his temper.</p><p>\u201cI think we should change the subject,\u201d she said, unwilling to get into an argument. He was right; she\u2019d probably been far too trusting. Still, she didn\u2019t feel she\u2019d had any choice.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWe\u2019ll change the subject.\u201d But he didn\u2019t introduce a different topic; neither did she.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to speak to Annie again?\u201d she asked a few seconds later.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne handed her daughter the cell.</p><p>Turning her back on both her mother and grandmother, Annie walked to the window. \u201cAll right, Daddy, I will. I know.\u201d This was followed by a short silence. \u201cI know. Okay. Goodbye. I\u2019ll check in tomorrow night, I promise.\u201d She closed the cell, then turned around and stared at Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bethanne asked. She\u2019d crawled under the sheets and opened her book. Ruth had turned off her light and was asleep, or pretending to be.</p><p>\u201cYou upset Dad,\u201d Annie said. \u201cAll he cares about is our safety. There was no need to get huffy with him.\u201d</p><p>Rather than argue, Bethanne shrugged. \u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d her daughter challenged. \u201cCan\u2019t you see how hard he\u2019s trying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he is,\u201d Bethanne conceded. Annie had a point; she\u2019d been short-tempered with Grant. In theory she\u2019d moved past the divorce, past the pain, and yet every now and then, when she least expected it, those old resentments would rear up, taking her by surprise.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing everything he can to make up for what he did,\u201d Annie said. \u201cAll he wants is for the two of you to get back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie\u2014\u201d She wasn\u2019t allowed to finish.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you think I shouldn\u2019t have told him about you riding off with Max, but...I felt he has a right to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you feel it\u2019s important to keep your father updated, then do so,\u201d Bethanne told her daughter. She stopped herself from saying that she\u2019d prefer it if Annie omitted any details pertaining to her.</p><p>\u201cDaddy loves you,\u201d Annie added. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect him to deny his feelings.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t doubt that Grant had loved her in the past, especially when they were first married. At the births of their children he\u2019d wept tears of joy as he held her hand and thanked her for making him a father. She remembered the good years they\u2019d shared, the career he\u2019d built and the comfortable lifestyle he\u2019d provided. However, those happy reminiscences were tainted by everything that had led up to and followed the divorce. Did he love her when he checked into a hotel room with Tiffany and then came home at night, all smiles? Did he love her the day he announced he wanted a divorce? He\u2019d been heartless the morning he walked out the door. Bethanne had worked hard to forgive him, but she wasn\u2019t sure she could ever forget the devastating pain Grant had brought into her life and her children\u2019s. Or could she? If they were to reunite, that was the question she\u2019d need to confront\u2014and answer.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll settle down for the night,\u201d Bethanne said, closing her book.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Bethanne rearranged her pillows and looked up at her daughter.</p><p>\u201cSay something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that Daddy still loves you.\u201d Annie\u2019s eyes widened as she waited for Bethanne\u2019s response.</p><p>\u201cI know he does, and I love him, too.... I always will.\u201d That love had altered but the flame hadn\u2019t completely burned out. She didn\u2019t want to feel anything for Grant and yet she did. How could she not? They were married for twenty years. She\u2019d given birth to his children. Those were facts she couldn\u2019t ignore or forget. But love, she\u2019d discovered, had many sides, many angles, and some were sharper than others.</p><p>\u201cThen there really is hope that you might reconcile?\u201d Her daughter\u2019s face filled with anticipation.</p><p>This was the same question that had been rattling around her head for the past few weeks\u2014and the past few minutes. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re thinking about it?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019m giving it...consideration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my saying so...\u201d Ruth levered herself up on one elbow. She hadn\u2019t been sleeping, after all. \u201cGrant\u2019s learned from his mistake. He\u2019s paid the price. We all do sooner or later,\u201d she said, looking tired and sad. \u201cFor myself, I appreciate that he\u2019s man enough to admit it. Not many would, you realize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Annie and Ruth exchanged warm smiles.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll wait until we get to Vegas to check out a casino,\u201d Annie said, and swallowed a wide yawn. \u201cWe\u2019ve had quite a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Ruth murmured.</p><p>Grinning to herself, Bethanne reached for her novel again, while Annie changed clothes and slid into bed beside her. Within minutes, her daughter\u2019s even breathing told Bethanne she was asleep. Ruth was, too. As soon as she finished her chapter, she closed the book and turned off her light. With her head nestled in the pillow, she shut her eyes, confident that sleep would soon overtake her despite the relentless glow from the casino\u2019s blinking sign. On, off. On, off...</p><p>To her surprise, she found her thoughts drifting to Max and what he\u2019d told her about losing his wife. It\u2019d been three years, he\u2019d said. He\u2019d grieved for three years. This man loved deeply. The possibility of that kind of unwavering love brought her solace, and she fell instantly asleep.</p><p>Annie woke when she heard her mother flick off the bedside lamp. The hotel room was bathed in muted shades of red and green from the casino\u2019s neon lights, which shone outside their window. They flashed off and on in Christmas colors and flickered through the slit between the drapes.</p><p>Rolling onto her side, Annie pulled the sheet over her shoulder and tucked it securely around her. She wished now that she hadn\u2019t called her father. She\u2019d tried Andrew, but he hadn\u2019t been home and apparently hadn\u2019t checked his text messages, either. Otherwise, he would\u2019ve called her back.</p><p>Mainly Annie had wanted to tell someone about their adventure. In retrospect, the afternoon had been amusing. A great anecdote that the three of them would repeat for years. Until recently, she would\u2019ve immediately called Vance and regaled him with it, too. Only, he was out of her life.</p><p>Her ego was gratified by the fact that he\u2019d made several efforts to contact her, all of which she\u2019d ignored. He was not to be trusted. Annie had never hidden anything from him and yet he\u2019d\u2014 Well, it didn\u2019t serve any useful purpose to review the list of wrongs Vance had committed against her.</p><p>Because her brother was clearly preoccupied, and she wasn\u2019t talking to Vance, and her friends were all off in various places this summer, Annie had phoned her father. She thought her grandmother had been hilarious, taking the bikers\u2019 clothes. Even now, just thinking about it made her smile.</p><p>Except that her dad hadn\u2019t been nearly as amused. When he learned Bethanne had ridden into town with Max, he\u2019d been upset. Justifiably so. She could see his point and, again, wished she\u2019d squelched the urge to call.</p><p>Another mistake she\u2019d made was giving her mother the phone. That hadn\u2019t gone nearly as well as she\u2019d hoped. Before long, her parents were snapping at each other, and it was all Annie could do not to grab the phone out of her mother\u2019s hand.</p><p>More than anything, Annie wanted her parents back together. They belonged with each other; at least her father could see that now. Lots of men made mistakes. Women, too. Annie knew that from watching her friends\u2019 parents. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Men, in particular, supposedly went through this middle-age form of adolescence, where they behaved badly. According to what she\u2019d heard, sooner or later they came to their senses. Some were smart enough to do whatever it took to get their families back. The lucky ones did. They reconciled with their wives and kids and started fresh, with a new appreciation of what they\u2019d lost.</p><p>Annie wanted her father to be one of the lucky ones. He had to be impressed by everything her mother had accomplished since the divorce. Annie would admit that even she was surprised by the success of the party business. She wasn\u2019t the only one, either.</p><p>Annie suspected that the attention her mother received had become an issue between Tiffany and her father. Grant didn\u2019t openly acknowledge that but Annie could read between the lines. The lovely Tiffany\u2019s career wasn\u2019t exactly going gangbusters these days, not that Annie was sorry to hear it. Frankly, she\u2019d be just as glad never to hear the other woman\u2019s name again. Fortunately, the lovely Tiffany was out of the picture.</p><p>She\u2019d given her own motivations some serious thought when Andrew had challenged her. He\u2019d accused her of wanting to revert to a perfect past that hadn\u2019t been as perfect as she\u2019d chosen to believe. Not true. This was more about instinct and love than any childhood fantasy.</p> <p>Her parents needed each other, and Annie considered it her duty as their daughter to encourage their reconciliation. Now all she had to do was pave the way for her mother and father to meet in the middle and resolve this.</p><p>Come to think of it, she might offer her father a suggestion or two. Flowers for when they arrived in Vegas might help her mother forget their little argument that evening.</p><p>Hmm... She set her cell phone to wake her early so she could call her dad. Roses, she told herself sleepily. Red ones...</p><p>Bethanne\u2019s next conscious thought was that Annie was awake and moving about the hotel room. Although she was obviously making an effort to be quiet, she didn\u2019t succeed. She dropped her cosmetics case with a clatter.</p><p>\u201cAnnie,\u201d Bethanne groaned. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSix. The way I figure it, we could get to Vegas this afternoon if we leave early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your grandmother awake?\u201d Bethanne asked, her eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cI am now,\u201d Ruth muttered.</p><p>Bethanne opened her eyes and noticed Ruth sitting up in bed, stretching her arms as she arched her back. \u201cGet me coffee and I\u2019ll do my morning exercises, then we can hit the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVegas, here we come!\u201d Annie cried. She was already dressed, with her suitcase packed and waiting by the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll jump in the shower,\u201d Bethanne said, and tossed aside the covers as she climbed out of bed. Retrieving her clothes, she stepped into the bathroom. By the time she finished, Annie had prepared coffee and Ruth had done her stretching exercises and was dressed.</p> <p>\u201cReady, Mom?\u201d Annie asked as Bethanne repacked her suitcase and slipped her book into her purse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready. But the question should be...is Vegas ready for us?\u201d</p><p>Annie laughed. \u201cI sure hope so.\u201d</p><p>They were on the road by seven-fifteen, and rolled into Vegas seven and a half hours later. Annie had booked them into the Hard Rock Casino just off the Strip. It wouldn\u2019t have been either Ruth\u2019s or Bethanne\u2019s first choice, but one casino was probably as good as another.</p><p>While Annie and Ruth checked in, Bethanne found the rental car location and swapped cars, more for peace of mind than anything else. Marvin back in Wells had done an excellent job, but they still had a long way to travel. Bethanne didn\u2019t dare risk another breakdown.</p><p>When she returned to the casino, both Annie and Ruth were playing the slot machines. The sights and sounds of the casino were everywhere. Instead of being annoyed by the din, Bethanne discovered that it added to the excitement.</p><p>\u201cSit down and play with us,\u201d Annie urged, intent on a game named after the television show Wheel of Fortune.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Bethanne wasn\u2019t keen on giving her hard-earned forty dollars to a slot, but it did look like fun. The thought of turning that fun into winnings was too tempting to ignore.</p> <p>She found a machine with a cartoon Texas oilman called Texas Tea, pulled out a stool and plopped herself down. Twenty dollars went quickly, although it was a nickel machine. At $2.25 with every push of the button, her twenty bucks vanished almost before she knew it. She wondered whether to feed it her last twenty, but hesitated, then decided she\u2019d reached her limit for that day.</p><p>\u201cHave you been up to the room yet?\u201d Ruth asked when Bethanne sat next to her mother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Annie had taken up Bethanne\u2019s suitcase and given her the room key earlier.</p><p>\u201cYou need to see the room,\u201d Annie said, smiling broadly. \u201cIf you wait a minute, I\u2019ll go up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs anyone hungry yet?\u201d Ruth asked. She removed the receipt for her winnings and stuffed it inside her purse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d Annie said. \u201cLunch was hours ago. But let\u2019s go to the room first.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne couldn\u2019t imagine why seeing their room was so important. Hotel rooms were pretty much alike. Beds, a television, sometimes a desk, and, of course, a small and generally cramped bathroom, and that was about it.</p><p>What awaited her was a large bouquet of red roses. Dozens of beautiful red buds in a crystal vase. \u201cRoses?\u201d Bethanne breathed as she stepped into the room.</p><p>Ruth and Annie looked positively delighted. \u201cThe card says they\u2019re for you,\u201d Annie crowed. Her eyes gleamed as if she was personally responsible.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, all of us. Read the card and see.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne unpinned the envelope from the pink ribbon and stared down at it for a moment while a strange thought went through her mind. Could they have come from Max? But that was impossible. He had no idea where she was. Or did he? Roses were extravagant. Special. She loved roses, always had. Max didn\u2019t know that\u2014but Grant did.</p><p>\u201cRead the card, Mom,\u201d Annie said a second time.</p><p>Bethanne ripped open the tiny envelope and removed the card. \u201cFor my three favorite women.\u201d It was signed \u201cGrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re from your father,\u201d she said as a warm feeling settled over her. A feeling of being cherished.</p><p>\u201cI told you Dad was trying,\u201d Annie said. She seemed really pleased by the gesture.</p><p>\u201cYou father knows how much I love roses.\u201d Bethanne glanced at the card again.</p><p>Ruth reached for the card and read it, too. \u201cI\u2019m sure Grant felt bad about your conversation last night and wants to clear the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s it,\u201d Bethanne agreed.</p><p>\u201cStill, roses are pretty special.\u201d That comment came from Annie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call your father and thank him.\u201d And she would...later. It was a lovely thing to do and Bethanne did appreciate his effort. Grant was trying to win her back. Now it was up to her to decide if that was what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cShall we think about dinner?\u201d Ruth asked.</p><p>It was still a bit early, but Annie was right; they\u2019d eaten hours ago. Because they were so eager to get to Vegas, they\u2019d had a skimpy lunch. Breakfast had consisted of coffee and the bottled orange juice Bethanne picked up at a filling station on the way out of Wells. After some discussion they had dinner at the hotel\u2019s buffet.</p><p>Bethanne ate until she was stuffed. At only seven-thirty, it seemed a shame to go back to their room so early. They were planning to spend the next day exploring the Strip. For tonight, that left the slots.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got forty dollars burning a hole in my purse.\u201d Ruth was grinning like a five-year-old at her own birthday party. \u201cLet me at those Wheel of Fortune machines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll give that Texas oilman another chance to show me what he\u2019s got,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I want to do just yet,\u201d Annie told them.</p><p>They set a time to reconvene and then split up. Two hours later, Bethanne arrived at the designated area. Ruth was already there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never think of Vanna White the same way again,\u201d her mother-in-law muttered. \u201cShe took all my money.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne laughed. She, on the other hand, had struck oil and was up more than a hundred dollars.</p><p>\u201cTell Annie good-night for me, will you?\u201d Ruth asked. \u201cI\u2019m going to the room. I\u2019ll read for a while and turn in for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Good night. I\u2019ll probably be joining you myself in an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>Annie showed up a couple of minutes later with a young man in tow. \u201cMom, meet Jason. Jason, my mom. We\u2019re going to hang for a while,\u201d Annie announced, then kissed Bethanne\u2019s cheek and was off.</p><p>Bethanne had barely managed a word. \u201cWell,\u201d she said with a sigh, \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll sit down with that oilman again.\u201d She found the area where she\u2019d been earlier and slid onto the stool. After inserting a twenty-dollar bill, she pushed the button and waited.</p><p>\u201cAny luck?\u201d a familiar voice asked.</p><p>Bethanne swiveled the chair around as Max claimed the empty seat beside her.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Bethanne was speechless. As casually as could be, Max fed a twenty-dollar bill into the machine next to hers, glanced over and smiled.</p><p>A smile. He\u2019d actually smiled. \u201cHi,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Her tongue felt as if it had twisted itself into knots. \u201cHow did you know where to find me?\u201d</p><p>He spoke as he played the slot machine. \u201cRooster heard Annie and Grandma talking about Vegas. I figured if I was Annie\u2019s age I\u2019d head for the Hard Rock Casino, so I took a chance you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>Out of all the casinos in Vegas, he\u2019d found the one she was in, although it was Friday night and the city was crammed with people and cars. The clang of the slots, music, laughter\u2014the sounds of excitement were all around. Even if he\u2019d guessed the right hotel, it was pure luck that he\u2019d happened upon her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been winning,\u201d she said, imitating his casual tone.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough to set the casino back any.\u201d</p><p>The music pounded in the background and seemed ten times louder than before. Bethanne had lost track of popular tunes and musicians years ago; she couldn\u2019t have identified the singers\u2019 names or the song titles. In fact, she was aware of nothing except the man sitting next to her.</p><p>After several minutes Max sent her a pained look. \u201cDo you like this music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna take a ride on my bike?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She wanted to get away, too. With him. It was difficult to think, but she couldn\u2019t blame that entirely on the music. \u201cHave your ribs healed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot quite, but I\u2019m willing to risk it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a brave man.\u201d</p><p>They stepped outside and the contrast to the ear-splitting music was almost shocking. She started to tell him how much she appreciated the fact that he\u2019d found her, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked. \u201cMy ears are still ringing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust that I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d Bethanne hadn\u2019t intended to admit that. Yet it was true. She hadn\u2019t expected to see him again, hadn\u2019t believed it was even possible. The explosion of surprise mingled with joy gave her pause. Bethanne had planned to use these weeks away to consider her future with Grant. This wasn\u2019t the time to confuse the issue by indulging some romantic fantasy about a man on a motorcycle.</p><p>Max studied her with those intense brown eyes. \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m here, too.\u201d He clasped her hand and intertwined their fingers. Bethanne\u2019s heart raced like that of a teenage girl on her first date. Get a grip, she told herself. As they walked out of the casino she kept reminding herself how ridiculous being with Max was. This was a dead-end relationship. A dead-end everything.</p><p>Although it wasn\u2019t nine o\u2019clock yet, it remained light out. \u201cAny place you\u2019d like to go?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Being unfamiliar with Las Vegas, Bethanne didn\u2019t know what to suggest. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll choose.\u201d</p><p>They reached his bike in the parking lot and he removed Rooster\u2019s helmet from the older man\u2019s Harley, which was parked beside his, and handed it to her. She climbed on the back of Max\u2019s bike and set her feet where he\u2019d shown her before. Max took his seat, started the engine with a roar and turned out of the parking lot.</p><p>Bethanne slipped her arms around his waist and held on, although less tightly than the first time she\u2019d ridden with him. Closing her eyes, she felt the breeze rush past and after a few minutes she relaxed. She wasn\u2019t sure where Max was going. It didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>When he slowed the bike, Bethanne realized they were completely out of the city, on a hill that overlooked the valley. Night had settled in and the casino lights lit up the sky.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, after they\u2019d parked and taken off their helmets. He looked down at the city, and Bethanne joined him.</p> <p>\u201cI used to sit up here and just stare at the lights,\u201d Max continued. \u201cIt\u2019s so crazy down there and so peaceful up here.\u201d He stood beside her in silence for a few minutes. \u201cTell me about your ex-husband,\u201d he suddenly said.</p><p>\u201cGrant?\u201d she asked, uncertain what to say.</p><p>\u201cYou have more than one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your question surprised me, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it difficult to talk about your divorce?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot anymore. I guess it comes down to a case of the two of us growing apart. He found someone else and the sad part is, I was so involved with his career, with our children and friends, that I didn\u2019t notice. I mean, a wife\u2019s supposed to sense these things, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you...did you ever cheat on your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d His answer was quick and decisive. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even tempted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the time, Grant and I had been married nearly twenty years. We\u2019d grown comfortable with each other. Complacent, I guess. He wanted me to be a stay-at-home mother and I enjoyed that role. I hosted dinners, arranged all his travel... I considered myself a full partner in his life and his career\u2014and yet I didn\u2019t know about Tiffany. I honestly didn\u2019t have a clue. If someone had told me, I swear I wouldn\u2019t have believed my husband was capable of betraying me that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you unhappy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not in the least. But after Grant moved out, I was an emotional mess. I felt lost, bewildered, defeated. As if I\u2019d suddenly been blinded, with no idea where I was or how to find my way out. It took weeks\u2014no, months\u2014to come to grips with the situation. I\u2019m a different person now. The years have given me perspective. I can understand better what happened and why Grant was attracted to Tiffany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds as if you\u2019re making excuses for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the ground and moved the dirt around with the toe of her shoe. Maybe she was making excuses for Grant; if so, it was probably because he\u2019d recognized how wrong he\u2019d been and told her so, over and over. \u201cGrant\u2019s sorry about it now.... I mentioned before that he wants us to get back together. He had roses delivered to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere in Vegas?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThey were in the room waiting for us. He wanted to apologize because we had a small argument over the phone last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout me, I suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you must know, he was horrified that I\u2019d taken off with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. It was a risky thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you dangerous, Max?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cIs Max your real name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Max Scranton. My friends find it ironic\u2014the Mad Max thing. But I\u2019ve been Max my whole life.\u201d He hesitated and leaned back against the bike, stretched out his legs and crossed his arms. \u201cKate used to call me\u2014\u201d He didn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt to talk about her?\u201d</p><p>He looked away. \u201cWhat you told me yesterday is true. It does get easier. I didn\u2019t think that was possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much longer will you continue to run?\u201d she asked. She wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as forward if he hadn\u2019t been curious about her and Grant.</p><p>\u201cIs that what I\u2019m doing? Running away from the pain?\u201d The question didn\u2019t appear to offend him.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cActually, I think I would\u2019ve pulled up roots and left Seattle if not for Andrew and Annie.\u201d It occurred to her that he might have children. \u201cDid you and Kate have a family?\u201d</p><p>Anguish came and went in his eyes so quickly that Bethanne wondered if she\u2019d imagined it. \u201cA daughter. Katherine was born with a rare genetic disease. She died when she was eleven. Since we both carried the gene, we decided not to have any more children. After Katherine it was just the two of us. Then...Kate was gone, too. I didn\u2019t deal well with that. I blamed myself for a long time.\u201d He spoke with his gaze on the lights of the city below. \u201cI buried myself in a bottle for the first year. I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened to me if it wasn\u2019t for Rooster and my brother. Fortunately, Luke stepped in to take over the business. Otherwise, I would\u2019ve lost it, along with everything else. In a way I think that\u2019s what I wanted. Maybe what I deserved. Death robbed me of the two people I loved most. Nothing else mattered. I think I wanted to die myself. Death would be easier than living with the pain.\u201d He paused and inhaled deeply. \u201cThen Rooster took control. He refused to let me slowly kill myself. I\u2019m grateful now, but, trust me, at the time I much preferred the idea of drinking myself to death.\u201d</p><p>Max had lost so much. His daughter and then his wife.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t talk about Katherine,\u201d he murmured, staring into the night sky. \u201cNot with anyone.\u201d He looked decidedly uncomfortable. \u201cYou...unnerve me, Bethanne. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it\u2014and I don\u2019t like it. Feeling vulnerable is something I avoid. I don\u2019t understand what makes you different.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t understand it, either. She placed her hand on his forearm and felt him tense. \u201cWhy did you come looking for me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He snorted softly as if he wished he knew the answer himself. \u201cThe thing is, I\u2019m not sure why I wanted to see you again. All I knew was that I...needed to.\u201d</p><p>Still sitting, he held out his arms, and she leaned into his embrace. He held her close. Bethanne tucked her head beneath his chin and released a slow, thoughtful sigh.</p><p>A hundred questions chased one another in her mind, but she couldn\u2019t ask a single one. After what seemed like a very long time, he reluctantly let her go.</p><p>\u201cYou feel like you belong in my arms,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Bethanne wanted to tell him she felt the same way, but she couldn\u2019t afford to encourage this relationship. Over the past six years she\u2019d dated, but no one had affected her the way this man did. Instead, she looked up at him, and his dark eyes held hers.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kiss me. Aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014but my life\u2019s complicated. I took this trip with my mother-in-law and Annie because I needed time to sort through some things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether to reunite with your ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, my life\u2019s complicated...and I can\u2019t...I won\u2019t get involved with you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny! My life is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplicated,\u201d he finished for her. \u201cYeah, I know. It\u2019s just a kiss, Bethanne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She felt foolish for acting as though it was something more. \u201cBut the way I feel...\u201d She didn\u2019t finish, wasn\u2019t even sure she should. She\u2019d just told him how attractive she found him.</p><p>He seemed to realize what she meant. \u201cGot it. It\u2019s time I took you back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to leave, but it was for the best and clearly he recognized that, too.</p><p>He placed the helmet on his head and climbed on the bike. Bethanne did the same. Instead of circling her arms around him the way she had previously, she simply gripped the sides of his leather jacket. If he noticed, he didn\u2019t mention it. In her two times on the bike, she\u2019d learned quite a bit about motorcycles. As they rode, her body automatically adjusted to the curves and turns.</p><p>The reverse journey, back into the city, seemed to take ten times longer. When they reached the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, he pulled into the parking area, where the valets assisted drivers. He waited for her to climb off first.</p><p>She removed the helmet and handed it to him. Her throat clogged with tears as she struggled to speak. She wouldn\u2019t see him again, and while she knew that was the only responsible option, it saddened her. Finally, she decided on a simple \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded without looking at her.</p><p>Turning away, she entered the casino and was startled by the surge of loud music.</p><p>Tired now and discouraged, Bethanne hurried toward the elevator. She was standing in the lobby when she saw Rooster making his way toward her.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Max?\u201d he asked, obviously surprised to find her alone. He held a beer bottle in one hand.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He dropped me off and left.\u201d</p><p>Rooster frowned and took a swallow of his beer. \u201cHe just dropped you off?\u201d</p><p>She hoped Max\u2019s friend would give her some insight into him. \u201cWe went up to a hill where we could look at the city and talked for a while.\u201d</p><p>Rooster led her away from the crowd and into one of the bars. \u201cLet me buy you a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m not much of a beer drinker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrder whatever you want,\u201d he said. He found them a table and raised his hand to get the attention of the waitress.</p><p>\u201cI prefer red wine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grinned at that.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with red wine,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNothing whatsoever. You might ask Max about that the next time you see him.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne doubted she\u2019d have the opportunity.</p> <p>The waitress came for their order and quickly returned with another beer for Rooster and a glass of merlot for Bethanne. Actually, she was glad she\u2019d run into Max\u2019s friend.</p><p>\u201cHe nearly tore this town apart looking for you,\u201d Rooster commented. He leaned toward her, his elbows propped on the table.</p><p>By contrast Max had made it sound as if he\u2019d tracked her down without much effort. \u201cDid he tell you why it was so important to find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are Willie and Skunk?\u201d She shouldn\u2019t ask questions. What she should do was drink her wine, thank Rooster and go up to bed.</p> <p>\u201cThey took off on their own when they got tired of racing from one casino to the next. Can\u2019t say I blame them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Max is all that pleased he found me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m not sure of anything, including how I feel.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cI guess I\u2019m sad, mostly.\u201d Still, she felt honored that their brief time together had such a strong impact on him. It\u2019d been the same for her, but the timing was all wrong. The situation, too. She tasted her wine, then held the glass by its stem. For some reason, she felt an urge to explain. \u201cI can\u2019t get involved with Max,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t. Not right now. I have responsibilities, decisions to make, and I need a clear mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt every casino he said he didn\u2019t need a woman messing with his mind. He said he wasn\u2019t going to let a woman make him stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know. You\u2019ll have to ask him. All day, casino after casino, he kept saying he needed his head examined and yet he kept searching. I asked him what was so special about you, and he wouldn\u2019t answer. He didn\u2019t stop until he found you and I don\u2019t think he would have, either.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, she smiled. \u201cWhen he hugged me, he said I...belonged in his arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hugged? That\u2019s all?\u201d Rooster sounded incredulous.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t touched another woman since Kate died. You\u2019ve obviously had a powerful effect on him.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her wine while she tried to make sense of all this. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Taking her business card from her purse, she handed it to Rooster. \u201cGive this to him and tell him to call me when he\u2019s ready.\u201d By then she would have reached her own decision regarding Grant. She\u2019d know what she wanted. With time and distance she\u2019d be able to think, to put her history with Grant and this new attraction in perspective. If she went back to Grant, she\u2019d inform Max\u2014provided she even heard from him again. If not...</p> <p>Rooster put the card in his pocket and frowned at her. \u201cYou sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>And she was.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Bethanne was putting on eye makeup when Annie, dressed in her pj\u2019s, stumbled into the bathroom bleary-eyed, her hair a tangled mess.</p><p>\u201cDid you have fun last night?\u201d Bethanne asked. She\u2019d lain awake a long time and heard Annie tiptoe into the room around three that morning. In fact, Bethanne doubted she\u2019d slept more than a couple of hours the entire night. She\u2019d been thinking of Max and their conversation. She couldn\u2019t help wondering what might have happened if she\u2019d let him kiss her. Well, it was too late to question that now.</p><p>\u201cI had a blast,\u201d Annie said as she ran a brush through her hair. \u201cWould it be all right if you and Grandma did your own thing today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing Jason again?\u2019</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t it? I met his parents. They\u2019re with him and his sister is, too. Apparently, a cousin of his got married yesterday afternoon. We hung out with his sister most of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. That\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting his parents for breakfast. Why don\u2019t you come with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I will. But I don\u2019t want you to stay out as late tonight, okay? We\u2019re leaving in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Annie dressed quickly in cotton capris and a tank top, and put on minimal makeup. Oh, the benefits of being in your twenties! Not that middle age didn\u2019t have its compensations...</p><p>When Bethanne had finished her own makeup, her mother-in-law was sitting on the end of the bed waiting. \u201cYou ready for breakfast, Ruth?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve been invited to join Annie\u2019s friend Jason and his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than ready.\u201d Ruth reached for her purse and together they left the room. They spent a delightful hour with Jason and his extended family, all of them friendly and outgoing people, then walked the Strip, visiting one casino after another. They rode the gondola at the Venetian and shopped at Caesars Palace, then ate lunch at Wolfgang Puck\u2019s restaurant. Ruth\u2019s energy surpassed Bethanne\u2019s. Her mother-in-law might be attending her fiftieth class reunion, but she was physically fit and mentally alert. And she\u2019d had a good night\u2019s sleep, unlike Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cI have to admit I\u2019m enjoying this more than I would Mount Rushmore,\u201d Ruth told her as she set her fork down. \u201cI\u2019m feeling lucky. Would you mind if I went back to the hotel and gave Vanna a chance to return my money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You do what you want. This is your trip.\u201d</p><p>Ruth looked unsure. \u201cBut I want you to enjoy yourself, too.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnnie certainly seems to be having a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too. A wonderful time,\u201d Bethanne assured her and, truthfully, she was.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d Ruth asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, that Texas oilman and I have struck up a friendly relationship. I think I\u2019ll go visit that slot machine again and see if he\u2019s willing to hand over any more of those oil residuals.\u201d</p><p>Her plans for the afternoon seemed to appease Ruth. Bethanne walked her mother-in-law back to the Hard Rock casino and sent her off to find the Wheel of Fortune slot machines. Then she strolled around until she came across the Texas Tea slots. Yesterday\u2019s machine was available and she grabbed it. Once seated and comfortable, she opened her purse to take out her wallet. She wouldn\u2019t have heard her cell phone if not for the fact that her purse was open. Automatically she pulled it out. She didn\u2019t recognize the number.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you give your business card to Rooster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking why you gave Rooster your cell phone number,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she murmured, shocked to hear from him and equally pleased. Last night she\u2019d reviewed their conversation over and over, and each time she\u2019d felt a sense of loss. She needed to consider her relationship with Grant, but that didn\u2019t mean she had to shut herself off from a new one, did it? Well, yes, it did if she and Grant were going to reconcile. She\u2019d finally fallen into a troubled sleep and woke with no clear understanding of what her ultimate decision would be. What it should be.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>He was right; she did know why she\u2019d done it. Even as she handed Rooster the business card with that vague comment about how Max should call when he was \u201cready,\u201d she knew. \u201cI wanted to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame casino. Same machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne\u2019s hand trembled as she dropped her phone back inside her purse. She told herself she should get up and walk away that very minute. But she couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>Max seemed to recognize her indecision the moment he approached her. She started to talk, but he stopped her by pressing his finger against her lips. Taking her by the shoulders, he smiled down at her. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI respect what you told me. I appreciate that you\u2019ve got a weighty decision to make. All I ask is that you give me today. I won\u2019t ask for anything more. Can you agree to that?\u201d</p><p>Again she nodded.</p><p>He smiled and slipped his arms around her, and they hugged.</p><p>His embrace felt warm and familiar as if this was where she belonged. Wasn\u2019t that what he\u2019d said\u2014that she belonged in his arms? It was exactly how she felt, too. Why, oh, why did he have to be the one who made her heart flutter? Why, oh, why did it have to be now? If she was confused and uncertain when it came to Grant, meeting Max only complicated that situation.</p><p>\u201cI could hold you like this all day,\u201d he whispered into her hair.</p><p>She wanted that, too. Maybe, she mused, she was using Max as a distraction to avoid thinking about Grant.</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of wasting what\u2019s left of today,\u201d Max said, clasping her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>When they went outside, the summer sun beat down on them. The heat hadn\u2019t reached its zenith and wouldn\u2019t for several hours, but the sun shone with a brilliant intensity. Bethanne put on her sunglasses as they walked. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA place I know not far from here.\u201d</p><p>It turned out to be an ice cream shop a couple of blocks off the Strip. Bethanne slid into the booth and Max took the seat across from her. He ordered a vanilla ice cream soda, while Bethanne had coffee.</p><p>They talked for four hours straight. Four hours. The conversation drifted naturally from one subject to another. They discussed music, politics, books and friends. She learned he was in the wine distribution business. That was the reason Rooster had commented on her preference for wine over beer. Rooster owned an advertising agency and had worked with Max on his company\u2019s account.</p><p>He asked her plenty of questions, too. He wanted to know about her children and she described Andrew and Annie with pride. In fact, they talked about everything\u2014except Grant or Kate or his daughter. It was as though the subject of the people they\u2019d once loved was strictly taboo.</p><p>About halfway through their conversation, Ruth phoned to say she was feeling a bit under the weather. Too much sun, too much food and her dismay that Vanna was a lot greedier than she\u2019d expected. Bethanne was concerned, but Ruth claimed she\u2019d feel better if she didn\u2019t interrupt Bethanne\u2019s fun with her Texas oilman. Bethanne didn\u2019t enlighten her mother-in-law about where she really was or who she was with.</p><p>\u201cTell me more about your business,\u201d Max said after she\u2019d put away her cell. He held her card in his hand and turned it over two or three times as if there was some invisible message scrawled across the back.</p><p>\u201cI never dreamed Parties would be as successful as it is. All I set out to do was make enough money to take care of my children and keep our home. The shock was how timely this idea turned out to be.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThere was an article about me in the Wall Street Journal when we added birthday parties for cats and dogs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? Parties for dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCats, too, and the idea\u2019s really caught on. Baby boomers love their pets and are willing to spend hundreds of dollars to throw them birthday parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to, but trust me, it\u2019s big business. I\u2019ve had offers to franchise, but it doesn\u2019t feel right. Not yet. The problem with so many companies is that they expand too quickly. I don\u2019t want to do that. Once the five stores are all operating at a comfortable profit margin, I\u2019ll look into it again, but for the moment, I\u2019m content.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds as if you have a good head for business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to think so.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention that most of what she\u2019d learned had been gleaned from her years with Grant. She\u2019d often remained in the background, but she\u2019d absorbed a lot of business strategy and financial wisdom.</p><p>\u201cSo the divorce is actually responsible for your starting up the business?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI had help.\u201d She told him the story of the knitting class she\u2019d joined and the friends she\u2019d made, including Elise Beaumont. \u201cElise\u2019s husband, Maverick, was a professional gambler\u2014and he took a gamble on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne that paid off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, thankfully. So you\u2019re right. Grant was indirectly responsible for my decision to start this business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now he wants to get back together with you?\u201d</p><p>She cradled her mug with both hands and looked down into the cooling coffee. \u201cHe does, and I\u2019m having a hard time deciding. I was with him for twenty years. We have a long, shared history, two children and a lot of happy memories. He realized he made a mistake and will do anything he can to rectify it.... I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to go back. I\u2019ve changed and so has he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you forgiven him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d She paused, then resumed, speaking slowly. \u201cAbout a year after the divorce I woke up feeling miserable and depressed. Annie had let it slip that Grant and Tiffany were in Paris. Paris. I\u2019d longed to visit Paris, and Grant knew that.</p><p>\u201cAll I could think about was how unfair it was that I should be alone, while Grant and Tiffany were off having the time of their lives. I buried my face in the pillow and just sobbed.\u201d The memory of her grief and her tears that bleak morning was fresh in her mind even now. \u201cI realized then that I had to forgive him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat made you decide right then that you had to forgive him? And how did you manage it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first, I thought it would be impossible. I thought no one could forgive what Grant had done to me and our children. But then...\u201d She bit her lip.</p><p>Max reached for her hand, gripping her fingers hard, silently encouraging her to continue.</p><p>\u201cThen I understood that unless I freed my heart of the bitterness and resentment I felt toward Grant, I\u2019d be incapable of ever loving again. I had to unclench my fist of anger in order to fill my palm with happiness, with joy...with love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve done that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d she whispered, unsure how to respond. \u201cI\u2019ve done my best but I\u2019ve discovered forgiveness is a lot harder than it looks. Just when I think I\u2019m completely over what he did, something will happen that shows me how far I still have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you he was upset with me because I took a risk and rode off with you. That angered me and I let him know it. Later, I felt bad because all Grant was really doing was telling me he was concerned about me and that he loves me. I was shocked by how quickly those old resentments returned.\u201d</p> <p>Max circled the straw around his empty soda glass. \u201cHow\u2019s Grant\u2019s relationship with his children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d Bethanne carefully chose the appropriate word. \u201cAndrew\u2019s had a hard time trusting his father. When we were first divorced, Annie acted out her anger but eventually she calmed down and now they\u2019re as close as they used to be. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s keeping tabs on me during this trip through Annie.\u201d In other words, Grant had more than likely heard an earful about Max already.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cAndrew\u2019s wedding complicates matters even more,\u201d she said. \u201cGrant wants us to stand together, united as a family, as we celebrate our son\u2019s marriage. In theory it sounds like a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d like that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose I would. Grant and I love our son and we adore Courtney. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>She was astonished by how easily she could voice her feelings to him. \u201cGrant and me together sends a message to our family and friends that isn\u2019t accurate. We aren\u2019t a couple and haven\u2019t been for six years.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne was grateful that Max didn\u2019t share his opinions or offer advice. His willingness to remain silent told her that he trusted her judgment and her ability to make difficult choices. To make the decisions that were best for her and her children.</p><p>As the afternoon progressed, she saw that the ice cream parlor had started to fill up. Max looked around and noticed it, too. They were taking up spaces paying customers could use.</p><p>\u201cCan I take you to dinner tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIce cream? Dinner? Apparently, what happens in Vegas is really pretty tame.\u201d She smiled as she said it.</p><p>Max smiled, too. \u201cThe night isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d</p><p>They set a time and place to meet, and Bethanne went up to her room to change clothes and check on Ruth. Her mother-in-law sat on the bed, leaning against some pillows she\u2019d stacked behind her, feet crossed at the ankles. She was knitting and watching television.</p><p>She looked up when Bethanne walked into their room. \u201cI called Jane in Florida,\u201d she said, blushing a little. \u201cI used the hotel phone, which probably cost me more than I lost at the slots, but I wanted my friends to know where we were. Jane asked how soon we\u2019d be in Florida.\u201d She beamed with pleasure over the phone call.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>Ruth\u2019s grin seemed to brighten her entire face. \u201cI told her we have a long way to drive, but we\u2019ll get there. Jane said that since we\u2019re in the area, it would be a shame not to see the Grand Canyon. We should go, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really should,\u201d Bethanne agreed. She opened her suitcase and unpacked the only dress she\u2019d brought. \u201cHave you heard from Annie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a peep.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne nodded and called her daughter\u2019s cell. Annie explained that she and Jason had tickets for a show that evening; she was definitely amenable to visiting the Grand Canyon. \u201cMight as well,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cBye, Mom!\u201d</p><p>Bethanne shook out her dress and hung it in the closet. While her back was to Ruth, she said, \u201cMax invited me to dinner. Will you be all right by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out?\u201d Ruth sounded surprised. \u201cWith that biker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Vegas.\u201d Bethanne shrugged, but she did feel guilty about deserting her mother-in-law.</p><p>Ruth frowned. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, although I hate the thought of you spending all your time in the room. You should go out, explore the town, enjoy yourself.\u201d She took her dress into the bathroom to change into and set out a pair of strappy heels to wear.</p><p>Ruth didn\u2019t seem keen on the idea of going out on her own. \u201cI suppose I could find something to do,\u201d she muttered when Bethanne reappeared. \u201cBut I wonder whether you should be having dinner with another man...\u201d She left the rest unsaid.</p><p>\u201cRuth, don\u2019t worry, I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>Ruth glowered. \u201cI hope you haven\u2019t taken leave of your senses.\u201d</p><p>Despite her effort not to, Bethanne laughed. She wasn\u2019t going to argue with Ruth, wasn\u2019t even going to point out that this was her business. \u201cI won\u2019t be late,\u201d she said as she breezed out of the room. One day was all Max had asked of her and she couldn\u2019t refuse him\u2014or herself.</p><p>Max met her in the lobby and did a double-take when he saw her. He\u2019d changed, too, and wore slacks and a crisp cotton shirt, one she suspected from the crease marks was brand-new. It occurred to Bethanne that it hadn\u2019t been practical to wear a dress if he planned on taking his bike. Rooster was with him and straightened when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cWow, you clean up nice,\u201d the older man said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She ran her hand down the front of her pale pink sheath.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Ruth up to tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s threatening to order room service.\u201d Bethanne rolled her eyes at that. Ruth could pitch guilt with the best of them, but Bethanne refused to cancel her evening with Max.</p><p>Both men chuckled and Rooster sauntered over to the elevators. \u201cShall we?\u201d Max said, offering her his arm. Once they were outside the hotel, the doorman got them a taxi. The restaurant Max took her to turned out to be a high-end steak house. Everything was delicious, from her salad to the rich dessert they shared. Max selected the wine, a rich cabernet sauvignon from France, and they discussed various Old and New World wines.</p><p>Max paid the bill, and when they left, he waved down a taxi. He gave the driver an address, and Bethanne asked, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d as he held her door.</p><p>He smiled, eyebrows raised. \u201cTo a biker bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She\u2019d feel terribly out of place.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said as he got in beside her. \u201cIt isn\u2019t what you think.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, they arrived at what appeared to be a honky-tonk tavern, where the band was loud and the crowd boisterous. Max found them a table in a shadowy corner and ordered drinks\u2014pints of beer from a microbrewery she\u2019d never heard of. Several couples were dancing, and before the waitress returned, Max led Bethanne onto the floor.</p><p>They danced until they were breathless. The live music was energetic, the atmosphere festive. Several men cast her questioning looks but she doubted their curiosity was due to her or the way she\u2019d dressed. The men seemed surprised to see Max with a woman, which made Bethanne feel even more special.</p><p>When she was convinced she couldn\u2019t dance another step, they went back to the table and collapsed into their chairs. Bethanne hadn\u2019t spent that much time on the dance floor in years. Max dragged his chair next to hers and picked up his beer mug, draining half of it. Then he set the mug aside, slipped his hand around her shoulder and drew her mouth to his.</p><p>This time Bethanne didn\u2019t hesitate. She closed her eyes and met him halfway. Winding her arms around his neck, she leaned into the kiss, which was gentle and soft. In the beginning. That quickly changed as passion flared between them. It\u2019d been so long since she\u2019d experienced desire, real physical need, that it rocked her. The kiss became so intense, she nearly slid off her chair.</p><p>Max seemed to feel just as shaken. He broke off the kiss and slumped back. His eyes met hers; he had the look of a man who was dazed, stunned. Bethanne understood, because she felt that same mixture of astonishment and wonder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Neither seemed to know what to say. After a moment, Max touched her face. \u201cYou taste nice,\u201d he whispered, sounding unlike himself.</p><p>She lowered her lashes. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and kissed her again as though testing his own observation. She clung to him. His kiss was urgent, needy, and once again desire sparked between them, scorching Bethanne\u2019s senses. She turned her head away and buried her face in his shoulder, trying to understand what was happening to them. Max ran his fingers through her hair and continued kissing the side of her face.</p><p>Anywhere else Bethanne would have been embarrassed. Thankfully, no one here seemed to notice or care.</p> <p>They danced and kissed and became so involved with each other that it was after two in the morning before she was aware of the time. Resting her forehead against his, Bethanne sighed. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>His hold on her briefly tightened. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s what I want,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like nothing better than to spend the rest of my time in Vegas with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re leaving for the Grand Canyon tomorrow morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s spectacular. You\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too. Can I call you again?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to respond.</p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Max said. \u201cYou call me. You should have my cell number in your phone index. If I don\u2019t hear from you...let\u2019s say by August first, after your son\u2019s wedding, then I\u2019ll know you\u2019ve decided to go back to Grant.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>Max escorted her to the hotel and kissed her one last time. He was wrong about one thing, she thought. What happened in Vegas wouldn\u2019t stay here. It would always be with her.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>By the time Ruth, Annie and Bethanne left Las Vegas, it was almost noon. They\u2019d slept in until after ten, eaten a late breakfast, packed up the car and were now on their way. This was the new rental and once again they\u2019d opted to do without a navigational device. They had their map and an atlas; that should be enough.</p><p>No one seemed to be talking much, and the tension inside the car remained high as Bethanne headed toward Henderson, Nevada, and then over Hoover Dam south on Highway 93. It went without saying that Annie and Ruth were upset with her for staying out so late with Max, but neither commented. Just as well. Her relationship with Max was none of their business, regardless of what they might think. Soon the map directed them toward the cutoff for Grand Canyon National Park.</p><p>Finally, Annie broke the ice. \u201cWill you be seeing Max again?\u201d she asked from the backseat. Although the question was thrown out casually, Bethanne could see that both her daughter and Ruth were keenly interested in her answer.</p><p>Would she see him again? That depended on what she decided about Grant\u2014a decision that was hers alone. She\u2019d told Max she\u2019d contact him after Andrew\u2019s wedding. The beginning of August, he\u2019d suggested, but that seemed so long to wait. Even after she\u2019d slipped into bed beside Annie, all Bethanne could think about was the kisses she\u2019d shared with Max. No man had affected her the way he did, not since she was in college and first met Grant.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Annie prompted.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cWill you be seeing Jason again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Annie admitted reluctantly, \u201cbut he has my cell number.\u201d</p><p>Max had hers, too, but he wouldn\u2019t use it, wouldn\u2019t phone until she\u2019d called him. That was how they\u2019d left it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a different time zone,\u201d Ruth announced, changing the subject as they crossed the state line. \u201cArizona isn\u2019t on daylight savings.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne knew that her mother-in-law had always been uncomfortable with conflict and tried to avoid it whenever possible. Bethanne had been much the same for most of her married life. But that had gradually changed; she\u2019d reinvented herself as a businesswoman, which had required her to negotiate, to compete and to promote her services. A woman who lacked confidence couldn\u2019t do those things.</p><p>The tension in the car eased, and the silence became companionable. Bethanne turned on the radio, filling the car with ABBA and the Fifth Dimension. It wasn\u2019t long before Ruth and Bethanne were singing along and Annie\u2019s voice harmonized with theirs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just plain good music,\u201d her daughter said, apparently surprised that she\u2019d be enjoying the same songs as her mother and grandmother.</p><p>They drove out of range and lost that station after half an hour or so. Bethanne snapped off the radio, and they lapsed back into silence.</p><p>\u201cHow are the wedding gloves progressing?\u201d Ruth asked after another lengthy period when no one seemed inclined to talk.</p><p>\u201cWhen has Mom had time to knit?\u201d Annie joked. \u201cFrankly, I never imagined I\u2019d see my mother on a Harley.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter didn\u2019t know her nearly as well as she thought, but Bethanne didn\u2019t say anything. Annie\u2019s vision of her was a contradictory one\u2014including both the independent businesswoman of today and the complacent wife of years past.</p><p>\u201cThis is all too weird for me,\u201d Annie was saying. \u201cMy mom and Mad Max? It\u2019s just...odd, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Mom. I realize this is your life and everything, but a guy on a bike? Really? My mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t find it odd at all,\u201d Bethanne muttered. But it was a moot point, since she likely wouldn\u2019t see Max again, although the prospect saddened her.</p><p>Ruth broke into a half smile.</p><p>\u201cThat reminds me of my family\u2019s opinion of Royce and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Royce?\u201d Annie immediately asked.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s another friend your grandmother hopes to see in Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-h-h,\u201d Annie said, dragging out the word in a meaningful way.</p><p>Bethanne could only assume her mother-in-law wanted to discuss this man\u2014or else why bring him up?\u2014but she had to grin at Ruth\u2019s blush.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell us about Royce,\u201d Bethanne said, taking advantage of the change in subject so she wouldn\u2019t have to answer questions about Max. She wasn\u2019t so different from Ruth, after all, trying to maintain the peace and avoid discord. Perhaps she hadn\u2019t changed as much as she thought....</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d Ruth stared down at her hands. \u201cAs you\u2019ve already guessed, we dated during our senior year. We broke up after I went to college and he became a marine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s attending the reunion, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re hoping to reconnect with him?\u201d Bethanne asked.</p><p>Ruth nodded. \u201cWe had a...nasty falling-out, so I\u2019m a bit apprehensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Grandma, he\u2019s probably just as excited about getting together as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d</p><p>Ruth\u2019s question was so sincere and charming that Bethanne wished she could lean over and hug her.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s been years and years since you last saw him?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes...so many that I can hardly believe it. I heard he lost his wife a few years back, and Richard\u2019s gone, and, well, I hoped... Oh, I don\u2019t know, other than that this would give me the opportunity to resolve things between us. We parted on such bitter terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he realize you\u2019re coming to the reunion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to fall in love all over again and marry him, Grandma?\u201d Annie teased.</p><p>\u201cAnnie,\u201d Bethanne chastised. \u201cCome on. Don\u2019t put your grandmother on the spot like that.\u201d</p><p>Ruth twisted around to look at Annie. \u201cHoney, remember we haven\u2019t seen each other in over fifty years and\u2014and there\u2019s a lot we have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you say it on the phone?\u201d Annie asked. \u201cYou should call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall him? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow. Or before you show up at the reunion, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do it,\u201d Ruth murmured, pressing her palms against her cheeks. \u201cWhat I need to tell him\u2014well, it\u2019s the sort of thing I\u2019d rather do face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Annie said as though she understood. \u201cYou loved him, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Very much. And then I met your grandfather and...everything changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still love Royce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I possibly know? I was eighteen when we dated. He came from a poor family, and my father never really approved of our relationship. In retrospect, I know Daddy only wanted the best for me. He liked Richard and, well, it was such a long time ago....\u201d</p><p>Ruth was so quiet all of a sudden that Bethanne glanced in her direction, shocked to see tears making wet tracks down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cRuth,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Ruth buried her face in her hands and started to weep in earnest.</p><p>\u201cGrandma?\u201d Annie leaned forward, touching her grandmother\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Ruth?\u201d Bethanne asked softly. Whatever it was must have to do with Royce.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Ruth managed between sobs.</p><p>\u201cWe will if you explain it to us,\u201d Annie said in a gentle voice.</p><p>Ruth shook her head again. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can face Royce after what I did to him.\u201d Ruth\u2019s hands trembled and she took a gasping breath. \u201cI hurt him deeply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuth, you were young. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s gotten over it.\u201d</p><p>Ruth refused to make eye contact. \u201cHe might have, but I\u2019m not sure I ever can.\u201d</p><p>Annie handed Ruth a tissue, which she clenched as if it were a lifeline.</p><p>\u201cWe promised to love each other and be true...\u201d she choked out. \u201cThat\u2019s what we called it back then\u2014being true.\u201d She closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd...you weren\u2019t?\u201d Bethanne probed.</p><p>Ruth looked down at her purse, winding the strap around her hand. \u201cI went to a party with friends soon after I got to college. I\u2019d never drunk anything stronger than beer. Someone brought vodka and mixed it with orange juice and gave me a glass. I remember how good it tasted and I had more of them...and the next thing I knew, I was necking with this boy and I didn\u2019t even know his name.\u201d She tried to stem the tears, swiping at them with the crumpled tissue. \u201cI told him I needed to get back to my dorm and he offered to walk me there. He seemed friendly and nice, and when we arrived, I let him kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuth, you were on your own for the first time,\u201d Bethanne said. She found it painful that after all the years, her mother-in-law still couldn\u2019t forgive herself for a youthful indiscretion.</p><p>\u201cGrandma, so what if you let a boy kiss you?\u201d Annie said. She rubbed her grandmother\u2019s shoulder with soothing strokes.</p><p>Ruth continued in a ragged voice. \u201cI told him I already had a boyfriend and...and he said that was fine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you see him again?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. We were in the same history class. We talked after the lecture a couple of times and went for a Coke. He was always nice to me. I wouldn\u2019t let him kiss me again and he respected that. I wrote Royce every single day but I never told him about Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard?\u201d Bethanne repeated, stunned. That was Grant\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cYes. Then one night we attended another party. He and I went together. I thought I\u2019d be all right because I was with Richard, but someone gave me a spiked drink and we...we\u2014\u201d She paused and once more hid her face in her hands. \u201cWe made love in the backseat of his car and a few weeks later I realized I was pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Ruth.\u201d Bethanne looked away from the road long enough to reassure her mother-in-law that she was the last person who\u2019d think badly of her. How strange that they should be having this conversation, which was probably the most serious and honest of their entire relationship, while driving down the freeway.</p><p>\u201cRichard took the news like a gentleman.... He said he loved me and would marry me. But we hardly knew each other and I hadn\u2019t even told Royce I\u2019d met anyone else...and then I had to tell him I was marrying another man and that I was pregnant\u2014and all of this happened while he was still in basic training!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuth, my poor Ruth...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Grandma, how awful for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI broke his heart,\u201d Ruth said with finality. She gazed at Bethanne, her tears drying as she resumed her story. \u201cHe said if I could be unfaithful so soon after leaving home, I wasn\u2019t the person he thought I was. He said he was happy to be rid of me.\u201d</p> <p>Again Bethanne looked away from the road. \u201cI\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean that. He was speaking from his pain.\u201d</p><p>Ruth went on as if she hadn\u2019t heard. \u201cRichard was a good husband. We were both determined to make the best of the marriage, and we did, but through the years...\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI often wondered what might\u2019ve happened if I\u2019d stayed home that night instead of going to the party. I wonder if Royce and I would eventually have married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only natural to wonder,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cYou were pregnant with Dad when you married Grandpa?\u201d Annie said. \u201cWow. I never added up the dates before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma.\u201d Annie ignored Bethanne. \u201cI meant what I said\u2014I bet Royce is just as anxious to see you again. You\u2019re probably the reason he\u2019s attending this reunion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope so, but I can\u2019t be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should call him and at least let him know you\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said adamantly.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, I wouldn\u2019t know what to say. Besides,\u201d she said as though this was a more convincing excuse, \u201cI don\u2019t have his number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy.\u201d Annie pulled out her cell phone. \u201cTell me his full name and I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Ruth turned to Bethanne, her face creased with doubt and indecision. \u201cDo you think contacting Royce before I arrive is a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it would hurt,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cIf you chatted briefly, then your mind would be at rest. You\u2019d know what to expect.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth\u2019s shoulders sagged. \u201cMaybe later. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s okay,\u201d Bethanne assured her.</p><p>\u201cYou do what you feel is best,\u201d Annie echoed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll look up his number for you, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cI\u2019d like to have it...in case I do decide to call. In case I can figure out what to say,\u201d she added under her breath.</p><p>It was afternoon when they entered the national park. The sights were as spectacular as Max had promised. They walked across the Grand Canyon Skywalk and marveled at the twisting, curving Colorado River far below.</p><p>Later, Ruth was in the gift shop and Annie was speaking to one of the park rangers, a young woman who didn\u2019t look much older than her daughter, when Bethanne\u2019s cell phone rang.</p><p>Digging in her purse, she located it just before it went to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethanne, where are you?\u201d</p><p>She groaned inwardly. \u201cHello, Grant.\u201d She almost wished she hadn\u2019t answered\u2014or that she\u2019d taken the time to check call display. \u201cWe\u2019re at the Grand Canyon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you got a late start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did, but we drove straight here. Your mother\u2019s eager to get to Florida.\u201d</p><p>The words were barely past her lips when Grant asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s this about you taking off with that biker?\u201d</p><p>Apparently, Annie had told Grant, which Bethanne didn\u2019t appreciate. \u201cIs that what Annie said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, some variation of it. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Bethanne echoed, unwilling to discuss Max with her ex-husband.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took off with this biker and according to our daughter you spent the night with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bethanne nearly exploded with outrage\u2014and then laughter. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be joking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, I hear you were gone until three.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne neither confirmed nor denied the report. Let Grant think whatever he wanted. She didn\u2019t owe him an explanation or an excuse.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best.\u201d And she meant it. The night with Max was one she would long cherish. He made her feel more alive, more feminine, and he\u2019d brought back the thrill of newly discovered passion. Yet he hadn\u2019t done anything other than kiss her and hold her. The desire was there; the need had felt urgent.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like you\u2019re falling for this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d She turned the question around, wanting him to form his own opinion.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The amusement was gone from his voice. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had one rather unpleasant discussion about this man. I\u2019d hate to have a repeat of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo would I.\u201d She had no intention of defending herself to Grant.</p><p>\u201cDo you plan on seeing him again?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cBethanne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s any of your business,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, Grant, but my relationship with Max has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>His silence spoke volumes. \u201cTrue, but you have to know I\u2019m working as hard as I can to rebuild our relationship. It doesn\u2019t help that every time I turn around, I hear about you and this biker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what his name is.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne sighed, unwilling to get into an argument with her ex-husband over a man she\u2019d dated once. Arguing put her on the defensive and she wasn\u2019t going to allow that.</p><p>She heard Grant exhale as though struggling with himself. \u201cI imagine women are easily enthralled with that kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the way middle-age men fall for younger women?\u201d That small dig apparently went right over Grant\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cTrue enough,\u201d he agreed, and his voice was back to that cajoling tone she knew so well. \u201cOn a completely different subject, how\u2019s my mother holding up?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne was grateful to talk about something other than Max. \u201cShe\u2019s doing great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie and I are fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Listen, I have some news I thought I\u2019d pass along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out there\u2019s a real estate conference in Orlando the same week as Mom\u2019s class reunion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She already knew what Grant was going to say. \u201cYou\u2019ve decided to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could be more perfect?\u201d Grant asked.</p><p>Indeed, Bethanne mused. What could be more perfect?</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>They spent the night in Flagstaff, Arizona, and were up early Monday morning, waking to sunshine. By seven, Annie had dragged the suitcases out to the car, while Bethanne dealt with the hotel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive so you can knit,\u201d Ruth volunteered.</p><p>Bethanne let her take the wheel, sitting beside her, while Annie climbed into the backseat. A little more than two hours later, they were in Albuquerque, New Mexico. They stopped for breakfast at a restaurant just off Interstate 40.</p><p>They were seated in a booth and reading over the menus when Annie said, \u201cDad told me he called while we were at the Grand Canyon.\u201d The comment was directed at Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d she confirmed without adding any details.</p><p>Annie set her menu aside. \u201cDid he say anything about the Realtors\u2019 convention?\u201d</p><p>In response, Bethanne looked at Ruth. \u201cGrant will be in Orlando next weekend, the same time as your reunion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far is Vero Beach from Orlando?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>Bethanne referred the question to her mother-in-law, who was far more familiar with Florida than she was. Ruth glanced over her menu. \u201cAbout two hours, I think\u2014but it\u2019s been a long time since I made the drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Dad will be only two hours away,\u201d Annie said, sounding downright gleeful.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll come to Vero Beach?\u201d Ruth asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he will.\u201d Bethanne kept her feelings well under control. Actually, she\u2019d be happy to see Grant. Maybe she could finally come to some conclusion, some decision; maybe she could finally say yes to a reconciliation. She\u2019d been giving their situation a great deal of thought. Grant had been persistent, determined to regain her love and trust. The problem\u2014and this had only recently become a problem\u2014was the way Bethanne felt about Max. Every time she considered what her life would be like if she and Grant were to reunite, Max was there, competing with those visions, those possibilities.</p><p>Max of the rare smiles, grinning at her. Memories of riding on his Harley, her arms hugging his waist. Memories of dancing and kissing. With Grant it was expensive champagne, classical music, two children and a twenty-year history. With Max it was cold beer, loud country music and one night in Vegas. No, it was time to put him out of her mind. He was little more than a drifter running from life. Deep down she suspected that her fascination with him was prompted by her fear of facing the issues she needed to confront regarding her ex-husband. She\u2019d forgiven Grant\u2014hadn\u2019t she? Forgiveness, as she\u2019d discovered, could be deceptive.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if it was possible to trust him again. Grant was sorry. He\u2019d admitted he\u2019d been wrong and accepted full responsibility for the pain he\u2019d inflicted on her and their children. Ruth had a point; that couldn\u2019t have been easy, especially for a proud man like Grant.</p><p>If only she could forgive wholeheartedly and forget the past...</p><p>And then there was Max. Gentle, loving Max, devoted to his wife. He\u2019d never cheated on Kate. He loved beyond the grave. Instinctively, she knew she could trust him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou ladies ready to order?\u201d asked the waitress, who appeared to be somewhere between Ruth\u2019s age and Bethanne\u2019s. She stepped up to their table, pad and pen in hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like French toast,\u201d Annie said, and gave the woman her menu.</p><p>\u201cOne poached egg on dry wheat,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d Bethanne closed the menu and held it out to the waitress\u2014and found three women staring at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, not understanding why her scrambled eggs had elicited all this attention.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no Max on the menu,\u201d the waitress said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cI said Max?\u201d Bethanne asked, startled to realize she deserved the looks Annie and Ruth were sending her.</p><p>The waitress continued to grin. \u201cI guess one of you ladies is missing her man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother is not missing that...biker,\u201d Annie snapped.</p><p>Ruth refused to meet her eyes.</p> <p>Bethanne\u2019s hand tightened on the menu. \u201cWould you both feel better if I said Grant\u2019s name?\u201d The answer was obvious. Then, glancing at the waitress, she said, \u201cGrant is my ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he wants to get back together with my mom,\u201d Annie explained.</p><p>\u201cMy son was an idiot, but he\u2019s regained his sanity just in time for my daughter-in-law to lose hers,\u201d Ruth said in a disgruntled voice.</p><p>The waitress stood there, holding the pad and pen, her gaze wandering from one to the other. \u201cLadies, I\u2019m no Dr. Laura. All I do around here is take orders and fill coffee cups. If you want advice, I suggest you turn on the radio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a latte.\u201d Bethanne decided to forgo the scrambled eggs, as her appetite was gone.</p><p>The waitress wrote down the order, hesitated a moment and then slid into the booth next to Bethanne. \u201cYou really should have some protein for breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll I want is a latte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got man problems, don\u2019t you, sweetie?\u201d she said, ignoring both Ruth and Annie. \u201cI don\u2019t normally get involved with customers but I\u2019ve been married a time or two myself, and it seems to me it takes a real man to admit when he\u2019s wrong.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep trying to tell Mom that,\u201d Annie insisted.</p><p>\u201cDid this ex-husband of yours drink too much?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t slap you around, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase skirts?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust the once.\u201d It was Annie who answered. \u201cAnd that was a big mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt always is,\u201d the waitress said. \u201cHalf the time men\u2019s brains are located below their belt buckles. Eventually they come to their senses but by then it\u2019s usually too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEunice.\u201d The cook stuck his head out of the kitchen. \u201cAre you fraternizing with the customers again?\u201d</p><p>Eunice rolled her eyes. \u201cIf I don\u2019t watch myself I\u2019m going to lose this job.\u201d She hurried toward the kitchen and put their order on a hanging circular device for the cook to grab.</p><p>\u201cWhat a sweetheart,\u201d Ruth murmured.</p><p>\u201cWise, too,\u201d Annie said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cI can tell Eunice has been around the block a couple of times and found her way home,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cI\u2019m leaving her an extra-big tip.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne felt embarrassed about having her personal situation aired in front of a stranger, no matter how sympathetic, and furious at her daughter and mother-in-law. And yet... She\u2019d begun to think they were right. Regardless of her infatuation with Max, she felt she had to give her ex-husband an honest chance. She had to give their relationship an honest chance, and she couldn\u2019t do that with Max hovering in the background.</p><p>Five minutes later, Eunice returned with their breakfast order. Lost in her thoughts, Bethanne sipped her latte. Thankfully, neither Annie nor Ruth appeared to notice how distracted she was.</p><p>When she saw Max the night before last, she\u2019d told him she\u2019d call after the wedding. But it wouldn\u2019t be fair to keep him waiting and guessing. The only decent thing to do was call him now and explain that she wouldn\u2019t be contacting him in the future.</p><p>Bethanne slid out of her booth and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d her daughter asked. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to make a phone call\u201d was all she was willing to tell either Annie or Ruth.</p><p>Standing in the parking lot, Bethanne took out her cell phone. Max had programmed in his number and she hit speed dial, knowing she was about to do something irrevocable. She felt regretful, but relieved, too. Closing her eyes, she leaned against the rental car and silently prayed he\u2019d answer.</p><p>He picked up on the third ring, but at the sound of his voice, she suddenly couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said again.</p><p>After a long moment, his voice softened. \u201cIs that you, Bethanne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be calling you.\u201d Then, because she owed him an explanation, she rushed to say, \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry, but I\u2019ve made my decision.\u201d</p><p>Her announcement was met with stark silence.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI heard you.\u201d Silence again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going back to Grant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour final decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d It was her final decision\u2014to give a new relationship with her ex-husband every opportunity to succeed. That didn\u2019t guarantee success, of course, but she could only go into this with an open heart. Without reservations. She couldn\u2019t have one eye on the exit as she and Grant tried out their new roles.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound convinced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am completely convinced that this is the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you call me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you waiting to hear from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you assume I was waiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were, weren\u2019t you?\u201d That was the way she remembered their discussion when they\u2019d parted in Vegas.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? You only left Vegas two days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant phoned and he\u2019s coming to Florida and...and I can\u2019t stop thinking about you and it\u2019s causing all kinds of problems.\u201d She hadn\u2019t intended to admit all that, but it slipped out. \u201cTo top everything, we went for breakfast and instead of ordering scrambled eggs, I ordered you.\u201d She could sense his smile. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about you, too. Kate would\u2019ve liked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this, Max. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even bother to pretend otherwise, which frustrated her. \u201cYou won\u2019t be hearing from me again,\u201d she said, trying to sound firm.</p><p>\u201cOkay. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>She felt like stamping her foot. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really going back to your ex-husband?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond for a moment. Then she said in a low voice, \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves me,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cAnd you love him,\u201d Max said. \u201cI understand that. But do you love him enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have children together, a twenty-year history as husband and wife. I already told you all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel. I can\u2019t deal with this,\u201d she whispered, and her voice cracked.</p><p>\u201cBethanne, listen,\u201d Max said, speaking softly now. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be decided this very minute. I thought we were going to connect after your son\u2019s wedding. It\u2019s in July, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuly 16.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have lots of time. We both do.\u201d</p><p>Despite what he\u2019d said about understanding, he really didn\u2019t. No one did. \u201cI want this over now. I can\u2019t be seriously considering getting back with Grant and dreaming about you. Why you? Oh, Max, why does it have to be you? Of all the men I\u2019ve dated in the past six years, none of them made me feel the way you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he whispered, his voice husky. \u201cNo one. Not ever. I loved Kate, adored her, but that was...different.\u201d</p><p>Neither spoke for what seemed like a long time. Then Bethanne saw Annie and Ruth walking out of the restaurant. \u201cI need to get off the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlbuquerque.\u201d Fearing he might try to find her, she added, \u201cDon\u2019t come. Please don\u2019t try to follow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>Annie was staring intently at her and so was Ruth. Rather than say anything more, Bethanne snapped her cell shut and dropped it in her purse.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Ruth asked.</p><p>Bethanne felt incredibly guilty and guessed she must look it, too. But she didn\u2019t respond. She had a right to her private conversations, dammit! Ironically, she\u2019d been trying to do something that should please them.</p><p>\u201cYou were talking to Max, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Annie said.</p><p>Not waiting for a reply, both women turned toward the parking lot. Bethanne went back inside the restaurant, to the ladies\u2019 room. Her nerves were a mess.</p><p>Instead of feeling better after talking to Max, she felt worse. She hadn\u2019t settled a thing. Quite the contrary; she\u2019d muddled her thoughts and emotions even more.</p><p>Washing her hands in the empty room, Bethanne looked at herself in the mirror and announced, \u201cI am my own woman. I will not let the dictates of my family influence my decisions.\u201d Then she dried her hands carefully with a paper towel and left the bathroom.</p><p>When she got to the car, Annie was in the driver\u2019s seat with Ruth in the back. Bethanne climbed into the front passenger seat and closed the door. She automatically reached for her knitting.</p><p>Without a word, Annie backed out of the parking space.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you that I\u2019m worried about you,\u201d Ruth said, leaning forward. She apparently felt obliged to impart her misgivings.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your concern, Ruth, but you don\u2019t need to worry. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Dad?\u201d Annie cried.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Bethanne asked. She continued to work the white cashmere wool, knitting faster than she\u2019d thought possible. Thankfully, the pattern wasn\u2019t so complicated that she had to study every row.</p><p>\u201cHe loves you! Doesn\u2019t that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does,\u201d Ruth answered for her. \u201cI think we should leave your mother alone. She\u2019s right. This is her decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can keep quiet,\u201d Annie said, completely ignoring the fact that Bethanne was sitting beside her and could hear every word.</p><p>\u201cYour mother wants to return to Grant on an even playing field,\u201d Ruth said stiffly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Bethanne asked, twisting around in her seat.</p><p>Ruth wouldn\u2019t look at her. \u201cIt means,\u201d she said, glancing at Annie, \u201cthat Bethanne wants to have an affair with this biker before she takes your father back. It\u2019s tit for tat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuth!\u201d Bethanne could hardly believe she\u2019d said that. \u201cHow can you even suggest such a thing?\u201d After all these years she\u2019d assumed her mother-in-law knew her better. \u201cIf it\u2019ll help either of you, I\u2019ll let you know that Max and I have done nothing more than kiss.\u201d She instantly regretted telling them even that much.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Annie said in the same voice she\u2019d used as a little girl when she wanted something important. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t bring up Max\u2019s name again if you\u2019ll do just one thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive Dad a chance. It isn\u2019t fair when Dad\u2019s in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>What do you think I\u2019m doing? she wanted to shout. This is all about giving him a chance.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like Max is trailing behind our car on his motorcycle,\u201d she said tartly.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t do anything foolish, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a foolish woman,\u201d she told her daughter.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t used to think so,\u201d Ruth muttered under her breath but loudly enough for Bethanne to hear.</p><p>\u201cI am not a foolish woman,\u201d Bethanne repeated, and then suddenly realized her purse wasn\u2019t within sight. \u201cDid either of you pick up my purse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I take your purse?\u201d Ruth asked.</p><p>Oh, my goodness. Bethanne remembered that she\u2019d left her purse in the restroom at the Albuquerque diner. \u201cAnnie,\u201d she said, trying not to panic. \u201cI left my purse at the restaurant.\u201d She\u2019d been upset and walked off without it.</p> <p>\u201cMom, we\u2019re on a freeway! I can\u2019t just turn around. I have to wait for the next exit.\u201d</p><p>Ruth leaned forward. \u201cNow, what were you saying about not being a foolish woman?\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to see the Alamo,\u201d Annie said once they were back on the road after collecting Bethanne\u2019s purse. Her forgetfulness had cost them over an hour.</p><p>\u201cI have a reservation in Branson for tomorrow night,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cRemember what happened the last time we went off course?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Grandma, Vegas was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore fun for some than others,\u201d Ruth said sharply.</p><p>Bethanne was getting used to the verbal darts and disregarded the comment.</p> <p>\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m looking forward to Branson,\u201d Ruth continued. \u201cMy friends tell me Andy Williams gives a terrific performance.\u201d</p><p>Annie glanced over at Bethanne. \u201cJust who is this Andy Williams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, Annie, he\u2019s one of the best singers ever,\u201d Ruth said enthusiastically. \u201cWell, in my opinion, anyway. He\u2019s like Perry Como, Frank Sinatra and Steve Lawrence all rolled into one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Perry or Steve, either, Grandma. Were they part of a group?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens, no! Bethanne, this girl needs a musical education.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne laughed, glad that good humor had been restored.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean we\u2019re going to bypass the Alamo?\u201d Annie asked, sounding disappointed.</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cThe next time your mother drives, I want you to get on that phone of yours and buy the three of us tickets for Andy Williams. This is something I don\u2019t want you girls to miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Grandma,\u201d Annie murmured, but she didn\u2019t sound happy about it.</p><p>Bethanne took over driving just outside Texas. Studying the map, she saw that their little venture to Las Vegas had taken them even farther off course than she\u2019d realized. Fortunately, Branson was in the southern part of Missouri.</p><p>Once Bethanne was behind the wheel, both Ruth and Annie took naps. She welcomed the silence because it gave her a chance to think. Each day on the road, she\u2019d chatted with Julia Hayden about the business and received an update. The company hardly needed her anymore; Julia was efficient and had good judgment.</p><p>She regretted the phone call to Max earlier that morning. At the time she\u2019d been serious\u2014clearing her mind of him was the only sensible option. What she\u2019d told him was true. She couldn\u2019t make a decision about Grant if all she could think about was Max. The best thing was to sever the tie quickly. Yet the moment she\u2019d heard Max\u2019s voice, Bethanne knew she couldn\u2019t do it, couldn\u2019t walk away as if he was nothing more than a Vegas fling.</p><p>Maybe she just needed to get him out of her system. Really, what could possibly come of a relationship with someone like Max? It wasn\u2019t as if she could climb on the back of his Harley and travel across the country without a care in the world. Bethanne had responsibilities, a thriving company. Max had taken a sabbatical from his wine distribution company but he\u2019d been away for three years. He hadn\u2019t said when he planned to return, if ever.</p><p>He rode from one end of the country to the other with no destination, stopping here or there on a whim. What kind of life was that? He\u2019d lost his wife and daughter. That was hard, grief was hard, but it\u2019d been three years and he gave no indication that he was ever going to relinquish this lifestyle. The thought of any long-term relationship with Max was irrational. Out of the question.</p><p>If Max was a tumbleweed, drifting with the wind, Grant was like a rock. Solid. Hardworking. A family man. Even if he\u2019d stumbled badly when he married Tiffany. For a short time, his world had revolved around the young woman and he\u2019d turned a blind eye to everything he\u2019d once considered a priority, including his own children.</p><p>But his infatuation with his new wife hadn\u2019t lasted long. Only a few months after they\u2019d married, there\u2019d been trouble in that relationship.</p><p>Bethanne knew nothing about Grant and Tiffany\u2019s divorce settlement, but she did know that Grant had paid dearly\u2014and not just financially. Soon after he left her he\u2019d been passed over for a huge promotion and changed companies as a result. She assumed he was doing well, since he never seemed to be strapped for money whenever the children needed it, although that wasn\u2019t often these days, other than their college expenses.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Annie said, straightening and rubbing her eyes. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re near Amarillo, Texas,\u201d Bethanne told her.</p><p>\u201cTexas? We can\u2019t be that far from the Alamo, then. It would just be a short side trip, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA short side trip like Vegas?\u201d Ruth said, obviously awake now. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of miles between Amarillo and San Antonio, and this time I\u2019m not giving in. We\u2019re going to Branson, and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Annie sighed. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t think the Alamo is that much out of our way.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne handed her daughter the map. \u201cYou might want to take a look to get an idea of how big Texas is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMo-om, I know my geography.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far is Amarillo from Branson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to MapQuest,\u201d Annie said a few minutes later, studying her phone, \u201cit\u2019s almost nine hours.\u201d She groaned with frustration.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to find a place for the night,\u201d Ruth said, arching her back. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to go stir-crazy in this car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should spend a couple of days in Branson,\u201d Bethanne suggested. \u201cShake off the road dust and let down our hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days.\u201d Annie flopped back in her seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always dreamed of seeing Andy Williams in concert,\u201d Ruth said wistfully. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s about to become a reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s always been my dream, too,\u201d Annie muttered sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cAnnie,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cThis is your grandmother\u2019s trip.\u201d Those words were a now-familiar refrain.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019ll have to wait until I\u2019m in my sixties before I see the Alamo?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne smothered a laugh. \u201cThen you\u2019ll appreciate it all the more, the same way your grandmother\u2019s looking forward to seeing her teenage idol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Annie slouched down in the seat. \u201cI wrote an essay on it, you know,\u201d she said righteously. \u201cI got an A.\u201d She closed her eyes, apparently picturing Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie making their last stand.</p><p>Just before they left the state of Texas, Bethanne stopped at a Dairy Queen for ice cream, which made for a small break. Several police and fire department vehicles were parked outside. Long ago Bethanne had read a comment that Dairy Queen restaurants were like city halls in Texas\u2014the one establishment where everyone convened.</p><p>For reasons she didn\u2019t even want to consider, she removed her cell from her purse and typed a text message to Max. She didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d receive it or if he\u2019d respond. All she said was:</p><p>Spending two nights in Branson, MO.</p><p>She hesitated before she pushed the send button, but sent it, anyway.</p><p>What was she doing? She felt like a first-time shoplifter certain to be caught. Regardless of all her assertions that what she did was her own business, she didn\u2019t want Ruth or Annie to know.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d Bethanne realized that, once again, she must look guilty. Why else would Annie question her? In fact, she felt guilty. She\u2019d resolved to reconcile with Grant, or at least try, and yet she\u2019d impulsively contacted Max....</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Annie nudged her. \u201cYour ice cream\u2019s melting all over your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looked down to discover that Annie was right. In the warm sun the soft-serve ice cream had melted and dripped down her wrist.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Ruth passed her a wad of napkins.</p><p>Bethanne licked away at the cone but soon realized it was a lost cause and tossed the entire mess into a nearby garbage can.</p><p>Back on the road with Ruth driving, Bethanne fidgeted, crossing and uncrossing her legs. She stared out the window and chewed on her fingertip. Even knitting didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Annie demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhy should anything be wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they stopped for the night that Bethanne had a chance to look for Max\u2019s reply, if there was one. Her eyes widened when she saw it. She held her breath. His response was simple:</p><p>I\u2019ll meet you there.</p><p>Snapping the cell phone closed, she held it against herself only to find both Ruth and Annie studying her curiously. She exhaled and carefully set her phone aside.</p><p>Annie leaped off the bed, stalked over to the dresser and grabbed Bethanne\u2019s cell. She opened it and frowned at the screen. \u201cMother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do now?\u201d Ruth asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s meeting Max in Branson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow listen,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cFirst of all, Annie, what you\u2019ve done is rude and it\u2019s an invasion of my privacy. Secondly, I make my own decisions and I\u2019m telling you right now, the more you pressure me into going back to Grant the more attractive Max looks. Unless I figure out how I feel about Max, I\u2019ll never be happy with Grant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ruth shrugged and got her book from her economy-size purse. \u201cWhat you decide is up to you. You\u2019re over twenty-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay over.\u201d Annie threw herself down on the bed.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Bethanne felt better for having spoken her mind, although she could have done without Annie\u2019s comment.</p><p>Her daughter plugged in the earbuds to her iPod and lay back, eyes closed.</p> <p>Bethanne took a long, hot shower, crawled into bed beside Annie and opened her book. She read late. Both Annie and Ruth were asleep by the time she turned off her light.</p><p>Although it was past midnight and they had every intention of getting an early start in the morning, Bethanne couldn\u2019t sleep. Whenever she closed her eyes, all she could see was Max. Not Grant. Max.</p><p>He planned to meet her in Branson. She didn\u2019t know where he was when he got her message. Apparently, close enough to Missouri to get to Branson by the following afternoon. She wondered if Rooster was traveling with him. She didn\u2019t like the thought of him on the road alone, although she understood that was often the case.</p><p>The next day when they arrived in Branson, the traffic was worse than Manhattan at rush hour. It took them forty-five minutes just to reach the hotel. Once they were in their room and unpacked, they went downstairs and ate a quick lunch in the hotel\u2019s coffee shop.</p><p>Ruth paid the tab and went to collect the show tickets Annie had ordered for her. While she was away from the table, Bethanne\u2019s cell phone rang. In her eagerness to answer, she dropped her purse and scrambled to retrieve it.</p> <p>\u201cIs that Max?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d she said as she bent down to get her cell from her bag. Caller ID revealed Grant\u2019s name. She pushed the button that would send him directly to voice mail. \u201cIt\u2019s your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will when I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather speak to Max?\u201d Annie sounded like a hurt little girl.</p><p>Bethanne put the cell beside her on the table. \u201cAnnie, please try to understand. I don\u2019t know what I find so attractive about Max. I wish I did. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m such a disappointment to you and your grandmother, but I need to do this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, Mom, have your fun. Dad and I will be waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>The call from Max came fifteen minutes later. She and Annie were just finishing their coffee.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, keenly aware that Annie was listening.</p><p>\u201cHi. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>She gave him the name of the hotel. \u201cI\u2019m not the most popular person at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you told Grandma and Annie I was meeting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to see me again,\u201d he commented, obviously amused.</p> <p>\u201cA sensitive man wouldn\u2019t remind me of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that tells you all you need to know about me.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne grinned but her smile faded when she saw Annie scowling at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you in the lobby in an hour,\u201d Max said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d She closed her phone and then looked at her daughter. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Annie asked, following Bethanne out of the hotel.</p><p>\u201cShopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Annie asked, hurrying to keep up with her. \u201cAnd shouldn\u2019t we invite Grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Give her a call.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne was on a mission. She had an hour to deck herself out in jeans, boots and a Western shirt. If she was going to be in Branson, she intended to look like she belonged here.</p><p>With Bethanne and Annie shopping, Ruth stayed in their hotel room alone. She\u2019d made her excuses and was grateful for this time by herself. She sat on the bed and fingered the paper Annie had given her. The paper on which her granddaughter had written down Royce\u2019s phone number. She hadn\u2019t decided what to do.</p><p>Thankfully, neither Bethanne nor Annie had pressured her about contacting him, although both seemed to think she should. Bethanne had said something that made a lot of sense. If she called Royce now, she wouldn\u2019t have that confrontation awaiting her when she arrived and she\u2019d be able to enjoy the rest of the trip.</p><p>Every mile that brought her closer to Florida, closer to Royce, increased her anxiety.</p><p>She needed to do this\u2014and she didn\u2019t want Bethanne and Annie hearing her conversation. Although she sort of wished someone was with her now to hold her hand, to encourage her and to offer comfort if it went badly. This was really difficult, so much more difficult than she\u2019d ever expected.</p><p>She took the hotel phone from the nightstand next to the bed, stretching the cord so she could set it beside her. She smoothed out the slip of paper, running her hand over it two or three times. Finally, she reached for the receiver, following the instructions in order to place a long-distance call.</p><p>A minute after that, the phone rang at the other end.</p><p>It rang again as she held her breath. Again.</p><p>Then Royce answered. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Despite all the years since they\u2019d spoken, she recognized his voice.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cRoyce?\u201d Somehow she managed to whisper his name.</p><p>\u201cYes? Who is this?\u201d</p><p>His own voice fell, and Ruth was fairly certain he already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ruth.\u201d The silence was terrible. \u201cI heard you planned to attend the class reunion,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I thought it was only fair that you know I\u2019ll be there, too. Actually, my daughter-in-law and granddaughter felt I should warn you.\u201d At first, she couldn\u2019t utter a word, and now she couldn\u2019t seem to shut up. \u201cWe\u2019re driving across the country.... We\u2019re in Branson and we\u2014 Oh, none of that\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>The silence on his end of the line returned and Ruth was convinced she\u2019d made a mistake.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather I didn\u2019t attend the reunion?\u201d he asked after another long moment.</p><p>\u201cOh, no...I mean, yes. I want you there. I\u2019d really hoped we\u2019d have a chance to talk first, though...if you agree.\u201d</p><p>More silence. Ruth couldn\u2019t stand the tension.</p><p>Eventually, he spoke. \u201cI think that would be a good idea. Call me when you get into town, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...I\u2019ll do that.\u201d Her hand squeezed the phone so hard, she thought her fingers might leave indentations.</p><p>\u201cRuth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you called.\u201d</p><p>The tension between her shoulders eased. \u201cI am, too.\u201d</p><p>She replaced the receiver, but her hand lingered on it for several minutes as she considered their short conversation. Already she felt better. Setting the phone back on the nightstand, she nearly collapsed against the pillows.</p><p>Annie\u2019s sour mood improved fast, which was due, no doubt, to some old-fashioned retail therapy. Bethanne made her purchases in record time. The two of them returned to the hotel room, their arms loaded with packages.</p><p>Ruth talked to Annie about their shopping excursion as Bethanne hurriedly changed into her new outfit, complete with red cowboy boots. If her friend Anne Marie Roche, the local bookstore owner, could own a pair, then she could, too.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d she asked her mother-in-law, twirling around and modeling her new clothes.</p><p>Ruth frowned. \u201cLike Dale Evans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale who?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Ruth got her purse. \u201cCome on, Annie, or we\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate? For what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe show. I told you I wanted both of you to see it, and your mother obviously isn\u2019t coming with me. I\u2019ve got three tickets, for heaven\u2019s sake. I have no intention of going alone.\u201d She frowned. \u201cMaybe I can scalp one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma!\u201d Annie rolled her eyes. \u201cUntil yesterday I didn\u2019t even know who this Andy person was.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t stick around to hear the rest of the conversation. She was out the door before either of them had time to protest. Entering the lobby, she looked around, disappointed to see that Max hadn\u2019t arrived yet. She found a vacant wingback chair by the fireplace, where she sat and waited\u2014but not for long. A few minutes later, the elevator doors slid open and Max and Rooster stepped out.</p><p>Max looked even better than she remembered. For a moment all Bethanne could do was stare. He didn\u2019t immediately see her, but when he did, a slow smile crossed his face.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, standing and walking toward him.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He met her halfway.</p><p>Bethanne held out her hands to him, and Max took her fingers in his.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ride all this way to hold hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m desperate for one of those hugs of yours.\u201d</p><p>She was equally desperate to give him one, knowing the kisses would come later. As they embraced, she closed her eyes. His arms felt so good around her, so right.</p><p>\u201cTwenty hours on the bike and all he wants is a hug?\u201d Rooster laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely something wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty hours?\u201d Bethanne asked, breaking away to study him.</p><p>\u201cWe took off the minute he got your message,\u201d Rooster elaborated.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m here now,\u201d Max said, glaring at his friend.</p><p>\u201cVegas,\u201d Rooster supplied.</p><p>\u201cOh, Max.\u201d She held her palms against his face, wanting more than anything to kiss him. She couldn\u2019t. Not here in the hotel lobby, but soon. Very soon.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d Annie said the minute she was in her assigned seat at the Moon River Theater. She didn\u2019t appreciate having to attend this show with her grandmother, especially since her mom got out of it. Fortunately, that meant the seat beside her wasn\u2019t occupied. \u201cIt\u2019s Annie,\u201d she said, leaning into the empty seat and doing her best to keep her voice down.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetheart. Did you get to Branson okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe made it fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d</p><p>Annie wouldn\u2019t have believed old people could make such a racket. The noise level was as high as a rock concert. Well, maybe not quite as high, but it was up there. She pressed one finger to her other ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sitting with Grandma, waiting for Andy Williams to come onstage, but I thought I should call you right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma dragged you with her to see Andy Williams?\u201d He sounded far too amused, in her opinion.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there, Dad. Grandma also got tickets for the Twelve Irish Tenors, and she expects me to go to that one, too.\u201d She leaned even farther into the empty seat so Grandma Hamlin wouldn\u2019t hear. This was ridiculous. If she wanted to listen to tenors, she\u2019d attend church services more often.</p><p>Her father laughed outright.</p><p>\u201cDad, this isn\u2019t funny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t nearly as apologetic as he should be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you made it safely to Branson,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks for the updates on your travels. Otherwise, I\u2019d be worried about the three of you on the road.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m calling,\u201d Annie said.

He\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Branson?\u201d</p><p>Although he couldn\u2019t see her, Annie nodded. \u201cShe sent him a text message sometime yesterday. I don\u2019t know when.\u201d On second thought, maybe she did. \u201cActually, I think it was while we were at a Dairy Queen in Texas. She started acting all weird.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have any idea what she said to Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that she\u2019d be in Branson for the next two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh, read it. And I read his reply. She got really mad at me. Max said he\u2019d meet her here.\u201d She felt even more like a tattletale but her father needed to know.</p><p>\u201cAnnie,\u201d her father said, his voice solemn. \u201cI appreciate you telling me this. However\u2014and this is important\u2014you have no right to be reading her private messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cBut Mom was there in the room. And she didn\u2019t do anything to stop me. Maybe she wanted me to see it,\u201d she said mutinously.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014Max is in Branson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas your mother seen him yet?\u201d</p><p>Her father obviously didn\u2019t understand the seriousness of the situation. \u201cDaddy, she\u2019s with him right this minute. Why else do you think I\u2019m the one with Grandma? Mom was supposed to go, too, but she and Max went off together and Grandma and I are at this...event. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone under thirty except for me.\u201d In Annie\u2019s opinion, this was above and beyond her duty as a granddaughter.</p><p>\u201cWhere did they go?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>It took Annie a moment to catch up with the conversation and realize he was asking about her mother and Max. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Her father went quiet again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all, either.\u201d Annie felt a bit childish, but she couldn\u2019t stop herself.</p><p>Grant sighed. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s run off and married him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019d never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and I went shopping, and she got a whole new outfit and red cowboy boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Anne Marie Roche has a pair. She\u2019s the lady who owns the bookstore on Blossom Street, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have red boots got to do with anything?\u201d He seemed confused.</p><p>\u201cNothing, I suppose, except that Mom always admired Anne Marie\u2019s, and when she saw a red pair she decided to get them for herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like your mother\u2019s become a...free spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s worse than that. All she thinks about is this biker. Yesterday morning at breakfast she\u2014\u201d Annie wished she hadn\u2019t said anything now. \u201cNever mind. The thing is, Dad, Mom isn\u2019t acting like herself. Grandma and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love your mother,\u201d Grant said after a long pause.</p><p>\u201cI know you do, and I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s actually falling for this...this biker. As far as I can tell, he doesn\u2019t have a job. I can\u2019t believe it...I really can\u2019t. My mother and a biker?\u201d Saying the words aloud made it seem even more unlikely. \u201cMaybe she is falling in love.\u201d Her father sounded sad, but not as disturbed as Annie had thought he\u2019d be.</p><p>\u201cThen we need to do something.\u201d Annie hoped her father had an idea because she didn\u2019t. Acting upset and giving her mother the silent treatment hadn\u2019t kept Bethanne away from Max. In fact, it seemed the harder Annie tried, the less effective her methods. Grandma disapproved, too, and that hadn\u2019t influenced her, either. She seemed bent on being with Max. Bent on throwing away the past and destroying the future. It wasn\u2019t that Annie didn\u2019t understand that sometimes divorce was the best option, but this one should never have happened. Her parents belonged together. Andrew called her arrogant for saying that; however, Annie didn\u2019t care. She was absolutely convinced she was right.</p><p>\u201cAnnie, listen to me, and when we finish speaking, let me talk to your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m listening.\u201d Annie pressed her cell even harder against her ear and held her finger against the other ear. She closed her eyes because that helped her concentrate.</p><p>\u201cI hurt Bethanne badly. I betrayed her and the vows of our marriage. I realize now what a huge mistake I made. I\u2019m praying it\u2019s not too late and that there\u2019s something left of our relationship to salvage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that, too, Daddy, more than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does Grandma.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention Andrew. Her brother wasn\u2019t willing to forgive and forget as easily as the rest of them. Annie got frustrated with him but Andrew had apparently divested himself of all feelings for their father. Their relationship was as minimal as he could make it. Well, her brother had an excuse. He had other things on his mind, like getting married. Still, she hoped his attitude would change with time.</p><p>Annie knew Andrew and their mom were close, the same way she was with their dad. Her brother was quick to defend their mother and blame their father. But Dad recognized that he\u2019d been in the wrong, and in her opinion Andrew should take that into consideration.</p><p>\u201cI gather my mother isn\u2019t a fan of Max\u2019s, either,\u201d her father continued.</p><p>\u201cDad, if you met him you\u2019d wonder what Mom ever saw in him. He\u2019s...he looks just like a stereotypical biker.\u201d Okay, maybe he was attractive for an older guy, but muscles and lean good looks weren\u2019t everything.</p><p>\u201cI understand your mother. We weren\u2019t married all those years without me knowing her....\u201d</p><p>Annie couldn\u2019t figure out why her father wasn\u2019t more upset. \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re happy Mom\u2019s chasing after him.\u201d That was a slight exaggeration. But she\u2019d expected him to react more strongly to this latest update.</p><p>\u201cI started to tell you, Annie, I hurt your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and she knows that, too, better than anyone. But it\u2019s different now. You\u2019re back and the lovely Tiffany is out of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank God, but this isn\u2019t about Tiffany or me. It\u2019s about your mother and Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a plan.\u201d Annie should\u2019ve guessed her father wouldn\u2019t stand idly by and let some other man step into the place he belonged. \u201cYou\u2019re flying into Branson, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Annie echoed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s well aware of how I feel. If I could go back six years, trust me, I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy.\u201d Annie, too, would give anything to turn back time.</p><p>\u201cYour mother and you and Andrew are my whole world and I was stupid enough to leave you. I\u2019ve paid the price for being such an idiot, but I might still lose your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you and Mom to get back together,\u201d Annie said fervently.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, Annie, it might be too late.\u201d His voice was bleak, as if he\u2019d already given up. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then all I can do is accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccept it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any choice but to abide by your mother\u2019s wishes. I\u2019ll always love her, always. Even when I was married to Tiffany I loved your mother. I might not have shown my love the way I should have, but my feelings for her never went away. Tiffany sensed that, I think. My family was an issue between us from the beginning, which is why she tried so hard to keep us apart.\u201d</p><p>Annie felt her throat thicken. She didn\u2019t like to remember how it had been when her father left them. Those were dark days for all of them. Her brother was the one who\u2019d held the three of them together those first few weeks. Meeting Courtney had helped him, and that was good, but at the time she\u2019d had no one. Her mother was a basket case and Annie had floundered badly.</p><p>\u201cMom said that when I get upset about her seeing Max, that only makes him more appealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d her father agreed. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember that plaque she has up in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plaque,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThe one about setting a bird free?\u201d That ceramic wall hanging had been in the kitchen for years, and while she\u2019d seen it practically every day of her life, she didn\u2019t remember the exact words. What it meant was that if someone was meant to return they would of their own accord.</p><p>\u201cAnnie, listen. You and I need to set your mother free. Let her enjoy her time with Max. Let\u2019s both give her that. I\u2019ll meet you in Florida in a few days and we\u2019ll see how things go. Until then, leave your mother alone. Tell your grandmother to do the same. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love your mother enough to want her happiness. If she finds that with Max, then all I can do is step aside.\u201d</p><p>Annie wanted to argue\u2014but she couldn\u2019t. Her father was wise. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. Bethanne would choose for herself; that was her privilege and her responsibility. Annie just hoped she made the choice they wanted her to make.</p><p>\u201cNow let me talk to your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Annie straightened and tapped her grandmother on the arm. \u201cGrandma, it\u2019s my dad. He wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Ruth looked concerned. \u201cDid you tell him about you know who?\u201d she asked in a loud whisper.</p><p>Annie nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s cool with it.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother widened her eyes as she took the cell. \u201cHello,\u201d she said.</p><p>Annie listened hard but she could only make out bits and pieces of the conversation. Apparently, her father said the same thing to Ruth that he\u2019d said to Annie, because her grandmother shook her head as if she had trouble accepting his advice.</p><p>After a few minutes she handed the phone back to Annie. \u201cHe wants us to let your mother have her fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a smart decision.\u201d</p><p>Annie was inclined to abide by her father\u2019s judgment. \u201cHe says he\u2019ll be in Florida next week and we should be patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves your mother.\u201d</p><p>Annie nodded. Until then, she\u2019d never realized how much.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Bethanne and Max sat on the hotel porch on an old-fashioned bench swing. They\u2019d gone to dinner with Rooster. As soon as they\u2019d finished the meal, Rooster excused himself and went inside the hotel, insisting he was on his way to bed.</p><p>\u201cYou must be exhausted,\u201d Bethanne said as they gently swayed. Max sat with his arm around her shoulders and her fingers tangled with his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not so tired I can\u2019t appreciate time with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to bed, too,\u201d she suggested. \u201cWe have all day tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said through a yawn.</p><p>Bethanne was just as glad. She rested her head against his shoulder. \u201cEven though we\u2019ve talked about a lot of things, I know almost nothing about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about myself,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to ask?\u201d</p><p>Of all the questions that buzzed around in her head, she asked one of the least important. \u201cHow long have you and Rooster been friends?\u201d</p><p>Max blinked, and Bethanne saw that he was struggling to stay alert. \u201cFor most of my life. He\u2019s my brother\u2019s age and we were neighbors growing up. You know we also have a business connection\u2014he handles our advertising.\u201d</p> <p>Bethanne nodded. \u201cIs he married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, he was at one time but it didn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s currently between...well, I hesitate to say girlfriends. Companions might be the better word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe only joins you on the road part of the time, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. A month every summer, and sometimes a few weeks in the spring and fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, Rooster or me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA brother. Luke\u2019s ten years older. He\u2019s taken over the business since I\u2019ve been away. His kids are raised and he travels to Australia and New Zealand every chance he gets. We connect three or four times a year when I\u2019m in California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your parents alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey died a year apart back in the late nineties.\u201d</p><p>She already knew his only daughter had died at a young age.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to Seattle?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOnce. Rooster and I took a ride around the Kitsap Peninsula and into the rain forest a couple of summers ago. It\u2019s beautiful country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still in the same house where you and Grant used to live?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Bethanne found it a curious question. \u201cYes. It\u2019s the only home our children had ever known. There was enough upheaval in their lives without me pulling that rug out from under them, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever considered moving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That was the truth. She loved her home and had no intention of leaving.</p><p>\u201cAnything else you want to know about me?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a home?\u201d</p><p>She felt his smile against her hair. \u201cI don\u2019t need one. Wherever I am, that\u2019s home. However, I own a house in California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you visit often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends other than Rooster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few here and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean money? My needs are simple. I don\u2019t require much, don\u2019t want much.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne had guessed they had little in common, but that didn\u2019t dissuade her. The attraction she felt for him was as strong as ever. Stronger. He\u2019d ridden twenty hours to see her. Even now, he was so exhausted he could barely keep his eyes open and yet he wanted to stay up so he could be with her. She couldn\u2019t imagine Grant being content to sit on a porch swing like this.</p><p>Oh, that wasn\u2019t fair. She couldn\u2019t compare them. They were as different as any two men\u2014any two people\u2014she\u2019d ever met. Grant would always be ambitious, driven to succeed. She knew that when she\u2019d married him.</p><p>Max didn\u2019t seem to care about financial or career success, not anymore. And she could tell it had never been the be-all and end-all for him.</p><p>She instinctively recognized that he was a man who loved completely. Grant\u2014well, he\u2019d claimed to, but he\u2019d deviated from his love, his vows, without caring how that affected her or their children.</p><p>After several minutes of silence, he said, \u201cI know from what you told me that you had to find your way back to God after Grant left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It\u2019d been a small epiphany for her.</p><p>\u201cYou helped me see that I needed to do the same thing\u2014make peace with Him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been at odds ever since I lost Katherine. My daughter lived longer than any of her doctors expected. It was bad enough losing her, but then Kate...\u201d He hesitated. \u201cLosing my wife was too much, and frankly I\u2019ve ignored anything spiritual ever since. Then, at a time when I least expected it, you plowed your way into my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlowed?\u201d She raised her eyebrows. \u201cPlowed?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOkay, you appeared in my life. And for the first time since I buried Kate, I could feel. I could breathe without pain. I could face the future. I have to say it felt damn good and then...you were gone.\u201d</p><p>She tightened her hand around his, unsure what to say.</p><p>\u201cI had a choice,\u201d Max went on. \u201cI could get angry all over again or I could be thankful that you came when you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI chose to be thankful. Don\u2019t get me wrong, God and I aren\u2019t back on speaking terms but I\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Max.\u201d Not caring who saw them, she turned her head so their lips could meet. Early in their relationship, Grant had always been the romantic one. He\u2019d written her poems and sent her flowers on the flimsiest of excuses. And yet no one, not even Grant, had said anything more beautiful to her than this.</p><p>\u201cWhatever happens, whatever you decide\u2014\u201d he continued, after breaking off the kiss. He paused, then kissed her again. \u201c\u2014I\u2019ll accept it with gratitude.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne felt as if she might weep.</p><p>Max kissed the top of her head. \u201cThis probably isn\u2019t a good time for us to talk about serious matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too tired to filter what I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I could ever love again after I lost Kate. You\u2019ve shown me it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, savoring his words, and snuggled closer. \u201cI know what you mean. I thought it would be impossible to feel this way after Grant left me. I was sure I\u2019d never be able to trust another man, let alone give him my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you give me your heart, Bethanne?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it scares me to death.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIt does me, too.\u201d He kissed the side of her neck and his lips against her skin felt like a mild electric shock.</p><p>\u201cI...think it might be best if we both went to our rooms. You\u2019re tired, and I need time to sort all this out in my head.\u201d</p><p>Walking hand in hand, they approached the elevator. Once inside\u2014fortunately they were alone\u2014Max punched their floor numbers. As soon as the door closed, he drew her into his arms and kissed her. The kiss was hot and urgent, and when he released her they were both breathless. His gaze held hers and she smiled at him.</p><p>He hugged her again and Bethanne stepped into the hallway that led to her room. Her mother-in-law and daughter were still out, to Bethanne\u2019s rather guilty relief.</p><p>She undressed and climbed into bed and sat there, mulling over the conversation with Max.</p><p>After Grant moved out, Bethanne had dated Tiffany\u2019s ex-husband. Paul was much younger. They\u2019d bonded over the trauma of having loved an unfaithful spouse. Paul had since remarried and recently had a baby son. She was happy for him.</p><p>After Paul, Bethanne had dated off and on. Nothing had come of those relationships. And now she\u2019d met Max... It seemed as though she\u2019d been waiting for him all these years. Why now? Falling in love couldn\u2019t have come at a more inconvenient time.</p><p>Bethanne was still sitting up in bed, staring blankly at the wall, at about ten, when the door opened and the other two came in. Both were surprised to find her in the room.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were with Max,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>\u201cI was. We had dinner and then he went up to his room.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention that he\u2019d spent twenty hours on his bike, riding through four states in order to meet her.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a disagreement?\u201d Ruth asked, sounding hopeful.</p><p>\u201cNo. He was tired and so was I.\u201d Preferring not to discuss Max, she asked, \u201cHow was the show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncredible,\u201d Ruth said on the end of a dreamy sigh. \u201cI could fall in love with Andy Williams all over again. Oh, my, that boy can sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hardly a boy, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it as dreadful as you feared?\u201d Bethanne asked her daughter.</p><p>Annie set her purse on the dresser. \u201cYou know, it wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you.\u201d Ruth couldn\u2019t keep from chortling.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t someone I\u2019d purposely see again,\u201d Annie added, \u201cbut I have to admit he does have a decent singing voice. Even at his age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the songs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were all right.\u201d Annie shrugged as if to say she could take them or leave them.</p><p>\u201cAll right?\u201d Ruth muttered. \u201c\u2018Moon River\u2019 is all right? It\u2019s brilliant!\u201d After a moment she started to undress for bed.</p><p>Annie sat beside Bethanne, then tucked her feet up and rested her chin on her bent knees. \u201cDad and I had a long talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d No doubt she and Max were the main topic of that conversation.</p><p>\u201cI told Dad how strange you\u2019ve been acting.\u201d She grinned as she said it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he had a lot to say.\u201d Bethanne let the acting-strange comment go unchallenged.</p><p>\u201cI told Grant he should be more concerned than he is, but I\u2019m afraid my son gave up listening to my advice a long time ago,\u201d Ruth said as she smoothed hand lotion over her upper arms and vigorously rubbed it in.</p><p>\u201cDad said we should leave you and Max alone,\u201d Annie astonished her by saying.</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d That hardly sounded like the Grant she remembered.</p><p>\u201cYes. I know he\u2019s right.\u201d She looked steadily at Bethanne. \u201cHe also said he might\u2019ve already lost you, and if so, it\u2019s what he deserved.\u201d</p><p>Grant said that?</p><p>\u201cDad told me you\u2019d have to make up your own mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I think my son has lost his,\u201d Ruth murmured as she capped the lotion. \u201cThe least he could do is show a little gumption and fight for you.\u201d</p><p>Unable to resist, Bethanne smiled. Ruth made it sound like the two men should choose their weapons and face off at dawn.</p><p>\u201cThis is Grant\u2019s business and yours,\u201d Ruth went on. \u201cSo I\u2019ll butt out. Besides, I have news.\u201d</p><p>Annie bounced on the bed. \u201cYou called Royce!\u201d</p><p>As though embarrassed, Ruth lowered her head and nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier, when you were shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Again it was Annie who asked, leaning forward in her enthusiasm to hear. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he was glad you called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so...I think he even recognized my voice. I certainly recognized his. It hasn\u2019t changed a bit. He sounded the same as he did at eighteen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow did the conversation go?\u201d Bethanne didn\u2019t want to appear too eager, but judging by the look on Ruth\u2019s face, she already had her answer.</p><p>\u201cWe agreed to meet before the reunion to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ruth, that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Bethanne was pleased for her and grateful that the conversation had gone well. She\u2019d wondered if Ruth would find the courage to contact Royce\u2014and hoped she would.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Jane, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs everyone excited about the reunion?\u201d Annie sank back against the pillow and yawned.</p><p>\u201cYes, and everything seems to be coming together nicely,\u201d Ruth said, her eyes bright. \u201cJane told me they have the high school gym for the dinner and dance, just the way we did for the senior prom. She heard from Jim Maxwell and Alice Coan. They\u2019ve been married for fifty years now, so it\u2019s a double celebration for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember your senior prom?\u201d Annie said, studying her grandmother.</p><p>Ruth laughed. \u201cI doubt I\u2019ll ever forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you with Royce?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said dreamily.</p><p>\u201cIt must\u2019ve been so romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d Ruth shook her head. \u201cActually, it was one of the worst nights of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma, how can you say that? What happened?\u201d</p><p>Ruth pulled down the covers and sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell us,\u201d Bethanne urged.</p> <p>\u201cWell...I might have mentioned that Royce\u2019s parents didn\u2019t have a lot of money. The Jamesons sold everything they owned for the opportunity to purchase an orange grove. Unfortunately, for the first couple of years the crops didn\u2019t meet their expectations. Royce worked with his brothers and parents, but there never seemed to be enough money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid purchasing the grove pay off over time?\u201d Bethanne asked. She hated the thought of that kind of effort going unrewarded.</p><p>\u201cI believe so, but not while Royce was living at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened at the prom?\u201d Annie asked again.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, our senior prom.\u201d Ruth smiled as she said it. \u201cRoyce asked me, and naturally I said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Annie echoed.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t afford to buy me a corsage for the dance, so his mother did her best to make me one from orange blossoms, but it just wouldn\u2019t stay together. Not wanting to offend her, Royce took the corsage she\u2019d made but when it fell apart he bought me a plastic rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe bought you a plastic rose for the prom?\u201d Annie sounded incredulous.</p> <p>\u201cAnnie,\u201d Bethanne said, \u201cthat was all he could afford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he wear a tux?\u201d her daughter asked, despite Bethanne\u2019s caution.</p><p>\u201cA tux?\u201d Ruth repeated. \u201cMy heavens, no. He had on his Sunday best, but it wouldn\u2019t have mattered to me if he\u2019d been in his coveralls. He was still the handsomest boy in his class.\u201d</p><p>Annie stared at her, clearly fascinated by this glimpse into a life so different from her own.</p><p>\u201cHe picked me up in this vehicle they used in the groves. It didn\u2019t have a top, although it might have at one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Annie gasped. \u201cCan this get any worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. It rained on our way to the prom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, and until you see rain in Florida, you haven\u2019t seen rain. The drizzle we get in the Pacific Northwest can\u2019t compare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were in your prom dress?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWith my hair all done up and my new chiffon dress. I arrived at the prom looking like something that had crawled out of the Everglades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyce felt terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poor boy,\u201d Bethanne said, picturing the nightmarish scene. She couldn\u2019t imagine anything else going wrong.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet Royce was wonderful about everything. He wiped the streaming mascara from my face and kissed away my tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have been drenched, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for sure, but he didn\u2019t care about himself. All he wanted was to make the night special for me, and he\u2019d tried so hard.\u201d She smiled wryly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t end up going to the prom, of course. He took me home and went back to his own place to change, then we spent the rest of the evening watching TV.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne hadn\u2019t met Royce yet, but she liked him already.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s changed much over the years?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about him,\u201d Ruth said, \u201cbut I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all change,\u201d Annie said, sounding mature. \u201cBecause of the things that happen to us.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne nodded. She\u2019d changed since Grant had left their marriage. Changed in many ways, some of which she was only beginning to understand.</p><p>Soon afterward they turned off the light. It wasn\u2019t long before Ruth\u2019s steady breathing told Bethanne her mother-in-law was asleep.</p><p>Annie lay on her back, then shifted onto one side; she seemed unable to find a comfortable position. Something was bothering her and Bethanne guessed it was directly related to Vance.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Vance lately?\u201d Bethanne whispered. Annie had mentioned him only once since he\u2019d left for his European adventure.</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d Annie muttered, and bunched up her pillow with unnecessary force.</p><p>\u201cHow do you sort of hear from someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sent me a text, which I ignored, and then he emailed me, but I haven\u2019t answered that, either,\u201d she said. \u201cHe told me he arrived safely and that he\u2019s having a wonderful time. Well, good for him. He doesn\u2019t need to rub it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re having a good time, too,\u201d Bethanne reminded her. \u201cAnd you met Jason in Vegas, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d The word was full of enlightenment. \u201cI should let him know I\u2019m not sitting at home pining after him.\u201d She scrabbled for her cell phone on the nightstand, and although the room was dark, immediately started scrolling down her emails.</p><p>Annie paused and sent Bethanne a look of deep satisfaction. \u201cThere\u2019s another email from Vance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? What did he say now?\u201d Bethanne raised herself up on one elbow.</p><p>Annie seemed inordinately pleased. \u201cThat he\u2019s miserable, homesick and sorry he ever left Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does that make you feel?\u201d Bethanne asked.</p><p>Annie\u2019s returning smile was answer enough.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Grant Hamlin sat in his recliner and stared at the television. If anyone had asked him about the program, he couldn\u2019t have said what he was watching. All he could think about was Bethanne.</p><p>He was losing her.</p><p>Even now, he couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d told their daughter to leave Bethanne to her own devices, to let her reach her own conclusions. He\u2019d said what he knew he had to say, as a parent and as a man who loved his ex-wife. But the words left him feeling ill. Yes, he wanted Bethanne to make the choice that was right for her\u2014but he wanted that choice to be him.</p><p>What he\u2019d told Annie was true. He loved Bethanne. Tiffany had come between them, but he\u2019d let her do that. He took complete responsibility for his mistake. He hadn\u2019t started out looking for an affair but he\u2019d obviously been open to one. Tiffany had seemed vibrant, exciting, ambitious, and Bethanne, by comparison, had been...dull, mired in the tedium of domestic life. It appalled him that he\u2019d been so blind, so selfish. He\u2019d lost interest in their love life, too. Still, the affair had begun innocently enough. An office lunch that lasted nearly two hours. A simple kiss at a Christmas party. By Valentine\u2019s Day, they were meeting in hotel rooms and Grant had the sexual stamina of a teenager. Perhaps not surprisingly, that changed shortly after they were married.</p><p>In retrospect, he knew it was unconscionable that he\u2019d abandoned his family; walked away without a qualm or a doubt. And yet, he\u2019d done exactly that.</p><p>At the time Grant had convinced himself he was lucky to escape when he did. He\u2019d told himself that because Andrew was about to graduate from high school and Annie would join her brother in college the following year, neither child needed him any longer. How wrong he\u2019d been to underestimate his children\u2019s need for their father.</p><p>Grant rubbed the back of his neck. He\u2019d quickly recognized his mistake in marrying Tiffany. And to compound the humiliation, she\u2019d decided he\u2019d been a mistake\u2014too old, not successful enough, not as sexually adventurous as she wanted. The end of their marriage hadn\u2019t come soon enough. After Tiffany moved out\u2014oh, what a godsend\u2014he\u2019d been too embarrassed to approach Bethanne.</p><p>By then she\u2019d started her business and it had taken off. Watching from the sidelines, he\u2019d been impressed and astonished by how well she\u2019d done.</p><p>In the past couple of years, Grant had eased his way, carefully, cautiously, back into his family\u2019s life. Annie had accepted him without question. Andrew was a different story. His son wasn\u2019t as willing to put the past behind them. Eventually, Grant hoped, Andrew would see that he was genuinely contrite and trust him again.</p><p>At least Andrew wasn\u2019t openly antagonistic. He remained cool and withdrawn. Grant didn\u2019t blame his son for being wary; it was what he deserved and he knew it. Andrew was his mother\u2019s son for sure.</p><p>Thinking about him, Grant went into his small office in the sparsely decorated condo and reached for the phone. He checked his watch. It wasn\u2019t quite nine. A bit late, but not too late to call Andrew. He had to look up the number\u2014a sad commentary all on its own.</p><p>Andrew answered as if he\u2019d been holding his cell. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything wrong with Mom or Annie?\u201d Andrew asked immediately. \u201cOr Grandma?\u201d</p><p>It hurt that Andrew assumed a phone call from Grant could only mean an emergency. \u201cNo. They\u2019re in Branson, Missouri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast I heard they were in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they arrived in Missouri this afternoon. Your grandmother took Annie to see Andy Williams.\u201d</p><p>Andrew snickered. \u201cI bet she loved that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d He inhaled softly. \u201cListen, has anyone said anything to you about those bikers they met along the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax and Rooster?\u201d</p><p>He was shocked that his son knew their names. \u201cWhat have you heard?\u201d He felt guilty pumping Andrew for information. But what else could he do? He\u2019d advised Annie not to spy on her mother or try to influence her. That nobility was costing him now. He felt at a real disadvantage, being miles away while this Max character was right there on the scene.</p><p>\u201cMom called a couple of days ago and told me about the car breaking down and how these bikers stopped to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you know their names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom told me.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t exactly free with his information. \u201cDid she mention that she met Max and Rooster in Vegas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you worried, Dad?\u201d</p><p>Grant frowned. His son sounded pleased, almost gleeful, that Grant was concerned. \u201cYes, I guess I am,\u201d he said honestly. \u201cI haven\u2019t made a secret of the fact that I\u2019m hoping to get back with your mother.\u201d He paused, hoping his son would offer him a word of encouragement.</p><p>\u201cMom said something about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny advice you\u2019d care to give me?\u201d Grant asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot really. Mom\u2019s done well for herself.\u201d</p><p>As if he didn\u2019t know. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what she\u2019s accomplished,\u201d he said.</p><p>Andrew didn\u2019t appear to have anything to add.</p><p>\u201cIs there some way I can help with the wedding?\u201d His son hadn\u2019t asked a single thing of him from the moment Grant walked out of the house. Andrew hadn\u2019t even invited him to attend his high school graduation. Bethanne was the one who\u2019d let Grant know the time of the ceremony. His son\u2019s graduation from college hadn\u2019t been much different. Annie had hand-delivered the invitation; Grant suspected that had she not done so, he wouldn\u2019t have been included. Bethanne was kind enough to invite Grant to the party she threw afterward. He felt out of place and miserable in the home he\u2019d once shared with his family. Former friends seemed to avoid him. He did his best to socialize, but the situation was painfully awkward. Rather than ruin the day for Andrew or Bethanne, Grant had quietly slipped away.</p><p>That afternoon had been pivotal for Grant. It was then that he\u2019d realized how badly he missed being part of the family. His family. He felt like an outsider and, with his son, an outcast.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything, Dad, but thanks for offering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about money?\u201d He\u2019d never known a kid to turn down financial help.</p><p>\u201cThanks, no. Courtney and I have it covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to do what I can,\u201d Grant rushed to say, feeling the pain of his son\u2019s rejection. \u201cAnything you ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Dad, I think you\u2019ve done enough.\u201d</p><p>The words stung and Grant was forced to swallow a retort.</p> <p>They chatted a bit longer and then Grant disconnected. If anything, he felt worse than he did before he\u2019d phoned.</p><p>Disheartened, Grant returned to his recliner and the TV. He had a lot of ground to recover with Andrew. His son wanted vindication, and the sad part was, Grant knew he was entitled to feel that way. Like his mother, Andrew was intensely loyal.</p><p>Leaning forward, Grant pressed his head into his hands. He wanted his family back and he wasn\u2019t sure how he was going to make that happen. All he could do, he figured, was show them, by whatever means possible, that he loved them and longed to be with them again.</p><p>If only Bethanne...</p><p>...Bethanne. Max couldn\u2019t get the image of her out of his mind. It used to be that he\u2019d close his eyes and Kate\u2019s face would flash before him. For three years she\u2019d been foremost in his thoughts.</p><p>The police had never determined whether the car accident was suicide or simply an error in judgment. Max knew. Kate, distraught over the death of their daughter, had fallen into a deep, lingering depression. She\u2019d chosen to take her own life. He didn\u2019t know if he could ever accept that. He\u2019d lost so much\u2014his daughter, his wife...his reason for living.</p><p>The shock of her death had numbed him for the first few weeks. Then came the anger. Didn\u2019t she understand what her death would do to him? She\u2019d deserted him, left him desolate and alone. The anger had been all-consuming. He couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t eat. More than once he\u2019d driven to the cemetery and raged at her.</p><p>Then his anger had been joined by guilt. A guilt so intense he couldn\u2019t function anymore. For days he\u2019d stayed home, staring at the wall, unable to cope with even the most mundane tasks. He should\u2019ve known Kate would do something like this. The signs had been there. Because he\u2019d buried his own grief over the loss of their daughter in his work, he hadn\u2019t recognized those signs until it was too late. He should\u2019ve gotten Kate the help she needed. He should have demanded she see a counselor, that they both see one. Nightmares had plagued him. He\u2019d ignored what should have been obvious, convinced everything would get better with time.</p> <p>But it hadn\u2019t. It\u2019d gotten worse. Much worse.</p><p>After months of being unable to function, of drinking too much and taking stupid risks, Max talked to his brother and asked for some time away. Originally, he\u2019d thought all he\u2019d need was three months, six at the most. But once he was on the road he found peace. Rooster, his lifelong friend, had come with him. They\u2019d ridden bikes since Max was in his teens. Rooster had provided companionship when he\u2019d needed it most. He hadn\u2019t tried to tell Max how he should feel but was there to listen when he wanted to talk. Best of all, life on the road was simple. Even though he moved from place to place, there was a predictability that calmed him and, surprisingly, friendships that gave him purpose. This solace was still shaky but at least he was able to sleep. At least the nightmares had stopped. Everything was going smoothly until this summer.</p><p>When he met Bethanne.</p><p>Now she was all he could think about. An hour after he\u2019d returned to his room he still couldn\u2019t sleep. He\u2019d ridden more than twenty hours with only short breaks for the opportunity to be with her again. It was a testament to Rooster\u2019s friendship that he\u2019d traveled with him. Both Willie and Skunk had taken off, which was fine with him. Max had met them along the way. They\u2019d traveled together for a week or so and they might meet up again sometime. If not, it wouldn\u2019t bother him.</p><p>Rooster seemed to enjoy watching him make a fool of himself over a woman. Max closed his eyes. Some nights he talked to Kate, relaying details of where he was and the people he\u2019d met on the road. The people he\u2019d helped or tried to help. He did that whenever he could. It was a penance of sorts, he supposed, for having failed his wife. These friendships, most of them brief, allowed him to make up for what he hadn\u2019t done. They silenced the accusations inside his head.</p><p>Instinctively, he knew Kate would have approved of Bethanne. He liked to think she\u2019d approve of the fact that he was getting involved with life again.</p><p>Max didn\u2019t know what it was about Bethanne that appealed to him so strongly. He\u2019d met other attractive women, but none had stirred him the way she did.</p><p>He\u2019d been faithful to Kate from the moment they\u2019d met and he\u2019d been faithful since her death, too. Like Bethanne, he wasn\u2019t the type to fall in and out of bed, driven by hormones and the need for sexual satisfaction.</p><p>He\u2019d sensed Bethanne was someone worth knowing the first time he\u2019d laid eyes on her in that caf\u00e9 near Pendleton, Oregon. They\u2019d looked at each other when he placed his order and he\u2019d experienced a strong physical reaction. Almost a feeling of recognition. He wasn\u2019t sure what else to call it. There was attraction, of course, but it was more than that.</p><p>She must\u2019ve felt it, too, because when they met again at the lake, she told him she\u2019d thought about him that night. The way she\u2019d touched his hand... It was as if she\u2019d identified the pain he carried inside and somehow known how to ease it. He usually tried to avoid being touched but with Bethanne it was different.</p><p>Yes, this woman belonged in his arms. In his life. He knew it then. He knew it now.</p><p>Apparently, he fell asleep soon after he\u2019d decided that. What seemed like minutes later, Rooster was knocking at his door, waking him. Max had no idea how it could be morning already, but the clock radio in his room confirmed that it was. He staggered to the door and unlatched it to let him in.</p><p>Rooster had showered, shaved around his neatly trimmed white beard and changed clothes. \u201cYou look like hell,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>Max grumbled some meaningless reply and went into the bathroom. By the time he\u2019d finished, Rooster had coffee brewing in the small pot provided by the hotel.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you and Bethanne up to today?\u201d he asked, making himself at home in the room\u2019s only chair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d They hadn\u2019t made plans to meet in the morning, although it was understood that they would. Maybe he\u2019d take her to Al and Susie\u2019s place, which wasn\u2019t far away. When he\u2019d learned Bethanne was in Branson, he\u2019d called them.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you traveled all this way and you\u2019re not even going to see her again?\u201d</p><p>Of course he was, but he didn\u2019t answer. He poured a cup of coffee and handed it to Rooster, then poured his own.</p><p>Sitting on the edge of the bed, Max sipped the hot liquid and hoped it would restore his composure.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it bad,\u201d Rooster commented.</p><p>No sense denying it. Max hadn\u2019t spent twenty hours on his bike for the fun of it. He\u2019d come for Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you told her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows about Kate, just not the suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows about the wine business, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Rooster braced his elbows on his knees. \u201cYou\u2019ve told her more than I figured you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethanne might go back to her husband,\u201d Max murmured. His stomach tensed at the thought. The possibility was real, and he needed to prepare himself for whatever she decided.</p><p>Rooster immediately shrugged off Max\u2019s concern. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see the way her face lit up the second she saw you. The girl\u2019s got it as bad as you.\u201d He drank his coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing she sent you that text message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Rooster shook his head. \u201cHonestly, Max, you moped around like a lost puppy dog from the moment she left Vegas. Her phone call didn\u2019t help, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called to say she didn\u2019t want to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, you talked her out of that.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even tried. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, are you getting dressed or not? I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d Rooster sat back, balancing his ankle on the opposite knee.</p><p>Max changed into jeans, the shirt he\u2019d bought in Vegas and his leather vest. He didn\u2019t own much of anything else outside of his biking gear. Back at the house, he had a closet full of business suits. It\u2019d been so long since he\u2019d worn one, he wondered what it would feel like.</p><p>They headed for the elevator. \u201cYou going to call Bethanne?\u201d Rooster asked.</p><p>\u201cLater...\u201d He couldn\u2019t forget that Grant was still a factor. Her ex wasn\u2019t going to simply remove himself from the picture.</p><p>The elevator finally came and they stepped inside, Rooster pushing the button for the lobby. The car stopped on the ninth floor. Bethanne\u2019s floor.</p><p>Annie\u2019s grandma was waiting in the hallway.</p><p>She hesitated when she saw them, then stiffened her shoulders and walked into the elevator, probably wishing there was someone else inside. Someone besides the two of them.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Grandma,\u201d Rooster said.</p><p>\u201cI am not your grandmother,\u201d she snapped. Her back was as straight as a poker. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d venture to say you\u2019re older than I am.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was patently untrue, but Rooster exchanged a smile with Max. \u201cAre you going to let me buy you breakfast?\u201d he asked, leaning forward and speaking into her ear.</p><p>\u201cI should say not.\u201d She made it sound as if he\u2019d propositioned her.</p><p>\u201cAnyplace in town you want,\u201d Rooster said, not easily rejected.</p><p>His persistence appeared to fluster her. \u201cThank you for the invitation,\u201d she said formally, \u201cbut I\u2019m having breakfast with my daughter-in-law and my granddaughter. They\u2019re in the lobby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSleep in, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens, no. I forgot my tickets in the room. We\u2019re going to see the Twelve Irish Tenors and the Oak Ridge Boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Oak Ridge Boys are in town?\u201d Rooster asked, not hiding his excitement.</p><p>\u201cAnnie and I are going to the afternoon show.\u201d</p><p>The elevator arrived at the lobby and the doors glided open. Max immediately saw Bethanne and Annie standing by the fireplace waiting. His gaze went directly to Bethanne. Without conscious thought, he started walking toward her and she toward him.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d you sleep?\u201d he asked in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cBadly,\u201d she whispered, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to breakfast or not?\u201d her daughter demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going,\u201d Rooster said, and offered Annie and Ruth each an arm, elbows jutting out.</p><p>Max reached for Bethanne\u2019s hand, and every doubt he\u2019d experienced instantly fled. They were together and that was enough. They would take this day by day.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re doing,\u201d Ruth said to Rooster.</p><p>\u201cWhy, I\u2019m taking two beauties out for breakfast, that\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that\u2019s our cue to slip off by ourselves,\u201d Max said. They walked out of the hotel, and when Rooster went left, they went right.</p><p>Max\u2019s heart lifted. He had twenty-four hours with Bethanne. It was going to be a good day.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>\u201cHow about a ride?\u201d Max asked Bethanne after they\u2019d finished breakfast. They\u2019d returned to the hotel, strolling lazily down the busy sidewalks of Branson. Bethanne hadn\u2019t seen Ruth, Annie or Rooster since they\u2019d parted ways about an hour earlier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think after all that time on the bike, riding would be the last thing you\u2019d want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a place I want to show you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019m all for it.\u201d Twice now Bethanne had ridden with Max and each time she\u2019d felt more relaxed, more comfortable. He must have planned this, because when he collected his Harley, he had Rooster\u2019s helmet.</p><p>When she was securely seated behind him, Max took off. He hadn\u2019t said where they were going, but it really didn\u2019t matter. She would\u2019ve gone anywhere with him.</p><p>They rode for about forty minutes. He turned off the main road to a lake with a number of upscale modern homes built along the shoreline. Then he pulled into the driveway of one of those houses and climbed off the bike.</p><p>After removing his helmet, he said, \u201cThis belongs to a friend of mine. He said I can stop by anytime I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he at home now?\u201d she asked, removing her own helmet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I left him a voice mail and said I\u2019d like to take him up on his offer. I haven\u2019t heard back.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne dismounted and tucked her fingertips into the rear pockets of her jeans while Max walked over to the house. He dashed up the steps to the porch and rang the doorbell. When no one answered, he lifted a brick from beneath the window, thrust his hand in the hole and took out the key.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we have the place to ourselves,\u201d he said, unlocking the front door.</p><p>Bethanne hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re sure your friend won\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done this before...stopped in like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I promise.\u201d Without waiting for her, he walked inside.</p><p>Reluctantly, Bethanne followed. When she entered the house she noticed large, comfortable furniture. Max went over to the triple-wide sliding glass doors that led to the deck. He opened two, letting a clean breeze waft through the rooms.</p><p>He moved to the railing and looked out over the lake, which sparkled in the sunshine. It was alive with activity. The sounds of enjoyment\u2014laughter and good-natured shouting\u2014carried easily to the house. People were boating and fishing. A water-skier crossed the lake, and a couple of Jet-Skiers left huge rooster tails in their wake.</p><p>Bethanne joined him on the deck, and he slid his arm around her waist. \u201cI had no idea this was so lovely,\u201d he said, almost as if he was speaking to himself.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been here before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce. That was about two and a half years ago. Like I said, a friend of mine owns this. It was a little over a year after Kate died and I was consumed with grief. I was here, but I don\u2019t even remember looking at the lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrief takes over your life, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she said, growing thoughtful. \u201cYears ago I read that grief is the place where love and pain converge. For whatever reason, that stayed in my mind. The truth of it hit me after Grant left. I grieved for my marriage.\u201d Like Max, she spoke in a whisper. \u201cIn the months after that, I discovered a number of things about myself, and they weren\u2019t necessarily things I liked. My husband had moved in with Tiffany. I wanted him back. I was willing to do anything, be anyone, if only Grant would come home again. I needed my husband. I\u2019d never experienced that kind of emotional pain. Never understood how the man who\u2019d vowed to love me could hurt me this badly.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s arm tightened around her.</p><p>\u201cThat first year forced me to reinvent my life,\u201d she said, \u201cbut a large part of who I am was formed by my love for Grant.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd he tried to destroy that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cI know how much you loved Kate,\u201d she said after a moment, leaning her head against his shoulder. \u201cI wish I could tell you that the grief you\u2019re feeling will disappear and never return. But by now you\u2019ve discovered it won\u2019t completely vanish.\u201d</p><p>He slowly exhaled.</p><p>\u201cBecause of Kate and Katherine, because you loved them, you\u2019re a different person. That love, and the love they had for you, will stay with you forever. Nothing can change the way you feel about them. They\u2019re part of you and always will be.\u201d</p><p>Max turned her to face him and whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d Wrapping his arms around her, he held her close. For a long time they stood there and simply clung to each other. They didn\u2019t feel the need to kiss, and she believed that was because what they shared transcended the physical. This understanding\u2014that they\u2019d both lost what they\u2019d treasured most\u2014brought them together in a more profound way than mere attraction.</p><p>Eventually, they wandered down to the lake, took off their shoes and walked along the shore, holding hands. They smiled at a group of kids digging in the sand with colorful shovels and pails. After a while they found a private spot, where they sat and gazed out at the water.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving in the morning?\u201d Max asked, although he already knew the answer.</p><p>Bethanne splayed her fingers in the sand and nodded.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided where you\u2019re going next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably New Orleans.\u201d Bethanne remembered that was on Ruth\u2019s original route. \u201cRuth had everything worked out before Annie and I joined her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuth planned to drive cross-country alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t about to let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be forever grateful you tagged along.\u201d He reached for her left hand and kissed the knuckles.</p><p>Bethanne would be forever grateful, too.</p><p>Her right hand continued to make circles in the sand. \u201cWhy did you want to know about our next stop?\u201d she asked as casually as she could. She might appear relaxed, but she held her breath, torn between hope and dread. She hoped he\u2019d follow but didn\u2019t dare ask if he would.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to New Orleans?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wild and crazy town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>Max squeezed her fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t meet you there.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, trying to hide her disappointment. \u201cWhat about Florida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>She blinked again. He hadn\u2019t offered any explanations or excuses. She could always ask but decided against it. If Max wanted her to know his reasons, he would volunteer the information. She wasn\u2019t a needy individual who craved constant reassurance.</p><p>\u201cThen this is it?\u201d she asked, swallowing hard.</p><p>Max\u2019s eyes immediately sought hers. \u201cNo...\u201d He shook his head, then looked away. \u201cThe truth is, I don\u2019t think I can give you up.\u201d</p><p>The tension left Bethanne and she threw her arms around him and smiled. Max smiled, too, then leaned over and kissed her. She set her hand on his shoulder and kissed him back. After a moment, they drew apart.</p><p>Max lay in the sand and closed his eyes. \u201cI never expected to feel this kind of peace again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m six years out of my marriage and I\u2019m only beginning to feel content. Sometimes I\u2019m amazed to realize I\u2019m truly happy. At first, I didn\u2019t believe that was possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy now?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, too, and felt the wind and the sun against her face, heard the excited sounds of children playing. Max was sprawled out at her side\u2014a man she barely knew, yet was convinced she could love. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI hardly ever tell anyone about Kate and never about Katherine.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d noticed more than once how infrequently he spoke of anything personal.</p><p>\u201cRooster was shocked that I told you.\u201d</p><p>Turning onto her side, she kissed him again and then lay back in the sand, nestling her head on his shoulder. \u201cFrom New Orleans, we\u2019re only a day and a half from Vero Beach,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where Ruth\u2019s class reunion is taking place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you plan to stay in Florida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week. We\u2019ll return the rental car at the Orlando airport and fly back to Seattle on June 19.\u201d</p><p>He grew quiet.</p><p>\u201cI should tell you that Grant will be in Florida at the same time. He says it\u2019s for a Realtors\u2019 convention in Orlando, but I know that\u2019s only an excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he claims\u2014but he said that to me every morning when he went to work and was actually sneaking off with Tiffany to some hotel room.\u201d She sighed, a little disturbed by the surge of bitterness she felt. \u201cThe thing is, I don\u2019t know if I can ever trust him again...or if it\u2019s even possible to go back.\u201d</p><p>Grant had surprised her, giving Bethanne these days with Max. Andrew had left a message on her cell the night before, saying Grant had phoned and offered to help with the wedding. It seemed Grant was trying not only with her but with their children. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI should stay away from Vero Beach,\u201d Max said. \u201cIf I showed up there, it might be awkward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care what Grant thinks,\u201d she insisted. She wanted Max with her. \u201cCome to Florida,\u201d she urged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting this\u2014\u201d he gestured around him at the beach \u201c\u2014influence you. Us, together, all by ourselves. But as you\u2019ve pointed out, your life\u2019s a lot more complicated than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBesides, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m meeting my brother next week. I\u2019d like to meet you there, but...it\u2019s not a good idea. Not now. You have things to discuss with Grant, and I need to get back to California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason Grant decided to fly to Florida was to keep you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame him,\u201d Max said. \u201cIn his shoes, I\u2019d do the same thing. He and I both understand that you have to make your own decision. So, take this time with him. Celebrate your son\u2019s wedding, and when it\u2019s over, I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t allow her to finish, cutting her off with a deep, hungry kiss. \u201cYou can consider all the what-ifs later, but for now let\u2019s just enjoy being together.\u201d</p> <p>By noon it was too warm to stay on the beach. They walked back to the house and sat out on the shaded deck. After searching through the refrigerator and cupboards, Bethanne found frozen lemonade mix and a pitcher. She prepared it, then poured them each a tall glass and added ice.</p><p>Rejoining Max, she brought out the drinks.</p><p>He sat with his head bent forward, brushing sand from his hair.</p><p>As Bethanne set the drinks on a small table, she noticed that he was badly in need of a haircut.</p><p>\u201cYou could use a trim,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019ve been chasing after this incredible woman and haven\u2019t had time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI used to cut Grant\u2019s hair. I could cut yours.\u201d</p><p>Max glanced up. \u201cYou cut your husband\u2019s hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so shocked.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cFrom everything I\u2019ve heard about Grant, he seems more like the type to pay for an expensive cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he is now. In the early years we were short of cash and looked for ways to save money. I discovered I had a knack for cutting hair. He actually preferred me to do it because I knew exactly how he liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a woman of many talents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told. I\u2019m serious, Max, I\u2019d be happy to give you a trim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have scissors?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot with me but I found a pair in the kitchen that would work nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, by all means, have at it.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d been several years since she\u2019d cut anyone\u2019s hair but she was confident in her skills. While Max wetted down his hair in the laundry room sink, Bethanne got a towel from the hall cupboard. Then she dragged a kitchen stool onto the deck.</p><p>Max returned a few minutes later. She took one look at him, at his hesitancy, and smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a thing to worry about, so stop frowning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just asking myself how well I really know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you answer the question?\u201d She patted the stool cushion, indicating he should sit.</p><p>\u201cI decided I could trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood decision.\u201d</p><p>She used the comb he supplied and started by cutting the small hairs that grew above the ears. Blowing the bits of hair away, she felt the tension leave his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve relaxed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve been dreaming about you blowing in my ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will as long as you whisper sweet nothings in mine.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>Bethanne chatted as she worked. The more she engaged him in conversation, the more at ease he became. Standing in front of him she examined her work and was pleased with the result so far. As she stepped back, he took her hand, raised it to his lips and kissed her palm. Goose bumps shivered up and down her arms.</p><p>Before she was completely sure how it\u2019d happened, she was sitting on his lap and they were deeply involved in a series of kisses. The scissors and comb were forgotten on the deck floor as she twined her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better stop,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I\u2019d rather find out where this will take us.\u201d</p><p>She hid her face in the side of his neck. \u201cWe already know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and it\u2019s becoming more appealing by the minute.\u201d Then, as if drawing upon some inner reserve of strength, he gently pushed her away. \u201cI never appreciated how sensuous it could be to have a woman cut my hair.\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been like this with Grant, she thought, even early in their marriage. She immediately felt guilty for making the comparison.</p><p>Resuming her work, she walked around to the back of his head and asked him to tuck in his chin while she clipped the hair at the base of his neck.</p><p>\u201cHow does it look?\u201d Max asked once she\u2019d finished.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell me.\u201d She dug a small mirror out of her purse and handed it to him.</p><p>Max opened it and studied his reflection. He seemed surprised at what a good job she\u2019d done. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>She began to leave to get a broom from the kitchen when he caught her fingers and pulled her close. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, too.\u201d And she would, more than she dared admit.</p><p>Max was about to kiss her when the front door opened and a large man in Bermuda shorts walked in. His face instantly lit up in a huge grin. \u201cMax!\u201d he shouted, and started across the house toward the deck.</p><p>Max met him halfway and the two hugged and slapped each other on the back.</p><p>\u201cAl, this is Bethanne. Bethanne, Al.\u201d</p><p>Al nodded at her. \u201cI came as soon as I got the message that you were at the house.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>Al was a bear of a man, easily six-five or more. He engulfed Max in another hug and then turned to Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, hardly knowing what to think. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind that we invaded your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d He clasped her by the shoulders. \u201cNow, let me take a good look at you.\u201d He smiled down at her, then glanced over his shoulder. \u201cHey, Max, you got yourself a cutie.\u201d</p><p>When he released her, Bethanne nearly stumbled backward.</p><p>\u201cI hope you found everything you need,\u201d Al said as he walked into the kitchen. He removed a beer from the fridge and motioned to Max with it, silently offering him one.</p><p>Max declined with a shake of his head.</p><p>Al pulled back the tab and took a deep swallow. He returned to the living room and sat down on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Sherry?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing great,\u201d Al said.</p><p>Bethanne assumed the other woman must be Al\u2019s wife but didn\u2019t ask.</p><p>Obviously feeling the need to explain, Al looked over at her. \u201cSherry\u2019s our daughter. Max picked her up hitchhiking three years ago\u2014thank God\u2014and managed to talk some sense into her. Our little girl got hooked on painkillers. We hardly knew her anymore. She stole her mother\u2019s jewelry and hocked it for drug money and was on a downward spiral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear she\u2019s better,\u201d Bethanne whispered. This was every parent\u2019s nightmare.</p><p>\u201cShe did a complete turnaround,\u201d Al said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Max picking her up that night I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened to her. How he talked her into going to rehab I\u2019ll never know. Her mother and I begged her over and over but she wouldn\u2019t listen to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did that?\u201d Bethanne stared at Max.</p><p>\u201cHe does that sort of thing,\u201d Al continued.</p><p>\u201cAl,\u201d Max said under his breath. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t known him long,\u201d Bethanne said, cutting Max off. \u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should head out.\u201d Max stood and started for the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got time,\u201d Bethanne countered, winking at Al.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Al looked from Bethanne to Max and then back again.</p><p>\u201cBethanne, come on,\u201d Max said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hear what Al has to say,\u201d she told him. \u201cCome back and sit down.\u201d When Max hesitated, she added, \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>Max claimed the chair he\u2019d recently vacated, but he didn\u2019t seem pleased about it.</p><p>\u201cMax rides his motorcycle from one end of the country to the other, and along the way he helps people in need,\u201d Al explained. \u201cIf he comes across someone in trouble, Max lends a hand. Sometimes it\u2019s talking to them, like it was with our Sherry. Other times it\u2019s getting them something to eat and a place to live. All he asks in return is that whoever he helps pays it forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s definitely one of the good guys,\u201d Bethanne said. Now she understood what the mechanic in Wells, Nevada, had been talking about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no saint,\u201d Max grumbled.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk about it, either. As you might\u2019ve noticed, he doesn\u2019t like people knowing what a soft heart he has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find out?\u201d Bethanne asked. \u201cOther than through Sherry, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRooster.\u201d</p><p>Max grunted in disapproval.</p><p>\u201cName\u2019s a bit odd. His real name\u2019s John Wayne Miller. John Wayne played a guy called Rooster in a movie called True Grit back in the sixties and apparently that\u2019s how Rooster picked up the nickname.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne nodded. \u201cYeah, I heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you two\u2019d stop talking about me as if I wasn\u2019t here,\u201d Max complained.</p><p>Al continued to ignore Max. \u201cMax stops by to see Susie and me every now and then.\u201d He smiled at Max. \u201cThis is the first time he\u2019s ever brought a lady friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Max helped me when our car broke down in Nevada.\u201d She caught his eye. \u201cI don\u2019t recall you asking me to pay it forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we go yet?\u201d Max asked pointedly.</p><p>\u201cI was with my daughter and mother-in-law, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-mother-in-law,\u201d Max corrected.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m divorced. Max and I just sort of hit it off.\u201d</p><p>Al looked pleased as spiked punch. \u201cI always wondered why he never had a woman in his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer my own company,\u201d Max said.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it to me.\u201d Al laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve found someone special, and you should be grateful. It\u2019s not much of a life, racing from one coast to the other, especially if you\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like my life the way it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do,\u201d Al muttered sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Max said. He held his hand out to Bethanne; it was time to leave.</p><p>\u201cNo need to rush off. Susie\u2019s on her way home and I know she\u2019d love to see you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bethanne agreed with Max\u2019s friend. \u201cWe should stay and say hello to Susie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d be real disappointed if you took off,\u201d Al said. \u201cBesides, she\u2019s bringing lunch. I\u2019ll give her a quick call and tell her to pick up enough for five.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI eat as much as two normal people, so she automatically buys two of everything when she\u2019s feeding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch,\u201d Bethanne said sweetly.</p><p>Max nodded reluctantly.</p> <p>Sure enough, Susie arrived about ten minutes later and the men met her in the driveway. Al and Max brought in grocery bags and two six-packs of beer, plus an equal number of sodas.</p><p>Susie was a petite woman who stood a full foot and a half shorter than her husband. She had curly brown hair and big hazel eyes. Clearly she adored Max and welcomed Bethanne with a warm smile.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how happy I am to meet you,\u201d she said, rushing inside. \u201cAl and I were so thrilled to hear from Max, we immediately changed our plans and headed for the lake house.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne followed Susie into the kitchen and began unpacking groceries, setting the food on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cWhat else can I do to help?\u201d Bethanne asked when she\u2019d finished.</p> <p>\u201cGrab those bags over there,\u201d Susie said, pointing to the chips.</p><p>Bethanne was put to work opening bags of potato chips and emptying them into plastic bowls while Susie made a salad.</p><p>Al and Max moved onto the deck, where Al turned on the barbecue.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you and Max been together?\u201d Susie asked as she sliced tomatoes.</p><p>Bethanne peeled a cucumber. \u201cWe aren\u2019t exactly together. We only met a few days ago.\u201d Although it felt as though she\u2019d known him for a lot longer...</p><p>\u201cReally? Well, you found yourself a gem of a guy. I don\u2019t know what happened to him. Max has never spoken about why he lives the way he does, but it\u2019s obvious there\u2019s some tragedy in his past.\u201d</p> <p>If Max hadn\u2019t explained, then Bethanne didn\u2019t feel she could.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s done so much for others,\u201d Susie went on. \u201cRooster told us that he helped a handicapped woman in Boston by replacing her roof. And a friend of ours told us about a family who was about to lose their home due to the husband\u2019s unemployment. When the bank threatened to repossess it, Max stepped in and made the late payments.\u201d</p><p>Just then Max appeared in the kitchen doorway. \u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201d he asked suspiciously.</p><p>Susie rolled her eyes. \u201cWhy do men always assume we\u2019re talking about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEgo,\u201d Bethanne said, and they laughed. If any man didn\u2019t suffer from an outsize ego\u2014in her opinion, anyway\u2014it was Max.</p><p>\u201cHey, Max, I bought you chocolate ice cream,\u201d Susie said as she arranged silverware on the table on the deck. Smiling at Bethanne, she added, \u201cHe\u2019s got a weakness for chocolate ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Max snuck up behind Bethanne and slipped his arms around her. \u201cWhat I have is a weakness for you,\u201d he said, kissing her cheek. He whispered, \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t believe a word these people tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI already told you, Bethanne, I\u2019m no saint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound as if you\u2019re ashamed of helping other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, but I don\u2019t like to broadcast it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re a lone wolf, a drifter who needs no one, riding off into the sunset.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and muttered, \u201cYou making fun of me?\u201d in a mock-ferocious voice.</p><p>Bethanne laughed. \u201cGuess so.\u201d</p><p>They ate hot-off-the-grill cheeseburgers around three o\u2019clock. Bethanne liked his friends. Al and Susie carried the conversation, regaling her with stories about their children. Sherry was the youngest of three, and their problem child, although she\u2019d successfully gone through rehab and had now returned to school. In large part due to Max, as the couple were quick to remind Bethanne. Max scowled every time they mentioned his name.</p><p>Bethanne helped with the cleanup and Max suggested they leave close to five. The afternoon had been perfect in every way. Al and his wife both hugged her before she went out to join Max on the Harley.</p><p>\u201cHe needs you,\u201d Susie whispered to her. \u201cHe\u2019s a lost soul.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne smiled and hugged the other woman back. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I met you and Al.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I hope we\u2019ll see you again.\u201d</p><p>She put the helmet on and climbed onto the bike. As they took off, engine roaring, Bethanne slipped her arms around Max\u2019s middle and relaxed against him. After a while she loosened her grip. Occasionally she even stretched her arms out at her sides, feeling free and unencumbered. She sensed that she was finally getting to know him\u2014that they\u2019d breached some barrier.</p><p>The return to Branson seemed to take far less time than the trip to the lake.</p><p>Annie was sitting in the lobby waiting for Bethanne. \u201cMom!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhere did you go? Why didn\u2019t you answer your phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you call?\u201d Her purse had been near her most of the day, but she hadn\u2019t heard her cell.</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>That explained it. \u201cWhat did you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody left me,\u201d Annie complained.</p><p>Bethanne managed not to sigh\u2014or say something sarcastic. \u201cWhere\u2019s Grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still out with Rooster. They went to see the Oak Ridge Boys. At breakfast I said I didn\u2019t want to go and Rooster jumped at the chance. I haven\u2019t seen them since.\u201d</p><p>Ruth had gone with Rooster. That was a shock. \u201cYou spent the entire day on your own?\u201d</p><p>Annie nodded, then shrugged. \u201cI had fun shopping, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, where were you?\u201d</p><p>Max stood beside her and they held hands. \u201cI was with Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Annie,\u201d he said, giving her a friendly smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, duh, I figured that much,\u201d she told her mother. \u201cHi,\u201d she muttered grudgingly in Max\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cWe went to see some friends of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could all go to dinner tonight,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>Annie didn\u2019t show much enthusiasm. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving in the morning, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and according to your grandmother\u2019s schedule, we\u2019re headed for New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax says it\u2019s a real party town. Should be lots of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore fun than Vegas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA different kind of fun,\u201d Max said. \u201cI wish I could go, but I\u2019m headed somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Annie didn\u2019t look at all disappointed. She glanced at the doors and suddenly her face lit up. \u201cGrandma!\u201d she shouted, jumping to her feet.</p><p>Bethanne turned to see Ruth and Rooster walking into the hotel. \u201cRooster and I had the most wonderful day,\u201d Ruth said, hurrying toward them.</p><p>\u201cTwo shows, one right after the other, and both of them exceptional.\u201d Rooster looked delighted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to get out of Missouri,\u201d Annie announced to anyone who cared to listen.</p><p>\u201cWhat about dinner?\u201d Bethanne asked once again. \u201cAll of us together. Max and Rooster are leaving tomorrow, and so are we.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount me out on dinner,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted and we\u2019ve got a full day coming up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with Grandma,\u201d Annie said, as if she was glad of an excuse to escape. \u201cWe\u2019ll just get room service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are on your own,\u201d Rooster said as the three of them strolled over to the elevator a few minutes later.</p><p>Max looked at Bethanne. \u201cMaybe we should say our goodbyes now, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a glass of wine?\u201d she suggested instead.</p><p>He hesitated, then nodded slowly.</p><p>They found a vacant table in the lounge, and Bethanne studied the wine list. For the first time it felt awkward between them, as though they both feared what would happen next. In the morning they\u2019d go their separate ways, and after that\u2014she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>They each ordered a glass of red wine, an Australian shiraz, which was promptly delivered.</p><p>Bethanne gazed down at her wine, hardly noticing its rich ruby color.</p><p>\u201cI have to be in California next week. I don\u2019t have a choice about that,\u201d Max said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s hand closed over hers. \u201cMy brother\u2019s handled the business ever since Kate died. It\u2019s time I went back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going home?\u201d</p><p>Max gave her a lopsided grin. \u201cLuke was beginning to think I was never going to return. A lot has changed in the past three years\u2014in the business, in his life, in mine. I\u2019m ready now, only I didn\u2019t realize it until a few days ago. Until...you.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze and held it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go on to Florida, and we\u2019ll connect again later this summer. If that\u2019s what you decide.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne started to say that was too long to wait.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, you need to be with Ruth and Annie, with your son and his bride. With Grant.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne opened her mouth to protest, but again he stopped her.</p><p>\u201cMake no mistake, I\u2019d welcome the opportunity to explore where this relationship will take us, but I have things I need to attend to and so do you.\u201d His expression was determined. Unwavering. \u201cWhile you\u2019re in Florida, you and Grant will have the chance to work this out\u2014or not. Until you do, I\u2019ll stay out of your life. I\u2019ll abide by whatever decision you make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if...what if Grant and I don\u2019t get back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come to Seattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come wherever you are. Anyplace. Anytime. All you have to do is contact me.\u201d</p><p>It sounded risky to Bethanne, scary, especially when she wasn\u2019t sure of her own mind. She wanted Max to convince her they were meant to be together. He hadn\u2019t. She wanted him to fight for her. He wouldn\u2019t. The decision was hers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>\u201cBethanne, we\u2019re both high on emotion.\u201d His hand cupped her cheek as if he felt the need to touch her, to hold on to her as long as he could.</p><p>They finished their wine, then returned to the front porch and sat in the swing, Max\u2019s arm possessively around her. She rested her head on his shoulder, closing her eyes. She wanted to keep these feelings with her forever.</p><p>Part of her wanted to argue with him, say she\u2019d already made up her mind. Only she hadn\u2019t. Not really. Twenty years with Grant couldn\u2019t be easily shoved aside or forgotten. Max was right; they were high on emotion, on discovery. What they shared was fresh and new. Their feelings for each other had yet to be tested. All she had were these few days with Max. Seven days that had indelibly marked her. But could it be more than just a memory, significant though that memory was? Should it?</p><p>Max escorted her to her room and kissed her good-night. Bethanne felt an urge to weep\u2014but this time for reasons she understood far too well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Twenty-Two</p><p>The next morning Annie was up at five-thirty, eager to hit the road. She turned on the bedside lamp and studied the road map. The day before had been a dead bore. Although she\u2019d spent most of her time wandering from store to store and had even bought a few things, she\u2019d grown tired of that.</p><p>The most interesting part of the day had been breakfast with her grandmother and Rooster. He seemed intent on letting them both know what a great guy Max was. She\u2019d had some serious doubts about this biker. To all outward appearances, he was little more than a drifter. Her mother had hinted at the fact that Max owned a wine distribution business but she hadn\u2019t said much. Annie was convinced it was because her mother didn\u2019t know much.</p><p>But Rooster was obviously determined to fill in the blanks. He spent a good hour telling them about Max and his brother, Luke. He explained that Max had lost both his wife and his daughter and had gone off the deep end for a while.</p> <p>Rooster turned every topic of conversation, every remark, into an opportunity to talk about Max.</p><p>When Grandma mentioned going to New Orleans, he\u2019d said, \u201cMax spent six months there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d Annie had asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cBuilding homes with Habitat for Humanity. He also joined a group that reconnected pets with their owners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Annie had assumed he\u2019d been drinking and gambling. The fact that he was helping victims of Hurricane Katrina quickly trampled her sense of indignation.</p> <p>\u201cSo the two of you are heading home to California,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>\u201cWe leave first thing tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing back to do what?\u201d Annie had asked.</p><p>\u201cMax is stepping into the role he left three years ago,\u201d Rooster said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be working in the family business.\u201d</p><p>Annie made it clear that she wasn\u2019t impressed. She refused to even hint to Rooster that her views of Max were starting to change, much as she didn\u2019t want them to.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t trust him,\u201d Rooster said.</p> <p>\u201cPlenty of reasons not to,\u201d Annie had muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s ruining everything between my mom and dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d Rooster asked gently.</p><p>Annie nodded stubbornly, but her grandmother was evidently staying out of it.</p><p>\u201cKids want to see their parents together,\u201d Rooster said, reaching for his coffee mug and holding it out for the waitress to refill. \u201cThat\u2019s natural. But sometimes it isn\u2019t for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is with my parents,\u201d Annie insisted. She looked across the table and met her grandmother\u2019s eyes, assuming Ruth would immediately agree. It came as a surprise when she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Hearing how Max had volunteered in New Orleans wasn\u2019t something Annie wanted to hear. She preferred to think of him as a drifter who\u2019d taken advantage of her mother. Although she struggled to hold on to that image, she found it increasingly difficult, especially when she saw how happy he made her mother. Now that she knew that he had a good heart, it was even harder to dislike him.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t ready to admit that yet, she told herself as she refolded the map. Both her grandmother and mother were still asleep.</p><p>Another minor complication had come her way in the past couple of days.</p> <p>She\u2019d emailed Vance back to let him know what a great time she was having and casually asked about his adventures in Europe. He replied right away. Matt and Jessie argued constantly. Everything cost more than they\u2019d expected. At the rate they were going, they\u2019d be out of money in a few weeks when they\u2019d hoped it would last them a year. He hated hostels and had trouble making himself understood.</p><p>In Annie\u2019s opinion, if Vance was visiting a foreign country, he should make the effort to learn at least basic phrases in that language. She told him so, a comment he\u2019d chosen to ignore. She hadn\u2019t heard from him since, and that was fine, although she did want Vance to know she was having the experience of her life...well, other than their last day in Branson. Unfortunately, she hadn\u2019t met anyone in Missouri the way she had in Vegas.</p><p>Jason had emailed her several times, as well. In fact, Annie hoped they\u2019d keep in touch....</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t sleep well after Max dropped her off. There was so much more she\u2019d wanted to say, so much more she wanted to know. He\u2019d be traveling for several days, which would make communication difficult. She\u2019d be on the road, too, heading in the opposite direction. Once she arrived in Vero Beach, Grant would meet her. She didn\u2019t want to think about her ex-husband, not when she was preoccupied by another man. Above all, Bethanne longed to be fair to both men. She wouldn\u2019t mislead Grant into believing a reconciliation was possible if she decided it wasn\u2019t. At the same time, she couldn\u2019t help wondering if what she felt for Max would diminish in the days ahead.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ten hours from New Orleans,\u201d Annie said as Bethanne stepped out of the bathroom, dressed and ready to go. She said this as if it were little more than a Sunday drive in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s just six hundred miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix hundred miles.\u201d Ruth groaned as she completed her morning stretches. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to make that in a single day, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can.\u201d Annie sounded completely confident as she tucked the map in her bag. \u201cEspecially if we get an early start.\u201d Hopping off the bed, she clapped her hands. \u201cCome on, Mom. And, Grandma, just think\u2014every day brings you closer to Vero Beach\u2014and Royce.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that was all the incentive Ruth needed. Although Bethanne hadn\u2019t pried, she knew this trip had more to do with seeing Royce than with the actual reunion.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about all the knitting you\u2019ll accomplish in ten hours, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d spent so much time with Max, Bethanne had neglected her project. Annie had a point; she could use the long hours on the road to knit...and think. She\u2019d only completed the first glove so far. Her goal had been to finish the pair before they returned to Seattle.</p><p>They dressed and finished packing their suitcases. While Ruth directed the bellman with their luggage, Annie arranged to have the car brought to the front of the hotel. Bethanne checked out. After she\u2019d put their expenses on her credit card, she handed the woman behind the counter a short note for Max, thanking him for a wonderful day. In a postscript, she\u2019d added that she was going to miss him.</p><p>\u201cWould you please give this to Max Scranton when he checks out?\u201d she said.</p><p>The woman looked up. \u201cMr. Scranton\u2019s already left.\u201d</p><p>Already? Max was gone? Silly as it sounded, Bethanne wasn\u2019t prepared to hear that.</p><p>Bethanne drove, with Ruth in the passenger seat. \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you I enjoyed Branson,\u201d her mother-in-law said. \u201cIt was everything I\u2019d dreamed it would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou enjoyed attending the shows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and Rooster wasn\u2019t half bad.\u201d She glanced at Bethanne. \u201cI might have misjudged him. He\u2019s actually quite a nice man. A bit young for me, but a gentleman at heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you had a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRooster.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he insists on using such a ridiculous name, but that\u2019s his business. He said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnward to New Orleans,\u201d Annie broke in. \u201cI can hardly wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Ruth grinned. \u201cMy mouth\u2019s watering for that Cajun food Emeril\u2019s always talking about. Give me some shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e and fil\u00e9 gumbo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma, I thought you didn\u2019t like spicy food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally I don\u2019t, but I\u2019m not about to pass this up. Besides, why did they invent antacid tablets if it wasn\u2019t for times like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about Bourbon Street...\u201d Annie said dreamily.</p><p>\u201cAnd apparently the French Quarter is quite a shopping experience,\u201d Bethanne added.</p><p>They stopped in Little Rock, Arkansas, for a late breakfast. Annie took over the driving after that, while Bethanne sat in the back and worked on her knitting. She was distracted by thoughts of Max and ended up ripping out several rows.</p><p>\u201cWe should call Dad,\u201d Annie said just outside Jackson, Mississippi, early that afternoon.</p><p>\u201cWe should,\u201d Ruth agreed.</p><p>Grant hadn\u2019t called in a couple of days, which was unusual. He seemed to be following his own advice and giving her the space she needed. But Bethanne suspected he was nervously waiting for her to get in touch with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him,\u201d Ruth volunteered, and reached for Annie\u2019s cell phone, which rested on the console between them. She\u2019d come to use it quite a bit this trip. Bethanne wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she bought one of her own.</p><p>Mother and son spoke about the trip for a few minutes before she turned around to hand the phone to Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cHello, Grant,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said back. \u201cHow was Branson?\u201d He sounded tentative, unlike his usual confident self.</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d If he was waiting for her to fill him in about her time with Max, then he\u2019d be disappointed.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you plan to get to Vero Beach?\u201d Grant asked.</p><p>\u201cNo later than Monday, although it depends on how many stops we make along the way,\u201d Bethanne told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to visit New Orleans,\u201d Grant said. \u201cIt would mean more if I could see it with you.\u201d He paused. \u201cDo you think that might be possible someday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d And she didn\u2019t. Rather than dwell on that, she asked, \u201cWhen do you fly into Orlando?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean that, Bethanne?\u201d he asked in a husky whisper. \u201cDo you honestly mean that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said. Being away from the demands of her business and the wedding plans would give her a chance to assess their relationship and decide if it was possible to step back in time. She wondered if she\u2019d changed too much\u2014and if Grant had changed enough.</p><p>\u201cTell Dad hello for me,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Bethanne promised, and she did. She was grateful for the closeness father and daughter shared. She hoped that one day Andrew and Grant would find a common bond, too, and that her son would be able to forgive his father.</p><p>They spoke for a few more minutes and then Bethanne passed the phone back to Ruth.</p><p>They arrived in New Orleans around five-thirty that afternoon. For the past three or four hours, Ruth and Annie had traded off driving. By the time they got to their hotel on Canal Street, Bethanne was more than willing to call it a day. She was tired and uncharacteristically cranky.</p><p>After they\u2019d checked in and had their suitcases brought up to the room, Annie and Ruth convinced her to explore the French Quarter with them, despite her protests.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel better once we have something to eat,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>They had no difficulty finding a fabulous restaurant. New Orleans was legendary for its food, and anyone they asked was willing to make recommendations. Bethanne loved the bistro\u2019s shaded courtyard and enjoyed every bite of her pecan-coated catfish and every sip of her Sazerac, a classic New Orleans cocktail. And the bread pudding with bourbon sauce... As Annie said, it was to die for. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Afterward, although she was tired and eager to get back to the room, Bethanne wandered into an antiques store in the Quarter and studied the cameos. She owned a couple of them, which she treasured, but didn\u2019t intend to collect more.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d a pleasant clerk inquired.</p><p>\u201cJust looking, thanks,\u201d Bethanne said as she continued down the aisle. Both Annie and Ruth had followed her inside. They each found a different area to explore. The wooden floors creaked with age as Bethanne examined the contents of a display case.</p><p>\u201cWe recently got in something quite unusual, if you\u2019re interested in a memento that\u2019s out of the ordinary,\u201d the clerk said. She moved behind a glass counter and brought out a small box.</p> <p>Inside was a plain fabric button. Bethanne couldn\u2019t see anything special about this particular button, other than its obvious age.</p><p>\u201cThis was sewn in the collar of a Confederate uniform,\u201d the woman said as she reverently took the button from its protective box and held it in the palm of her hand. \u201cI have a photograph of it here.\u201d The clerk laid a picture of a tattered gray uniform beside the now-empty box. \u201cWhen young men left for the War Between the States, their sweethearts would often soak a button in perfume. Once it was dry they\u2019d sew it into their loved one\u2019s uniform collar, reminding the soldier of all he\u2019d left behind. That way, whenever he was lonely for his home and his sweetheart, all he had to do was breathe deeply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so romantic,\u201d Annie said, coming to stand next to her mother.</p><p>\u201cHow much is it?\u201d Bethanne asked.</p><p>The clerk named a price that shocked her. \u201cFor a button? Thank you, but no. That\u2019s way out of my price range.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom, you should get it,\u201d Annie urged.</p><p>Bethanne shook her head. \u201cWhat would I do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it as a souvenir of our trip,\u201d Annie said. \u201cIt\u2019s different and historical and so romantic.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne considered it for a moment. \u201cI think I\u2019d rather buy something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething more reasonably priced, you mean,\u201d Ruth commented, having joined them, as well.</p><p>The three shopped a bit longer. Annie bought a number of small items for her girlfriends and Ruth purchased pralines to bring to her own friends at home. In the end, Bethanne didn\u2019t get anything; she wasn\u2019t in much of a buying mood. She missed Max.</p> <p>As soon as they returned to their hotel room, Ruth changed into her pajamas and was asleep almost immediately.</p><p>Annie was busy on her iPhone, answering emails. Taking the opportunity to soak in the tub, Bethanne sought a quiet thirty minutes to herself. A bubble bath was a luxury she hadn\u2019t enjoyed in a while. As she lay in the hot bubbly water, she closed her eyes.</p><p>She was completely relaxed when Annie stepped into the bathroom and sat on the edge of the tub.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything, sweetie?\u201d Bethanne asked.</p><p>Annie didn\u2019t say anything right away. \u201cI\u2019m glad Max isn\u2019t here,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Bethanne tried not to sound defensive.</p><p>\u201cI can see how much you like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Bethanne understood her daughter\u2019s concerns. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid Max might ruin any chance of a reconciliation between your father and me. Look, Annie, I know how much you want me to get back with your father. But what you need to remember is that nothing\u2019s the same as it was six years ago. Our family will never return to the way it used to be. You and Andrew are adults now. I\u2019d never attempt to convince either of you to enter a relationship you didn\u2019t feel was right. I expect the same courtesy and respect.\u201d</p> <p>Her daughter blinked and then nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe understand each other?\u201d</p><p>Annie nodded again. \u201cJust promise me one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive Dad a chance. Just give my dad a chance.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Annie whispered. She hadn\u2019t slept. The glowing digital alarm by her side told her it was a little after three. There was a strip of light under the door from the hallway, but except for that and the clock, the room was dark. Grandma Hamlin snored softly in the other bed.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d her mother returned groggily.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am now,\u201d Bethanne said, and rolled onto her back.</p><p>Annie stared at the ceiling. \u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d</p><p>Her mother sat up, leaning against the pillows, and studied Annie. \u201cWhy would I be mad at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of what I said about Max,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe thing is, I think I might really like him if it wasn\u2019t for Dad.\u201d Annie had lain awake, examining her feelings, and realized that Max and Rooster were good guys, kind and helpful. She had no idea what would\u2019ve happened at the lake if they hadn\u2019t come by when they did.</p><p>\u201cYou really care about him, don\u2019t you?\u201d Annie sighed. Her father could have put an end to this romance and he hadn\u2019t. More than that, he\u2019d actually insisted they leave Bethanne alone to make her own decision. Annie admired his attitude, which she viewed as brave and selfless, but she wanted to shout at him to do something and fast. He wouldn\u2019t listen, though. Both her parents were such complicated people.</p><p>\u201cI do care about Max.\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice was tender.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird watching my mother fall in love with someone other than my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m in love with him, Annie. It\u2019s too soon for that. I\u2019m...infatuated with Max, but we haven\u2019t faced any real difficulties yet. I think it would be easy to fall in love with him one day. I like Max a lot, and I hope things work out so we can be together, but they might not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love Dad, too, right?\u201d She felt as if the dream she held of seeing her parents reconcile was crumbling at her feet.</p><p>\u201cI do care a great deal for your father. I can\u2019t dismiss our years together because of an error in judgment he made.\u201d Her mother lay down again. \u201cHowever, I doubt that you woke me up to chat about your father and me. What\u2019s up, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>Annie sighed, unsure where to start. \u201cI heard from Vance again.\u201d She made it sound like he\u2019d only emailed her a couple of times. The fact was, Vance had contacted her nearly every day since he\u2019d left for Europe with Matt and Jessie. She hadn\u2019t answered most of his emails.</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned that he\u2019s homesick and wants to come back to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t. His ticket home isn\u2019t good until next year. When he tried to change it, the airlines wanted to charge him for a whole new ticket. He doesn\u2019t have that kind of money and he can\u2019t ask his parents. He says the airline\u2019s being unreasonable and I agree with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have known that when he booked his flights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he already paid for his return ticket!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had a pretty quick change of heart, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Bethanne commented. \u201cHe\u2019s only been in Europe a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me, Annie?\u201d</p><p>That was the problem with her mother, Annie thought. She read between the lines far too easily.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She closed her eyes tightly. \u201cVance wants me to meet him in France at the end of the month.\u201d There, she\u2019d said it, and held her breath while she waited for her mother\u2019s reaction. \u201cWhat do you think about that?\u201d</p><p>Annie should\u2019ve known. Her mother always did this. She turned everything into a question. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to talk to you. I need advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d her mother said. \u201cObviously, this is bothering you. Otherwise, you\u2019d be fast asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so would you,\u201d Annie added, smiling.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t sound upset, though, and that was reassuring.</p><p>\u201cFirst, how do you feel about Vance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow or before we left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...I miss him. Before he decided to go to Europe, we talked practically every day. We were almost always together, which is one reason I was so upset when I found out he was going to Europe with Matt and Jessie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kept it a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to tell me, or so he said, but Matt told him not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he listened to his friend instead of doing what he knew was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say why he wants you to meet him in France?\u201d</p><p>Annie folded her hands behind her head and stared up at the ceiling some more. \u201cHe said he\u2019s tired of being a third wheel. Matt and Jessie are having all these arguments and he\u2019s afraid he doesn\u2019t have enough money to last a year and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, nothing is turning out the way he thought it would,\u201d her mother finished for her. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why he invited you to fly over and join him?\u201d</p><p>Just the way her mother asked told Annie she thought it was a pretty selfish reason. \u201cThat\u2019s what he said, but you have to remember Vance isn\u2019t exactly a great communicator.\u201d</p><p>Annie wanted to believe he was lost and lonely without her and that he regretted everything. He hadn\u2019t said so, but she knew that was what he really meant. Or what she hoped he meant...</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll have to decide if he\u2019s sincere,\u201d her mother whispered. \u201cIf he\u2019s asking because he wants to be with you or he just doesn\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Annie lowered her voice, too, not wanting to wake her grandmother. \u201cHe does want to be with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what he said, though, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but it\u2019s what he meant.\u201d</p><p>Her mother was silent for several minutes. \u201cIt sounds to me like you want to be with Vance, too.\u201d</p><p>That was true, although Annie hated admitting it. \u201cHe really hurt me, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he needs to work harder for me to put this behind us, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t think he\u2019s suffered enough?\u201d</p><p>Annie snickered in the dark. \u201cYou\u2019re funny, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do want him to suffer, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he should. He went behind my back and planned this whole trip without telling me anything. I\u2019m supposed to be his girlfriend\u2014wouldn\u2019t you assume he\u2019d want me to know? I shared everything with him. I thought I wanted to marry him and I believed he felt the same about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only does he hit me with the news that he\u2019s going to Europe with his two friends, but then he insults my intelligence by asking me to drive him to the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does take gall,\u201d her mother agreed.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you want him to suffer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I would.\u201d</p><p>Annie knew she could count on her mother to be on her side.</p><p>\u201cBut when is it enough? It\u2019s hard to know when I should forgive and forget.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrue,\u201d her mother murmured.</p><p>\u201cI can forgive him...in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time,\u201d her mother echoed. \u201cEventually, you\u2019ll be able to look past his behavior\u2014if you choose to. Men can be completely oblivious to what matters most. When you think about it, Vance must\u2019ve known how upset you\u2019d be, and yet he wanted you to send him off with hugs and kisses.\u201d</p><p>Annie felt better talking this over with her mother. Everything was starting to seem a little clearer. \u201cI heard from Jason, too. He called me the day I spent alone in Branson. We\u2019ve kept in touch since Vegas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to be honest, it felt good to have someone interested in me after Vance was such a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like Jason?\u201d</p><p>Annie shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a glowing endorsement.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I tried to figure out why I feel this way. He\u2019s really nice and fun and we had a great time together. Another girl would be over the moon about meeting someone like him. Then I realized what\u2019s wrong. Jason didn\u2019t act like Vance. I\u2019m so used to being with Vance that it felt sort of...wrong to be with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Her mother shifted onto her side. \u201cI remember when Paul\u2014 Tiffany\u2019s ex\u2014and I went to dinner after your father moved out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Annie didn\u2019t like to remember that. Her father and the lovely Tiffany had hurt and betrayed two people. Well, four, including her and Andrew.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t been out with another man for so many years that I started to shake. I didn\u2019t know how to act or what to say, and when I did find my tongue, I was convinced I sounded like a nutcase.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a fair comparison to her situation with Jason. Her mother had been close to a nervous collapse the first few weeks after Annie\u2019s father moved out. Those days had been dreadful for all of them.</p><p>Annie had been furious with both her parents, but especially Bethanne. If her father fell in love with another woman, it had to be her mother\u2019s fault. Bethanne was boring, Annie decided. Her mother\u2019s whole world revolved around the house and the family and those dinner parties she put on for her father\u2019s business associates. She\u2019d let herself go, too. Her hair was too long and she didn\u2019t shop for herself often enough.</p> <p>In the weeks that followed, Annie had done her utmost to bring her father home. She\u2019d cried and pleaded and told him she\u2019d make sure Bethanne did whatever was necessary to make him happy. In retrospect, Annie was embarrassed by her behavior. She understood now that nothing she\u2019d said had put a dent in his determination.</p><p>What hurt the most was discovering that he didn\u2019t even want to talk to her anymore, although they\u2019d always been so close. Annie was convinced it was all lovely Tiffany\u2019s fault.</p><p>After she\u2019d finished blaming her mother, Annie had turned her anger on the new woman in her father\u2019s life. The divorce was completely her fault, and if Annie could show her dad the truth about Tiffany, Grant would change his mind and come back to the family.</p><p>Annie had pulled some nasty tricks on the lovely Tiffany, but they\u2019d backfired. The only thing her efforts had accomplished was to upset her father and widen the rift between them.</p><p>With her mother a weakling and her father refusing to have anything to do with her, Annie had nearly self-destructed. Fortunately, Andrew had stepped in and, with Courtney\u2019s help, gotten her away from the dangerous path she\u2019d chosen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet all of a sudden,\u201d her mother whispered.</p><p>Not wanting to confess where her mind had wandered, Annie said, \u201cI had a thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it go to your head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFunny one, Mom.\u201d Annie smiled into the dark.</p><p>\u201cAnd? Want to share that thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason\u2019s actually really nice.\u201d Jason was more than nice; she\u2019d probably try to keep this going, see where it went, although he lived in California and long-distance relationships were a drag.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re going to tell Vance?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d She paused. \u201cVance should\u2019ve thought about being a third wheel when he agreed to go to Europe with Matt and Jessie,\u201d she began. \u201cI\u2019ve got more to do with my life than give up a whole month just so he doesn\u2019t feel lonely while he\u2019s away. He had his chance and he blew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d still like to be with him, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but for all the wrong reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be with him because we\u2019re comfortable together. Familiar. But that isn\u2019t a good enough basis for uprooting my whole life.\u201d The more Annie verbalized her thoughts, the more convinced she was that she\u2019d made the right decision. And the more she felt that pursuing a relationship with Jason made sense. The very reason she\u2019d had doubts about him\u2014the fact that he wasn\u2019t Vance\u2014was now why she wanted to see where a connection between them might lead.</p><p>\u201cCan we go back to sleep now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Annie said, but she didn\u2019t think she would.</p><p>Twenty-Four</p><p>They stayed in New Orleans another day, and after a leisurely drive, got to Vero Beach late Monday afternoon. Bethanne hadn\u2019t heard from Max. She\u2019d toyed with the idea of contacting him, but had resisted.</p><p>For now.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how much everything\u2019s changed,\u201d Ruth kept repeating as they made their way into town. On the drive down Route 60, she\u2019d pointed left and right, shaking her head at what were once orange groves as far as the eye could see, but were now mostly housing developments and suburban sprawl.</p><p>\u201cCall Royce,\u201d Annie said when they reached their hotel and had unpacked.</p><p>Ruth paced the room, nervously rubbing her palms. \u201cYou think I should?\u201d she asked, looking at Bethanne. \u201cI mean, so soon? We just got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you would,\u201d Bethanne reminded her.</p><p>\u201cGrandma,\u201d Annie groaned. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting to hear from you. Now call him!\u201d Annie commanded, gesturing at the room\u2019s phone.</p><p>Ruth glanced uncertainly toward Bethanne, who nodded her encouragement.</p><p>\u201cOkay...I will,\u201d Ruth declared, sounding more like a schoolgirl than a mature adult, \u201cbut if this turns out badly, I\u2019ll blame the two of you.\u201d She fixed them both with a shaky glare.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t, I promise,\u201d Annie said with utter confidence.</p><p>Bethanne watched discreetly as Ruth sat on the bed and punched in Royce\u2019s number from a slip of paper in her purse. She held the receiver to her ear, clenching and unclenching her fist. In the silence Bethanne could hear the phone ring, followed by a man\u2019s voice answering.</p><p>\u201cRoyce, it\u2019s Ruth,\u201d she began, her own voice fluttering with anxiety. She rushed on. \u201cMy granddaughter thought I should let you know we made it here safely. We\u2019re in Vero Beach at the hotel the reunion committee recommended.\u201d</p><p>While Bethanne couldn\u2019t hear what Royce said, she saw from Ruth\u2019s reaction that he seemed pleased to have heard from her. Ruth hunched over, and Bethanne could see her smiling.</p><p>\u201cSure\u2014but my daughter-in-law and granddaughter are with me. All right. Uh-huh...that would be very nice.\u201d She looked at Bethanne and Annie, who stood with their hands clasped as they awaited the outcome. \u201cOkay, yes...that\u2019s very thoughtful. We\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d Ruth hung up the phone.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Annie asked expectantly. She and Bethanne were staring at Ruth.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to take us all to dinner,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>\u201cAll of us?\u201d Bethanne asked to be sure she understood correctly.</p><p>\u201cHis grandson is with him, and he\u2019s bringing him along for you to meet.\u201d</p><p>Annie smiled, clearly intrigued by this unexpected turn of events. \u201cWas he happy to hear from you?\u201d</p><p>Ruth blushed. \u201cI think so,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d Annie crowed, collecting a fresh set of clothes and heading for the shower.</p><p>\u201cI need to change, too.\u201d Ruth looked down at what she was wearing. She brushed an invisible speck of dirt from the front of her blouse. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to see Royce again,\u201d she muttered, her forehead wrinkling.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Bethanne insisted, amused and deeply touched at the sight of her mother-in-law in such a state.</p><p>Ruth immediately started riffling through her clothes, searching for the perfect outfit in which to rendezvous with her high school sweetheart. With both Annie and Ruth occupied, Bethanne grabbed her cell and stepped out onto the patio, closing the sliding glass door carefully behind her. The waves breaking on the beach were hypnotic, and the ocean breeze dispelled the intense heat and humidity of late afternoon.</p><p>Sitting in one of the patio chairs, Bethanne punched out Max\u2019s cell number. She had no idea if she\u2019d reach him. If she didn\u2019t, she\u2019d leave a message.</p><p>Max picked up on the fourth ring, just before the call went to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cMax...it\u2019s Bethanne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethanne.\u201d His voice was low.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the way to California.\u201d He paused. \u201cAre you in Florida yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe arrived about thirty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Grant there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. He\u2019s meeting us later.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to think about Grant right now. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiserable.\u201d He laughed hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cAre you really?\u201d Bethanne hugged the phone tighter.</p><p>He muttered something under his breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to sound so happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m feeling exactly the same without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was New Orleans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ate beignets at Caf\u00e9 du Monde yesterday morning. Last night we listened to jazz on Bourbon Street. After that, I ended up drinking some wicked alcoholic concoction in a hurricane glass. It knocked me for a loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou three didn\u2019t get into any trouble, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone that I care to mention,\u201d she joked. \u201cI\u2019d always heard that New Orleans was famous for its food, and it was fantastic.\u201d She found herself chattering on. \u201cAnnie talked Ruth and me into trying a mint julep\u2014\u201d</p><p>Max snorted in amusement. \u201cWere you able to walk back to the hotel afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d Bethanne giggled. \u201cWe had to get a taxi.\u201d</p><p>She paused as their laughter died away, then said quietly, \u201cI wish you\u2019d been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d he told her. \u201cMaybe one day we\u2019ll go back together.\u201d Grant had said that, too.... Just then, Annie opened the sliding glass door, wearing a sleeveless summer dress Bethanne had never seen before. She must have purchased it in Branson.</p><p>\u201cI need to go,\u201d Bethanne said hurriedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too. Give my best to Rooster.\u201d</p><p>As she ended the call, she experienced a piercing sense of loss. Instead of feeling better, she felt worse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWas that Max?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>Bethanne nodded.</p><p>\u201cDad called,\u201d Annie continued. \u201cHis flight landed on time and he\u2019s on his way to Vero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGrandma suggested he join us for dinner,\u201d Annie said, leaning against the glass door.</p><p>Bethanne\u2019s voice was cool. \u201cWhat about the conference? Won\u2019t he be missing that?\u201d</p><p>Annie shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Bethanne wondered if there even was a conference. It had certainly come up very conveniently.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to get ready for dinner?\u201d Annie prompted.</p> <p>Reluctantly, Bethanne stood up and prepared to go back inside the room.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Annie murmured, putting a hand on her arm. \u201cGrandma\u2019s pretty nervous about seeing Royce. You might want to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to do that?\u201d Bethanne searched Annie\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You always managed with me.\u201d Annie smiled.</p><p>\u201cBut...Ruth isn\u2019t my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend she is.\u201d Annie glanced over her shoulder. \u201cSomeone\u2019s got to do something. She\u2019s pacing back and forth, and I\u2019m afraid if she sprays on any more cologne she might set off the fire alarm.\u201d</p> <p>Sure enough, Bethanne found her pacing the length of the room, pausing only to gnaw on her cuticles.</p><p>\u201cGive me fifteen minutes,\u201d she told Ruth.</p><p>\u201cFifteen minutes for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo take a quick shower and change clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m taking you to the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let Royce find me in the bar!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can.\u201d Bethanne adopted her firmest parental tone. \u201cNow, don\u2019t argue with me.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth stared at her like a forest animal caught in the headlights of an oncoming car.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Bethanne escorted her to the lounge, which was a cozy, unpretentious place, with an old-fashioned wooden U-shaped bar and a few mismatched tables and chairs. A cheerful bartender took their drink order. Bethanne asked for two glasses of white wine, which were brought to the table a few minutes later.</p><p>Ruth took one sip and nearly coughed her lungs out.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Bethanne pounded her on the back.</p><p>Ruth shook her head vigorously.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bethanne asked, startled.</p><p>\u201cRoyce just came in,\u201d she whispered, while she dug in her purse for a tissue to wipe her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Bethanne scanned the dimly lit room.</p><p>Ruth nodded toward the tall, silver-haired man who\u2019d just slipped onto a bar stool with his back to them.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Bethanne whispered.</p><p>Ruth seemed paralyzed with fright. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can face him.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne was surprised to see Ruth\u2019s hands trembling.</p><p>\u201cI hurt him so much...\u201d she began in a broken voice that Bethanne had never heard before.</p><p>\u201cRuth, you were young.... I\u2019m sure he\u2019s gotten over it\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ruth cut her off with a sharp shake of her head. \u201cHe might have, but I\u2019m not sure I ever can.\u201d She sat for several minutes, clutching the now-tattered wisp of tissue. Then, as Bethanne watched, she slid out of her chair and squared her shoulders.</p><p>Bethanne gave her a smile of encouragement.</p><p>Ruth walked up behind Royce and placed her hand on his shoulder.</p><p>Royce whirled around. His face registered shock. For a long moment all they did was stare at each other. \u201cRuth... Ruth, is that really you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I changed so much?\u201d she asked, taking a step back, as if dreading the answer. She pressed her fingers to her lips, seemingly on the verge of tears.</p><p>\u201cNo, no...\u201d He blinked, apparently to clear his vision. \u201cYou\u2019re even more beautiful now. More beautiful than I remembered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyce...\u201d she said, then faltered.</p><p>They embraced wordlessly, then he took Ruth\u2019s face in his hands as he gazed down at her.</p><p>Just then, Annie entered the bar, having updated her Facebook page with photos from the road. Taking in the reunion between Ruth and Royce, she broke into a huge smile and gave Bethanne a thumbs-up.</p><p>Royce\u2019s grandson, Craig, was the next to arrive; shortly after he joined the party and introductions were made, Bethanne noticed that he and Annie fell into animated conversation. Royce and Ruth hardly looked up, drowning in each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Leaning back in her seat, Bethanne savored her wine and surveyed the scene. In a few days\u2019 time they\u2019d fly home to Seattle and Bethanne would return to her regular life, but she wouldn\u2019t be the same woman. The trip had changed her. It had changed them all. The three of them had grown close, sharing their secrets, confronting their fears. And despite some moments of tension, they\u2019d come to understand and support one another in new ways.</p><p>She was so immersed in her thoughts that she almost missed Grant\u2019s entrance. He walked into the bar and glanced around, brightening when he saw her. To her surprise, Bethanne felt a surge of affection. Tall and lean, Grant still cut a striking figure, and his energy was palpable. They\u2019d been a good match\u2014partly because Bethanne had always been content to remain in the background, his silent partner in more ways than one.</p><p>His smile was electric, transforming his entire face. As he started toward her, she was reminded of his ability to make people feel they were the sole focus of his attention. Over the years, she\u2019d heard many of his colleagues talk about his charisma and its effect on clients. He obviously still had it.</p><p>Ruth spotted her son before he reached Bethanne and pulled him over to make introductions. Grant caught her eye and winked, but when the three couples sat down together, he was trapped on the other side of the table. After sharing a bottle of wine, they all left for dinner at the restaurant beside the hotel.</p><p>The Ocean Grill boasted an interesting assortment of wrought iron, stained glass and other collectibles. While they were being seated at their table next to the window, Grant wangled a seat next to Bethanne. Outside, the surf roared against the sand and groups of tourists walked the beach, waves crashing at their feet.</p><p>Bethanne felt Grant\u2019s hand touch hers beneath the table. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She gave him a fleeting smile but kept her eyes on the menu. The truth was, he\u2019d been in her thoughts more than she wanted to admit. Despite her reservations, his familiar presence brought back the glow of happier times. Grant slipped comfortably into his role as father and son\u2014something that Max, for all his intensity, could never do. She studied him as he chatted effortlessly with Royce and Ruth, full of high spirits and completely at ease. Grant was family, and that was difficult to ignore or dismiss.</p><p>The wine flowed as the evening progressed, and Bethanne relaxed. At Royce\u2019s urging, she ordered the pompano with apricot sauce and found it outstanding. As was typical, Grant and Annie both ordered the same entr\u00e9e\u2014the stone crab claws\u2014which they ate with gusto.</p><p>After dinner Annie and Craig went for a walk along the beach. Royce and Ruth did, too, leaving Grant and Bethanne alone at the table. Bethanne stirred her coffee, suddenly self-conscious.</p><p>\u201cI brought you something,\u201d Grant said.</p><p>\u201cFrom Seattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d He reached inside his dinner jacket and took out a small wrapped package.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to buy me gifts,\u201d she protested, although she couldn\u2019t suppress her curiosity. Grant had always been a generous and original gift-giver; it was one of his talents. He never once forgot an anniversary or her birthday, and outdid himself from year to year in the extravagance and thoughtfulness of his presents.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to have this,\u201d he said as she untied the bow and removed the paper.</p><p>The instant she saw the box, Bethanne knew.</p><p>Nestled inside was the button she\u2019d seen in the antique store in New Orleans. Annie had obviously mentioned it to him; he must have ordered it that same night.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much,\u201d she breathed, recalling the story about the soldiers and their sweethearts.</p><p>\u201cEvery time you look at that button,\u201d he said, his head close to hers, \u201cI want you to think of me.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>That evening with Royce, Ruth felt as if the years had evaporated, and they were eighteen again. They talked nonstop without a trace of awkwardness, until Ruth realized it was midnight\u2014and they were alone.</p><p>Bethanne and Annie had turned in for the night. Craig must have gone home. Apparently, Grant had driven back to Orlando, although she didn\u2019t remember him leaving. All Ruth could see, the whole night long, was Royce. All she\u2019d heard was what he said. Everything else was a blur.</p><p>Before he left her at the door of her room, Royce had asked if he could pick her up the next morning and take her to his home on the Indian River. Ruth had agreed. Not once had he mentioned the circumstances of their parting fifty years ago, but she felt its shadow, even in their happiest recollections. Ruth wished they could leave the past buried, but she knew that unless they confronted it now, it could destroy any hope of a future. All that shame and pain...</p><p>Unable to sleep with such thoughts chasing through her head, Ruth rose before Bethanne and Annie and dressed, taking special care with her hair and makeup. The humidity in Florida during summer was unrelenting. She didn\u2019t expect her hair to stay in place, but felt she had to make the effort.</p><p>For Royce.</p><p>\u201cGrandma, what are you doing up so early?\u201d Annie asked groggily as Ruth came out of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s early for you,\u201d Annie observed. Generally, Ruth was the one who lingered in bed. \u201cHave you done your exercises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Ruth smoothed a stray curl into place. \u201cI\u2019m seeing Royce this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains it,\u201d Bethanne murmured from the other side of the bed, next to Annie.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy meeting Craig?\u201d Ruth asked her granddaughter. While her attention had been focused mostly on Royce, she did notice the two young people talking, their heads close together.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really nice.\u201d Annie\u2019s face shone with what looked like genuine enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing him again?\u201d Ruth asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taking me out on the river\u2014he promised we\u2019ll see manatees and dolphins.\u201d Annie stretched contentedly. \u201cYou never told me Florida was so beautiful, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has its own unique beauty, just like the Pacific Northwest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know when you\u2019ll be back?\u201d Bethanne pushed herself into a sitting position, running a hand through her tousled hair.</p><p>\u201cNo...I\u2019ll give you a call later. If Annie\u2019s with Craig, what are you going to do all day?\u201d She hated the thought of Bethanne stuck in the hotel room or out on her own, and hoped Grant wouldn\u2019t be tied up in those boring Realtor meetings.</p><p>\u201cGrant\u2019s stopping by,\u201d Bethanne assured her. \u201cHe\u2019s got a session this morning, but he should be finished by lunchtime. We\u2019re going to meet up around one o\u2019clock.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat will you do this morning?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne climbed out of bed. \u201cI thought I\u2019d laze by the pool and read. I have my knitting, too, so I\u2019ve got plenty to do. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d She waved a hand at Ruth. \u201cEnjoy your day with Royce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Ruth glanced at her watch.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right between you?\u201d Bethanne asked Ruth in a meaningful tone.</p> <p>Ruth shifted uncomfortably. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know yet. I haven\u2019t really had a chance to talk to him...about everything.\u201d She shot Bethanne an anxious look. \u201cI\u2019ll call you this afternoon, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Bethanne blew her a kiss and Annie sent her off with a big smile. Certain that she was a few minutes early, Ruth headed into the lobby in search of a newspaper and a cup of coffee. To her surprise, Royce was already waiting, his newspaper unfolded in front of him.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said. Just seeing him made her pulse race uncontrollably. It seemed impossible that fifty years had passed. Being with him felt so familiar, like rediscovering a language she\u2019d spoken as a child. But could he ever forgive what she\u2019d done?</p><p>Royce refolded his newspaper and stood. \u201cRuth...\u201d he began, and then fell silent.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d Ruth said nervously. \u201cI hardly slept last night,\u201d she confessed, hoping he could read what was on her mind.</p> <p>Royce frowned and looked away. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep much myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping we can really...talk this morning.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI suppose we should.\u201d Reaching for her hand, he tucked it in the crook of his arm. \u201cWe have a lot to discuss, but before we do, I want you to know what bliss it\u2019s been to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same.\u201d Ruth had never expected to have a second chance with him, and this time she was determined not to ruin things between them.</p><p>He escorted her to his car, and opened her door the way he had when they were teenagers. Royce had always been a gentleman, even as an impoverished boy of eighteen.</p><p>Instead of driving to his home on the river, he went in the direction of Orchid Island.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Ruth asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d start the day with a glass of freshly squeezed Indian River orange juice.\u201d</p><p>She guessed he was taking her to his childhood home. \u201cYour father sold the groves, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d Royce grinned over at her. \u201cMy brother bought him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArnie?\u201d She squinted at him in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cBenny,\u201d Royce corrected. He was the oldest in the family. Arnie, she recalled, was the youngest.</p><p>When they got to the property, he drove right in, along a row of perfectly aligned orange trees, stopping at the end. \u201cRemember our prom night?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ruth laughed. \u201cHow could I forget it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven my children and their children know the story of how we arrived at the dance looking like a pair of miserable water rats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too.\u201d</p><p>Royce glanced at her. \u201cDid I understand you right? Didn\u2019t you say that Bethanne and Grant are divorced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey looked like a couple to me.\u201d</p><p>Ruth hugged herself. \u201cThey did, didn\u2019t they? I can\u2019t tell you how thrilled I am to see the two of them together again. We came upon some bikers\u2014motorcyclists\u2014on the road... Well, Bethanne seems to have taken a liking to one of them. I have to tell you how concerned I am that she might actually be falling for this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t seem to be the case last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom your lips to God\u2019s ear,\u201d Ruth said fervently. \u201cGrant went through a midlife crisis,\u201d she said by way of explanation.</p><p>\u201cWhich led to the divorce, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did, but thankfully he realized how foolish he\u2019s been. I\u2019m grateful that he\u2019s smart enough to see what\u2019s truly important. He\u2019s doing everything he can to get his family back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish him well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Ruth drew in a deep, fortifying breath and forged ahead, fearing that if she put this off any longer, she wouldn\u2019t have the courage to say it later. \u201cSpeaking of being foolish, I\u2014I want to apologize for the way I ended things....\u201d She turned in her seat to face him, twisting the strap of her handbag. \u201cI\u2019ve agonized over my actions all these years, wishing I could rewrite that part of our history....\u201d She let her words trail off. A knot had formed in her throat. She didn\u2019t list her offenses; he knew them as well as she did. \u201cMore than anything, I regret causing you pain. I was young and so foolish and I wish\u2014\u201d Her voice cracked.</p><p>In the silence that followed, Royce placed his hand over Ruth\u2019s, which still clenched her purse strap.</p><p>\u201cI forgave you a long time ago,\u201d he said slowly. His gaze flickered to hers, serious and tender. For a moment Ruth was speechless.</p><p>\u201cBut how could you?\u201d she finally croaked out.</p><p>He smiled wistfully, staring at the orderly stretch of trees. \u201cI won\u2019t say it was easy...\u201d he began. \u201cFor a while I was convinced I\u2019d never love any woman again.\u201d He shook his head at some unnamed memory. \u201cFortunately, I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d loved his wife. Ruth was relieved to know that.</p><p>\u201cLife has a way of setting things right,\u201d he continued with a philosophical shrug. \u201cI married Barbara, and we had three remarkable children. I have no regrets.\u201d He squeezed Ruth\u2019s hand lightly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any, either. You and Richard were happy, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She had been happy\u2014as happy as she\u2019d made up her mind to be. She and Richard both had their faults, but they\u2019d created a good life together. And while she\u2019d often wondered what would\u2019ve happened if she\u2019d married Royce, she hadn\u2019t allowed herself to obsess over it.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we can really put the past behind us?\u201d she ventured. \u201cCan you accept my apology?\u201d</p><p>Royce looked over at her.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. His eyes brimmed with forgiveness, and something more. Ruth released her death grip on her purse and let her fingers curl around Royce\u2019s. For long minutes, they sat there in silence, each afraid to break the spell.</p><p>Royce\u2019s brother Benny met them soon after. They exchanged greetings, and then Benny gave Ruth a short tour, which concluded with Benny pouring them each a glass of fresh-squeezed, extra-sweet orange juice.</p><p>Ruth sipped hers, savoring this reminder of her childhood. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten how good Indian River oranges are.\u201d She sighed. This was orange juice at its finest; after all, Floridians took pride in the fact that it had been served at the White House.</p><p>As they walked back to the car, Royce pointed to a gnarled, fruit-laden tree at the edge of the grove. \u201cI kissed you there for the first time,\u201d he said, nostalgia coloring his voice.</p><p>\u201cNot there,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cIt was the second tree back.\u201d</p><p>Royce stared at her in amazement. \u201cYou remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Royce had always been\u2014and evidently still was\u2014a hopeless romantic. \u201cI\u2019d dropped by on some pretext about bringing your homework to you or something equally inane.\u201d She rolled her eyes at the transparency of it. \u201cYou walked me out to the car and asked if I\u2019d ever been in an orange grove before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hadn\u2019t, so I offered to show you around,\u201d he went on. His face lit up at the memory.</p><p>\u201cI lied,\u201d Ruth crowed. \u201cGood grief, Royce, I\u2019d grown up around the groves!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied?\u201d He pretended to be shocked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no dummy. I was hoping you were going to kiss me and I didn\u2019t want to ruin my chances.\u201d</p><p>Royce opened the car door for her. \u201cAs I recall, I was all teeth and no finesse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall,\u201d she countered, \u201cthe minute your lips met mine, my toes curled up and I nearly swooned.\u201d</p><p>Royce laughed and Ruth did, too. He raised her hand to his lips and gently pressed a kiss against her knuckles. \u201cI can assure you I\u2019m a much better kisser these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor that matter, so am I,\u201d she said archly.</p><p>They drove back across the Seventeenth Avenue bridge, heading south once they reached the island. Royce\u2019s home presided over a narrow strip of land, with a view of the Atlantic Ocean from the front door and the Indian River from the back. Parking in the circular driveway outside his two-story house, he led her up the brick steps. When he ushered her in, the first things she saw were the large French doors that offered an expansive view of the Indian River. It wasn\u2019t really a river, she knew\u2014it was part of an inland waterway that stretched from Florida to Maine. Filled with brackish water, the waterway teemed with fish and fowl and was home to various marine animals. As a child she could remember lying on her belly on the dock, petting the manatees. Before the days when such contact was frowned upon, Ruth had discovered that manatees and dolphins were intensely curious creatures, apparently as eager to learn about humans as humans were to learn about them.</p><p>\u201cOh, Royce, this is magnificent.\u201d She stepped around the table in the center of the foyer, barely noticing the huge floral arrangement that dominated it. \u201cHow long have you lived here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while now...\u201d Royce gestured around him. \u201cTen years, I\u2019d say. Since I retired from the math department at the University of Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always wanted a home on the river,\u201d she reminded him. In their teens they\u2019d spent many afternoons talking about their future. Naturally they\u2019d be married. They\u2019d chosen to ignore the fact that her family disapproved of him. They\u2019d blithely planned to have two children and had even chosen their names: Molly and Royce, Jr.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to be a stewardess, remember?\u201d Royce stared out over the water. \u201cSorry, I guess these days they\u2019re called flight attendants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d That would\u2019ve been a dream job, being able to travel around the world. \u201cInstead, I stayed home and brought up my children. Richard was a good provider and wanted it that way,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cLater, after they were grown, I did tons of volunteer work.\u201d</p><p>Following his father\u2019s example, Grant had wanted the same for his wife and children. Bethanne had only worked outside the home briefly, before Andrew was born. From then on, her daughter-in-law had been an energetic and committed homemaker. It had been a rather old-fashioned choice, perhaps, and at odds with the times, since those years were the height of the women\u2019s movement. Still, Bethanne had seemed content, throwing herself into supporting Grant\u2019s career and being an ultra-attentive mother. Oh, how Ruth wished Grant had appreciated his wife more.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Royce asked, moving to stand close beside her.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing...just getting caught up in memories.\u201d She shrugged, the silk of her blouse whispering against Royce\u2019s arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf us?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo...my son. What Grant failed to realize when he left Bethanne was that she was the secret behind his success. She filled the same role for him that I did for Richard.\u201d Ruth shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to take a wife for granted, I suppose.\u201d She raised her eyes to meet Royce\u2019s. \u201cBethanne gave everything she had to my son, and he tossed her aside for a younger woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be the first man to make that mistake,\u201d Royce said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I doubt he\u2019ll be the last.\u201d Ruth sighed.</p> <p>Royce wrapped his arm around her and pulled her close. \u201cWe still worry about our children, don\u2019t we?\u201d he murmured in her ear. \u201cNo matter what their ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help myself,\u201d Ruth admitted miserably, leaning into Royce\u2019s comforting bulk. Grant wasn\u2019t her only concern. Robin was so similar to her father, and Ruth often feared her daughter would end up just like Richard, consumed by her job. In her darkest moments, Ruth imagined Robin dying young from a heart attack, without ever having really lived.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your children,\u201d she said, hungry to learn everything about him.</p><p>\u201cWell...Peter, my oldest, is an attorney. He\u2019s married and has two children. Maureen is a pharmacist who was playing doctor with her dolls from the time she was two years old. She was constantly scribbling prescriptions and taking them to the drugstore. Our youngest son, Kent, went into the ministry, serving God in Haiti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Royce, it sounds like you have an incredible family.\u201d Ruth looked up at him.</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m truly blessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a good wife,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he agreed. \u201cThe kids turned out well, mostly because of Barbara\u2014I miss her every single day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho does Craig belong to?\u201d Ruth asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Maureen\u2019s son. He works with Kent part of the year in Haiti. He\u2019s still got a year of medical school. He has a true commitment to serving those who are suffering and in need of healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems like a wonderful young man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe is, and he was quite taken with Annie.\u201d Royce winked as he said it.</p><p>Ruth beamed. \u201cShe liked him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night when I asked Craig to join us for dinner, he said yes, but I could tell he wasn\u2019t keen on the idea. When I woke up this morning, he\u2019d left a message on my phone, thanking me for introducing him to Annie.\u201d</p><p>Ruth laughed delightedly. Annie was going to have plenty of male choices, she thought. That boy in Europe had some real competition now.</p><p>Royce turned to her, smiling. \u201cWould you like a ride down the river?\u201d</p><p>Ruth clutched at his hand, her face alight with pleasure. \u201cOh, Royce, could we really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could take a stroll down memory lane, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds heavenly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember John Bolinger?\u201d he asked as he led the way to the river dock.</p><p>\u201cOf course. He was a good friend of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill is. He\u2019ll be at the reunion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Connie Keenan?\u201d Ruth wondered.</p><p>\u201cLast I heard, she\u2019d signed up, too.\u201d</p><p>Ruth clung to Royce\u2019s arm as they stepped carefully across the planks of the dock. He stopped just short of the motorboat anchored at the end of the walkway. Turning to face her, he lifted his free hand to touch her cheek.</p><p>\u201cFor me, the most important name on that list was yours. Oh, Ruth, I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Ruth couldn\u2019t speak for the emotions that flooded her. Tears pricked her eyes and she lowered her face so Royce wouldn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d she finally managed. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>Bethanne spent a lazy morning at the hotel, sleeping in late, while both Annie and Ruth went out for the day. Annie took off early with Craig, and Ruth was with Royce. Those two had been inseparable almost from the moment they\u2019d seen each other the night before. Bethanne hoped they could resolve the past. It seemed promising because they obviously both wanted the same thing.</p><p>Young love, first love. Grant had been Bethanne\u2019s first love, and Ruth was right. There was indeed something special about giving your heart away for the first time. While it might not be possible to recapture what they\u2019d once shared, she\u2019d always have her memories of loving Grant.</p><p>Grant.</p><p>Max.</p><p>All at once Bethanne was too confused to know what she wanted. With Max everything was fresh and new. With Grant she carried\u2014and would always carry\u2014the baggage of his infidelity. Someone looking at the situation from outside might feel a decision between the two men was simple because of that painful history. It wasn\u2019t. She and Max hadn\u2019t even had their first disagreement. To this point all was bliss, but she was mature enough to understand that wouldn\u2019t last.</p><p>Bethanne had the whole morning to herself. After a leisurely breakfast of orange juice and toast by the pool, she took a long walk on the beach. She\u2019d purposely left her cell phone behind, hoping to duck any and all responsibilities for the next hour or so.</p><p>The surf pounded the shore as she strolled down the sandy shoreline, which was nearly deserted. The breeze offered a respite from the heat and humidity. She wore a large straw hat she\u2019d bought at the hotel gift shop and walked barefoot, her feet making soft indentations in the wet sand.</p><p>Mainly, her mind was occupied with thoughts of Max. Other than their brief conversation the day before, they hadn\u2019t spoken again. She realized he was giving her this time with her family, in much the same way Grant had given her time with Max. Was respect between rivals like honor among thieves? That concept made her smile, even if the comparison didn\u2019t quite work.</p><p>She tried to be sensible and realistic about Max, and yet whenever she thought about never talking to him again, never seeing him again, an instant sadness settled over her. It didn\u2019t seem possible that she\u2019d come to care for a man so quickly and yet she had.</p><p>No one had made her feel the way Max did\u2014at least not since the divorce. After six years of grief and anger, six years of forgettable relationships, Bethanne felt she might be incapable of giving her heart to another man...ever. She\u2019d loved Grant completely, totally. When she spoke her wedding vows she\u2019d meant them to be forever. Until death do us part... Not until someone better, cuter, younger or sexier comes along. Forever.</p><p>Grant.</p><p>Last evening he\u2019d been so good with both Annie and Ruth, and yes, with her, too. He seemed sincere in his desire to make amends. As Ruth had said more than once, it took a big man to admit when he was wrong. Grant wanted her back and yet she had to ask herself: Could he still bring her happiness? Could they be happy together again? She\u2019d forgiven him to the best of her ability, but she wasn\u2019t confident she could trust him. Whenever he came home late, how would she know he hadn\u2019t been with another woman? She\u2019d never asked if there\u2019d been anyone before Tiffany. In truth, she didn\u2019t want to know, and chose to believe Tiffany had been his only indiscretion.</p><p>Sitting on the beach, she brought her knees up and dragged her fingers through the sand while her thoughts darted like bumblebees, flitting in one direction and then another. This decision was the most difficult she\u2019d ever had to make.</p><p>Giving Grant hope for a reconciliation meant she\u2019d have to forget about Max. If they were to have any chance of being a couple again, she\u2019d have to give the relationship one hundred percent. That probably required counseling, for him and for her.</p><p>Bethanne wasn\u2019t so naive that she didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d played a role in the breakdown of their marriage, too. She\u2019d become complacent, too involved in her children and their activities. Grant left it up to her to arrange their social outings and she\u2019d grown lax about setting aside time for just the two of them. They hadn\u2019t done anything to nurture their marriage. The blame for that, she knew, should be equally divided.</p><p>Another flaw on her part was her inability to recognize what was happening in Grant\u2019s life. In retrospect she must\u2019ve been blind not to have noticed the signs. They\u2019d all been there, as blatant as could be\u2014almost as if Grant had wanted her to know. Perhaps he did, so she\u2019d do something to stop him, something to show how much she loved him. But Bethanne had been oblivious to it all. She\u2019d ignored the significance of countless late nights at the office and some imaginary big deal that never took place. Ignored the extra time Grant spent on his grooming each morning. She\u2019d taken everything at face value, including the small unexpected gifts he brought home for no particular reason, gifts no doubt motivated by guilt. She\u2019d ignored all of these signs, content to go blindly about her life, wrapped up in her daily routines.</p><p>Andrew had pitched for his high school baseball team that spring and Grant had attended only one game. Not once did she question his excuses. Their son was about to head into his senior year of high school and she was working on the grad night committee and\u2014</p><p>Oh, what good did it do to dredge up ancient history? Closing her eyes, Bethanne fought back waves of regret, determined not to let them drown her in sadness and confusion. She was past this, past Grant.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u201cBethanne?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of her name, she turned to find her ex-husband walking toward her. He looked relaxed and fit and\u2014all right, she\u2019d admit it\u2014handsome. He wore white cotton pants and a printed floral shirt that showed off his tanned arms.</p><p>Bethanne glanced at her watch. It couldn\u2019t possibly be one o\u2019clock yet. Wrong. It was almost one-thirty.</p><p>Grant sat down in the sand next to her. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think when I couldn\u2019t get ahold of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea so much time had passed.\u201d She\u2019d been on the beach for more than two hours. Thankfully, she\u2019d lathered on sunscreen; otherwise, she would\u2019ve burned to a crisp.</p><p>\u201cHave you had lunch?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fish-and-chip place down the beach. Royce mentioned it yesterday. How about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She wasn\u2019t hungry but he probably was.</p><p>Grant helped her to her feet, and they started walking along the beach in the opposite direction. He took her hand, intertwining their fingers.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember our first date?\u201d he said.</p><p>Of course she did. \u201cWe had fish and chips on the Seattle waterfront.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t have enough money for two orders so we shared the one,\u201d he said, grinning down at her.</p><p>\u201cAnd the seagull stole your french fry.\u201d She smiled at the memory of Grant chasing after the bird, demanding his french fry back. She\u2019d laughed herself silly and recalled thinking she could really fall for this guy. \u201cWe were so young.\u201d</p><p>Grant\u2019s eyes smiled back at her. They reached the small restaurant and chose to eat indoors in the cool, air-conditioned room. The tables were mismatched but the aromas that filled the place were enough to convince Bethanne she had more of an appetite than she realized. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They shared an order of fish and fries, for old times\u2019 sake. When their meal was delivered, Grant said, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the only time I was short on cash. Remember the night Andrew was born?\u201d</p><p>As if she could ever forget. \u201cWhat I remember is your panic when I told you I might be in labor. You immediately started doing the breathing exercises I was supposed to do until I thought you were about to hyperventilate.\u201d Bethanne had been afraid they\u2019d have to call an Aid Car for her husband.</p><p>\u201cWhat you didn\u2019t know was that I hadn\u2019t paid the doctor everything we owed him and I was worried he wouldn\u2019t deliver the baby without being paid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. McMahon never said a word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank goodness.\u201d Grant slathered a french fry with ketchup and popped it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou so badly wanted a son,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI did not,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI would\u2019ve been happy with either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said,\u201d she muttered, and picked up a fry, dipping it in a pool of ketchup. \u201cBut when the doctor announced we had a son, you gave the loudest whoop I\u2019d ever heard and high-fived the nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most certainly did not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was there. I remember it clearly, Grant Hamlin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expected another boy when you had Annie.\u201d He smiled, his gaze turned inward. \u201cI fell head over heels for that baby girl.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne had to agree. Annie held her daddy\u2019s heart in the palm of her hand the first moment he laid eyes on her. The only time their relationship had been strained was shortly before and then after the divorce. Everything seemed back to normal between them now, and for that Bethanne was grateful. Annie needed her father\u2019s love and approval perhaps even more than she did Bethanne\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when Andrew got pneumonia?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne set down her fork and reached for a napkin to wipe the grease from her fingers. Their son had been just eighteen months old and she\u2019d already taken him to the pediatrician twice that week. The nurse had made her feel she was being overprotective and a bother. That night Andrew wasn\u2019t any better and she\u2019d held her son in her arms for hours as he struggled to breathe. First thing the next morning, she drove him to the doctor again, ready to face down that dragon of a nurse, only to have the doctor explode in anger at her for not getting Andrew to the hospital. Bethanne had burst into tears. She\u2019d phoned Grant, who met her at Emergency and gently took her in his arms. He\u2019d been her strength when their son was put in an oxygen tent.</p><p>\u201cThere were some hard times when the kids were growing up, weren\u2019t there?\u201d Bethanne said. She swore Annie had the worst case of chicken pox of any child she knew. They went down her throat and into her stomach. The poor child had been miserable for days. No one else had slept, either.</p> <p>\u201cWe had plenty of good memories, too.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne had to agree they did. \u201cLike our tenth wedding anniversary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were so confident your high school Italian would be enough for us to get around by ourselves,\u201d Bethanne said, wondering if he recalled some of their adventures.</p><p>\u201cWe could afford the plane fare and that cheap hotel and food, of course, but not much else,\u201d Grant was quick to add.</p><p>Not that Bethanne needed any reminders. Their budget had been squeaky tight and they were unable to afford any tours. All at once she began to laugh. When Grant gave her an odd look, she covered her mouth and muttered, \u201cThe cheese. Don\u2019t you remember the cheese?\u201d</p><p>Grant stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have forgotten the cheese.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe bought cheese?\u201d he asked, his eyes widening.</p><p>Still laughing, Bethanne nudged him. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding\u2014you really don\u2019t remember? You were so sure you could make yourself understood. The Englishman at the hotel suggested a cheese shop, but somehow we got the directions wrong.\u201d</p><p>Grant shrugged; the story appeared to have been erased from his memory.</p><p>\u201cWe stopped in another store to ask about the cheese shop, and the owner kept shaking her head as you chatted away, looking for directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt in brilliant Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d she echoed. \u201cThen the owner smiled, went into the back room and returned with two candlesticks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it to you to remember that,\u201d Grant said with a grin. \u201cWe did eventually find the cheese shop, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually, after we stopped laughing.\u201d</p><p>Grant\u2019s eyes darkened then, and he grew serious as he reached for a paper napkin and dabbed the edges of his mouth. \u201cWe were happy, Bethanne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, as her amusement faded. \u201cWe were.\u201d He\u2019d told her that more than once, and these reminiscences had confirmed the truth of it.</p><p>\u201cWe can be again.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes held. She longed to believe him, longed for some reassurance that the possibility was as real as it felt in that moment. Life during the past six years had taught her that the future didn\u2019t come with any guarantees.</p><p>\u201cI want to believe that, Grant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll give me the opportunity to make you happy.\u201d He took her hand. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking is that we put the past behind us and try again.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unsure how to respond. Being with Max had felt so right but he remained a mystery. When it came down to it, she knew shockingly little about him. He kept everything close to his chest, almost as if he was afraid to share too much of himself with her...with anyone.</p><p>Grant was safe, a known quantity. Yes, his betrayal had come between them, damaged them; despite that they knew each other as well as any two people who\u2019d spent twenty years as husband and wife possibly could.</p><p>Or did they? She couldn\u2019t help wondering if Grant recognized the changes in her.</p><p>\u201cWhy the frown?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI was frowning?\u201d Bethanne hadn\u2019t been aware that her uncertainty showed so easily on her face. \u201cDo you really know me, Grant?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe woman I am today isn\u2019t the woman I was when we divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that. I\u2019ll admit you surprised me, Bethanne. You have an uncanny mind for business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a good teacher.\u201d She doubted that Grant knew how much she\u2019d learned from him.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d he asked, astonishment reflected in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou. When I hosted those dinner parties,\u201d she elaborated, \u201cI socialized with your business associates, listened to their stories\u2014and yours. You\u2019re good with people, Grant. They like and trust you right away. That\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never understood how much of a team we were until...until I was on my own,\u201d Grant said. \u201cYou did far more than arrange those social events. You were my emotional support, my encourager. I owed a great deal of my success to you and I was too self-absorbed to see it.\u201d</p><p>Hearing him admit her importance to his career felt good. More than good. His acknowledgment validated her in ways she hadn\u2019t expected.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, hardly able to speak.</p><p>\u201cI realize now that I didn\u2019t appreciate you nearly enough. Fool that I am, I walked away from the one person in this world who complemented me better than anyone else ever could.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her and she toward him, and their lips met in a sweet, gentle kiss.</p><p>Bethanne drew back. If she thought this time in Florida, away from Max, would clear her head, she was wrong. She stood abruptly and grabbed her purse, ready to go. Their kiss had been...comfortable. And that had unsettled her.</p><p>Watching her closely, Grant stood, too. He\u2019d paid for their lunch when he\u2019d placed the order, so they were free to leave. They walked back to the hotel, side by side. He didn\u2019t reach for her hand and Bethanne was grateful. She wasn\u2019t sure what she felt. No, that wasn\u2019t it. She felt too much. Too many different emotions. Contradictory emotions. She longed to call Max and tell him what had happened, discuss it with him. But they\u2019d made no promises to each other, no commitments. In fact, everything had been left unresolved.</p><p>As they walked, Grant peered down the beach. \u201cIs that Annie and Craig?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Bethanne looked up and nodded.</p><p>Annie saw them and waved, and then, with Craig at her side, she raced toward Bethanne and Grant.</p><p>\u201cMom, Dad,\u201d Annie said, sounding breathless and excited. \u201cCraig and I have the most fantastic idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d Bethanne asked.</p><p>Still gasping, Annie pressed her hand over her heart. \u201cWe want to redo prom night for Grandma and Royce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole thing,\u201d Craig said, equally excited. \u201cFrom beginning to end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? How exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dinner and photos, a limo and a dance and everything,\u201d Annie explained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already talked to the manager of the restaurant at your hotel and there\u2019s a private room we can use,\u201d Craig said.</p><p>Annie exchanged a smile with Royce\u2019s grandson. \u201cCraig has a friend who drives part-time for a limo company, and he checked and they have a car available Saturday night....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Gramps would love to redo that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we?\u201d Annie\u2019s eyes seemed twice their normal size as she implored them to consider the idea.</p><p>Grant looked at Bethanne and she looked at him. She\u2019d had enough experience throwing parties that this one wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it happen,\u201d she said.</p><p>Grant nodded. \u201cJust tell me what you need me to do.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Seven</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Ruth asked in a bewildered voice. Her eyes shot to Bethanne, who merely shrugged. They wouldn\u2019t be able to keep the secret much longer, but she knew Annie wanted to play this out to the last possible second.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going shopping, Grandma,\u201d Annie said, steering her grandmother out of the hotel room and down the hallway toward the lobby.</p><p>\u201cBut why? I brought everything I need. Will you two kindly tell me what you\u2019ve got up your sleeves? And don\u2019t you say it\u2019s nothing, because I know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have everything you need,\u201d Annie insisted.</p><p>\u201cSurely you\u2019ve learned not to argue with Annie,\u201d Bethanne said, closing the door to their room and hurrying after them.</p><p>\u201cJust where are you taking me?\u201d Ruth demanded.</p><p>\u201cShopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found a perfect store right here on the beach that I want to show you,\u201d Annie said. \u201cWe can walk there. Come on, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you two are up to,\u201d Ruth muttered, clearly confused but curious nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think we\u2019re up to anything?\u201d Bethanne asked innocently. She\u2019d done her best to arrange everything without raising Ruth\u2019s suspicions, but it\u2019d been difficult. For the past twenty-four hours she\u2019d met with florists, musicians and photographers. She\u2019d run herself ragged and worked a miracle. Or what she hoped would be a miracle. Grant had talked to Royce and he\u2019d agreed to do whatever he could to pull this off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Royce had contacted a number of their high school friends in town, including Jane and Diane. Meanwhile, Annie, Craig and Grant had been busy decorating the hotel restaurant\u2019s private room, recreating prom night with the theme of Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, the same as it\u2019d been fifty years earlier.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time you spilled the beans,\u201d Ruth said, planting her feet squarely on the sidewalk and refusing to budge.</p><p>Annie\u2019s shoulders heaved in a sigh. \u201cI guess we might as well,\u201d she said, glancing at Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d Bethanne agreed, trying not to smile.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Annie said, looking at her grandmother. \u201cCraig and I were talking and I asked him if he knew what happened the night of your senior prom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Bethanne added, \u201cbecause he was well aware of what a disaster it turned out to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was thinking,\u201d Annie said, picking up the story, \u201cwhat a shame it was that the two of you were so disappointed. Then Craig said it was too bad we couldn\u2019t turn back the clock and do it all over again.\u201d</p><p>Annie threw her hands in the air as if that was explanation enough.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when the two of them came to Grant and me,\u201d Bethanne said.</p> <p>\u201cWith the idea of redoing prom night for you and Royce.\u201d Annie\u2019s face glowed with pride. \u201cOnly this time we\u2019re going to make sure everything goes perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRedoing prom night,\u201d Ruth repeated.</p><p>\u201cSo right now we\u2019re taking you to pick up your prom dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick it up? My goodness, I can\u2019t imagine where that old dress went.... The rain must have ruined it. In any case, I don\u2019t recall ever seeing it again. And need I mention that it most likely wouldn\u2019t fit even if I could locate it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyce had a picture your mother took that night. Apparently, you\u2019d given it to him.\u201d</p><p>What he didn\u2019t know was that Bethanne and Grant had that photograph blown up so the couple would see themselves at seventeen and eighteen as they walked into the prom.</p> <p>\u201cI found a dress shop here in Vero,\u201d Annie said. \u201cI showed them the photo and asked if they had any dresses similar to the one in the photograph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t have anything close to that dress.\u201d Ruth shook her head. \u201cFashion\u2019s changed a lot over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, they didn\u2019t.\u201d Bethanne was eager to fill in the details. \u201cBut they knew of a secondhand shop that had high-end wear at reasonable prices and, well, I found a gown with an empire waist and took it to the seamstress who works at that dress shop...and all I can say is that she\u2019s very talented.\u201d</p><p>Ruth looked stunned.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Grandma,\u201d Annie said, urging her grandmother along the sidewalk. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got all afternoon, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need you to try on the dress first,\u201d Bethanne told her.</p><p>\u201cFirst?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You have a hair and nail appointment next.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHair and nails,\u201d Ruth echoed as though in a trance. \u201cI feel like someone needs to pinch me. Is this really happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really happening,\u201d Annie said gleefully.</p><p>\u201cAnd Royce knows about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, some of it, but only because we needed his cooperation. We didn\u2019t tell him until we had everything in place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyce wants to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d Bethanne slipped an arm around her and guided Ruth toward the dress shop. \u201cHe knows and approves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s excited, Grandma. He always felt bad about how that night turned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me how wonderful you were,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cYou could\u2019ve been really unpleasant about it but you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The owner of the dress shop met them at the door and held it open. \u201cI think this is a delightful idea,\u201d she said, welcoming them inside. She led them to the back where the seamstress stood waiting.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d she said, and gestured toward one of the dressing rooms.</p><p>Ruth started inside\u2014and stopped. Then, looking over her shoulder, she stared at Bethanne and Annie. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s almost identical to my dress the night of the prom. Even the bow is the same.\u201d The lavender, floor-length empire-waist dress with its straight skirt and cap sleeves resembled the dress in the photograph to a remarkable degree. The seamstress had done exquisite work.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ruth,\u201d Bethanne breathed once her mother-in-law had tried on the dress. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Annie nodded. \u201cGrandma, this is going to be a night you\u2019ll remember for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do this for Royce and me,\u201d Ruth said tearfully.</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad worked really hard on this,\u201d Annie told her.</p><p>Rarely had Bethanne seen her daughter happier. It wasn\u2019t until she\u2019d overheard Annie talking to Grant the day before that she understood why. In Annie\u2019s eyes the fact that Grant and Bethanne were getting along so well meant a reconciliation was imminent.</p><p>Until then, Bethanne hadn\u2019t fully accepted that her attitude toward Grant had changed. Without realizing it, she\u2019d lowered her guard and allowed herself to become vulnerable to him. That recognition gave her pause. They\u2019d worked together, running all over town, and had frequent \u201cstrategy\u201d discussions. They\u2019d laughed until they were giddy, and sipped wine until she felt light-headed. When Grant kissed her goodbye she could almost believe the divorce had never happened.</p><p>If it was possible to turn back the clock for Ruth, could she do it for herself and Grant, too? Bethanne didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Glancing at her watch, she clapped her hands. \u201cWe have places to go and people to see,\u201d she said, dismissing her thoughts. She couldn\u2019t let herself get sidetracked. Not right now. She had too much to do.</p><p>By seven on Saturday, just six days before the actual reunion, all the preparations for the prom had been made. Royce and Grant were at his house, where the car was due to arrive any minute, while Bethanne kept Ruth company at the hotel.</p><p>Bethanne had purchased a party dress of her own at the secondhand shop. A frilly dress that was the kind of outfit Brenda Lee or Connie Francis might have worn, with a short skirt flaring out from the waist. A wide silk ribbon belted around her middle set off the strapless top.</p><p>\u201cI feel seventeen all over again,\u201d Ruth said, running a hand along the front of her gown.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cWe want you to feel young and in love for your senior prom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bethanne, I do. I really do. Royce is just the way I remember him...and so much more. I think I\u2019m falling in love again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we want is for you to be happy, Ruth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I appreciate that more than I can say.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne couldn\u2019t recall a time she\u2019d seen Ruth this excited.</p><p>A knock sounded at the door, and Bethanne answered it to find Royce standing on the other side, dressed in a tuxedo and holding a wrist corsage in his hand.</p><p>\u201cIs Ruth here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ruth stepped forward and Royce\u2019s jaw sagged. \u201cRuth, my goodness, that\u2019s the same dress you wore the night of our prom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t the same dress. It\u2019s a re-creation.... Annie and Bethanne arranged this.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t seem to take his eyes off her. \u201cThere\u2019s a car waiting for us outside,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cA car?\u201d Ruth asked. She gave Bethanne a puzzled look. \u201cI thought you said the prom was taking place right here at the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Bethanne responded in a whisper. \u201cJust go with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ruth whispered back.</p><p>Royce helped her with her corsage, and Ruth pinned on the boutonniere Bethanne had ordered earlier. She walked them through the lobby and out the door, where the young chauffeur stood by the limousine. As soon as they appeared, he made a sweeping motion with his arm and held the back door open.</p><p>Royce handed Ruth inside and then hurried around the car. When they\u2019d driven off, Grant showed up. \u201cWhere are they going?\u201d Bethanne asked.</p><p>\u201cFor a ride down Ocean Drive,\u201d he said. \u201cThings weren\u2019t quite ready yet, so we needed them to kill about fifteen minutes. Besides, the limo ride is part of the experience.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne followed Grant through the restaurant, where they attracted quite a few curious glances. With Grant attired in a suit and jacket, and she in her short, frilly dress, they must have looked like actors who\u2019d stepped off the stage of a Broadway play about the 1960s.</p><p>Annie dashed toward her when Bethanne entered the room. \u201cWhat do you think, Mom?\u201d she asked eagerly.</p><p>Bethanne drew in her breath as she proceeded through an archway of colorful balloons. Annie, Grant and Craig had done a marvelous job. The band\u2014five musicians and a lead singer\u2014were off to one side behind a waist-high barrier of red velvet with \u201cClass of 1961\u201d emblazoned in gold lettering across the front. Several small tables, with lamps on each one, were artfully arranged around the room.</p><p>Other couples started to arrive, and the photographer came forward to snap their pictures.</p><p>Annie greeted each couple, giving them a printed program and offering the women a dance card.</p><p>\u201cEverything looks so real,\u201d Bethanne told Grant. \u201cI feel like a time traveler.\u201d The life-size photograph of Royce and Ruth was propped against one wall, framed by tiny twinkling lights.</p><p>\u201cJust wait until the king and queen are crowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-h.\u201d Bethanne brought one hand to her mouth. She hadn\u2019t thought of that, but Grant had. They\u2019d worked together to make this happen for Ruth and Royce, put aside their differences and become a team again. Even a few months ago, she wouldn\u2019t have believed it possible, wouldn\u2019t have believed they were capable of accomplishing this evening.</p><p>When the starring couple arrived, the band began to play, and almost before she was aware of it, Bethanne found herself in Grant\u2019s arms as he led her onto the small, makeshift dance floor.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2018Moon River.\u2019 It\u2019s the theme song from Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s. Andy Williams sang it the night I went to the concert with Grandma in Branson,\u201d Annie said as she and Royce\u2019s grandson glided past Bethanne and Grant.</p><p>\u201cApparently, Andy made an impression on our daughter,\u201d Grant said, smiling down at her.</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel like high school all over again?\u201d he asked, his head close to hers.</p><p>Bethanne nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s only just begun,\u201d Grant murmured.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine what else he had planned. But she was about to find out....</p><p>About an hour into the night, the band paused and Grant walked to the stage and reached for the microphone.</p><p>\u201cThe time has come to crown the king and queen of prom night,\u201d he said, sounding every bit the professional spokesperson. \u201cI know the suspense is almost more than we can bear.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was polite laughter. Jane and Diane and their dates\u2014their husbands\u2014gathered around Ruth and Royce.</p><p>\u201cThe ballots have been tallied and the decision made.\u201d When he announced Royce\u2019s name, a loud round of applause was followed by shouts and cheers.</p><p>\u201cSpeech, speech,\u201d the crowd chanted.</p><p>Royce stepped forward, and Grant placed a crown on his head, then handed him the microphone. \u201cThere\u2019s only one woman I want by my side this evening, and that\u2019s Ruth,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThen so be it.\u201d Grant held a second crown as Craig escorted Ruth to the small stage. Grant carefully set the crown on her head as tears glistened in her eyes. Then, right in front of everyone, Royce kissed her full on the lips.</p><p>The crowd loved it. So did Bethanne, who exchanged a warm look with Grant. They\u2019d done this. It hadn\u2019t been easy, but all their effort was worth seeing the joy on Ruth\u2019s face. And on Royce\u2019s...</p><p>The music started again, and the \u201croyal\u201d couple walked onto the dance floor, soon to be joined by others. Without conscious thought, Bethanne moved toward Grant.</p><p>He slipped his arms around her as if they\u2019d never been apart. As if they were still a couple. A team. The two of them against the world.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d Grant whispered as he drew her close.</p> <p>\u201cYou worked as hard as I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about redoing Mom\u2019s prom night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Bethanne wasn\u2019t sure what he did mean, then.</p><p>\u201cI want to thank you for being the incredible woman you are, for giving my life meaning and for offering me hope that there\u2019s a chance for the two of us again.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him and closed her eyes as she allowed the rhythm of the music to carry her. Their steps matched easily, smoothly, as innate as breathing. They used to dance together like this, but that was in another lifetime....</p><p>Twenty-Eight</p> <p>Max Scranton pulled his motorcycle into the driveway of the home he\u2019d once shared with Kate and their daughter. He hadn\u2019t been here in more than three years. This was the first time he\u2019d come back to Monterey since climbing on his Harley. He\u2019d never intended to stay away this long, but there\u2019d been no reason to return.</p><p>Until now. Until he\u2019d met Bethanne.</p><p>Time lost all meaning as he sat on the bike in his driveway and stared at the house. He\u2019d expected a flood of grief and regrets, but he felt almost nothing. No guilt, no heartache, no melancholy. His overwhelming emotion was sadness for what no longer existed. The life he\u2019d known here was gone. He\u2019d handed the business over to his brother and had lost touch with the majority of his friends.</p><p>Shutting down the engine, he climbed off the bike and removed his helmet. The key to the house was hidden under a fake rock near the front door. His brother and Rooster routinely stopped by to check on the place and give him updates, although he wasn\u2019t all that interested. He\u2019d wanted to put the house on the market, but that would\u2019ve meant returning and cleaning it out. He\u2019d found the task too daunting.</p><p>The car pulling in behind him took him by surprise.</p><p>Rooster.</p><p>He should\u2019ve realized his friend would show up. Rooster looked quite different in slacks and a shirt with a button-down collar than he did in his leather vest and chaps. Max wondered what Ruth and Annie would think if they could see Rooster now. They probably wouldn\u2019t recognize him; the biker bore little resemblance to the successful advertising executive he was for most of the year.</p><p>Rooster got out of his car and closed the door, the sound reverberating in the stillness of the late afternoon. His friend joined him on the porch.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Max demanded.</p><p>Max had phoned Rooster a few hours earlier, when he\u2019d arrived in town. They\u2019d parted ways the week before because of Rooster\u2019s business commitments. He should\u2019ve known his friend wouldn\u2019t leave it at a simple call. \u201cI was in the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t bother to respond to the obvious lie.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I wasn\u2019t. I figured you might need some company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Rooster\u2019s skeptical look revealed his doubt. \u201cDo you want me to go in with you?\u201d</p><p>Max studied the locked door as he considered his reply. He wasn\u2019t ready to face this alone. He appreciated the fact that Rooster was with him, although he\u2019d be hard-pressed to admit it.</p><p>He finally inserted the key and opened the door. For an instant he stood there paralyzed. Moving forward required an effort so great he began to sweat. He went in and, after three steps, again stood motionless.</p><p>Noticing that Rooster was watching him intently, Max advanced another step. The house was exactly as he\u2019d left it, exactly as he remembered. Directly in front of him was a stunning view of the Pacific Ocean through the floor-to-ceiling windows. White leather furniture was tastefully displayed; a black grand piano rested in one corner of the living room and a huge natural-rock fireplace took up the far wall. The original artwork was worth ten times what Kate had paid for it. She\u2019d always had an eye for talent.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Rooster asked. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>Max heard the hesitation in his friend\u2019s voice. He didn\u2019t know what he was supposed to think, what he should feel. Closing his eyes he tried to remember what it was like when he\u2019d lived here with Kate and their daughter. Happy. He\u2019d always love Kate, but she was gone and he was alive. He hadn\u2019t realized how much life he was capable of until he\u2019d met Bethanne and discovered he could feel again, love again.</p><p>\u201cThis is a beautiful house,\u201d Rooster commented.</p><p>\u201cKate loved it,\u201d Max said. And so had he. Their home had been a place where friends and family gathered, where they enjoyed good food and wine and one another\u2019s company. \u201cI did, too.\u201d</p><p>He moved into the kitchen, and then the family room. Portraits of Katherine at different ages lined one wall; her wheelchair and special computer had been stored in her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI kept an eye on the wine cellar,\u201d Rooster said.</p><p>Despite himself, Max grinned. \u201cI assumed you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get us a bottle?\u201d</p><p>That sounded like a good idea. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>Rooster disappeared, and Max found two wineglasses in the alcove off the kitchen and brought them out. One day he\u2019d share a bottle of exquisite wine with Bethanne....</p><p>The minute she came to mind, he experienced a burning need to hear her voice. He missed her smile, her scent, missed being with her. Before he could continue with these thoughts Rooster returned with a bottle of expensive French Bordeaux.</p><p>\u201cAre we celebrating?\u201d Max had to ask. The wine wholesaled for one hundred and fifty dollars, or it had three years ago. It was probably more now.</p><p>\u201cYes, we are. We\u2019re celebrating the fact that you\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d Max repeated. He hadn\u2019t expected to feel this sense of welcome. He was really, truly back, and it felt damn good.</p><p>Rooster opened the wine and left it to breathe as they wandered from room to room, inspecting the house.</p><p>Max paused just inside the master bedroom door. The walk-in closet was filled with Kate\u2019s things\u2014her clothes, shoes, jewelry. Seeing it gave him an emotional jolt. Automatically, he turned and walked away. He\u2019d deal with that later. It was still too soon.</p><p>By the time he returned to the living room, Rooster had poured the wine. They sat across from each other in a comfortable silence. With a friend as good as Rooster, words weren\u2019t necessary. They savored the wine; Max decided it was worth every penny.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Bethanne?\u201d Rooster asked after a while.</p><p>\u201cNo, have you?\u201d</p><p>Rooster chuckled. \u201cNot lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with her ex.\u201d</p><p>His friend\u2019s eyebrow arched. \u201cYou worried?\u201d</p><p>Max could brush off his concern but Rooster would see through that easily enough. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t.\u201d He tried not to think of Grant and Bethanne together. No one needed to tell him that the ex would do everything in his power to persuade Bethanne to give him another chance. For that matter, maybe she should. They had plenty of reason to try again.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Max reached for his wine goblet, holding the stem as he studied the dark purplish liquid. It helped if he focused on something like the rich color of the wine rather than his feelings for Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cYou could always call her. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to keep in touch, you know. Her ex phoned her every day, sometimes more than once. Fair is fair.\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t remember it that way and said so.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so Grant talked to the daughter, but you can bet Annie relayed every message.\u201d</p><p>Annie was definitely Grant\u2019s ally, as she should be. With Max out of the picture and Grant pleading his case, Max had to wonder if he stood a chance. \u201cThere\u2019s a good possibility I\u2019ll lose her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay to sit back and let that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any choice.\u201d Before they parted, Max had told her he\u2019d give her breathing room, and he was keeping his word.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Rooster argued. \u201cThe least you can do is tell her how you feel. Fight fire with fire.\u201d</p><p>Max mulled over his friend\u2019s advice. \u201cI\u2019ll take it under consideration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo.\u201d</p><p>Rooster left a little while later. Max remained in his chair, the wineglass in his hand. His cell phone was attached to his belt, within easy reach. Not once since they\u2019d parted had he called her, although she\u2019d phoned him that one time. Their conversation had been far too short\u2014and then silence. And he knew why. Grant was being persuasive. No doubt about it, the ex had the advantage.</p><p>He unclipped his phone, punched out the number and closed his eyes as he waited for her to answer.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>She sounded busy, harried.</p><p>Background noise made it difficult to hear. \u201cIt\u2019s Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax. Oh, Max...\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the warm reception he\u2019d been hoping for. The tension between his shoulders increased.</p><p>\u201cCan you talk?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to go out on the patio. I\u2019m in a restaurant and it\u2019s hard to hear you.\u201d</p><p>The background clatter died down as Bethanne apparently stepped outside. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMonterey, California. At the house where Kate and I lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Funny how that was the first question everyone seemed to have.</p><p>\u201cSo far. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Everything\u2019s good. Annie, Grant and I threw prom night for Ruth and Royce yesterday evening\u2014they\u2019re out with friends right now. We fly home next Sunday, after the reunion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProm night?\u201d He frowned. \u201cYou arranged a prom night for your ex-mother-in-law and her high school boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ll explain later.\u201d</p><p>So there\u2019d be a later for them. Or at least it sounded that way. \u201cBethanne, listen, there are things I need to tell you, things I should\u2019ve told you before.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say anything\u2014it isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>A chill went through him. \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019ve made a decision and you and Grant are getting back together?\u201d That seemed the only logical explanation.</p><p>\u201cYes...no. I don\u2019t know... He\u2019s been so wonderful and...well, I didn\u2019t think it was possible, but after the past few days I\u2019m wondering if maybe we should give it a shot.\u201d</p><p>Max couldn\u2019t blame her, although his disappointment was devastating. \u201cAre you sure this is what you want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo...no. Oh, Max, the minute I heard your voice my heart went crazy. Grant\u2019s here and everything seems idyllic. But I\u2019m afraid this won\u2019t last.\u201d She sighed. \u201cTry as I might, I can\u2019t get you out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed a little. \u201cI can\u2019t get you out of mine, either.\u201d He couldn\u2019t lose her so soon after he\u2019d found her. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to decide anything now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew and Courtney\u2019s wedding. I have to get through my son\u2019s wedding.\u201d Her voice was frantic. \u201cI have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethanne.\u201d He murmured her name. \u201cStop. Take a deep breath and listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>He heard her soft intake of air. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to work out. I\u2019m not going to pressure you one way or the other. This is up to you, and if you want to reconcile with Grant, then I\u2019ll abide by your decision and get out of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that? You\u2019d walk away without a word?\u201d</p><p>He would. He hated the thought of it, but he would. \u201cYes. I\u2019d respect your wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d She sounded hurt, confused.</p><p>\u201cBethanne,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what people do when they love the other person. Your happiness is paramount to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love me, Max? Is it possible to love someone after such a short time?\u201d</p> <p>These weren\u2019t questions Max felt qualified to answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Anything less than total honesty would be wrong. \u201cWhat I do know is that I feel alive when I\u2019m with you. You inspire me to open my eyes and accept the past and not worry about the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s love, then that\u2019s what I feel. If you think Grant\u2019s the man who\u2019ll make you happy, then I\u2019ll remove myself from the equation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax, hold on a minute.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d lowered the phone, but Max could still hear. \u201cTell everyone I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d Someone else spoke, although Max couldn\u2019t tell who it was. \u201cI\u2019m not being rude. I\u2019ll be inside when I\u2019m finished.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a good time. He shouldn\u2019t have phoned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back now. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right\u2014I understand. I\u2019ll let you return to your meal.\u201d If he\u2019d been smart enough to remember the three-hour time difference, he would\u2019ve realized it was the dinner hour.</p> <p>\u201cI...want to see you,\u201d she whispered as though it was a weakness of character. \u201cI know I\u2019m being completely unfair and that you deserve so much more than to be left hanging. I\u2019ll be able to think more clearly once I\u2019m back in Seattle and Andrew and Courtney are married. I...apologize that I can\u2019t be more definite than that.\u201d</p><p>At this point Max was willing to take whatever she was willing to offer. \u201cGet through your son\u2019s wedding and then we\u2019ll talk. I\u2019ll fly up to Seattle and we can meet face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean we won\u2019t talk until after the wedding?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave that up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it would be better if you phoned me instead of the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She seemed uncertain. \u201cDo you want to hear from me?\u201d</p><p>That was an understatement. \u201cYes, very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for your call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow go back inside that restaurant and enjoy your dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Bye, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d He didn\u2019t want the conversation to end, didn\u2019t want to break the connection. So he continued to hold the cell phone against his ear. He heard the click and knew she\u2019d terminated the call.</p><p>He was losing Bethanne. He felt it and was powerless to do anything more than hope.</p><p>Twenty-Nine</p><p>Annie\u2019s suitcase was packed, and while her mother and grandmother ran a few last-minute errands, she stayed at the hotel. Her father would be picking the three of them up early that afternoon for the evening flight to Seattle.</p><p>While she waited, she sat in the restaurant that overlooked the Atlantic and read through her emails. Vance sent her as many as five a day. He said basically the same thing in each one.</p><p>He was miserable.</p><p>As he should be!</p><p>He wanted to come back to Seattle.</p><p>He should\u2019ve thought of that before he took off without me.</p><p>He wanted her to join him.</p><p>Fat chance of that.</p><p>Annie wasn\u2019t willing to forgive and forget. Okay, deep down maybe she could be talked into letting bygones be bygones. Eventually. But as her mother had pointed out, she wanted Vance to admit he was wrong, which was something he seemed incapable of doing. That being the case, she ignored his pleas. If she sent him one email a day, he should consider himself lucky. Maybe it was petty and immature, but she made sure he knew she wasn\u2019t sitting around pining for him. In fact, she mentioned Craig\u2019s and Jason\u2019s names at every opportunity.</p><p>To be honest, the thought of joining him in Europe did appeal to her, but she\u2019d never let him know that. Besides, she had a year of school left before she got her MBA and she wasn\u2019t going to drop out now just to spend a month or two on vacation. As Vance had so incisively said, she had responsibilities. He would no doubt realize soon enough that everyone had responsibilities.</p><p>Annie opened today\u2019s first email from Vance, read it and then settled back to mull over this latest bit of news. Vance was returning home at the end of August. His parents had deposited money in his account so he could get his ticket changed. He was heading home.</p><p>Annie\u2019s first reaction was sarcastic. Isn\u2019t that wonderful? At the same time, she couldn\u2019t help feeling kind of good, knowing that Vance would be in Seattle again. However, she was determined that their relationship wasn\u2019t going to slip back to what it had been. For that matter, she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to be with him at all.</p><p>Vance had been secretive, insensitive and a jerk, and that was just the beginning of the list of character defects she\u2019d compiled. If he assumed everything would remain status quo between them, he was in for a shock.</p><p>Annie generally waited a day or two before she replied to any of Vance\u2019s emails. She carefully composed a response and then reviewed every word before she pressed the send button.</p><p>She decided not to reply yet. Instead, she emailed Jason. She planned to stay in touch with Royce\u2019s grandson, Craig, too; he\u2019d been a lot of fun this past week. They had a great time putting together the prom for their grandparents. She thought it was really cool that Craig\u2019s grandfather and her grandmother had gotten together again after fifty years. Those two were crazy about each other. It reminded her of the way Max looked at her mother\u2014and her mother at him.</p><p>She almost felt sorry for Max because after the past week it was pretty obvious that her parents would reunite. The truth was, she actually liked Max. Her problem with him was simple\u2014he stood, or used to stand, between her mother and father.</p><p>\u201cI figured I\u2019d find you here.\u201d</p><p>Annie looked up to see her father. She checked her watch. \u201cHi, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, and slid into the booth across from her.</p><p>Annie closed her computer. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we were leaving for another couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t. I was hoping you\u2019d be alone so we could chat.\u201d</p><p>The waiter approached, and her father waved him off with a grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she asked. Reaching for her glass of iced tea, she sipped through the straw.</p><p>Her father crossed his arms on the table and leaned forward. \u201cDid you notice how well things are going between your mother and me?\u201d</p><p>Annie nodded.</p><p>\u201cI think we might make a go of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d However, Annie didn\u2019t discount her mother\u2019s feelings for Max. \u201cDon\u2019t get overconfident, Dad,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. All I want is a second chance.\u201d He shifted uncomfortably. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t be asking you this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad. Just ask me, okay?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak right away. \u201cI know your mother got a phone call from Max the other night while we were at dinner,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cEveryone knew about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went outside and talked to her.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t one of Annie\u2019s smarter moves. \u201cYeah, I told her she was being rude, which she didn\u2019t appreciate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas...\u201d He hesitated. \u201cHas Max called again?\u201d He frowned. \u201cForget I asked that. I shouldn\u2019t put you in the middle. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d She could so understand his wanting to know.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly. \u201cThe problem is, I feel your mother and I are very close to patching things up, and yet I don\u2019t know exactly where I stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the two of them together\u2014did you get a feel for what\u2019s going on between them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and, Dad, I don\u2019t want this to shake you or anything, but Max is hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot as in...sexy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s the strong, silent type. The kind of man most women notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to worry\u2014you are, too. Well, sort of.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThanks. That\u2019s encouraging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad, quit worrying. Mom will do what\u2019s best for her, and that\u2019s what we all want, right?\u201d Of course, what she thought was best for her mom was her dad.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he echoed. \u201cI wish I knew what your mother was thinking, though.\u201d</p><p>Annie did, too. That morning she\u2019d caught her mother staring at her cell phone as though torn by indecision. She\u2019d stared at it for so long that Annie was about to comment. Before she could say anything, Bethanne closed it abruptly, and dropped the cell inside her purse.</p><p>Leaning back, her father raked his hands through his hair. \u201cNo matter what happens, I\u2019ll always love her. I was an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all are at one time or another.\u201d Annie wanted to wrap her arms around her father. She wanted to reassure him that life was filled with mistakes and that the key was to learn from our errors in judgment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That thought made her sit up straighter. She was willing to look past her father\u2019s mistakes but not Vance\u2019s. Maybe she was being unfair to him. Maybe she should give him a second chance.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d her father said, \u201cif your mother decides we\u2019re finished, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to love anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy.\u201d Hearing him say that made Annie want to weep. This was the kind of love she hoped to find one day. A forever kind of love.</p><p>\u201cAlso, before I forget, I wanted to thank you for telling me how much your mother admired that Civil War button. If there\u2019s anything else she likes, please pass the information along. I\u2019m looking for ways to spoil her. I have six years to make up for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Daddy, you can be so thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI want your mother to realize how much I love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I think of anything else, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He seemed in an optimistic mood and that pleased Annie. She glanced down at her computer. \u201cCan I talk to you about something else?\u201d she asked. \u201cI could use your advice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, baby, anything.\u201d</p><p>Annie flattened the paper napkin in her lap. \u201cYou remember Vance, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the guy you were dating.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe one I thought was about to propose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d He frowned as if he\u2019d welcome the opportunity to give Vance a piece of his mind.</p><p>\u201cBut instead,\u201d she went on, \u201che told me he was taking off for Europe. For a year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was a real disappointment, wasn\u2019t it, honey?\u201d</p><p>The sympathy in his voice soothed her hurt feelings. \u201cI was devastated,\u201d she said. \u201cI cried buckets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve you, Annie. No one treats my daughter like that and gets away with it.\u201d</p><p>Annie loved the way her father rushed to her defense. \u201cVance is coming home at the end of August.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this European adventure didn\u2019t work out the way he planned, huh?\u201d Her father\u2019s eyes flashed with satisfaction, as if to say this was what Vance got for hurting Annie.</p><p>\u201cApparently, Europe wasn\u2019t what he expected.\u201d She tried to hide the pleasure it gave her to tell him so. \u201cNow he seems to think everything will go back to the way it was before he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding!\u201d His voice rang with righteous indignation.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, I don\u2019t know how I feel about Vance anymore. I\u2019ve gone out with a couple of other guys during this trip, but it isn\u2019t the same as being with him. He was more than my boyfriend. Vance was my best friend, too.\u201d She sighed. \u201cFor a while I thought I missed him so much because I was just so used to being with him. I decided that wasn\u2019t a good enough reason to get back together. But now...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get over him, honey. Vance needs to know he isn\u2019t the only bird in the flock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to tell him about Jason. He\u2019s the guy I met in Vegas. Jason was nice, and so is Craig. I talked to Mom about it and, well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d been a really helpful conversation. \u201cWe discussed me wanting Vance to be sorry for the way he treated me. Mom said\u2014\u201d Annie paused \u201c\u2014she said the real problem is that I wanted to make sure Vance understood that what he did was wrong. If he\u2019d told me about this trip, it would\u2019ve been different but to hide it from me and then expect me to be okay with it was too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with your mother more. Like I said, Vance doesn\u2019t deserve you. You aren\u2019t really going back with him, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. I...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, honey. If he\u2019s making plans behind your back now, that behavior isn\u2019t going to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Are you saying that even if he apologizes I shouldn\u2019t give him another chance?\u201d Annie was surprised to find herself sticking up for Vance, but she felt compelled to be his champion.</p><p>\u201cAnnie, you\u2019re smarter than this.\u201d</p><p>Annie stared at her dad.</p><p>\u201cOnce the pattern\u2019s set, nothing will change. Save yourself a lot of grief.\u201d</p><p>She continued to stare.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t forgive him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>Annie blinked, more confused now than before. \u201cBut, Dad, you want Mom to forgive you.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Listen, you can forgive Vance, if that\u2019s what you want. But can you trust him?\u201d</p><p>Annie sucked in her breath. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s the same thing Mom\u2019s asking herself? Can she trust you, Dad?\u201d</p><p>He blinked as though the question had caught him unawares. \u201cYes, she can. I\u2019ve learned my lesson. I promise you before God and man that I will remain faithful to your mother. Never, ever again will I take her for granted.\u201d</p><p>Annie hoped that was true. She believed him\u2014she had to\u2014and prayed her mother did, as well.</p><p>Thirty</p><p>Bethanne, Annie and Grant drove to the airport in his rental, while Royce was taking Ruth in his own car. It was obvious to Bethanne, and no doubt everyone else, that the older couple had picked up where they\u2019d left off fifty years earlier. All the resentments and regrets had apparently been laid to rest. Ever since the night of the prom, they\u2019d spent nearly every minute together. And the class reunion the other evening had been, according to Ruth, the second-best event of the year.</p><p>Plans were already in motion for Royce to visit Seattle the following month. Andrew and Courtney\u2019s wedding was the perfect reason. Bethanne wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they decided to marry before the end of the summer. That would mean one of them would need to move and she wondered how they\u2019d handle it.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy your stay in Florida?\u201d Grant asked as they approached the Orlando airport. The direct flight into Seattle would have them back in familiar territory within five and a half hours.</p><p>\u201cVery much,\u201d Bethanne told him. The highlight for her had been prom night, when she\u2019d felt so close to Grant.</p><p>\u201cThat was a lovely thing you did for my mother,\u201d Grant said. \u201cYou and Annie. It meant the world to Mom.\u201d</p><p>Grant had played no small part, although he was eager to give her the credit.</p><p>\u201cI had a great time, too.\u201d Annie leaned forward from the backseat. \u201cEven in Branson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, you and Andy Williams,\u201d Bethanne said, teasing her.</p><p>\u201cMom, promise you won\u2019t tell anyone about that, okay?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne tried not to smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my lips are sealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll let me drive you home,\u201d Grant said as they took the exit to the airport off the Bee Line Expressway.</p><p>\u201cAndrew said he\u2019d pick us up,\u201d Bethanne told him. \u201cWe planned that before we left.\u201d She\u2019d missed her son and there seemed to be a hundred things she needed to discuss with him. Now that the wedding was just a few weeks away, they had to go over all the details for the rehearsal dinner.</p><p>\u201cWe can call him from the airport,\u201d Grant said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for him to go out of his way when I have a car arranged.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne shrugged. She didn\u2019t want to make an issue of this, although she\u2019d looked forward to reconnecting with their son. They\u2019d talked while she was on the road, but nothing compared with a face-to-face conversation.</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d Grant pressed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d She made an effort to disguise her lack of enthusiasm.</p><p>Grant didn\u2019t speak for several minutes. \u201cI guess what I\u2019m saying is that I want to be with you for as long as I can. If you\u2019d rather ride home with Andrew, I understand.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne offered him a brief smile. \u201cI\u2019m happy to spend time with you, too.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and held her look. \u201cAre you, Bethanne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked. She noticed that his hands tightened around the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cAnnie and I had a short conversation earlier. She wanted my opinion of Vance and whether she should forgive him. I more or less told her to ditch him. Any man who\u2019d treat my daughter the way he did isn\u2019t worthy of dating her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d Annie protested from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cThen she reminded me that I was asking you to forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgave you a long time ago,\u201d Bethanne said.</p><p>\u201cBut do you trust me?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want there to be a single doubt in your mind. I told Annie and I\u2019m telling you that there\u2019ll never be a repeat of what happened with Tiffany. I give you my word.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne looked straight ahead. He\u2019d given his word before, standing in front of the minister at her family church; he\u2019d promised to love and protect her, to remain faithful until death. She wished she could block out the doubt and tell him what he wanted to hear. It would be so easy to claim she trusted Grant. So easy to assure him that the thought of his cheating again had never entered her mind. Only, she\u2019d be lying.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019re sincere,\u201d she said, not quite answering his question.</p><p>\u201cYou can trust me, Bethanne.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, hoping that would provide him with the reassurance he seemed to need.</p><p>She tried to concentrate on their relationship, on giving them another chance. Yet she couldn\u2019t dismiss her feelings for Max. She wanted to be with him. But she was with Grant, who so clearly loved her.</p><p>Grant placed his hand on her knee and Bethanne smiled over at him again, a noncommittal smile. He was trying so hard. But she couldn\u2019t give him the answer he was asking for, not now and maybe not ever. As she kept telling him, she was very different from the woman he\u2019d once loved; the changes in her life had been dramatic. One thing was sure\u2014she\u2019d meet this challenge the way she\u2019d met every other one in the past six years.</p><p>When they boarded the plane without Ruth, Bethanne was afraid her mother-in-law would miss the flight. Ruth was the last person to walk on, having waited outside security as long as she could in order to be with Royce. When she settled into her seat next to Bethanne, her face glowed with happiness.</p><p>\u201cRoyce is booking his flight to Seattle right this minute,\u201d she said, fastening her seat belt.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be together again soon.\u201d</p><p>Ruth nodded. \u201cBethanne,\u201d she whispered, \u201cam I an old fool? Is it possible to fall in love again at my age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuth, good grief, you\u2019re not old! Besides, age shouldn\u2019t matter. Does Royce make you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, but, well, there are complications. His family\u2019s in Florida and mine is in Washington.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour family\u2019s grown,\u201d Bethanne continued. \u201cYou can come for visits and vice versa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friends are in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes for them. Plus you\u2019ll make new friends and reconnect with old ones.\u201d Bethanne leaned over and squeezed her arm. \u201cDo you love Royce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all my heart, and he loves me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll work something out.\u201d</p><p>Ruth went very still. \u201cI wish it was that simple. I think these weeks apart will be good for us. They\u2019ll give us time to mull over some decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will,\u201d Bethanne agreed, although she hoped Ruth would be more successful at reaching a conclusion than she\u2019d been.</p><p>Grant sat with Annie across the aisle, and they had their heads close together almost the entire flight. More than once Grant laughed out loud at something Annie said, and she basked in her father\u2019s approval. There was no sign of the angry, rebellious girl Annie had been at sixteen.</p><p>Bethanne took the opportunity to knit, while Ruth watched a movie. When they landed in Seattle, Andrew was waiting in baggage claim. Bethanne\u2019s spirits rose the instant she saw her son.</p> <p>\u201cAndrew,\u201d she said, rushing forward. Her six-foot-tall son threw his arms around her and lifted her from the ground.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be back.\u201d Bethanne felt as though she\u2019d been away far longer than eighteen days. She wanted to unpack her suitcase the minute she stepped into the house and start a load of laundry. And then she\u2019d walk from room to room in a small private ritual she had, something she did whenever she\u2019d been traveling. She\u2019d touch all the things she loved the most, the objects and pictures and mementos that made this house her home, the one place on earth where she truly belonged and that belonged to her.</p><p>\u201cI thought your father phoned and told you he was giving me a ride.\u201d Bethanne slipped her arm around Andrew\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cHe did and I told him if he\u2019d ordered a car, he should take care of Grandma and Annie. I said I\u2019d drive you home. He didn\u2019t mention it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But they\u2019d barely spoken once they arrived at the Orlando airport. Bethanne had bought a Sudoku puzzle book and a couple of magazines after they\u2019d checked their luggage and gone through security. She\u2019d read the magazines while they waited at the gate, and on the plane he\u2019d sat with Annie. As soon as they were airborne, Bethanne had taken out her knitting and finished her project.</p> <p>Grant hugged his son, too, and although Andrew hugged him back, Bethanne noticed a decided coolness in her son\u2019s attitude toward his father. Grant still had work to do if he hoped to repair that relationship.</p><p>Father and son collected the suitcases from the baggage carousel, while Annie sought out the driver Grant had arranged.</p><p>\u201cBethanne,\u201d Ruth said, clasping Bethanne\u2019s elbows. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough. This was the trip of a lifetime for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful, too,\u201d Grant told Bethanne. He hugged her before they parted. \u201cWould you like to go to dinner Tuesday night?\u201d</p><p>After all the meals out, she\u2019d prefer to stay in but hated to disappoint Grant. \u201cThat would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still have things to talk about.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see you Tuesday, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll call first.\u201d</p> <p>As Bethanne and Andrew started toward the parking garage, Annie found them. \u201cMom, I had a great time. Thanks so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I\u2019ll see you Tuesday at the office, okay? Bye, Andrew. Talk soon.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne had decided they should take Monday off to deal with chores and relax before going back to work. She nodded, readjusted her purse strap across her shoulder. \u201cBye, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>Andrew was quiet on the way to the car. It wasn\u2019t until they\u2019d driven out of the parking garage that he spoke. \u201cAre you okay, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cFrankly, you don\u2019t look that good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d she said humorously. Leave it to her son to be that blunt. \u201cI\u2019m fine... Oh, Andrew, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve met someone I...really like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve heard all about Max from Annie. Even Dad called me because he was worried. I\u2019m glad. He could use a bit of competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I lost my mind?\u201d she asked. \u201cJust when it looks like everything\u2019s coming together for your dad and me, I meet Max.\u201d She valued her son\u2019s opinion; Andrew knew her better than anyone.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t lost your mind, Mom. You\u2019re too down-to-earth for that.\u201d</p><p>She immediately felt a sense of relief. \u201cWhat seems to bother everyone is that I know so little about him. The crazy part is that it doesn\u2019t seem to matter. I know what\u2019s important\u2014that he loved his wife and that he\u2019s a good person, a really good person with a big heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s enough for me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She meant that in the most profound way. She was grateful for his kindness and his faith in her.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about you and Dad?\u201d Andrew asked next.</p><p>If Bethanne had an answer, she wouldn\u2019t be in this emotional mess. \u201cHe was wonderful the whole time I spent with him. He realizes what he did was wrong. Now he wants to...start over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that possible, Mom?\u201d</p><p>For years she\u2019d been convinced a reconciliation was completely out of the question. Yet over the course of the past week, Grant had proven that he was willing to do whatever it took.</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Andrew repeated.</p><p>Bethanne couldn\u2019t be anything but honest. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think it might be.\u201d</p><p>Her son exhaled slowly. \u201cYou can actually forgive Dad for what he did to you? To all of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never be able to completely erase the pain he brought into our lives,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut I think I can let go of the bitterness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your feelings for Max?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged helplessly. \u201cI wish I knew what to do. In some ways I wish I\u2019d never met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Max had seriously complicated her life. But before she could give that any further thought, Andrew turned onto her street.</p><p>This was the home she loved, the one she\u2019d been determined to keep after Grant left. It represented far more than a house in a nice neighborhood. It was a symbol of her determination to rise above what Grant had done. She felt its welcome the minute Andrew pulled into the driveway.</p><p>She unlocked the front door and walked inside while her son dealt with her luggage. As he carried her bags upstairs to the master bedroom, she scooped the mail off the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou need me to do anything else?\u201d he asked, walking back downstairs where Bethanne was sorting through her mail. Other than bills and a letter from an elderly aunt, there didn\u2019t seem to be anything of importance.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Thank you for everything.\u201d</p><p>Andrew kissed her cheek, then headed for the front door.</p><p>\u201cCan you and Courtney stop by on Thursday?\u201d she called after him. \u201cWe should discuss the rehearsal dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, turning toward her. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about six? I\u2019ll put something in the Crock-Pot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourtney\u2019s got a bridesmaid thing, so she\u2019ll come later, but six works for me.\u201d He paused.</p><p>\u201cMom, I know you\u2019re troubled about this situation with Dad. I doubt I could give you any pearls of wisdom, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make the right decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate hearing your opinion.\u201d She set the mail down and looked at her son.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I want you to know that whatever you decide is fine by me. As far as I\u2019m concerned, Dad doesn\u2019t deserve a second chance, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. All I really want to say is that you should go with your gut instinct. You did that when you started Parties and it\u2019s never failed you yet. It won\u2019t now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know what my instinct\u2019s saying,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. Just relax, sit back and listen to your inner voice.\u201d</p><p>He made it sound easier than it was. She walked him to the door, hugged him one last time and watched him pull out of the driveway. As soon as the car disappeared around the corner, Bethanne decided unpacking and laundry could wait. She visited each of the downstairs rooms, performing her coming-home ritual, before going up to her bedroom. Halfway there, she stopped and closed her eyes. Andrew had advised her to listen to her inner self. She concentrated hard and made a genuine effort to hear whatever message her intuition was trying to send. She heard her pulse roaring in her ears, but the message, unfortunately, wasn\u2019t clear.</p><p>Once in her room, she sat on the bed and, after debating for a couple of minutes, reached for the phone. Her hand closed around the receiver, and without further hesitation, she punched out the cell number that was engraved in her memory.</p><p>Thirty-One</p><p>Bethanne pressed the receiver to her ear and held her breath with each ring. She was nearly gasping by the time Max picked up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bethanne,\u201d she said, struggling to talk. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything, please. This isn\u2019t going to work. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She was on the verge of sobbing. \u201cGrant is trying so hard and he wants us to reconcile and...and I owe him that. We were married all those years and until the affair he was a good husband, a good father. He\u2019s sorry and I can\u2019t be confusing myself with you...so I won\u2019t be talking to you again.\u201d Despite her effort to make this as quick as possible, to say what she had to say and be done with it, a sob escaped.</p><p>She brought her hand to her mouth and managed to stifle a second one.</p><p>\u201cAre you finished?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cYes...I don\u2019t have anything more to say. I\u2019m sorry, Max, so sorry. At any other time, I really think we could\u2019ve made this work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your final decision.\u201d</p><p>She knew this break had to be definite. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to wait until after Andrew\u2019s wedding?\u201d</p><p>Drawing this out any longer would make it even more difficult. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you change your mind?\u201d</p><p>If she confessed that she hadn\u2019t stopped thinking about him all the while she was in Florida with Grant, she\u2019d only confuse matters. She couldn\u2019t let Max know that she had to get him out of her head if she intended to work things out with Grant.</p><p>\u201cBethanne?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t answer for the lump in her throat.</p><p>\u201cBethanne,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAre you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>She laughed then, and the sound mingled with that of a sniff so it sounded almost as though someone was strangling her.</p><p>\u201cIf I could hug you right now, I would.\u201d</p><p>She wished it was possible. She needed to feel his arms around her, needed the comfort of his embrace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you sorry we met?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Away from him, she\u2019d wavered.

I agreed. I\u2019m holding you to that, Bethanne. Whatever decision you make needs to wait until after July 16\u2014that\u2019s when the ceremony is, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t call you. But you should understand that I\u2019m not giving up easily. I\u2019m here for the long haul.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut... Grant\u2019s trying so hard,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cSo would I if I were in his shoes. The fact is, I\u2019m trying, too. I care about you, Bethanne. I didn\u2019t think I could fall in love again. You proved me wrong.\u201d</p><p>With every word he spoke, her resolve seemed to melt.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, you won\u2019t hear from me, but I want to see you after the sixteenth. If, at that time, you feel a relationship between us won\u2019t work I\u2019ll accept that. But you\u2019re going to have to tell me to my face and not over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Max, please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t love me. This is hard enough.\u201d</p><p>Her plea was met with silence.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could be more accommodating,\u201d he finally said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a man who loves easily or often. I can\u2019t turn my feelings on and off like a faucet. This is what I feel, and it\u2019s not going to change no matter what you decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to give Grant a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t offer a single argument. \u201cWhy are you being so amenable about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I? I was kicking myself for being too hard on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to let Grant try to persuade me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, because that\u2019s the only way you can decide. We\u2019ll meet after Andrew\u2019s wedding,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe two of us are going to sit down and you\u2019re going to tell me then what your decision is. Not now. Not when you just got off a flight and you\u2019re feeling tired and pressured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. She knew now that she\u2019d been unfair to him. \u201cYou\u2019re right...I should never have called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did. Just hearing from you gives me hope.\u201d</p><p>She had to talk about something else before she started crying again. \u201cDid everything go well with you and your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtremely well. I\u2019m resuming my position in the business. What\u2019s your email address? I\u2019ll send you a link so you can check it out.\u201d</p><p>She rattled it off before she could change her mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, my love.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone and fell onto the thick down comforter. Reaching for a pillow, she bunched it up under her head and closed her eyes, thinking she\u2019d rest for a few minutes. The next time she stirred, it was dark outside and she felt chilled.</p><p>When she realized she\u2019d been asleep, Bethanne sat up and waited for her vision to adjust to the dark. She\u2019d had no idea she was this tired. True, she hadn\u2019t slept well in several nights...</p><p>Oh, no. Had she really phoned Max or was that part of some weird dream? Her stomach tensed. It felt far too real to have been a dream.</p><p>Bethanne dragged herself off the bed and took a hot bath, got into her pajamas and returned to her bedroom, peeling back the covers. She climbed into bed and didn\u2019t wake until early Monday morning.</p><p>Once she was up and dressed, she brewed coffee and put a load of clothes in the washer. Then she sat at her home office computer to check her email.</p><p>As the messages appeared, the most current at the top, she saw Max\u2019s name and inhaled sharply. He\u2019d said he would forward a link to his company website, but she hadn\u2019t expected him to do it this soon.</p><p>She read the release and, smiling, picked up the phone.</p><p>\u201cI called you last night, didn\u2019t I?\u201d she said when he answered.</p><p>\u201cYes. Are you feeling better now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean what I said, Bethanne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She heard Rooster\u2019s voice in the background.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m interrupting you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot really. Rooster\u2019s helping me clean out the house. I\u2019ve got an appointment with a real estate agent this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>This was the house he\u2019d lived in with Kate and their daughter. He must be dealing with a lot of difficult emotional issues. \u201cWhere will you move?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Max.\u201d Her shoulders slumped. Guilt, never very far away, came to hover near her.</p><p>\u201cAre you still upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going to call me again,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you should,\u201d he said. \u201cCall me anytime you want, day or night, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she told him adamantly. \u201cNot until after Andrew and Courtney\u2019s wedding. That\u2019s what we agreed.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell chimed. She was in no mood for company. The bell chimed again and she groaned. Whoever was there didn\u2019t seem inclined to leave. \u201cHold on, someone\u2019s at the door,\u201d she said, putting down the phone.</p><p>Before she could get to the foyer, she heard the front door open. It was Grant.</p><p>\u201cGrant?\u201d she said, shocked that he\u2019d just walk into the house. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI thought I\u2019d stop by to see that you were doing okay after the flight and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my home now! You don\u2019t have the right to let yourself in without an invitation.\u201d</p><p>He blinked as though her words offended him. \u201cI apologize,\u201d he said stiffly. \u201cThe front door was unlocked and I wasn\u2019t sure you heard the doorbell.\u201d</p><p>As tired as she was the night before, Bethanne must have forgotten to lock it.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather I left?\u201d he asked, looking sufficiently chastened. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t mean to upset you and I can see that I have.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne exhaled, torn between irritation and apprehension. She didn\u2019t want Grant to know Max was on the phone and, at the same time, she didn\u2019t want Max to know Grant was in the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made a pot of coffee. Help yourself. I\u2019m just finishing a phone call. I\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She waited until Grant was on his way to the kitchen before she returned to her home office and closed the door.</p><p>Sitting at her desk, she propped her elbow on it and rested her forehead in her hand. \u201cI have to go,\u201d she told Max.</p><p>\u201cRemember, if there\u2019s anything else you want to know about me, all you have to do is ask.\u201d</p><p>Despite her discomfort, Bethanne smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be calling,\u201d she said. This was becoming a litany, repeated time after time.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pity.\u201d</p><p>Grumbling under her breath, she replaced the receiver, then joined her ex-husband in the kitchen. Grant had poured himself a cup of coffee; he looked relaxed and at home.</p><p>\u201cI apologize again, Bethanne. Walking into the house was presumptuous of me.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to argue. She crossed her arms and leaned against the counter. \u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m safe and sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She didn\u2019t fill in the details.</p><p>He stirred sugar into his coffee. \u201cDo you have plans for tonight?\u201d</p><p>Seeing that she\u2019d already agreed to have dinner with him on Tuesday, she couldn\u2019t imagine what he had in mind for tonight. \u201cNot really. What are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to show you.\u201d He gave her a rather self-satisfied smile, which made her wonder. Still, she\u2019d hoped for a quiet Monday evening.</p><p>\u201cToday?\u201d she asked. \u201cCan\u2019t we do it later in the week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, sure.\u201d He was clearly disappointed.</p><p>\u201cCould you tell me what it is?\u201d</p><p>Grant cradled his mug of coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s a house, a lovely one that\u2019s been on the market for a while. The owners are ready to bargain\u2014and so am I.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Two</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t really want to see this house Grant was so excited about. She knew from the years they were married that he\u2019d dreamed of one day buying a home on Lake Washington. Waterfront property was highly sought after and, in a word, expensive.</p><p>By Wednesday afternoon, Bethanne regretted ever having consented to this. She hadn\u2019t been back in the office long and had barely had time to do more than answer emails and catch up with a few pressing items that required her immediate attention. Julia Hayden had done a masterful job but there were a number of decisions only Bethanne could make. Her day was harried enough without this appointment.</p><p>He phoned at noon to confirm their meeting time. She almost told him that he should arrange the viewing for another evening. What changed her mind was how excited he seemed. She hadn\u2019t heard that kind of enthusiasm from him in a very long while.</p><p>A half hour before she planned to leave, Annie wandered into her office. \u201cHas your day been as hectic as mine?\u201d her daughter asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bethanne said, glancing up from her computer screen.</p><p>Annie sat down in the chair across from her desk. \u201cDid you and Dad get together last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did.\u201d Grant had taken Bethanne to an old favorite of theirs. Zorba\u2019s was a family-owned Greek restaurant where they used to dine every year on their birthdays. Bethanne enjoyed Mediterranean-style cuisine, and so did Grant. Back then, it had been a real treat to splurge on a couple of special nights.</p><p>As Grant\u2019s career advanced they were able to dine out more often and they\u2019d expanded their repertoire of restaurants. Bethanne hadn\u2019t gone to Zorba\u2019s since the divorce. Their meal on Tuesday evening had been pleasant and, not surprisingly, led to reminiscences of previous dinners there. The original owners, whom they remembered fondly, had retired and their children now ran Zorba\u2019s. While the recipes were the same, or so they were told, the food didn\u2019t taste quite as good.</p><p>\u201cDad said he was taking you to your favorite place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had several favorite restaurants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t throw away all those years, Mom! You just can\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bethanne didn\u2019t comment. Instead, she changed the subject. \u201cDid your father mention that he wants us to see a house this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think that\u2019s great, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne was a little startled by her daughter\u2019s reaction. \u201cI\u2019m not selling the house, Annie. I told your father that when he brought up this idea, but he insisted I at least look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost anything to do a walk-through, does it?\u201d</p> <p>Bethanne knew Andrew would appreciate her feelings about their family home. And she\u2019d expected Annie to display some emotion regarding it. Annie had been four when they\u2019d moved there and Bethanne doubted she had any memories of the apartment they\u2019d lived in before that.</p><p>\u201cDad emailed me pictures of the Lake Washington house, and, Mom, it\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Over dinner at Zorba\u2019s, Grant had shown her brochures for cruises to the Greek isles, a trip they\u2019d once anticipated for their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. Only, there hadn\u2019t been any anniversary and no trip. Bethanne had scanned the flyers while sipping a small glass of ouzo. The implication was that if they did remarry, they\u2019d take one of these cruises\u2014a second honeymoon.</p><p>Everything seemed to be moving so quickly. Too quickly for Bethanne. Grant was obviously trying to give her reasons to reconcile. He\u2019d always been persuasive, a deal-maker, and he was using all his skills to sway her decision.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s trying too hard,\u201d Bethanne felt obliged to tell her daughter. \u201cIt isn\u2019t material things I want. There\u2019s so much more involved here.\u201d</p> <p>Annie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cMom, Dad\u2019s afraid.\u201d She hesitated briefly. \u201cWere you on the phone with Max the other morning when Dad came by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d She\u2019d been careful not to let Grant know she was speaking to Max. He might have overheard but she doubted it.</p><p>\u201cDad said he thought you might\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cIt really threw him after the week in Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d So all this house business had to do with Grant\u2019s insecurities. But until Andrew\u2019s wedding, her decision was on hold. Her first priority was seeing their son happily married. Only then would she address these uncomfortable issues.</p> <p>\u201cThe cruise, the house\u2014it\u2019s all a bit much,\u201d she said.</p><p>Annie smiled. \u201cDad means well.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d She kept thinking about their meal at Zorba\u2019s. The recipes were the same as they\u2019d been years ago, but the experience wasn\u2019t. Grant had wanted to recapture the past and his attempt had fallen short. Neither of them had acknowledged it, though. It might not be a good analogy, but Bethanne feared the same thing would happen with their relationship. Even if they both wanted a reconciliation to work, it might not. Too much time had passed. They no longer had the same interests or, she suspected, the same values. Bethanne liked quiet evenings at home, reading and knitting. From what Grant had told her, he often went out nights, to network, meet with clients and make connections. She, too, was required to spend a certain number of evenings at work-related occasions, but more and more she preferred to be by herself or with family and friends.</p><p>Another thought had come involuntarily when Grant suggested Zorba\u2019s. Had he dined there with Tiffany? She didn\u2019t ask. For a moment, she\u2019d felt a fresh stab of pain but then shoved it from her mind, determined to enjoy the dinner.</p><p>During their conversation, she\u2019d realized that the Bethanne he wanted back was the old Bethanne, the woman who\u2019d supported and encouraged him. She couldn\u2019t slip into that role again, nor did she want to. She had her own business now. Grant was ambitious; so was she. Frankly, she didn\u2019t know if there was enough room in a marriage for that much ambition.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Annie murmured.</p><p>Bethanne sighed. \u201cI want it to work with your father, but I don\u2019t know if it will. Five or six years ago, I would\u2019ve moved to the moon if Grant asked it of me. Not anymore, Annie. Seeing this house is a waste of time. I know it and so do you.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I do.\u201d</p> <p>Still, some part of Bethanne must have been trying to please Grant; she\u2019d agreed to view this property simply because he\u2019d been excited about it.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to call Dad and tell him you\u2019re too busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She weighed her options. Checking the time, she realized Grant was probably at his office already, waiting for her. \u201cI\u2019ll go. Do you want to come with us?\u201d</p><p>Annie\u2019s face instantly lit up. \u201cI\u2019d love it. Are you sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than sure.\u201d In truth, Bethanne welcomed the company. With Annie accompanying her, she might be able to avoid an awkward discussion with Grant.</p><p>They drove to Grant\u2019s office in their own cars. He greeted Annie and introduced the listing agent, Jonathan Randolph, who was going to show them the property. Annie rode with Jonathan, and Bethanne and Grant followed in his car.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d Grant asked as soon as they were alone.</p><p>\u201cFrantic,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat about yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso busy.\u201d He glanced away from the road and smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to love this house,\u201d he said as they entered the circular driveway that led to the double front doors.</p><p>Just looking at it from the outside, Bethanne had to admit this was a stunning home. \u201cThis has got to be way beyond anything you...either of us could afford.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne understood what Grant was doing. She hadn\u2019t been married to him all that time without knowing how his mind worked. He hoped once she saw the house she\u2019d have a change of heart. He was counting on it.</p><p>And yet, after those same twenty years of marriage, Bethanne was astonished that he didn\u2019t know her better. She\u2019d never longed for things. What mattered to her were the emotions and experiences they represented. Family night playing board games with their children, or a vacation that included Andrew and Annie, meant more than a diamond tennis bracelet or a pricey dinner.</p><p>\u201cI know you love the old house,\u201d Grant said, coming to stand at her side. \u201cI realize you have no intention of moving. All I want you to do is look at this place.\u201d</p><p>Annie was already out of Jonathan\u2019s car and eager to explore. Bethanne wished she shared Grant and Annie\u2019s enthusiasm.</p><p>True to her word, Bethanne toured the house. She had to agree it was everything Grant had claimed and more. The views of the lake and surrounding area were breathtaking. And the inside\u2014had she designed a dream home it would have looked almost exactly like this. A huge walk-in closet, the washer and dryer on the second floor and a deck off the master bedroom.</p><p>Grant hardly said a word as Jonathan escorted them from room to room, detailing the unique features, of which there were many. He waited until they were back in the car before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWell, what did you think?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne took a moment to collect her thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s perfect\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d feel that way once you saw it,\u201d he said, nearly exploding with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d she continued.</p><p>It was as if he hadn\u2019t heard her. \u201cI could see your eyes light up every time Jonathan showed us another room, especially the kitchen. Didn\u2019t you love that huge gas stove? I have to tell you, Bethanne, I could just see you roasting our Thanksgiving turkey in that oven. Plus, the house is a steal and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA steal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the owner\u2019s been transferred and is anxious to sell. The house has been on the market nearly six months and he wants it to move. He\u2019s making double house payments, so he wouldn\u2019t reject any reasonable offer.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne sympathized with the owner\u2019s predicament.</p><p>\u201cI figure we could get the price down another ten percent,\u201d Grant said. \u201cJonathan suggests, and I agree, that we go in low and be willing to dicker. Banks prefer twenty-five percent down, and I can handle that. I\u2019ll have to sell a few of my stocks, but I feel this house might be an even better investment than what I can expect to do in the market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should make that offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to, but living here on my own won\u2019t mean a thing if you aren\u2019t with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant, please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to pressure you, and I apologize if it feels that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss this now, all right?\u201d</p><p>He looked crestfallen. \u201cOkay. I hope we can start over, Bethanne, and I thought a complete break with the past would be best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t want us to have a second chance,\u201d she clarified, \u201cbut it\u2019s premature to make that decision. I told Max, and I\u2019m telling you, I want to wait until after Andrew\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old house is filled with memories,\u201d Grant argued. \u201cSome of them must be painful, particularly for you. The only reason I wanted you to see this house is so you\u2019d know I\u2019m willing to invest everything in creating a new life with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you don\u2019t seem to understand,\u201d Bethanne said, speaking slowly, hoping he\u2019d listen and understand, \u201cis that I risked everything when you left so I could keep the house. I was the one who held our family together. I kept up the house payments and started a business. At the beginning of each month I calculated how many parties I\u2019d have to hold in order to get the mortgage payment in on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the first couple of years were rocky for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRocky?\u201d The man didn\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I can see I stepped on a hornet\u2019s nest. How many times do I have to tell you I\u2019m sorry?\u201d he muttered, and she could see how difficult this was for him. Well, it was for her, too.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t want to move and start fresh,\u201d he said. \u201cFine. We won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if he meant they wouldn\u2019t move or wouldn\u2019t start over, and she didn\u2019t ask. They drove back to his office in silence. The tension in the car was so high she almost expected the windows to shatter under the weight of it. Maybe he was right. Maybe she was incapable of freeing herself from the bitterness of his betrayal. She thought she had; she hoped she had. Apparently not.</p><p>Grant pulled into his assigned parking spot at the office and the two of them sat in the car. Neither seemed capable of moving. Bethanne hated the fact that they were fighting. When they were married, she was invariably the one who sought a reconciliation when they\u2019d disagreed. Discord had always upset her.</p><p>\u201cBethanne,\u201d Grant said after an awkward moment. \u201cI spoke out of turn. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>She took a shaky breath and forced herself to relax. \u201cI do, too. I don\u2019t know why we lashed out at each other like that.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her fingers and wrapped his own hand around hers. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever makes you happy. I thought\u2014well, it doesn\u2019t matter what I thought. What\u2019s important is your happiness. If you\u2019re still dealing with issues about me, then that\u2019s understandable. I deserve it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that...\u201d Maybe it was, but only to a degree. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give up my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we won\u2019t,\u201d he said softly. He leaned over and kissed her cheek.</p><p>Thirty-Three</p><p>Andrew got to the house early on Thursday evening, the day after Bethanne had seen the Lake Washington house with Grant. Courtney would be joining them later. She had a dinner meeting with her bridesmaids, including Annie, who\u2019d most likely come to the house with her afterward.</p> <p>Bethanne had Andrew\u2019s favorite made-from-scratch black bean soup simmering in the Crock-Pot and corn bread baking in the oven. She\u2019d purposely put on the apron Andrew had sewed in his high school Family and Consumer Science Education class. When she was in school, the class had been called Home Ec and it was for girls only. Times had definitely changed. Andrew had done a good job on the apron and she wore it with pride.</p><p>Her son breezed into the house, hugged her and then immediately lifted the lid on the Crock-Pot. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d make the black bean soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already passed the recipe on to Courtney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the one for rhubarb crunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too,\u201d Bethanne said, unable to hold back a smile. In fact, she\u2019d put together a small family cookbook of recipes for every season. The black bean was Andrew\u2019s all-time favorite, and she used to have a huge batch going every college break. That soup alone was practically enough to bring him home.</p> <p>He slid onto a stool at the kitchen counter and watched her for several seconds. \u201cI got a surprise phone call on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Who from?\u201d she asked absently as she stirred the soup.</p><p>\u201cYour friend Max.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne dropped the spoon, which clanged against the side of the ceramic pot. \u201cMax called you?\u201d She wondered how he\u2019d gotten Andrew\u2019s number, then realized it wouldn\u2019t have been difficult.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to send a case of champagne for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne\u2019s mouth went dry. She tried to speak but couldn\u2019t get her tongue to cooperate.</p> <p>\u201cFirst, I told him I\u2019d talk it over with you, but then I went ahead and made a decision. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind. Whatever you decide is up to you and Courtney.\u201d Bethanne managed to speak, although her voice echoed oddly in her ears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really generous of him to offer. We haven\u2019t met, but I like him, Mom. He sounds like a cool guy.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne just nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhen I mentioned that you and I were getting together tonight to discuss the rehearsal dinner, he offered to send a couple cases of wine for that, too.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne paid an inordinate amount of attention to the soup. \u201cYour father might not appreciate your accepting either offer.\u201d</p><p>Andrew considered that for a minute, then shrugged. \u201cI say if Max wants to send us wine as a wedding gift, we should let him. Courtney agrees. I wouldn\u2019t turn down anyone else\u2019s gift\u2014why should I reject his?\u201d</p><p>He had a point.</p> <p>\u201cDoes it bother you, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I think it\u2019s a wonderful gesture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Andrew slid off the stool and got two bowls, which he carried to the kitchen table, setting them on the quilted place mats.</p><p>\u201cDid...did Max ask about me?\u201d</p><p>Andrew appeared to find her question highly amusing. \u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, her son was going to force her to beg for every scrap of information. Andrew pretended interest in collecting silverware from the drawer.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make me ask?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be so cruel, should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, placing her hands on her hips. She waited impatiently for him to fill her in on their conversation.</p><p>\u201cHe told me some more about how the two of you met.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the memory.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you rode on the back of his bike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than once,\u201d she admitted proudly.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s something I\u2019d like to see.\u201d</p><p>In the beginning she\u2019d been terrified by every bump and curve in the road, but gradually she\u2019d learned to relax and enjoy the sensation of freedom. If the relationship between Max and her developed, and that remained a huge question, she might eventually learn to ride herself.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t ask how it\u2019s going with you and Dad, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wondering,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cI think it\u2019s been difficult for him not knowing, but he said he promised you this time with Dad and that he\u2019s a man of his word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father gave him the same opportunity,\u201d she reminded Andrew.</p><p>\u201cWell, sure, but he had Annie reporting to him every ten minutes. Max doesn\u2019t have anyone feeding him information.\u201d</p><p>That was true\u2014and probably just as well.</p><p>\u201cWe only spoke for a few minutes. I told him I\u2019d discuss the wine and champagne with Courtney and get back to him in the morning. But basically we\u2019ve decided to accept.\u201d</p><p>She felt her son\u2019s scrutiny as if he expected her to weigh in with an opinion. Like she\u2019d already said, the decision was up to him and Courtney.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t have anything to say about this?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>The doorbell chimed just then, and to her surprise it was Grant. Andrew tensed as his father followed Bethanne into the kitchen. She returned to the other side of the counter while Grant leaned against it.</p><p>Father and son eyed each other, and Bethanne sensed the sadness in Grant. He missed his son and wanted the situation to be different.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind my dropping in like this,\u201d Grant said casually. \u201cAnnie told me you were discussing the rehearsal dinner tonight and I thought I should be here, too. I\u2019d like to be part of this wedding.\u201d He risked a glance in Andrew\u2019s direction. \u201cIf that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Andrew didn\u2019t comment. \u201cMom and I were just talking about the wine.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne sent him a warning look, which he ignored.</p><p>\u201cI have a couple of friends who are familiar with wine varieties. Should I check with them?\u201d Grant asked.</p><p>\u201cI believe we\u2019ve already got the drinks covered, Grant,\u201d Bethanne said pointedly. \u201cThanks for offering, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Grant looked somewhat taken aback. \u201cI thought you two were about to discuss the menu. How do you know if you want white wine or red? Actually, it might be a good idea to order a case of each.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Mom said,\u201d Andrew told him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got that covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that we don\u2019t value your input,\u201d Bethanne was quick to add, wanting to avoid a disagreement.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind is it? Sauvignon blanc? Merlot for the red? That\u2019s what I\u2019d recommend.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne looked to her son for help.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet, but I know it\u2019s going to be the best wine available,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cAlong with the wine, the same person\u2019s giving us three cases of champagne for the reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s giving you wine and champagne?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne nodded.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Grant\u2019s eyebrows rose slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s no small expense. Who\u2019s being so generous?\u201d He rested his hands on the counter behind him. \u201cIs it one of my clients?\u201d</p><p>Since he obviously wasn\u2019t letting this go, Bethanne left it to her son to explain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Max Scranton,\u201d Andrew said after a brief hesitation.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Grant asked, and then comprehension came into his eyes. \u201cMax? That biker? You\u2019ve got to be kidding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax owns a wine distribution company,\u201d Andrew informed his father.</p><p>\u201cHis brother\u2019s a partner,\u201d Bethanne corrected.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Andrew said with a shrug, \u201cbut Max owns the larger part of the business.\u201d</p><p>This was news to Bethanne. Max and Andrew\u2019s conversation had obviously been longer than her son had implied.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to accept it, are you?\u201d Grant frowned at Andrew, then Bethanne. \u201cHow do you think that would look?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe two of us are working on a reconciliation and another man gives our son all the wine for the wedding. This has the potential to be embarrassing. What are you going to tell people?\u201d He seemed to expect Bethanne to second his objection.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone anything,\u201d Bethanne said. \u201cIt\u2019s no one\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon,\u201d Grant said, looking at Andrew, \u201care you really going to accept this?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne couldn\u2019t remember the last time Grant had addressed Andrew as \u201cson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Dad, I did talk to Mom and she said the decision was mine and Courtney\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Grant glanced at Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cThe wine and champagne were given to them, not me,\u201d she said.</p><p>Grant blinked. \u201cSo...you\u2019re taking the wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the champagne.\u201d Andrew shrugged again. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift. Courtney and I were offered a nice gift by a friend of Mom, Grandma and Annie, so we\u2019re saying yes. This has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Grant said, attempting to disguise his wounded pride. Seeing the two soup bowls set on the kitchen table, he shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cIt looks like you two have everything under control here. If you need me for anything, give me a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Andrew muttered.</p><p>Wearing an expression of both hurt and disappointment, Grant walked out of the house.</p><p>Bethanne waited until the front door closed before she confronted her son. \u201cAndrew, was it really necessary to say that the wine\u2019s from Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, as a matter of fact, it was. Dad would find out about it sooner or later, and frankly I\u2019d rather tell him now than have him discover it the day of the wedding.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, regretting the hostility between father and son, as she removed the corn bread from the oven and set it on the stove top to cool.</p><p>\u201cAnnie said earlier that you and Dad looked at a house on Lake Washington yesterday,\u201d Andrew commented.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted me to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo things between you and Dad are going okay?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne didn\u2019t answer. Instead, she picked up the bowls, filled them and brought them back to the table. Andrew took the sour cream from the refrigerator and spooned it into a small serving dish.</p><p>\u201cYour father is making every effort.\u201d She sliced the corn bread, not meeting his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSure he is. Dad wants you back because you flattered his ego. He needs that. He needs you. It took him long enough to realize he was never going to find anyone who\u2019d do anything close to what you did for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew...I know you and your father have problems that need to be resolved, but Grant isn\u2019t that mercenary.\u201d</p><p>Her son laughed outright. \u201cMom, don\u2019t you believe it. Dad\u2019s always been about Dad. I\u2019m not championing Max. I\u2019ve only spoken to him the one time, so I don\u2019t know him. What I do know is the way you react whenever I mention his name. You get flustered\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI most certainly do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, pointing his finger at her. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it now.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed, Bethanne raised her hands to her face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been six years since the divorce and I\u2019ve never seen you react to any man like you do to Max. You\u2019re crazy about him and I have to tell you I think it\u2019s great. I don\u2019t want Dad stepping in now and ruining it for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know what I want,\u201d she said, sitting down and reaching for her napkin. Although she made a pretense of eating, she hardly swallowed a single bite.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Andrew countered softly. \u201cYou do know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father and I have talked about this and maybe he\u2019s right... I\u2019d gotten so wrapped up in you kids and all the volunteer work I did with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Andrew said, cutting her off. \u201cYou\u2019re a good mother. You always were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut was I a good wife?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said emphatically, \u201cand don\u2019t let anyone convince you otherwise. You did everything for Dad. You staged homes and ran errands and organized parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, I helped where I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you were a good wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI played a role in the divorce, too, Andrew. I didn\u2019t see it right away but I wasn\u2019t completely innocent. I allowed our marriage to grow stale. Your father was manipulated by a woman out to advance her career and the shortest path came through using Grant.</p><p>Yes, he let her do it, but he paid a high price for that. I wish you\u2019d stop being so hard on him.\u201d</p><p>Andrew stared at her as if seeing her with new eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re defending him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThink about it, Andrew. Your father\u2019s alone. Really alone.</p><p>Oh, he talks to Annie but until recently the two of us hardly ever spoke. You don\u2019t have much contact with him, either. He isn\u2019t fond of his sister and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t visit his mother nearly as often as he should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I agree. Not only that, I believe your grandmother might be moving to Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got that feeling when I talked to her. She\u2019s head over heels for this old boyfriend of hers, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bethanne smiled. \u201cBut getting back to your father...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mom, I see what you mean. Dad\u2019s out in the cold, but frankly he put himself there. It isn\u2019t like we shoved him out the door and then turned the lock. He chose to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt takes a big man to admit when he\u2019s been wrong,\u201d she said, consciously quoting Ruth. \u201cYour father would give anything to undo the harm he did. I admire him for that. Look at it from his point of view.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew slowly shook his head. \u201cI wish I could. You and Annie might be willing to forgive and forget, but I can\u2019t. Dad was heart less and calculating. He couldn\u2019t dump us fast enough when he left. I tried to talk to him, tried to get him to see reason. I begged him to reconsider, and you know what?\u201d Her son\u2019s voice rose with emotion. \u201cHe hung up on me. And you know what else? He doesn\u2019t even remember doing it. My coming to him meant nothing. Nothing. Well, he can come to me now and I\u2019ll give him the same treatment and we\u2019ll see how much he likes being ignored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Andrew...\u201d Bethanne had no idea her son had ever tried to reason with Grant.</p><p>His jaw was clenched as she reached across the table and laid her hand over his wrist. \u201cI wish I knew what to say.\u201d</p><p>He grew even more intense. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to forgive him, Mom, because I don\u2019t think I can.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Four</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d Annie asked anxiously, turning to Bethanne as if she could supply the answer. Annie and the other bridesmaids were lined up at the back of the church. Everyone was there for the wedding rehearsal\u2014everyone except Grant. Courtney carried a paper-plate bouquet comprising the ribbons from her two wedding showers; her grandmother, Vera Pulanski, had created it. Her father, along with her brother, his wife and their two children, were seated in a pew. Her sister, Juliana, was her matron of honor, so she, too, waited with Annie.</p><p>\u201cDad should be here,\u201d Annie said. \u201cGrandma and Royce were asking where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s on his way,\u201d Bethanne whispered reassuringly. The rehearsal was about to start and he hadn\u2019t shown up yet. This wasn\u2019t like Grant, who was rarely late for anything. The last time they\u2019d spoken he\u2019d said he\u2019d be at the church by five, but it was quarter past now. She glanced at her watch again, fighting down her concern.</p><p>\u201cMs. Hamlin,\u201d Pastor Hudson said, smiling over at Bethanne. \u201cI need you to sit here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She moved to the spot he indicated.</p><p>\u201cYour husband isn\u2019t here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cApparently, my ex-husband has been delayed,\u201d Bethanne said, and looked at her watch again.</p><p>\u201cYour ex-husband,\u201d Pastor Hudson repeated. \u201cIn that case we should make other arrangements.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne was about to mention that Grant wanted the two of them to sit in the same pew. She couldn\u2019t decide whether she should. Grant would be disappointed if they took separate pews, but she was afraid their family and friends would read too much into their sitting together.</p><p>In the end, she didn\u2019t say anything to the pastor; she\u2019d explain it to Grant later.</p><p>The rehearsal was almost over before he arrived\u2014breathless and contrite. \u201cI got held up in traffic. There was an accident and everything came to a standstill,\u201d he said as he rushed through the church doors. \u201cI tried to phone but everyone\u2019s cell is turned off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Dad,\u201d Annie assured him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again, and looked at Andrew, who ignored him. \u201cI would\u2019ve been here if it was humanly possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe understand, Grant,\u201d Bethanne murmured.</p><p>He seemed to appreciate that, but it was several minutes before he calmed down. Pastor Hudson reviewed the procedures a second time. When he pointed out that Grant wouldn\u2019t be sitting with Bethanne, Grant\u2019s eyes shot to hers.</p><p>His look of chagrin nearly undid her, but she was impressed by his quick recovery. He nodded and silently took his place. Bethanne felt bad about it, but she\u2019d never agreed that they\u2019d sit together as a married couple.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Ruth asked when the rehearsal was over. \u201cEveryone was worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraffic,\u201d Bethanne explained, coming to stand beside Grant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my own fault,\u201d he said. \u201cI left the office later than I intended.\u201d</p><p>Royce joined them, slipping his arm around Ruth. The couple were charming together\u2014a reminder to everyone that love is ageless.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re heading out for the rehearsal dinner,\u201d Annie said, approaching the group. \u201cGrandma and Royce, do you want to ride with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them,\u201d Grant offered. \u201cI need to spend as much time with my mother as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Grandma?\u201d Annie asked. \u201cAre you going somewhere?\u201d She exchanged a smile with Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cFlorida,\u201d Royce answered. \u201cAnd the sooner, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyce,\u201d Ruth protested, but not too much. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to say anything until after Andrew\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you and Royce engaged?\u201d Bethanne asked.</p><p>Royce raised Ruth\u2019s hand to his lips while she blushed. \u201cWe are,\u201d he said. \u201cNo ring yet, but I didn\u2019t want even one more day to go by without making it official.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Mom,\u201d Grant said, hugging her, then shaking hands with Royce. \u201cSo you\u2019re moving to Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said as she looked up at Royce. \u201cYou won\u2019t miss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure about that, but I can see you\u2019re in good hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to visit as often as you like,\u201d Royce told him.</p><p>\u201cWithin reason,\u201d Ruth added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be newlyweds and we might not be interested in company for some time.\u201d</p><p>Grant laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll definitely see me in Vero,\u201d he said. His eyes met Bethanne\u2019s and he smiled.</p><p>Bethanne kissed the older woman\u2019s cheek. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier for you, Ruth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>The church had started to empty; the wedding party, plus assorted family members, were on their way to the Blue Moon, where the rehearsal dinner was being held.</p><p>Grant led his mother and Royce outside. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he joked, \u201cI won\u2019t be late for dinner.\u201d He pulled out his keys and pushed the remote to unlock the car door.</p><p>Bethanne waved and walked toward her own car.</p><p>The Blue Moon was a restaurant Bethanne had often worked with through the years. She had a good relationship with the manager, who\u2019d been accommodating and helpful.</p><p>When she got there, Grant caught up with her just as she was about to enter the banquet room. \u201cBefore we go in, I have a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Bethanne said, although she would\u2019ve preferred to put off a conversation with him until after dinner. She had a number of last-minute things she needed to check.</p><p>\u201cDid Andrew decide to serve the wine...Max sent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No point in prevaricating or dodging the truth.</p><p>Grant stiffened at her answer.</p><p>\u201cIt was up to Andrew and Courtney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf someone asks about the wine, what will you tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say it came from a family friend\u2014but why would anyone ask?\u201d</p><p>Grant held her look for a long moment before he lowered his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cNo one will.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne reached for his hand and gently squeezed it. \u201cTonight and tomorrow aren\u2019t about us. This time is for our son and Courtney. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>Grant nodded. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything. I can\u2019t seem to keep my foot out of my mouth, can I?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne patted him on the shoulder. \u201cGrant, it\u2019s fine.\u201d His evening had begun badly with that traffic accident and then arriving late for the rehearsal. She could see how tense he was throughout dinner, not really connecting with anyone, which was uncharacteristic for him. He stayed close to his mother and Royce and made eye contact with Bethanne several times, but she was busy organizing the dinner and greeting family and friends.</p><p>By the time she was ready to leave, he\u2019d disappeared.</p><p>The wedding was taking place on Saturday afternoon at three. Bethanne helped Courtney dress, as did Courtney\u2019s sister, Juliana, her matron of honor. In her beautiful slim-fitting gown, with the wedding purse their friend Anne Marie Roche had knit and wearing Bethanne\u2019s gloves, she looked elegant. Lovely. Her beauty came from more than simply her appearance; so much love and happiness shone from her face that Bethanne was nearly brought to tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The photographers showed up around one and everyone gathered for the big photo shoot. Bethanne noticed that Grant remained in the background as much as possible, although he did spend some time talking to her father and his lady friend, Suzette, who\u2019d arrived in Seattle that very morning and had rushed to the church.</p><p>Fifteen minutes before the ceremony was to begin, Bethanne, Courtney and the matron of honor, along with the three bridesmaids, assembled in a small room off the church foyer. Bethanne could hear the guests arriving.</p><p>If she survived this day it would be a miracle. Of all the hundreds of events she\u2019d worked on through the years, the one that frayed her nerves the most was her own son\u2019s wedding.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you should know,\u201d Courtney said as Bethanne adjusted her veil.</p> <p>Her future daughter-in-law looked so serious that Bethanne paused and lowered her hands. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew sent Max an invitation to the wedding. He felt it was the least we could do after he gave us the wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t think to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was going to, but, well, he wasn\u2019t sure how you\u2019d react. We knew Grant wouldn\u2019t be pleased but Andrew said he really didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne inhaled a calming breath. If she was nervous before, this news set her completely on edge. Max could very well be in the church right now!</p> <p>\u201cMom?\u201d Annie stepped toward her. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to nod. \u201cAndrew invited Max to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne clasped her hands.</p><p>\u201cAre you glad?\u201d</p><p>Bethanne suddenly broke into a huge smile. \u201cYes...very glad. I know that disappoints you, Annie....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d her daughter said, stopping her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. I could see it wasn\u2019t really working with you and Dad. You both wanted it to, especially Dad, but it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter had recognized that almost before Bethanne did. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to your father after the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I ever really wanted was for you to be happy, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Dad. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne was convinced of that, as well.</p><p>Just knowing Max would probably appear at some point during the day filled her with a sense of joy, of anticipation and excitement\u2014and it did nothing to calm her nerves.</p><p>To her delight, the wedding ceremony went perfectly. Bethanne dabbed at her eyes when Andrew and Courtney promised to love and cherish each other for the rest of their lives. Grant looked over at her as if remembering the day he\u2019d spoken those same vows. She saw the pain in his eyes and knew how deeply he regretted having broken that promise. She smiled at him, telling him he was forgiven. And this time she meant that wholeheartedly, without reservations or lingering resentments.</p> <p>Annie rode with Bethanne to the reception, which was being held at the Century Club. Years earlier, Bethanne had been a member and supporter of the club and, because of her association with it, was able to secure the hall. It was a Victorian building in the middle of the city, with five acres of manicured gardens and lawns. As far as she could tell, Max hadn\u2019t attended the ceremony, although she\u2019d looked for him.</p><p>\u201cMom, did you see how happy Grandma is with Royce?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cHow can anyone avoid seeing it? I\u2019m so pleased for your grandmother.\u201d Robin, however, hadn\u2019t taken the news of her mother\u2019s impending nuptials with good grace. Suspicious by nature, she\u2019d demanded a background check, an idea Ruth had bluntly rejected.</p><p>Although she was preoccupied with keeping an eye out for Max, Bethanne managed to smile and exchange greetings throughout the meal. She moved from table to table, welcoming their guests. She lost track of Grant, but later noticed him making the rounds, too. When she could, she\u2019d find a moment to talk to him about Max\u2019s invitation.</p><p>The best man offered the toast and the band began to play. Andrew had just escorted his bride onto the dance floor when Bethanne saw a figure standing in the back of the room.</p><p>Max.</p><p>She blinked, excitement mingling with joy.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the Max she knew who wore chaps and a leather jacket. This wasn\u2019t the Max of simple needs and simple tastes, content to live life on the road. This was Max in a suit and tie. A man of sophistication and finesse and power. And yet...he was still Max. The Max she loved.</p><p>Drawn as if by invisible strings, she walked toward him.</p><p>He walked toward her.</p><p>They met halfway across the room, which was now crowded with dancing couples. They stood motionless, facing each other.</p><p>\u201cYou did come,\u201d she whispered, hardly able to believe he was there.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather I left and we talked later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...stay, please stay.\u201d She reached for his hand and held it in both of hers.</p><p>Thirty-Five</p><p>Grant saw Bethanne approach the other man and instinctively realized he must be Max Scranton. Anger surged through him but as he started across the room his son placed one hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Max! How dare he show up here.\u201d The anger burned even hotter inside him.</p><p>\u201cI sent him an invitation.\u201d</p><p>Grant felt as if his own son had thrust a knife in his back. He stared at Andrew, shocked that he\u2019d betrayed him in this way.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He choked out the question. Did Andrew hate him that much?</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Andrew said, locking eyes with him. \u201cLook at them. Take a good, long look at them.\u201d</p><p>Grant did and in that instant he knew with absolute certainty that it was too late. It didn\u2019t matter if Andrew had mailed Max an invitation or not. Grant had already lost Bethanne. He\u2019d sealed his own fate the day he\u2019d abandoned his family.</p><p>Without another word he turned and hurried out. Not knowing where else he could go, he went into the men\u2019s room. Pain overwhelmed him and, fearing he was about to collapse, he braced both hands against the wall, head down. He closed his eyes and struggled to breathe normally.</p><p>Despite all his efforts, his folly had cost him everything. He\u2019d hoped to win back Bethanne. God help him, he loved her; he hadn\u2019t known how much until it was too late.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Andrew stepped into the room and stood directly behind him.</p><p>Grant didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t. Nothing would ever be all right again. He was without hope. \u201cI\u2019ve lost your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I believe you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going with Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s falling in love with him,\u201d Andrew said.</p><p>Grant straightened, fists clenched at his sides. He fought to hold on to his composure, although tears scalded his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be all right,\u201d Andrew told him again.</p><p>Grant snickered. \u201cLike you care what happens to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I do,\u201d Andrew whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I did, and I\u2019d rather not, but you\u2019re still my father.\u201d</p><p>Grant turned to face his son. His vision blurred as his eyes filled with tears. He\u2019d thought he\u2019d lost his son completely. With a wrenching sob he reached for Andrew and drew him into his arms and hugged him close, as though his very life depended on this moment. Perhaps it did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he sobbed. \u201cSo sorry. I need my son...please, I need my son.\u201d</p><p>It took Andrew a few seconds to return the hug. For a long time, they clung to each other.</p><p>\u201cI need you, too,\u201d Andrew confessed. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to, but I do.\u201d</p><p>They broke apart and after a few minutes Grant said in a husky voice, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready.\u201d He wiped the moisture from his cheeks with the back of his hand.</p><p>Andrew stared at him quizzically.</p><p>\u201cI need to meet Max and wish your mother happiness.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be easy but he\u2019d told Bethanne he loved her enough to want her happiness above his own and he meant it.</p><p>Andrew nodded approvingly. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>Grant regarded him for a few seconds. Although he\u2019d lost Bethanne, he\u2019d found the road back to his son. He put his hand on Andrew\u2019s shoulder, proud of the fine young attorney he\u2019d become, and managed to say, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t wait another second,\u201d Max whispered.</p><p>With a huge lump forming in her throat, Bethanne seemed incapable of doing anything other than gazing up at him. Not until she\u2019d learned he might be at the wedding did she realize how desperately she\u2019d missed him.</p><p>\u201cI sincerely hope you\u2019re as glad to see me as I am to see you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Still in a trance she continued to stare. This was Max. Right here. Now. This minute.</p><p>Grinning boyishly, he added, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to give me your answer yet as long as you let me hold you.\u201d</p><p>Looking around her, Bethanne became aware that they stood in the middle of the dance floor with couples all around them. The music was slow and sultry, a love ballad.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should just dance,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>Max\u2019s grin widened. \u201cI welcome any excuse to wrap my arms around you.\u201d</p><p>They moved a step closer and Max slipped his arms around her waist. Holding her tight against him, he lifted her feet off the floor, nearly crushing her in his embrace. Bethanne put both arms around his neck and buried her face in the curve of his shoulder. \u201cI have missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>He snorted as though discounting her words. \u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d she agreed. This time apart had been hard on her, too, but necessary. In the weeks they hadn\u2019t spoken, she\u2019d been able to listen to her inner self and recognize what she wanted. Just as her son had said\u2014once she listened, she knew.</p><p>What she wanted. Who she needed. Max.</p><p>Because of her twenty years with Grant and because of their children, she felt she had to give reconciliation an honest attempt, but it hadn\u2019t worked. It never really would, despite Grant\u2019s efforts to win her back.</p><p>Max\u2019s hold relaxed and she slid down his front until her feet were secure on the floor. Although they made a pretense of dancing, all they really did was shuffle their feet and gaze at each other. Bethanne was nearly giddy with joy.</p><p>Max pressed the side of his face against her temple and she closed her eyes. This must be what it felt like in heaven, she mused. This overwhelming sense of happiness, of being complete. This elation.</p><p>\u201cMom, Mom...\u201d Annie\u2019s voice broke into her near-trance. Reluctantly, she pulled away from Max to look at her daughter, who\u2019d hurried across the polished dance floor.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Annie repeated, and stopped abruptly when she saw Max. Her jaw fell open. \u201cWow, you look...fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Max smiled down at Bethanne.</p><p>\u201cI came to tell you Rooster\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought Rooster?\u201d Bethanne directed the question to Max.</p><p>He winked. \u201cIt\u2019s more a case of him bringing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe him,\u201d Bethanne whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe both do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRooster is talking to Grandma and Royce,\u201d Annie said. \u201cAnd Dad\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy.\u201d Bethanne wasn\u2019t so sure what Grant\u2019s reaction would be, although she sensed that he knew it was over. Really over.</p><p>Annie shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve already talked to Dad. He and Andrew...well, you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to your father myself.\u201d Bethanne couldn\u2019t leave this to anyone else. He had to hear it from her; she was about to explain that when Andrew and Grant approached them.</p><p>Grant stepped forward and the two men eyed each other intently. Andrew clasped his dad\u2019s shoulder and after a momentary hesitation Grant extended his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Grant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>His gaze shifted to Bethanne, and he hugged her, then looked back at Max. \u201cLove her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to do exactly that,\u201d Max said. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>Grant nodded and they exchanged handshakes. Grant turned to face Bethanne.</p><p>She met his look and saw the pain in his eyes. He held her gaze a moment longer and whispered, \u201cBe happy.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed tightly. \u201cI will.\u201d Then her eyes met Andrew\u2019s and she realized that the wall between her son and his father was gone.</p><p>Grant moved away and greeted an old friend as if nothing of importance had taken place.</p><p>Andrew came forward. \u201cYou\u2019re Max.\u201d The comment was more statement than question.</p><p>\u201cI take it I have you to thank for the invitation,\u201d Max said as they shook hands.</p> <p>Courtney joined them, and Andrew slipped his arm around her waist. \u201cAnd this is Courtney, my wife. I imagine we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of you in the future.\u201d</p><p>Max turned to Bethanne, his eyes full of warmth. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly my intention. By the way, congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Courtney smiled at him. \u201cAndrew and I also wanted to thank you for the wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the champagne,\u201d Andrew added. \u201cI\u2019d offer you a glass but it disappeared pretty quickly after the toast.\u201d</p><p>Max seemed touched by their appreciation. \u201cI wanted to do something for you. I hope your guests enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all did,\u201d Andrew assured him. Then, looking from him to Bethanne, he said, \u201cI hope you intend to make my mother blissfully happy.\u201d</p><p>Max took Bethanne\u2019s hand in his. \u201cI plan to see to it at my earliest opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when will that be?\u201d Bethanne asked.</p> <p>\u201cHow about right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCelebrate, Mom,\u201d her son whispered. \u201cThis is a festive occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy.\u201d How could she not be? Max drew her back into his embrace and they resumed dancing, held close in each other\u2019s arms. They passed her father and Suzette on the dance floor; he smiled and gave them an outrageous wink.</p><p>Annie left soon after, and Andrew and Courtney continued to mingle with their guests. Bethanne noticed that Max\u2019s appearance had caused a stir. She could almost hear the speculation as to who he might be and how she knew this handsome stranger. \u201cSo that is you.\u201d Ruth marched up to Max and Bethanne, with Royce at her side.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ruth,\u201d Max greeted her, releasing Bethanne yet again.</p><p>With one hand on her hip, Ruth said, \u201cIf you\u2019d been dressed like that when we first met you, you would\u2019ve saved me a lot of grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you should be.\u201d</p><p>Max laughed out loud. \u201cAnd this has to be the famous Royce.\u201d</p><p>Royce thrust out his hand. \u201cGlad to make your acquaintance,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were talking to Rooster a few minutes ago,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cHe was wearing a suit. And a tie.\u201d</p><p>Bethanne nodded. \u201cHe cleans up pretty well, too, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two certainly played me for a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Ruth, would we do that?\u201d Max teased.</p><p>\u201cIt appears so. Now, you listen to me, young man. For whatever reason, this girl loves you. I can\u2019t understand it myself. She was married to my son and I have to tell you, she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuth,\u201d Bethanne interrupted, convinced Ruth had had one glass of champagne too many.</p><p>\u201cShe deserves a man who\u2019ll love and appreciate her,\u201d Ruth went on. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t you, then I suggest you leave now before I make a fuss and embarrass my grandson and his bride on their wedding day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your man,\u201d Max said. \u201cI plan to love Bethanne for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can shorten that life if you fail me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Robin, Grant\u2019s sister, rushed over to them, reading the situation all wrong. \u201cShould I contact the authorities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hardly,\u201d Ruth told her. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d She planted her hands on her daughter\u2019s back and steered Robin away. \u201cBy the way,\u201d Ruth said over her shoulder, \u201cMax, this is Robin. Robin, Max.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a small wave.</p><p>\u201cIs there anyone else I should meet before I take you someplace private and show you how much I\u2019ve missed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Bethanne looked around, conscious of all the people watching her and Max.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am.\u201d With one sweep of his arms, he lifted her completely off her feet.</p><p>Bethanne gave a cry of surprise as she slipped her own arms around his neck. His right arm was around her waist and the other supported her legs. He started toward the exit.</p><p>It was such an outrageous, romantic thing to do, Bethanne didn\u2019t know how to respond. \u201cPut me down,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen at least tell me where we\u2019re going!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re headed,\u201d Max whispered, his eyes brimming with love, \u201cfor the rest of our lives.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
