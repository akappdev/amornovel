Watched as the once genial Paris murdered yet another of his enemy, the Hunters. How many victims that made in the past hour alone, the angel could not say. He\u2019d long since lost count. And even if he paused to do the tally, the answer would have changed a second later as yet another body fell to the slick, blood-coated blades the warrior wielded.</p> <p>Of course, the panting, sweat-soaked Paris spun to engage two others, his motions fluid, lethally graceful...as unstoppable as an avalanche. At first, he played. A punch, cracking bone. A kick, smashing lungs. Laughing, spouting the worst of curses. Soon none of that was enough for the demon-possessed soldier, and he danced his blades over the tendons in their ankles, hobbling his prey for easier elimination.</p><p>Paris had made himself Bait to purposely draw these Hunters to him. They\u2019d come eagerly, happily, intending to steal the vile demon tethered inside him and finally end him. So Zacharel could not fault the warrior for what he did to defend himself, even as several new bodies joined the already mountainous pile enveloped by a sea of crimson and black. And yet, he could not commend the warrior, either.</p><p>These were not mercy slayings or even carried out in the name of a cold and calculated vengeance birthed in the bowels of an equally cold rage. No, these were a spew of fire, hate and desperation hotter than anything hell had ever created.</p><p>\u201cHe is like a poisoned apple,\u201d Zacharel said to the angel beside him. And because Paris was bonded to the demon of Promiscuity, his pruning belonged not to the humans he lived amongst but to the Deity\u2019s angels, who policed different realms of evil. \u201cPoison of this nature spreads slowly but corrupts absolutely.\u201d</p><p>Beads of ice fell around Zacharel, as they always fell around him these days, his breath misting in front of his face. Every crystal was to be a reminder of his own crimes, so recently brought to his attention. But unlike Paris, he did not wear misery like a winter coat, hugging it close to his body, relying on it, feeding it, helping it grow. Zacharel cared for nothing, not anymore.</p> <p>In his quest to destroy the demons that had ruined his life, he had slain \u201cinnocent\u201d humans, and this was to be his punishment\u2014to carry his Deity\u2019s displeasure with him always.</p><p>\u201cAs succulent as others consider this particular apple,\u201d Lysander proclaimed, \u201cthey will be willing to taste anything he offers.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel moved his gaze to the man who had taught him how to survive on the battlefield. The elite warrior was a muscled tower of unwavering strength. He wore a long white robe, his majestic wings like rivers of molten gold. Zacharel\u2019s ice raged around him, too, though not a single flake dared land on the man. Perhaps, like myriad other creatures, the crystals feared him\u2014and rightly so. In their world, he was judge and jury, his word law.</p><p>\u201cDo we remove temptation?\u201d Zacharel asked. For centuries he had acted as Lysander\u2019s executioner.</p><p>\u201cI will not order his assassination, no,\u201d Lysander said, resolute. \u201cAt the moment, Paris is redeemable.\u201d</p><p>Unexpected. Even with the great distance between the heavens and the earth, Zacharel could hear the grunts and groans Paris elicited, the screams of his enemies. The pleas for mercy that would echo into eternity, forever unheeded. And as determined as this Lord of the Underworld was, this was only the beginning.</p> <p>\u201cWhat will you have me do, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis searches for his woman, intending to free her from the Titan king\u2019s enslavement. You will aid him, protect him and protect the girl. The moment her ties to Cronus are cut, however, you will bring her here, where she will live out the rest of eternity.\u201d</p><p>Even more unexpected. The command smacked of leniency, something Lysander had shown to only one other demon-possessed immortal in all the millennia of his life: Amun, Paris\u2019s friend. And only because Bianka, Lysander\u2019s Harpy mate, had asked.</p><p>She must have requested this second favor, as well, for it was widely known that Lysander was powerless against her wiles. But even a besotted groom, tasked as he was with governing the heavens, responsible for all that transpired there, should not have asked another angel to do this deed. Aid a demon? Bring another here to live? Horrifying.</p><p>Zacharel offered no objection. And despite the fact that he had never experienced desire himself, he would do his best to cure Paris of his so that, when the inevitable break with the female came, the warrior would not return to his rage.</p><p>\u201cParis will protest her loss.\u201d After everything the warrior had done to find and save her already, everything he would soon do...oh, yes, he would protest\u2014using those dripping blades to make his case.</p><p>\u201cYou must convince him that he will be better off without her,\u201d Lysander said.</p><p>\u201cWill he be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d There was no hesitation in the pronouncement, lending it an edge of fiery truth. An unnecessary edge, for Zacharel knew Lysander would not, could not, lie.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I fail to convince him?\u201d He had to ask, needed the penalty riding heavy on his shoulders, driving him to succeed.</p><p>Eyes of pitiless navy frosted over, revealing the iron depths of Lysander\u2019s warrior core. \u201cWe are lost, for the greatest war the world has ever known now brews. The girl will lead us to our victory\u2014or our enemy to theirs. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d</p><p>Very well, then. When the time came, Zacharel would take her. No matter how Paris was affected.</p><p>Paris would hate him, and would, perhaps, do more than rage. There was no stopping that, not when so much darkness swirled inside him, a rot in his soul, far worse than any spiritual poison. But that wouldn\u2019t stop Zacharel from fulfilling his duty.</p><p>Nothing would.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>PARIS TOSSED BACK THREE fingers of Glenlivet and signaled the bartender. He wanted an entire hand and by right or might, he\u2019d have it. Except soon after the single malt was poured, he realized an entire hand wasn\u2019t going to cut it, either. Fury and frustration were living entities inside him, frothing and bubbling despite his recent fighting.</p><p>\u201cLeave the bottle,\u201d he said when the bartender made a move to help someone else. Hell, suddenly Paris doubted every drop of alcohol in a ten-mile radius would do the trick, but hey. Desperate times.</p><p>\u201cSure, sure. Anything you say.\u201d Shirtless Boy Wonder released the bottle and beat feet.</p><p>What? He looked that dangerous? Please. He\u2019d washed off the blood, hadn\u2019t he? Wait. Hadn\u2019t he? He looked down. Shit. He hadn\u2019t. Crimson streaked him from head to toe.</p><p>Whatever. He wasn\u2019t in a human bar, so no \u201cauthorities\u201d would have a beef with him. He was in Olympus, though the heavenly kingdom had recently been renamed Titania. Once only gods and goddesses had been allowed here, but when Cronus reclaimed the realm, he\u2019d changed things, allowing vampires, fallen angels and other creatures of the dark to come and play. A nice little screw you to the previous king, Zeus.</p><p>Call the bartender back, Promiscuity said. I want him.</p><p>Promiscuity\u2014the demon trapped inside him, driving him. Irritating him. Remember when I wanted fidelity? Monogamy? Paris replied in his mind. Well, we don\u2019t always get what we want, do we?</p><p>A familiar growl sounded in his head.</p><p>Whaa, whaa, pout, pout. He downed the second alcoholic offering and quickly chased it with a third. Both scorched so good he enjoyed a fourth. The potent alcohol razed his chest, burned holes in his abdomen, and flooded his veins. Nice.</p><p>And yet, his emotions remained as dark as ever, the edges of that bone-deep fury and frustration unsmoothed. His inability to save a not-so-innocent woman he should hate\u2014did hate, at least a little\u2014but also hungered for, body and soul, drove him, a constant whip against his flank.</p><p>\u201cIf I asked you to leave, would you?\u201d a monotone voice said from beside him. A voice accompanied by a blast of arctic air.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to look to know that Zacharel, warrior angel extraordinaire and infamous demon-assassin, had just joined him. They\u2019d met not long ago, when the feathered axman had come to Buda to off Paris\u2019s friend Amun. Had old Zach actually succeeded, two crystal blades would have been drilling into his spine at that very moment.</p><p>I want him, the demon said.</p><p>Screw you.</p><p>Finally. We\u2019re on the same page.</p><p>Really hate you right now.</p><p>Once upon a time, the demon had spoken to Paris with annoying frequency. Then the stupid sex fiend had stopped, merely urging Paris to bed this person or that person, no matter their gender or Paris\u2019s own feelings toward them. Now, the talking had started up again and it was worse than before, because he wanted everyone, especially the ones Paris felt no desire for.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d the angel prompted.</p><p>\u201cLeave, when I had to beg Lucien to bring me here and I know he won\u2019t be so accommodating next time? No, but I\u2019d damn sure want to know why you gave a crap about my location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not care about your location.\u201d</p><p>True story. Zacharel didn\u2019t care about anything, a fact you learned real fast in your dealings with him. \u201cThat\u2019s my point, so get lost.\u201d</p><p>As Paris nursed a fifth whiskey, he studied the smoke-stained mirror in front of him, covertly panning the area behind him. Bejeweled chandeliers hung from the ceiling. The walls were rose-colored marble, veined with glittering ebony, the floor a sparkling stretch of crushed diamonds.</p><p>Throughout the room, men and women talked and laughed. From minor gods and goddesses to fallen angels trying to work their way back into their saintly fold. Good luck with that in a bar. Morons. Anyway. There was probably a demon or two sprinkled among the masses, but Paris couldn\u2019t tell for sure.</p><p>Demons were as sneaky as they were evil. They could skulk around in their own scales, proudly showcasing their horns, claws, wings and tails\u2014and getting decapitated by warrior angels like Zach. Or they could possess someone else\u2019s body and skulk around in their skin.</p><p>Paris had thousands of years of experience with the latter.</p><p>\u201cI will leave, as you so succinctly suggested,\u201d Zacharel said, \u201cafter you answer another question for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Something else Paris knew from experience: angels were freakishly stubborn. Better to hear the guy out, otherwise he\u2019d find himself with a new shadow. He turned, facing the dark-haired stunner with eyes the color of jade, and sucked in a breath. Never ceased to amaze him, how magnetic these celestial beings were. No matter their gender\u2014or how mind-numbingly dull their personalities\u2014they drew and held your attention, every damn time. For some reason, Zacharel did so with more intensity than most.</p><p>But the magnetism wasn\u2019t what caught Paris\u2019s attention this time. Majestic wings arced over the angel\u2019s broad shoulders, a turbulent fall of winter clouds with streams of gold winding and curling throughout, snowflakes raining from the tips like glitter in a globe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re snowing.\u201d Captain Obvious, that\u2019s me.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can answer you, or I can ask my question and leave.\u201d Dressed in the long white robe that was customary for his kind, Zacharel should have looked innocent and prissy. Instead, he looked like the Grim Reaper\u2019s evil twin: emotionless, as frigid as the snow he shed and ready to kill. \u201cYour choice.\u201d</p><p>No thought necessary. \u201cAsk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to die?\u201d Zacharel said it as simply as he\u2019d said everything else, mist crystallizing in front of his mouth, creating a dreamlike haze and reminding Paris of the breath of life. Or death.</p> <p>Definitely ready to kill, Paris mused. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked, because honestly? He didn\u2019t know the answer anymore.</p><p>For centuries he\u2019d fought to live, but now, now he constantly threw himself into the fire and waited to be burned. Liked being burned. What kind of sick prick had he become?</p><p>Unflinching, the angel held his gaze. \u201cI think you want one particular woman more than you want anyone\u2014or anything\u2014else. Even death...even life.\u201d</p><p>Paris pressed his tongue to the roof of his mouth. One woman in particular: the not-so-innocent one.</p><p>Her name was Sienna Blackstone. Once a Hunter and always his enemy, for Hunters were an irritating army of humans who hoped to rid the world of Pandora\u2019s demons. Then fleetingly, she\u2019d been his lover. Then dead, gone. Then she\u2019d been brought back from the grave, her soul merged with the demon of Wrath. Now, she was out there. Somewhere. And she was suffering. Cronus had enslaved her, thinking to use her demon to punish his adversaries, and now that he\u2019d lost control of her, he thought to torture her into submission.</p><p>Paris might dislike the things Sienna had done to him, and yeah, as he\u2019d already admitted, part of him might even hate the woman herself, but even she did not deserve the cruel, vicious\u2014eternal\u2014punishment being meted out.</p> <p>I will find her, and I will save her. From Cronus...from himself. Right now, Paris simply couldn\u2019t get past the fact that she was suffering. Once that part of the equation was dealt with, he would stop thinking about her. He had to stop thinking about her.</p><p>\u201cSo I want her,\u201d he ended up saying to the angel. Sienna was not up for discussion. \u201cBFD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will pretend I know what that means.\u201d Zacharel shook his wings, more of that pure, glistening snow raining down. \u201cAs for you, I think that, despite your own desires, your demon wants anything with a pulse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes even a pulse isn\u2019t a requirement,\u201d he muttered, and damn if that wasn\u2019t the truth. Sex, as he\u2019d taken to calling his dark companion, wanted anyone and everyone\u2014but only ever once. With the exception of Sienna, Sex would not allow Paris to harden for the same person twice.</p><p>Why could he have Sienna again? No damn clue. \u201cBut again, so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think, even though you crave this particular woman, you slept with your friend Strider\u2019s future wife. He is the demon of Defeat, and your actions made his courtship of the Harpy very difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. You\u2019re entering dangerous territory here.\u201d Not that Paris had anything to apologize for.</p><p>The one-nighter had happened weeks before Strider and Kaia hooked up. Or had even thought about hooking up. Therefore, Paris had done nothing wrong. Technically. And yet, he now knew what Kaia looked like naked, and Strider knew that he knew, and that meant all three of them knew Sex tossed out naked images of the girl every time they were together. A consequence Paris loathed, but couldn\u2019t stop.</p> <p>Zacharel\u2019s dark head tilted to the side in a reflective pose, all the more mysterious because of the mist that continued to form with his every exhalation. \u201cI meant only to point out that you have clearly moved on to other conquests and that you are hardly discriminating in your choices, which makes me wonder why you still pursue your Sienna.\u201d</p><p>Because Sienna had been Paris\u2019s one and only shot at monogamy. Because he\u2019d inadvertently brought about her death. Because he\u2019d felt like he lost everything when she died.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re annoying,\u201d he snapped. \u201cAnd I\u2019m done talking to you.\u201d</p><p>Still the angel persisted. \u201cI think you feel guilty about every heart you break, every dream of happily-ever-after you crush, and every bit of self-loathing you encourage when your partners realize how effortlessly you overcame their reservations. I also think you are overindulged and pathetic, and that you have no business crying about your problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! I\u2019ve never cried.\u201d Paris slammed his glass on the counter with so much force the bar split down the center and the cup shattered. Blood welled from the slices in his palm, but the sting was minimal. \u201cAnd you know what? I think you are seconds away from finding pieces of your body scattered in all the corners of this bar.\u201d</p><p>Then, while he\u2019s down, we can have him!</p><p>Zip it, Sex.</p><p>\u201cUh, here you go,\u201d the bartender said, Johnny-on-the-spot with a clean rag he thrust in Paris\u2019s direction. His arm shook. He was still afraid of Paris.</p><p>I want\u2014</p><p>I said zip it! \u201cThanks, man.\u201d Paris fisted the material, applying pressure to the slivers of torn tissue before anyone could scent him and the oh-so-special pheromones his demon excreted.</p><p>One whiff of the intoxicating aroma, and everyone around him would become unforgivably aroused, uncaring about where they were or who they were with. Mostly their hunger would be for Paris, and though that would have been an especially craptastic outcome tonight considering he was operating under a time crunch, he would have enjoyed rebuffing the males with his fists.</p><p>Except...the pheromones never enveloped him. He frowned. Sex wanted everyone he\u2019d spotted tonight. Why not take advantage of his ability and force the patrons to want him back?</p><p>Paris returned his focus to Zacharel, wondering if the angel was somehow responsible.</p><p>Those eyes of the rarest jade narrowed to tiny slits. \u201cI think you hope to save your Sienna, and that is a good thing. I think you mean to keep her, and that is not. No matter how intensely you crave her, no matter that she might be your only chance at forever, your demon will eventually ruin her, for humans were never meant to battle demons, and at heart, she is still a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her own demon?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cIf one is bad, two is surely worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d If they continued on this path, his fury and frustration would rise up and consume him. He would lose sight of tonight\u2019s goal. \u201cI\u2019m not going to keep her.\u201d He would. He so would if given a chance, and if she would have him, of course, but hell, she wouldn\u2019t have him.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because this particular woman would not like the man you have become.\u201d</p><p>Snorting, Paris shoved his free hand through his hair. \u201cShe didn\u2019t like who I was.\u201d And now, after he\u2019d irrevocably stepped over the line between right and wrong? Please.</p><p>He\u2019d known his actions were reprehensible, and he\u2019d stepped over anyway. He\u2019d killed, callously. Seduced, methodically. Lied, cheated and betrayed. All of which he would do again and again.</p><p>\u201cYet you still rush to save her,\u201d Zacharel said.</p><p>Yeah. He was as big a moron as the fallen who frequented this place. Whatever. He knew. Didn\u2019t care. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t answer to you. I don\u2019t have to explain myself. And what\u2019s with all the questions? You said you only had one more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have asked only the one. The rest have been observations, and I have one more of those to offer.\u201d Zacharel leaned into him and whispered, \u201cI think, if you continue on this destructive path, you will lose everything you have come to love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a threat?\u201d Paris fisted the collar of the angel\u2019s robe. \u201cGo ahead and try something, winger. See what\u2014\u201d</p><p>Air. He was fisting and yelling at air.</p><p>Little growls sprang from his throat as he lowered his arm to his side. The only reason he knew Zacharel had been here was the temperature of his hands. They were practically frostbitten.</p><p>\u201cUh, who were you talking to?\u201d the bartender asked, faux casual as he cleaned an already clean counter.</p><p>If an angel didn\u2019t want to be seen, an angel wouldn\u2019t be seen. Not even by his brethren, fallen or otherwise. So only Paris had seen Zacharel this go-round. Great. \u201cMyself apparently, and we prefer to chat without an audience.\u201d</p><p>Was Zacharel still here? Paris wondered. Or had he materialized somewhere else? And what was the purpose of all that talk of Paris needing to stay away from Sienna? The angel shouldn\u2019t care.</p><p>Paris dropped the rag and turned the rest of the way to face the crowd. Several warriors were scowling in his direction\u2014why?\u2014dangerously close to ruining the room\u2019s elegance with the blood they were tempting Paris to spatter. He massaged the back of his neck, forcing thoughts of Zacharel and his threat into hiding. He had bigger and badder to deal with. He was here for Viola, the minor goddess of the Afterlife and keeper of the demon of Narcissism. She should have popped in already.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d heard he was coming and bailed, and if that was the case he couldn\u2019t blame her. He and his friends had once stolen and opened Pandora\u2019s box, unleashing the evil from inside. As punishment, they were cursed to host the demons they\u2019d released within themselves. Unfortunately, there\u2019d been more demons than naughty boys and girls to contain them, and when the box had disappeared in the chaos, the leftover evil spirits had needed homes. What better recipients for the Greeks to select than the unlucky, unable-to-run inmates of Olympus\u2019s\u2014Titania\u2019s\u2014immortal prison, Tartarus? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, yeah, Paris was partly responsible for Viola\u2019s dark side. She\u2019d been one of those unlucky prisoners. He wasn\u2019t entirely responsible, though, considering the girl was a criminal once considered dangerous enough to be forcibly kept away from the very gods and goddesses who were often praised in mythology books for their most vicious deeds.</p><p>What crime Viola had committed, he didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t care. She could slash him to ribbons, as long as she gave up the information he craved. The final puzzle piece needed to at last save Sienna.</p><p>According to the Hunters he\u2019d slain just this morning, Viola came here every Friday night to hustle immortals at pool and rave about her awesomeness over a few beers. Apparently, said Hunters had been watching her, intent on nabbing her and \u201cpersuading\u201d her to join their ranks. So, in a way, she kinda owed him.</p> <p>Where the hell is she? he wondered again, searching for the telltale long blond hair, eyes the color of cinnamon and a killer body that could\u2014</p><p>Appear in a puff of white smoke.</p><p>There, in front of the bar\u2019s only entrance, stood a luscious woman with long blond hair and eyes the color of cinnamon. Paris straightened, his nerve endings zinging with anticipation. Just like that. Prey located. Target acquired.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>I WANT HER, SEX SAID as Paris studied Viola.</p> <p>Of course you do, he replied dryly.</p><p>The tendrils of smoke that had marked Viola\u2019s appearance now curled away from her, thinning out to reveal a slinky black dress. The thick straps on her shoulders veed to frame heavy cleavage before dipping past her pierced navel. The micromini skirt stopped just below the hem of her panties.</p><p>Was she even wearing panties?</p><p>Paris yawned. He\u2019d been with gorgeous women, ugly women, and everything in between. One lesson he\u2019d quickly learned: beauty could hide a beast, and a beast could hide a beauty.</p><p>Sienna belonged to the beauty-hiding-a-beast category\u2014at least to him. While he\u2019d been crazed with desire for her, she\u2019d been plotting his downfall. And maybe he was as bad as his demon because part of him found even that side of her sexy. A reed-thin female had bested a battle-hardened warrior, and he thought that was hot as hell.</p><p>And okay, yeah, she considered herself plain and maybe once he would have agreed, but from the beginning, there\u2019d been something tantalizing about her. Something that drew him, held him captive. Now, anytime he pictured her, he saw a flawless gem with no equal.</p> <p>Concentrate. A command from the demon, who still wanted the minor goddess, and a reprimand from himself.</p><p>Viola flipped the length of her silky hair over one sun-kissed shoulder and scouted her surroundings. Men openly gaped. Women tried to hide their jealousy with (unconvincing) blank masks. She paused on Paris, looked him up and down, her lids narrowing, and then, shockingly, she dismissed him and continued her visual sweep.</p><p>The last time his demon had failed to attract a potential bedmate, he\u2019d met Sienna shortly thereafter. Could that mean...what if... His anticipation intensified until his bones vibrated. He would get his answers\u2014tonight\u2014no matter what was required of him.</p><p>He closed in on Viola, schooling his features to reveal only admiration as he went over his plan. Charm first, if he could actually remember how to be charming. Force second, and yeah, he definitely remembered how to go that route.</p><p>Ignoring his approach, Viola bent down and slid a glittery pink phone from inside her black leather boot. Moans of approval erupted behind her, and men high-fived each other, as if they\u2019d just received a glimpse of heaven. Even immortals could be childish. Never me. Unaware or unconcerned, she danced her nimble fingers over the phone\u2019s tiny keyboard.</p><p>Paris frowned. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>As an opener, the question totally blew, as did his accusing tone. But if she thought to summon help, someone to fight him, or even a Hunter to kill him, she\u2019d soon find herself his hostage, as well as his informant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Screeching. That\u2019s the immortal version of twittering or tweeting or whatever you lower beings want to call it,\u201d she said without glancing up. \u201cI\u2019ve got over seven bazillion followers.\u201d</p> <p>O-kay. Not what he\u2019d expected. He\u2019d spent a lot of time with humans, and knew they enjoyed sharing their every inane thought with the world. But a Titan who did so\u2014that was new.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you telling them?\u201d Was Cronus among the seven bazillion? Was Galen, the head honcho of the Hunters? And how many was a bazillion?</p><p>\u201cI maybe might be kinda sorta telling them all about you.\u201d A grin lifted the corners of her plump red lips as she continued type, type, typing. \u201c\u2018Lord of Sex is filthy and looking to score. I\u2019m not interested, but should I help him rack up points with someone else?\u2019 Send.\u201d She focused those haunting auburn eyes on him. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when the results come in. Until then, is there anything else you want to know about me before I walk away and ignore you?\u201d</p><p>Lord of Sex, she\u2019d said. Sooo. She knew who he was, what he was, but she wasn\u2019t running from him, wasn\u2019t tossing insults at him and wasn\u2019t screaming for his execution. A great start. \u201cYes, there is, and it\u2019s a private matter very important to me.\u201d Subtext: don\u2019t you dare Screech about it!</p><p>\u201cOhhh. I love private, important matters that I\u2019m not supposed to talk about but do, because I\u2019m such a giver. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Despite her convoluted confession that she meant to tattle, there was no more typing. Good. He proceeded. \u201cI want to see the dead. How do I make that happen?\u201d Sienna was a soul without a body\u2014a soul he couldn\u2019t sense in any way. Only those who communed with the dead could see, hear and touch her. But rumor was, Viola knew a trick that rendered the ability unnecessary.</p><p>She blinked, and he noticed that her lashes were painted a glittery pink to match her phone. \u201cLet me tell you what I just heard. Talk, talk, talk, I. Talk, talk, talk, I. Well, what about me?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. There was being charming, and there was being a sucker. He wasn\u2019t a sucker. Well, not all the time. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you about you. You can see the dead. Now you\u2019re going to teach me how to see them.\u201d An order she would do well to heed.</p><p>Her nose wrinkled. \u201cWhy do you care about seeing souls? If they\u2019re still here, they\u2019re causing trouble and\u2014oh, oh, wait.\u201d Clap, clap, jump, jump, twirl. \u201cI\u2019ve already figured this little mystery out because I\u2019m highly intelligent. You want to see your slain human lover.\u201d</p><p>Instantly his fury flashed to the surface, hot enough to blister. He didn\u2019t like anyone speaking of Sienna in any fashion. Not Zacharel, and certainly not this strange minor goddess with a penchant for gossiping. Sienna was his to protect, even in that capacity. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsk, tsk. No need to confirm my genius assumption.\u201d Viola patted his cheek, all syrupy sweetness for his mental handicap. \u201cEspecially since I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>She tried to walk away.</p><p>He caught her wrist. \u201cCan\u2019t or won\u2019t?\u201d There was a big difference. The first he could do nothing about. The second he could change, and if she pushed him, she would discover the lengths he was willing to go to, to do just that.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t. See ya.\u201d Oblivious to the rage she threatened to unleash, she jerked from his hold and practically skipped to the back of the bar, her perfect ass swaying, the heels of her boots clicking.</p><p>Incensed, he followed her, shoving aside anyone who got in his way. Grunts, groans and growls abounded, the predators in the crowd taking exception to his brute-force tactics. No one attempted to stop him, however. They sensed a far greater predator in their midst.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know who I am?\u201d he demanded the moment he reached Viola. They\u2019d start there and work their way to the mind changing, just in case one was dependent on the other.</p><p>She performed another twirl, making a production of it, as if she were a model at the end of a runway. He was a tall man used to towering over women, but Viola was a tiny fluff of five feet nothing and he dwarfed her.</p><p>Sienna, on the other hand, was just the right height. Standing, or on his knees, or lying down, he\u2019d reach all the best parts of her, no problem.</p><p>\u201cI know everything there is to know about the Lords of the Underworld,\u201d Viola said. \u201cI made the entire horde of you my business when I escaped Tartarus and learned you were responsible for my condition.\u201d</p><p>She did blame him for the demon she\u2019d been stuck with, then. And she smelled of roses, he realized with a jolt, the gentle scent suddenly clinging to his sinuses, very nearly drowning him in a warm sense of peace.</p><p>Lucien, the keeper of the demon of Death, could do the same thing to his enemies, calming them just before he struck a life-ending blow.</p><p>Paris\u2019s fury and frustration quickly chased that peacefulness away. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s a dark scowl. And not a very good look for you, I must say,\u201d she added, then caught a glimpse of her coral-painted fingernails and studied them in the light. \u201cSo pretty.\u201d</p><p>Touch her.</p><p>He tuned out his demon and decided he\u2019d give the charm/sucker thing one more shot. Because, honestly? He had yet to intimidate this female in any way. If this next attempt failed, he would let loose his beast in full force\u2014and he wasn\u2019t talking about Sex. There was darkness inside him now, so much darkness, and that darkness would drive him to do what was necessary, no matter how vile.</p><p>He had no one but himself to blame, for he\u2019d opened himself up to it. Just a fraction at first, like a crack in a window. But the funny thing was, once you welcomed in a breeze, there was no stopping what came next. A wind, a storm, thunder and lightning, until you could no longer reach the window to close it\u2014and didn\u2019t really want to anyway. That\u2019s what this new darkness was. Evil in its purest form, an entity very much like Sex, urging him on.</p><p>Lie, cheat, betray, Paris thought. Here, now, like all the other times before.</p><p>He leaned down, softening his expression, forcing his demon\u2019s desires to seep through his pores. Forcing his blood to heat and the musky scent of arousal to drift from him, as sultry as champagne, as heady as chocolate. If Sex wouldn\u2019t use those pheromones, Paris would. He hated doing this, because, like everyone else, both he and Sex became mindless, flesh-hungry beings at the first whiff. Worse, the memories of what he forced people to do...to crave... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cViola, sweetness. Talk to me. Tell me what I wish to know.\u201d His tone was a sensual caress, blissful and sure, and yet, even with the pheromones affecting Paris, he wanted only one woman and Viola wasn\u2019t her.</p><p>\u201cI meant to thank you for my demon,\u201d she went on, as if he\u2019d never spoken. As if he did not currently smell like pleasure walking. \u201cHe\u2019s the best! But then halfway to Budapest to track down your fortress, I forgot all about you. I\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d She fluffed her hair, looking away from him as she waved to someone at her right. \u201cSo, anyway, now that you\u2019re here, thanks. Feel free to relay that to the others. Now you\u2019ll have to\u2014 Argh! Who put a mirror there?\u201d she ended in a screech.</p><p>Undiluted rage blazed from her expression for a single heartbeat, followed by rapturous ecstasy as she studied her reflection.</p> <p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d She angled one way, posed, then angled another and posed again. \u201cI\u2019m gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViola.\u201d Seconds passed, but she never stopped admiring herself. She even blew herself a kiss. Fine. They\u2019d do this the other way. \u201cI can make you beg for my touch, Viola. In front of everyone. And believe me, you will beg. You will cry, but relief will never be yours. I\u2019ll make sure of it. But do you know what else? That\u2019s not even the worst of what I\u2019ll do to you.\u201d</p><p>Several seconds ticked by, but she never offered a reply.</p><p>Fury...</p><p>Frustration...</p> <p>Darkness...rising... He wanted to strike, to hurt, to kill.</p><p>He inhaled, held, held...smelled an infusion of roses...released the breath. Okay. Good. This time he was able to allow both emotion bombs to fizzle before detonation, calming him.</p><p>Perhaps Viola couldn\u2019t help herself, he realized suddenly. As he knew very well, all of Pandora\u2019s demons came with a major flaw. This could be hers. She was Narcissism, after all, a lover of self.</p><p>Testing his theory, he stepped in front of her, blocking her view of the mirror. Her entire body stiffened. Her gaze darted left and right, as if searching for interlopers who might have tried to harm her while she\u2019d been incapacitated. No one had approached, and the tension drained from her. She breathed easier.</p><p>\u201cI will gut the culprit!\u201d she whispered fiercely.</p><p>Bingo. Her flaw, and one she clearly reviled.</p> <p>\u201cConcentrate on me, Viola.\u201d He gripped her by the shoulders, squeezing harder than he\u2019d intended and shaking her until those cinnamon eyes rose to meet his. \u201cTell me what I want to know and you\u2019ll walk away from this unscathed.\u201d</p><p>Still not the least bit intimidated, she shrugged off his hold. \u201cSo impatient. I should be used to it by now, but alas. Men falling all over me...still a burden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViola!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s see what my worshippers have to say sooner rather than later, shall we?\u201d She lifted her phone and read the screen. \u201cFour hundred and eighty-five votes for Help him by giving him my number. Two hundred and seven votes for Are you stupid, climb him like a mountain, and one hundred and twenty-three votes for He\u2019s mine, bitch, walk away.\u201d She looked up at him, another smile taking root. \u201cThe little people have spoken. Yes, I will tell you about the souls.\u201d</p><p>Urgency overrode his relief. \u201cTell me, then. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you. Demon scum.\u201d The harsh voice rang out from behind him.</p><p>Annnd one of the guys Paris had bumped into earlier was finally acting out. Paris ground his molars. His hands returned to the female\u2019s shoulders. \u201cViola. Tell me.\u201d She would tell him, and he would leave, finally beginning his search in truth.</p><p>\u201cGet your hands off my female!\u201d</p> <p>Or not. Unleashed aggression dripped from the male\u2019s tone, and the need for violence quickly resurfaced inside Paris.</p><p>Restrain yourself, common sense counseled. Victory is within reach. \u201cA friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no friends.\u201d Graceful fingers reached up and hooked several tendrils of hair behind her ear. \u201cOnly admirers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking to you, demon.\u201d The male again.</p><p>Need rising...higher and higher...a thick black cloud that would not dissipate until blood ran in rivers at his feet. \u201cIf you want this admirer to survive, flash us out of here.\u201d Popping from one location to another with only a thought always made him sick, but sick was better than distracted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cWant him to survive, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me, demon?\u201d The tone was harsher, and far more determined. \u201cMove away from her and face me. Or are you a coward?\u201d</p><p>The cloud enveloped his mind, a single thought suddenly consuming him. The male was an obstacle in his path, blocking him from Sienna, and obstacles were to be eliminated. Always.</p><p>Another small voice of reason whispered through him, a beacon of gold amid an endless stretch of midnight. Zacharel... Current path... Destruction...</p><p>\u201cLook at yourself in the mirror, goddess,\u201d the male commanded. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to see what I do to the demon.\u201d</p><p>Even as a curse tore from her mouth, Viola obeyed, angling around Paris as if she couldn\u2019t help herself and hated herself for it. Just like that, she was once again enraptured by her own image, pinkie-waving and blowing kisses.</p><p>The golden whisper was destroyed. Death became inevitable. Paris pivoted on his heels to glare at his opponent.</p><p>Soon, blood would flow.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>PARIS HAD GOTTEN ONE FACT wrong. He didn\u2019t have an opponent. He had opponents. The knowledge caused a heady rush of eagerness to flood him. The day just kept getting better. Earlier he\u2019d slain a handful of Hunters, and this hour\u2019s selection\u2014aka dessert\u2014was a trio of fallen angels, each one bigger than the last. They were without shirts\u2014the new fashion?\u2014their scarred backs visible in the mirror at the top of the wall.</p><p>The frothing trio formed a solid wall of muscle on the other side of the bar, their arms crossed over their chests, their legs braced apart to evenly distribute their weight. A classic I\u2019m-about-to-hurt-someone stance.</p><p>I want them, Sex said, as if that were some big surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou will not walk away,\u201d he warned the men. Lately, he couldn\u2019t afford to leave survivors. They had a nasty habit of returning for revenge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you around,\u201d the one on the left said. \u201cYou smile and women fall at your feet, but I\u2019m gonna change that when I rip your spine out of your mouth. Then I\u2019m gonna tell your enemies where you are. Yeah, I know who you are, Lord of Sex. I also know the Hunters want the privilege of killing you.\u201d</p><p>The one on the right flashed a grin, total I\u2019ve-lost-my wings-and-I\u2019m-glad evil. \u201cYeah. I like that idea. Maybe I\u2019ll sign up with them, just to watch what they do to you when we\u2019re finished, you dirty\u2014\u201d</p><p>The one in the middle, the biggest one, placed a hand on Rightie\u2019s shoulder, silencing him. He had a bright white halo tattooed around his neck. That could mean he was only recently fallen, that he still had ties with the angels or that he liked to reminisce. Whatever. He would experience the same fate as his friends. \u201cLess words, more pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, more pain,\u201d Paris agreed. He unsheathed his two favorite daggers, the clear, crystal blades glinting like rainbows in the light.</p><p>\u201cHey, no arsenals allowed inside,\u201d the bartender bellowed. \u201cOnly fists.\u201d</p><p>The entire bar stopped and quieted, clearly intent on watching.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to try and pry mine from my grip.\u201d That would mean more opponents, more bloodshed. More satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cUnfair advantage,\u201d someone else called.</p><p>Exactly. If you weren\u2019t cheating, you weren\u2019t trying. But, all right. Even lost to the decadent taste of violence as he was, Paris knew how to pretend to play nice. He commanded the blades to vanish from view while still remaining in his hands. Magical as they were, they obeyed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what weapons you use,\u201d Halo said.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d Leftie unfolded his arms. \u201cThis is our territory, and we\u2019re taking it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, we\u2019ll make sure you never return.\u201d Rightie fisted his hands, cracking his knuckles. \u201cThis is gonna be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun. Yes. For me.\u201d Paris approached.</p><p>The trio approached.</p><p>All four met in the middle. The moment Paris was within reach, he kicked Leftie while punching Rightie. Leftie hunched over, gasping for breath. Rightie died. Paris had punched with his invisible blade, sinking hilt-deep into the bastard\u2019s carotid.</p><p>One down. Two to go.</p><p>Halo swung a meaty fist, but the low, straight line Paris had made with his body caused the former winger to encounter only air, the momentum spinning him around. By the time Paris jerked upright, Leftie had regained his stamina and jumped on him, attempting to rip out his trachea with claws that hadn\u2019t been there a moment ago. Through dumb luck or talent, Leftie managed to angle his wrist when he realized Paris was shifting position, hitting the tendon that ran from neck to shoulder instead. There was a brutal rending before Paris shoved him off, the bastard taking hunks of skin and muscle with him.</p><p>Paris didn\u2019t release him, though. He held on tight, even as Halo got back in the game and hammered at his face. He stabbed Leftie with a quick jab, jab. Kidneys first, to shock and disable. Heart second, to kill. Leftie died just like his friend.</p><p>Two down. One to go.</p><p>Paris released the now-lifeless body, heard the thump as it landed. Grinned. All the while, Halo continued to whale on him. Crack, crack. Pain in his eye, pain in his lip. Blood cascaded down his chin, stars winked through his vision, and Sex retreated to a hidden corner in his mind. Each new point of contact threw him backward into tables, knocking down glasses, chairs and people.</p><p>Finally he managed to dodge one of those fists. He regained his balance and spun low, intending to slash Halo in the back of the knee and hobble him. But the once heavenly being was used to dirty demon tricks and spun as well, darting out of the way just before contact. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An arm\u2019s length away from each other now, they straightened and glared. Paris had yet to land a single blow on the man. He wanted to land a blow. Would land a blow. Then, when Halo was immobilized, Paris would slice him from navel to neck.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he caught a flash of alabaster, a ripple of molten gold amid the feathers of an angelic warrior, and the snow that had become Zacharel\u2019s closest companion.</p><p>The man desires his woman as you desire yours. You would punish him for that?</p> <p>The words drifted through Paris\u2019s mind, rays of light scented with hope. To his shock, the darkness thinned and he thought, No, I don\u2019t want to punish a man for going after the woman he craves. Even if I\u2019m the obstacle he faces.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably regret this,\u201d Paris said, gripping the invisible blade hilts tighter, just in case, \u201cbut I\u2019m willing to let you leave. This is a one-time offer. Leave and live. That\u2019s it. No negotiation.\u201d</p><p>Halo scowled, his chin lifting, dark gaze narrowing. Whatever his name, there was no denying his punk-rocker appeal. His hair had been dyed the same pink as Viola\u2019s phone and lashes. Tears of blood were inked at the corners of his eyes. A ring of steel protruded from the center of his lower lip. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. She\u2019s mine, and I will not allow you to have her, to use and discard her when you finish with her.\u201d</p><p>Everything always came back to that, Paris thought, disgusted with himself and his demon\u2019s need for sex. But then, the guy had said the one thing guaranteed to demolish his no-negotiation boast, so they\u2019d try this a different way. \u201cDoes Viola want you in return?\u201d</p><p>A hiss of fury. \u201cShe will.\u201d</p> <p>Same thing Paris had once thought about Sienna. Still did, if he were being honest. He hoped that there was something he could do or say that would change her mind about him and she would come around, want him the way he wanted her.</p><p>Did the fallen angel have a chance at success? Did he? Females were the most stubborn creatures ever created.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, I don\u2019t want Viola.\u201d He stepped to the left, again and again until they were circling each other, every second bringing Paris back to the man he used to be: honorable, concerned, valiant. This wouldn\u2019t last, he knew, but he ran with it while he could.</p><p>\u201cYou lie!\u201d Halo\u2019s nostrils flared with the force of his inhalation. \u201cI, who never before craved a woman, could not resist her. Everyone wants her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, not me. I\u2019m here for info that will help me save my woman. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>A heavy pause as Halo flexed and unflexed his fingers, debating the truth of Paris\u2019s claim.</p> <p>Circle, circle. \u201cInformation only,\u201d Paris reiterated. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gave an abrupt shake of that pink head, his stubbornness a rival to that of a female. \u201cI do not believe you. You carry the evil nature of a demon. You won\u2019t be able to help yourself. You will lust after her, take advantage of her. Bed her.\u201d</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t. He was too close to Sienna, and he would wait for her as long as he could and survive. Fine. So maybe the truth was\u2014he might. Survival had caused him to do terrible things. Maybe he should point out that Viola carried a demon, too. But then, Halo was past the point of thinking logically.</p><p>Paris sighed, the darkness rising again. \u201cWe finish this, then.\u201d</p><p>Paris...</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he gritted, blocking Zacharel\u2019s voice from his head. \u201cI tried your way. It didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>He and Halo leapt at each other, meeting in the middle. Just as before, those meaty fists hammered at Paris. While the beating felt like stampeding demon hooves on his face, Halo\u2019s midsection was left wide-open. But rather than take the kill stabs as Paris had done with the others\u2014some of Zacharel\u2019s light must have stuck around after all\u2014he swept his arm low and sliced into Halo\u2019s thigh, barely nicking his femoral.</p><p>Still the beating continued to rain, the fallen never registering the fact that he was going to bleed out if he didn\u2019t leave and stitch himself up. Arms swinging, legs kicking, they fell into a table, toppled to the ground, rolled. Broken glass cut at Paris\u2019s arms, his back. He landed several searing blows, accidentally slicing with his blades, until finally he sent Halo stumbling backward, out of range.</p> <p>Halo stood, gasping for breath as he stepped forward once, twice. Then he stopped and frowned with confusion. At last his knees gave out. He dropped like a stone in the ocean. His once-tanned skin blanched to an unnatural chalk-white, his tattoos dimming. His eyes were suddenly fever-bright.</p><p>Fallen angels did not heal like immortals. They healed like humans: slowly. Or not at all.</p><p>\u201cYou...you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon.\u201d Done, done and done. All three were felled. \u201cGet some help, and you should recover just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you...\u201d Incredulity bathed Halo\u2019s punk-rocker features. \u201cYou won through cheating. That was a blade I felt. Multiple times!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate to break it to you, big boy, but cheating happens a lot. You might want to try it yourself. Besides, you said you didn\u2019t care what weapons I used.\u201d</p><p>There was muttering behind him.</p><p>Paris raised his arms and spun in slow motion. The crowd had yet to disperse, more concerned with collecting bets than escaping notice. \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d Blood dripped from his still-invisible daggers, pooling on the floor.</p><p>Suddenly they all had somewhere else to be. The sea of faces parted, giving him a direct view of Zacharel. The angel had his arms crossed over the wide expanse of his chest. His expression was troubled.</p><p>\u201cStill here?\u201d Paris arched a brow in challenge. \u201cYou want a piece of me, too?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, silent, Zacharel vanished.</p><p>Seriously. Why the interest?</p><p>Does it matter? Urgency shooting through him, Paris stomped to Viola, who still studied herself in the mirror. He sheathed his weapons and jerked her toward the door. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>It was definitely time to go. One, he didn\u2019t want to risk anyone else deciding to fight him. Two, seeing him talking to her might be more than Halo could handle. And three, she might have changed her mind about telling him what he wanted to know. He\u2019d have to get physical.</p><p>Halo watched her with longing in his eyes\u2014and just before the door closed behind Paris, hatred. Yeah. The dude would be back for revenge. Shoulda killed him. He still could. But Paris opted not to return to finish the job. If Zacharel reappeared and kicked up a stink, his game plan would be screwed.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Viola said, at last snapping out of her trance. She tugged at his hold. A cool wind blew past them, caressing the silky length of her hair along his arm. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>I want her, Sex said, peeking from the shadows of his mind.</p><p>On a mission here. \u201cI\u2019m getting you to safety,\u201d he lied. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your admirers to swarm you, do you?\u201d</p><p>She tugged harder. \u201cOf course I do. Here\u2019s a lesson about women. We like to be admired from afar, and then complimented up close.\u201d</p><p>He seriously did not need lessons. \u201cI meant your admirers weren\u2019t paying you the proper homage. They don\u2019t deserve your exalted presence.\u201d</p><p>And wouldn\u2019t you know it. Her resistance ended there. \u201cYou make an excellent point.\u201d</p><p>Of course, she\u2019d missed his sarcasm.</p><p>He arrived at an abandoned alley and stopped. Perfect. The moon was so close he had only to reach out to trace the soft, orange-yellow edges. Clouds were closer still, enveloping him in a fine, dew-scented mist. Though the area was well-lit, no one passing by would see what transpired within the narrow space.</p><p>He rounded on Viola, pressing her against the solid gold bricks of the building, invading her personal space to gain her full attention. Except, her attention had already moved to her phone, her fingers flying over the keyboard.</p><p>I want, I want, I want!</p><p>I hope you rot and die.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Lord of Sex is bloodier than before and...ick...swollen. My eyes are not amused.\u2019 Send.\u201d</p><p>He claimed her phone and, rather than smashing it as instinct demanded, returned it to the inside of her boot. \u201cYou can Screech about this later. As for right now, you\u2019re going to talk to me. What can I do to see the dead? Remember, your worshippers insisted you tell me.\u201d</p><p>A pout of those lush lips, but she said, \u201cBurn the body of the soul you wish to see and save the ashes. Speaking of, did I ever tell you about how I once saved the ashes of a\u2014\u201d</p><p>On and on she droned about what she\u2019d done, then about herself, her life, and Paris tuned her out, a curtain of hope forming around his mind. He\u2019d already burned Sienna\u2019s body and saved the ashes. At the time, he hadn\u2019t known why he\u2019d done so; he\u2019d only known he couldn\u2019t part with what remained of her. And ever since, he\u2019d secretly carried a small vial of those ashes in his pocket.</p><p>Somehow, he must have suspected he would need them.</p><p>When Viola at last quieted, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s more to seeing a soul than saving the ashes.\u201d There had to be. A few weeks ago, Sienna had escaped Cronus, had hunted Paris down, yet Paris hadn\u2019t seen her.</p><p>He never would have known about her arrival if William the Ever Randy, another being who could commune with the dead, had not been with him and casually mentioned the dead girl at his feet. Of course, Cronus had swiftly tracked her down and dragged her back to her prison.</p><p>An act the Titan king would pay for.</p><p>\u201cDuh, of course there is. Mix the ashes with ambrosia and tattoo the rim of your eyes,\u201d Viola said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see her, I promise. If you want to touch her, tattoo the tips of your fingers. If you want to hear her, tattoo the flesh behind your ears, blah blah blah. I remember a time when I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Once again he tuned her out. This he could, would do. Tattooing one\u2019s self with the ashes of the dead might be disgusting to most people, but Paris would have done a lot worse. \u201cWill I smell her? Taste her?\u201d he asked, interrupting Viola\u2019s monologue.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you tattoo the inside of your nose, lips and top of your tongue. One time, in Tartarus, I\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Enough! I don\u2019t want her, Sex suddenly piped up. Find someone else.</p><p>Well, well. For once they were in agreement. \u201cIs there anything else I should know? Any consequences I should be aware of\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cParis.\u201d</p><p>The familiar voice came from behind him. Paris whipped around, sickness already churning inside his stomach. Whenever Lucien visited him, bad news was quick on his heels. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>LUCIEN, KEEPER OF DEATH, stood tall and strong, a powerful presence even through the haze of mist that enveloped him. Like Viola, the warrior could flash from one location to another with only a thought. His dark hair was a mop of tangles sticking out in spikes. His eyes\u2014one blue, one brown\u2014were bright with concern. Dirt smudged his scarred cheeks, and there were rips in his wrinkled shirt and pants.</p><p>\u201cSince I told you not to come back for me until I texted you, I take it that\u2019s not why you\u2019re here.\u201d Out of habit, Paris palmed his blades. \u201cYou better start talking.\u201d</p> <p>Lucien\u2019s gaze strayed to Viola. \u201cGet rid of her first.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cher\u201d in question straightened her spine with a jolt. \u201cOh, no, he didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not some pretty a man can just toss aside whenever\u2014oh, hey. You\u2019re Anya\u2019s man.\u201d The indignation left her, and she waved happily. \u201cHi! I\u2019m Viola. As if you couldn\u2019t guess. My reputation for awesomeness precedes me, and I\u2019m sure Anya has mentioned me countless times.\u201d</p><p>She knew Anya, the minor goddess of Anarchy? A woman who had more balls than most men\u2014because she\u2019d cut them off the guys stupid enough to get in her way and kept them as souvenirs. Well, of course Viola knew Anya. They might have \u201cminor\u201d in their respective titles, but they were both major pains in the ass.</p><p>Lucien\u2019s dark brows drew low. \u201cNo, she never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStops talking about you,\u201d Paris rushed out, halting his friend before he insulted the egomaniac. He ran his hand along the front of his neck, his fingers taut as a blade, the universal sign for cut that out or die.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lucien lied, frowning. \u201cShe mentions you all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Viola laughed, a tinkling sound of amusement. \u201cNo need to state the obvious, you darling boy. As if I\u2019m not aware of how often I come up in conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should probably Screech about seeing Anya\u2019s man,\u201d Paris said. \u201cMaybe describe him. Post a picture. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>Expression serious, she said, \u201cIxnay on the picture. Those are reserved for my image, otherwise my fans get twitchy. But the other thing...totally. Description is one of the many areas I shine in, since I shine in everything.\u201d She grabbed her phone and typed away. \u201cHair of indigo and eyes of crystal and chocolate, he stands before me...\u201d</p><p>Paris met Lucien\u2019s confused stare. \u201cShe\u2019s the keeper of Narcissism, and she only registers conversations about herself.\u201d Clearly. \u201cYou can talk freely with me.\u201d</p><p>Lucien\u2019s eyes widened, and he studied Viola anew. \u201cAnother keeper? How did you find... Why isn\u2019t she...? Never mind. Doesn\u2019t matter right now.\u201d His focus whipped back to Paris. \u201cI\u2019m here because Kane\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>The sickness returned to burn a path up Paris\u2019s chest, stopping to play a game of tonsil hockey in his throat. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few days. He and William were together. Someone captured them, took them into hell to execute them. Maybe Hunters, maybe not. Another group attacked the first. William says the cavern they were in collapsed and knocked him out before the men could do anything to him. When he woke up, he was in a motel room in Budapest. Without Kane.\u201d</p><p>Paris rubbed a hand down his face. \u201cIs Kane still...alive?\u201d He had trouble speaking that last word, much less thinking it. If his friend had been slain while he\u2019d been chasing tail, he would never forgive himself.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. He is. He has to be.\u201d</p><p>Because they couldn\u2019t stand the thought of living without him. \u201cYou putting together a posse to search for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you have so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmun, Aeron, Sabin and Gideon.\u201d</p><p>Nasty fighters, all of them. If Paris were missing, he\u2019d want the same guys looking for him. Seriously, the only team capable of getting better results would be Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers and Hannibal Lecter.</p><p>Amun was the keeper of Secrets, and there was no greater warrior to have on your side. The man was like a worm in your brain, able to ferret out in seconds information you\u2019d buried for years. In fact, there was nothing anyone could hide from him. So Kane\u2019s location? No prob.</p><p>Aeron was the former keeper of Wrath. He\u2019d recently been beheaded and given a new body, and that\u2019s when his demon had merged with Sienna. But even without his darker half, Aeron liked to make his prey squeal before he moved in for the kill. Anyone who\u2019d hurt Kane would pay. Repeatedly.</p><p>Sabin was the keeper of Doubt, a warrior of unparalleled strength and determination, and he had a vicious streak that caused hardened criminals to soil their pants in fear. He got into your head, reminded you of your weaknesses, and basically turned you into a slobbering bag of self-recrimination before he savagely murdered you\u2014with a grin on his face.</p><p>And Gideon, well, he was the keeper of Lies. He dyed his hair blue, was tattooed and pierced, and had a warped sense of humor very few others got. His new favorite game involved casting his demon from his body and into his enemy\u2019s, then sitting back and watching the human destroy himself as the evil consumed him.</p><p>Paris almost felt sorry for whoever had taken Kane.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>\u201cSo, you in?\u201d Lucien asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Hate this. He wanted to say yes. He did. He loved his friends. More than he loved himself, even more than Viola probably loved herself. (Speaking of, the damn woman was still typing, and from her mutterings, she was telling the world how the Lord of Death found her far more attractive than the goddess of Anarchy.) His friends had fought beside him, bled for him and always had his back.</p><p>They\u2019d do more than take a bullet for him. They\u2019d take a life\u2014even their own. But... \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, whether he\u2019d be able to forgive himself or not. \u201cNot right now. There\u2019s something I have to do first.\u201d His resolve, that cloud of darkness, still swirled inside him, driving him. He\u2019d come this far; he couldn\u2019t back out now.</p><p>Lucien nodded without hesitation. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d There was no trying to change Paris\u2019s mind, no making him feel guilty, which meant there was no better friend. \u201cYou want help with your mission?\u201d he added, and damn if Paris didn\u2019t start to feel guilty anyway. \u201cIf you\u2019re headed into something dangerous, I\u2019m happy to volunteer William.\u201d</p><p>William, Anya\u2019s best friend and someone Lucien would love to see stabbed in the back. And heart. And groin. Willy wasn\u2019t possessed by a demon, but according to gossip he was the devil\u2019s blood-brother, as well as related to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.</p><p>Gossip was probably right. Nothing scared William. Nothing bothered him. And the cherry on top? If Willy ever opened a closet door and the boogeyman jumped out, it was only the boogeyman who\u2019d be scared.</p><p>\u201cBring him to me,\u201d Paris said. \u201cHe owes me.\u201d William had let Cronus take Sienna without a fight. As far as Paris was concerned, the guy was now his slave for life.</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d Lucien\u2019s gaze shifted to Viola, who was still typing. \u201cWhat about her? We can\u2019t let her run around on her own. Cronus and the Hunters would doubtless love to snatch her.\u201d</p><p>Cronus hated the Hunters, and the Hunters hated Cronus. Both sides were searching for the remaining demon-possessed immortals, each hoping to recruit more than the other, and neither would shy away from using brute force to get what they wanted. Paris enjoyed the idea of screwing both parties over.</p><p>\u201cTake her,\u201d he said, placing his hand on Viola\u2019s shoulder, meaning to shake her and gain her attention.</p><p>The action, innocent though it was, startled her, and between one heartbeat and the next, she went from gorgeously angelic to looking like the demon inside her. Two horns extended from her scalp. Red scales replaced her skin, and her eyes glowed like radioactive rubies. Sharp, deadly fangs protruded over her lips. Her nails grew into claws. The scent of sulfur overpowered the scent of roses, a scarlet mist wafting from her, stinging his nostrils, making his demon whimper like a newborn baby.</p><p>With a roar of white-hot rage, she sank those claws into Paris\u2019s wrist and tossed him so hard he smacked into the building next door, its solid gold bricks cracking and plumping filigree into the air.</p><p>Oxygen abandoned his lungs. Stars returned to his line of vision. What. The. Hell? When he was able to focus clearly, he saw that Viola was Viola again, exquisite, blonde and innocent.</p><p>\u201cOops. My bad.\u201d With a tinkling chuckle, she stuffed her phone into her boot. \u201cTouching the merchandise isn\u2019t allowed. Ever. Now, did you need something from me?\u201d</p><p>Lucien pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cThis is gonna be fun. I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind going with Lucien?\u201d Paris asked her as he lumbered to his feet. Every new breath scraped his lungs against his ribs. Worse, the wound in his neck had opened. With one toss, she\u2019d done far more damage to his body than the three amigos inside the bar had. \u201cHe\u2019ll take you to Anya and you two girls can, uh, catch up.\u201d He\u2019d thought to force her to go. Now? He\u2019d beg if necessary.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Viola clapped, twirled and threw herself into Lucien\u2019s arms. \u201cYes, yes, a thousand times yes! I\u2019m going with you, but only if you promise to stop and pick up my pet, Princess Fluffikans, on the way. Small word of warning, though. You\u2019re about to fall madly, passionately in love with me, and Anya will be utterly heartbroken.\u201d</p><p>It was far more likely that one of the other\u2014single\u2014warriors would fall madly, passionately in bed with her, but now wasn\u2019t the time to point that out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucien fought off her octopus-like arms, scowled at Paris, and vanished with Viola jabbering about her majorly awesome awesomeness. Paris didn\u2019t bother staying where he was. Death could follow the spiritual trail he left behind, easy, and meet him somewhere else.</p><p>Time to do a little tattooing.</p><p>The mortal and immortal worlds were scarily alike. Titania was a thriving metropolis of shopping centers and restaurants, brimming with entertainment of any and every kind. Didn\u2019t take Paris long to gather the necessary tattooing equipment and a spare set of clothes, and settle into one of the motels he\u2019d been amused to discover existed here. Apparently even immortals liked to have secret assignations.</p> <p>As he waited for Lucien, he ate because it was de rigueur. A sandwich, and he had no idea what was strapped between the bread. He got himself off because that was necessary for his demon. He hadn\u2019t had sex today, and the orgasm was like an injection of strength. Strength that wouldn\u2019t last, not like the adrenaline rush that accompanied intercourse, but whatever. He\u2019d take what he could get.</p><p>He showered, cleaned off the blood and the wealth of other things clinging to his skin. A lot of humans had died under his blade today. Hunters, his enemy. Mostly males. More and more, they were recruiting females. Paris wondered what would have happened if he\u2019d met Sienna on the battlefield, or if he\u2019d ever attempted to interrogate her.</p><p>If she\u2019d lived long enough, that\u2019s what he had planned to do to her. After he\u2019d bedded her again. Would he have hurt her? He liked to think no, but...damn. He couldn\u2019t be sure. She\u2019d known things she shouldn\u2019t. Where he was, why he was there. How to distract him, what to use to drug him, an immortal unaffected by human toxins. Now he knew she\u2019d gotten her info from Rhea, Cronus\u2019s wife and the true leader of the Hunters. Not directly, he didn\u2019t think, but filtered down through the ranks. But even if he hadn\u2019t known, he wouldn\u2019t have concerned himself with questioning her this time around. He just wanted her.</p><p>Safe, right? You just want her safe? A sneer from Sex.</p><p>Whatever. Paris toweled off and looked himself over in the steam-fogged mirror. He\u2019d lost a little weight, had bruises under his eyes, a few scratches on his cheeks and neck. His hair wasn\u2019t exactly even. He\u2019d trimmed the strands himself, just kind of chopping anytime a piece fell into his eyes. What would Sienna think of him now? Despite everything, she\u2019d been attracted to him before. Would she still be attracted to him? Right now, he might be a little too feral for any woman. Very mountain-man meets post-traumatic stress survivor.</p> <p>But what if the impossible happened and she did, in fact, want him again? For real, with no hidden agenda. What if she simply craved his body inside of hers? After all, she\u2019d fought her way free of Cronus\u2019s prison and come looking for him.</p><p>Lowering his guard would be stupid. He couldn\u2019t trust her. Not really. He could take her, yeah, that was still on the menu. If he could still get hard for her while he was around her. Only time would tell. And if he could\u2014and he thought he could, considering he was hard merely from thinking about her\u2014maybe he could even stay with her a few days. If so, would his hunger for her finally wane? Or would it continue to intensify? Would he be able to let her go when the time came?</p><p>What if she wanted to stay with him?</p><p>He yearned for that. So damn badly he yearned for that. But like Zacharel had said, Paris would ruin her if he kept her. Not for the reasons the angel had given, but because if he and Sienna were ever separated and he couldn\u2019t get to her, he would cheat on her. He would have to. His other choice would be death, and on the scales of life-versus-death, cheating\u2014surviving\u2014won every time.</p><p>He knew that firsthand, had once tried to sustain a relationship with a woman. Susan. He\u2019d had her, knew he couldn\u2019t have her again, but had craved something more and had pleased her in other ways. He\u2019d genuinely liked her, had enjoyed her company\u2014but had ultimately cheated on her, hurting her worse than anyone else ever had.</p><p>And here was another slap of truth: if he cheated on Sienna, he would destroy everything they had managed to build, as well as her heart, her sense of trust and any hint of innocence. He would be worthy of every dark deed she then committed against him\u2014yet still he wanted her.</p> <p>The situation was so messed up.</p><p>Scowling, he slammed his fist into the mirror. Jagged pieces of glass fell, shattering further when they hit the floor, surrounding his discarded weapons and glistening like diamonds in a sea of destruction. Blood dripped from his knuckles as he palmed and sheathed the blades at his wrists and ankles and holstered the guns under his arms. At this rate, he\u2019d soon be carving himself up like Reyes, the keeper of Pain. Anything for release, for a moment when he didn\u2019t have to wonder or worry about anything but his injuries.</p><p>Whatever. He\u2019d gotten used to wondering and worrying. They were his constant companions now, and without them, he\u2019d be utterly alone. Paris dressed in the new clothes he\u2019d bought, a black shirt and black pants. Where he was going, night reigned no matter the time of day. He needed to blend.</p><p>Not long ago, he\u2019d snuck into Cronus\u2019s secret harem and seduced one of the concubines, trading sex for information. Paris now knew Sienna was being held in the Realm of Blood and Shadows, part of Titania but...not. The realm was a kingdom within this heavenly kingdom, invisible to most and protected by evil. To enter was to die, blah, blah, blah.</p><p>Paris could find the realm on his own, no problem. He\u2019d gotten very good at bribing his way through the heavens, even the hidden areas. Finger-combing his wet hair, he padded to the desk in the living-room-slash-bedroom. He sat down and spread out his new tattoo equipment. Part of him wished he was out there, killing Hunters or already making his way into the Realm of Blood and Shadows. These delays sucked.</p><p>To his immense relief, Lucien found him a short while later, appearing in the center of the room. \u201cI felt bad for stiffing you with Willy, so I brought you a prize.\u201d</p><p>Death shoved the drenched, protesting William in Paris\u2019s direction, then motioned to Zacharel, who stood at his other side. The \u201cprize,\u201d as though he was something out of a Cracker Jack box.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Zacharel said in that cold voice of his. \u201cI brought myself. Lucien was hunting you, and I saved him the time and trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Paris popped his jaw. \u201cThanks tons,\u201d he said to Lucien, ignoring the angel. \u201cMean that.\u201d</p><p>William, my sweet William! I want him, Sex said, practically spraying drool through Paris\u2019s mind. Sex always wanted a piece of the guy. Not that Paris had ever admitted that aloud. Not that he ever would.</p><p>\u201cSo sad I can\u2019t remain,\u201d Lucien said with mock pity. \u201cBy the way, Viola\u2019s pet, Princess Fluffycakes or whatever, is a Tasmanian devil and a vampire. You\u2019re lucky I\u2019m leaving without slitting your throat.\u201d Once again, the warrior vanished.</p><p>As tiny snowflakes swirled around him, Zacharel eyed the room with distaste. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously man, it\u2019s a dump,\u201d William added. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in the heavens, I only ever stay at the West Godlywood. Can we at least request a suite?\u201d</p><p>No, they wouldn\u2019t be playing either man\u2019s version of the Q-and-A game. They would be playing Paris\u2019s. \u201cWhy is it always snowing around you lately?\u201d he demanded of Zach.</p><p>\u201cThere is a reason.\u201d</p><p>So not helpful on any level. \u201cWill you share it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you following me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>At least he didn\u2019t try to deny it. Not that he could have. Angels spoke the truth, and only ever the truth, which made Zacharel\u2019s earlier threat to kill him all the more real. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not yet ready to hear the answer.\u201d</p><p>Paris loved that kind of cryptic crap, he really did. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to stick around, make yourself useful and tattoo the rest of me.\u201d For the lines around his eyes, he needed a steady hand. \u201cThen you can help me kick ass and not bother with names.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel leveled him with a frown as fierce as the flurry of snowflakes storming from the ends of his wings. \u201cI have never tattooed anyone before. I\u2019m likely to mar you.\u201d</p><p>And yet, he would still do a better job than William, no question. \u201cThe worst you can do is poke out my eyes, but that\u2019s hardly a concern since they\u2019ll grow back. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>That frown deepened, minutes ticking by. \u201cVery well. I will do this for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you make yourself useful, angel boy. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll be in the bathroom.\u201d William\u2019s jet-black hair was dripping wet and plastered to his face. There was a fluffy white towel wrapped around his waist, displaying muscles that rivaled Paris\u2019s own, and a tattooed treasure map that led to his man junk. Looking at him, you could see the makings of a temper so savage anyone who miraculously survived an encounter with him would end up needing therapy. And diapers. \u201cI\u2019ve got to finish deep conditioning my hair.\u201d</p><p>Or maybe not so savage.</p><p>No matter. Paris had never been closer to finding and saving Sienna. With these two warriors at his side, he\u2019d succeed. Guaranteed.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>SIENNA BLACKSTONE, newly crowned Queen of the Beasts, Princess of Blood and Shadows, and Duchess of Horror, stood with her back pressed into the crumbling stone wall of the castle she unwillingly called home. Her wings were heavy, constantly pulling at recently formed tendons and bones, making her ache, cringe and, humiliatingly enough, sometimes cry.</p><p>The wings arched over her shoulders and draped down her sides in a cascade of midnight, their spiky tips now reaching the floor. She remembered seeing these very wings on Aeron, the previous host for the demon of Wrath. On his muscled, grimly tattooed body, they had appeared soft, gossamer, as weightless and beautiful as storm clouds. On her slight frame, they overpowered and overwhelmed and she had trouble finding her balance.</p><p>Sadly, that wasn\u2019t the worst of her problems. Cronus, god of gods (according to him) and all around asshat (according to her), paced in front of her, ranting and raving. Saying he was \u201cupset\u201d would be the equivalent of saying the Atlantic was a rain puddle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she\u2019d first met him, he\u2019d looked like a codger of an old man, complete with gray hair, wrinkled skin and stooped shoulders. Now he was GQ flawless and barbarian tough. Dark chestnut hair hung to strong, wide shoulders. Skin of the smoothest texture was tanned to the perfect shade of bronze. He\u2019d also ditched his prissy toga in favor of a black mesh shirt and black leather pants.</p><p>The change was gargantuan\u2014and creepy. She wanted to ask why he\u2019d gone this route, then offer to punish his stylist free of charge. Did she dare? Heck, no. The ranting and raving would morph into a straight-up savage beating. At least, that\u2019s the impression he gave.</p><p>\u201cI saved you,\u201d he snapped, death in his timbre as he stomped one foot in front of the other, back and forth, back and forth. \u201cI strengthened you. Gifted you with your demon. And how do you repay me? By constantly refusing to obey me. It\u2019s unconscionable!\u201d</p> <p>Gifted? Really? If the new definition of gifted was cursed forever and ever with misery and pain, then yeah, he had. \u201cI obeyed you,\u201d she reminded him. At first.</p><p>\u201cAt first,\u201d he said, parroting her thoughts. His was an accusation that lashed like the sharpest of whips. \u201cAnd only because you were compelled. You\u2019ve since learned to block me.\u201d</p><p>True. And that she had was a testament to the iron-hard rigidity of her stubborn core. With only a thought, this huffing, puffing being could render unending pain. With a wave of his hand, he could vaporize entire cities. Something she would do well to remember.</p><p>Sienna chose her next words carefully. \u201cTo be fair, you tricked me.\u201d Okay, so maybe she hadn\u2019t chosen carefully. At least her tone had been as flat and unaccusatory as possible.</p><p>A narrowed flick of his gaze nearly buckled her knees. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p> <p>She pressed more of her weight into the wall. \u201cYou promised I would see my younger sister.\u201d</p><p>You look so pretty, Enna.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Really. You\u2019re the prettiest girl in the whole wide world!</p><p>Skye, her only sibling, a little girl she\u2019d adored with her whole heart, had been abducted years ago, never to be seen or heard from again. Sienna missed her terribly, prayed she was healthy, whole and that she hadn\u2019t suffered incomparable cruelties.</p><p>\u201cYet you merely teased me with a glimpse of her,\u201d she added, rubbing her stomach as she always did when she thought of her sister, reminded of yet another girl, someone else she\u2019d loved and lost, the\u2014 She cut that thought off before it could form. I won\u2019t break down in front of this creature.</p> <p>Cronus ground his molars. \u201cThat glimpse... I should have known it would come back to haunt me.\u201d He paused, a low growl bubbling from his throat. \u201cI guess I should at last admit the truth, then. I showed you an illusion of your sister, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Wait, wait, wait. An illusion? Sienna bit her tongue. Why would he... How could he...? No matter the question, the answer was simple. To play her like a piano, as Paris had once said to her about her. Bastard wasn\u2019t a vile enough word for this beast.</p><p>Steady, calm. \u201cIs she even alive?\u201d Sienna gritted out.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>There was no of course with Cronus. He lived by his own set of rules, and he didn\u2019t always abide by those.</p><p>Every time he appeared before her, her demon showed her the despicable things he\u2019d done throughout his life. The lives he\u2019d taken, striking down not just his enemies, but his own people, humans, anyone who dared defy him. And he\u2019d stolen, oh, had he stolen. Ancient artifacts, powers that belonged to others, women. He had no shame. No limits.</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re telling the truth now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. Your demon will.\u201d</p> <p>A suspended moment as she searched inside herself. Wrath was calm, not worked into a frenzied need to punish him for lying. That glimpse of Skye had indeed been an illusion, but Cronus did believe she was still alive. Sienna gritted her teeth, saying, \u201cBring her to me, the real Skye, and let me keep her, then I\u2019ll do anything you ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She stamped her foot. It was childish, sure, but she had no other way to express her displeasure with this man. \u201cDo you, a supposedly all-knowing being, not know where she is?\u201d</p><p>In a blink, he was a mere whisper away, scowling down at her, his breath fanning over her. \u201cEnough about your sister! Aren\u2019t you curious why I gifted you with Wrath? You, a fragile, dearly departed female who had upset one of my strongest warriors? Aren\u2019t you curious about my desire for your willing participation in my war?\u201d</p><p>Do not suggest the king of the Titans needs a breath mint. She gulped. And don\u2019t you dare think about the warrior you upset. Don\u2019t you dare think about Paris. Oh, no, no, no. \u201cY-yes.\u201d And now she was stuttering? Grow some lady balls, Blackstone!</p><p>Red flashed in Cronus\u2019s eyes. Demon-red. A fiendish crimson that made her think of blood mixed with nuclear toxins. Not only was he the king of the Titans, but he was also possessed by Greed\u2014and right now, his demon was at the wheel, driving his actions, his words. Around her, the castle shook, his anger rattling its very foundation.</p><p>\u201cYou know the Hunters. You know how they operate. You were once a part of their cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d As if she could ever forget or absolve herself. Once she\u2019d even borne the symbol of infinity on her wrist, their mark. A permanent reminder of their \u201cgoals.\u201d In this spirit form, she had no tattoos but the butterfly around her wings, and for that, she was immensely grateful. \u201cThe same is true for thousands of others.\u201d</p><p>Except those thousands of others actually had no idea they were fools, or that they were expendable, nothing more than puppets on strings. Like she had been\u2014until she\u2019d gotten a bitch slap of truth and clipped those strings with brutal proficiency.</p><p>Soon after Wrath\u2019s possession of her, Cronus had whisked her to a Hunter compound. Because Cronus could shield himself from prying eyes and humans could not see her, no one had noticed them. Just as she\u2019d seen the king\u2019s sins play through her mind, she\u2019d seen the transgressions of the Hunters. Thefts, rapes, murders, all in the name of \u201cgood.\u201d That she had once been a (supposedly vital) part of their cause, that she had once aided them...</p><p>Punish them... Steal, rape, murder...</p><p>There he was. Wrath. Her dark companion. Even remembering what he\u2019d seen, and being worlds apart from those responsible, he urged her to seek vengeance against the Hunters. To show no mercy, no forgiveness for even the innocent among them, for all the harm they had caused, to hurt them far worse than they had hurt others.</p><p>Punish...</p><p>Cringing, she covered her ears with her hands. \u201cShut up, shut up, shut up,\u201d she chanted. Sometimes she could resist him; sometimes she could not. That\u2019s when he would overtake her, and her world would go black. For a little while, at least.</p><p>Though she was cursed to remain inside this deteriorating monstrosity of a castle, somehow Wrath was not. When he was in control of her mind, they could leave. He would use her body to castigate others however he wished.</p><p>Days later, she would wake up with blood on her hands, coating her skin. Of course, memories of what the demon had done would then deluge her. Sadistic, stomach-curdling things. And yet, nothing\u2014nothing!\u2014he had forced her to do was more disgusting than what the Hunters were doing to innocent humans.</p><p>Humans. How odd her new vernacular was to her. Once she\u2019d been a human. Such a foolish human. How could I ever have thought the goal of the Hunters was the elimination of evil?</p><p>Well, okay, that was easy. As a teenager, she\u2019d seen a vile demon in action\u2014or what she\u2019d thought was a demon\u2014and the experience had freaked her out, convinced her that such evil was the reason her sister had been taken. Combine that with the shock of learning that humans were not alone, that there was an entire world of creatures at work around them...</p><p>The whole other-world thing had proven to be true, at least. But the rest, the demon she\u2019d seen? While they did in fact exist, she hadn\u2019t encountered one that night. Her Hunter boyfriend had drugged her\u2014his preferred method of recruiting\u2014created the perfect atmosphere to elicit fear, and her hallucinating brain had filled in the rest. Afterward, he\u2019d fed her fear with stories of the evil they could fight and the good they could do, saying she might even be able to find and save her sister.</p><p>What he\u2019d failed to tell her: humans made their own decisions, influenced by demons or not. They decided to embrace the dark or run into the light.</p><p>Not all Hunters cloaked their malevolence with righteous determination; she knew that, she did. Some were genuinely sincere in their desire to rid the world of evil, and wouldn\u2019t create their own to do so. But the fact that she had once willingly contributed to such a warped cause, well, she would never get over that fact. Worse, she had hurt Paris, a warrior who would give his life to protect the ones he loved.</p><p>There was no stopping the next flood of thoughts, each revolving around the man she had once harmed beyond repair. She had struck at Paris when he was at his weakest. Worse, she would have aided in his cold-blooded murder if he hadn\u2019t escaped with her.</p><p>During that escape, she was shot down and she\u2019d even blamed him for that, thinking he had used her body to shield his own. Oh, how she had despised him. Now, she despised only herself.</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t exactly true. She also hated the Hunters and everything they represented.</p><p>Cronus wanted her to punish them. Her demon wanted to punish them. She wanted to punish them. But Cronus refused to simply unleash her. Instead he demanded she return to their midst and spy on Galen, the leader\u2019s right-hand man, as well as the keeper of Hope. Yep, a demon was second-in-command of the demon slayers, and none of them knew it. They thought he was an angel.</p><p>\u201cAs devoted as you were to the Hunter cause in life, Galen will believe you wish to rejoin him in your death,\u201d Cronus said, as though reading her thoughts. Maybe he had. \u201cHe will welcome you with open arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be able to see me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe will.

But he is overly confident of his appeal and his strength, and he will think he is watching you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn that case, he\u2019ll never tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019ll feed you false information, and the truth can be garnered from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he asks me to prove my loyalty to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will.\u201d</p><p>And she would be forced to comply to continue her ruse. Would he ask her to hurt the warriors she now wished to aid? To hurt innocent humans? Well, the answer to both was the same. Never!</p> <p>Look at me. Once a human who didn\u2019t know about the supernatural, then a Hunter in the midst of it all, hating the demons I chased, and now I\u2019m one of those demons\u2014and hoping to aid the others. \u201cSorry, but I\u2019m gonna have to stick with my first answer.\u201d</p><p>Another flash of red streaked through Cronus\u2019s eyes, brighter than before. If she was intelligent, she would view that red as a stoplight for her resistance.</p><p>Why start acting like a smartie now? \u201cThat\u2019s a big-time no, in case you forgot,\u201d she said more firmly.</p><p>\u201cYour human superior ordered you to sleep with Paris,\u201d he growled, \u201cand you did. Do not try and act self-righteous with me.\u201d</p><p>Yes, but her attraction to Paris had been immediate and overwhelming. She had yearned for him.</p><p>Yearned for him, even though she believed his demon was responsible for infidelity, the breakup of marriages, teen pregnancies, rapes and the rampant spread of STDs. Even though Paris had been, and would always be, at the head of a never-ending parade of lovers. A fact driven home by a coworker who had watched him for days, snapping pictures of all the women he bedded, then showing those pictures to Sienna after she\u2019d brought him in. And yet she\u2019d still had to fight a wave of jealousy, an emotion she never should have felt in the line of duty.</p> <p>Had she mentioned her mental incompetence?</p><p>\u201cIf he asks you to kill for him, seduce him into bed instead,\u201d Cronus said. \u201cThat will save you from having to do something unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>They certainly had different definitions for unpleasant! \u201cYou\u2019d be better served demanding I bring you Galen\u2019s head in a magical box of starlight while riding on the back of a Pegasus through a rainbow, because he won\u2019t want me sexually. I\u2019ve never been the type to attract a man\u2019s attention.\u201d</p><p>She knew what she looked like. Hazel eyes too big for her face\u2014ordinary. Lips also too big for her face\u2014unappealing. Freckled skin\u2014unfashionable. And wavy brown hair that was neither silky-straight nor perkily curly\u2014ordinary, unappealing and unfashionable.</p><p>Cronus remained undeterred. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The truth can\u2019t hurt you, she told herself\u2014while hurting.</p><p>\u201cBut then,\u201d he went on, \u201cyour looks will not matter. Galen will be attracted to your demonic power. He\u2019ll want to control you, to feed you all that false information, to use you. Yes, the more I think on this, the more I like it. You will sleep with him.\u201d</p><p>She ran her tongue over her teeth. \u201cKilling Galen will destroy the heart and soul of the Hunters far more effectively than pleasuring him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but dying is not his fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his fate, then? What is it, exactly, you think he can do for you?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Deep breath in...out... \u201cOkay, there are two problems with your plan. Galen\u2019s a douche bag, and I suck in bed.\u201d Wait. That hadn\u2019t come out right. \u201cI mean, even if he only wants me for my demonic power\u2014\u201d just saying the words grated \u201c\u2014or because he thinks he can feed me false info, or control me or whatever other reason you think up, he\u2019ll never come back for seconds because we\u2019ll both be embarrassed by our performances, and the entire plan will be moot.\u201d</p><p>The only reason she\u2019d garnered Paris\u2019s interest was because he\u2019d been desperate to get laid\u2014by anyone!\u2014in order to survive. \u201cGalen is more likely to laugh at me than tell me his secrets.\u201d</p><p>Perfectly trimmed brows arched, fixing the king\u2019s features in a patronizing expression. \u201cYou can be trained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can dogs, but they\u2019ll only bite you.\u201d She would do far worse.</p><p>A beat of silence as he absorbed her taunt. \u201cWoman, you frustrate me! I\u2019m not asking you to willingly submit to torture. I\u2019m merely asking you to allow a man to have you in the name of duty\u2014as you have allowed before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too big a commitment for me. I kill him, or I do nothing to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGalen is an immortal warrior who has spent thousands of years on a battlefield. How do you propose you kill him, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust leave that to me,\u201d she said, mimicking his earlier words. \u201cAnd, hey, here\u2019s another idea. Why can\u2019t you kill him? I thought you were all-powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d With a scowl as dark as a moonless night, Cronus slammed his fists on either side of her temples, creating holes in the wall and causing bricks to fall and dust to plume in the air.</p><p>Rattle...rattle...</p><p>Great. The entire castle was shaking again.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you, a slave, question me? I am your master, your owner. The arbiter of your fate. I answer to no one.\u201d</p><p>Except to your wife. With the royal sovereigns, hurting one always hurt the other, pain slithering across the bond between them. But Sienna wasn\u2019t going to remind him of that little gem. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are. I will not align myself with Galen.\u201d</p><p>Before she could so much as blink, Cronus fit his hands around her neck and squeezed until she could no longer breathe, until her lungs burned and her throat felt scaled by acid. Rattle, rattle, went the walls, as if the entire structure might collapse from within. \u201cI can be the executioner of your soul, and you will cease to exist in every way, or I can be your savior, granting you a measure of peace at long last.\u201d Tighter...tighter...then, abruptly, the pressure eased. \u201cRemember that, for you are the one who will decide your ultimate fate.\u201d</p><p>She barely curbed the urge to feed him both of her knuckles. \u201cWhatever I decide,\u201d she snapped, uncaring of the consequences, \u201cyou\u2019re still an asshole.\u201d</p><p>Surprising her, he gave a grin full of teeth. \u201cAren\u2019t I, though?\u201d</p><p>At one time, Sienna had been mild mannered, afraid of hurting anyone\u2019s feelings, desperate to smooth any and all ruffled feathers. Maybe the demon\u2019s bad mood had bled into her. Or maybe the waspishness came courtesy of knowing just how worthless her entire life had been. Either way, she had never had more to lose\u2014or cared so little.</p><p>\u201cYou should have picked someone else to host Wrath. Because...wait for it...my answer is still no.\u201d</p><p>Rather than adding fuel to the seething cauldron of his temper, her words seemed to make him back down. His features softened, the murderous rage draining from his gaze, his taut lips sliding back over his teeth. He lowered his arms.</p><p>Shocking.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, gentle, so gentle now. \u201cThere was no better choice than you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart drummed fitfully in her chest. Though she was dead, her spirit self had developed a heartbeat, a need to breathe, the moment the demon had entered her soul-body. Unfortunately, this meant she could feel pain and if cut she would bleed.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d she finally asked. \u201cYou have to tell me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d He turned, offering his profile and ignoring her question. \u201cIn this realm hidden from the rest of the heavens, where no one will ever find you, I don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p><p>A muscle drummed rapidly in his jaw, and before she could reply he added, \u201cDo you enjoy living here, Sienna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Not because she was magically compelled to remain inside this castle, but because he\u2019d done what he could to make her time here a misery. Including digging deep inside her mind and yanking out the worst of her memories. Those memories played out like movies in every room, a never-ending stream of persecution, guilt and shame.</p><p>Every day she relived Skye\u2019s abduction. How she\u2019d failed to save her sister from the man dragging her away. Every day she witnessed the loss of the baby she\u2019d been unable to bring to term, something she hated remembering, would never willingly dwell on. Every day she saw her foolish betrayal of the beautiful Paris. How she\u2019d hurt the first man to ever make her crave more. How she\u2019d condemned him simply because of his race.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. Because you will remain here until you agree to return to your flock and become my spy.\u201d</p><p>Back in the air went her nose. \u201cIf those are my choices, I\u2019ll stay here forever.\u201d</p><p>Cronus tossed her another grin, a cruel twist of his lips that lacked any hint of amusement. \u201cIs that so? What if I told you that I picked you because of your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would demand to know why.\u201d Her eyes narrowed to tiny slits, the king of Titans in their crosshairs. He was tricky, without morals and utterly devious. She had to be careful. \u201cI would also point out that you could have played that particular card sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I feared you would obsess over her and forget my purpose. Now, however, you have left me no choice.\u201d</p><p>She feigned nonchalance and buffed her nails.</p><p>He hissed at her. \u201cWhat if your precious Skye once lived with Galen? What if she bore him a child?\u201d</p><p>Take me swimming, Enna. Please, please, please. I\u2019ll never ask for anything ever again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d The denial gasped from her, a croak of dismay. He\u2019s lying. He has to be lying. \u201cShow her to me.\u201d She forced herself to add, \u201cPlease,\u201d though the word was gritted.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t done. \u201cWhat if Galen is the only one who knows where they are? What if he tortures them? What if becoming his whore is the only way for you to learn the truth? The only way to save them?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Had no answer. He\u2019s lying! The scream of desperation echoed through her mind\u2014her own, not her demon\u2019s. She had to stay strong. Had to insist he present at least a modicum of proof before she reacted.</p><p>\u201cThink about all I have told you, my darling Sienna. I will return soon and we will discuss any new duties you might wish to take on.\u201d With that, he disappeared, there one moment, gone the next.</p><p>Sienna sank to her knees, her strength leaving with the king. Her eyes burned, her chin trembled. Her wings pulled and folded in ways they shouldn\u2019t, and a sharp cry escaped her. Every damned day was a new lesson in horror for her.</p> <p>Tears trickled down her cheeks, scalding her skin. How much more could she take? How much longer until she broke?</p><p>For Skye, she\u2019d do just about anything, and Cronus knew that. Skye was all she had left, having somehow become both sister and daughter in her mind. Made sense, though. She\u2019d only known her sister as a little girl, and the baby she\u2019d lost, a girl as well, had never gotten the chance to grow out of infancy. And the possibility of a niece or nephew? Yeah, she\u2019d do anything.</p><p>Cronus knew that. No wonder he\u2019d reined in his temper. He didn\u2019t have to hurt her physically to get what he wanted. No wonder he\u2019d chosen Sienna for his games. She was still a puppet, the strings she thought she\u2019d cut anchored to another master\u2019s hand.</p><p>Worse, there was no way to fight this one.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p> <p>PARIS SPRAWLED IN an unfamiliar bed, one hand at his side and gripping a crystal blade, the other draped over his forehead, shielding his eyes. After a few days of traveling, closer than ever to his goal, he was in another motel in Titania, with Zacharel...somewhere, and William snoozing peacefully on the bed beside his.</p><p>In quiet moments like this, Paris\u2019s mind always hopped the Memory Train, taking him back to when he\u2019d first met Sienna, and tonight was no different. He remembered walking the streets of Rome, in desperate need of a lover, every woman he encountered shooing him away as if he were repugnant. Then someone had rammed into him from behind, and weak as he\u2019d been from the lack of sex, he\u2019d nearly fallen flat on his face before he\u2019d managed to right himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he\u2019d heard her say, the sensual rasp of her voice thrilling him on every level.</p><p>He turned slowly, afraid that if he moved too quickly he would frighten her and she would run away like the others. Papers were scattered around her feet, and she crouched, trying to gather them. First thing to register was dark hair curtaining a face hidden by shadows.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll teach me to read and walk at the same time,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you were reading,\u201d he said, bending down to help her. \u201cI\u2019m glad we ran into each other.\u201d More than she would ever know.</p> <p>Her heavily lashed lids lifted, and her gaze met his. She gasped. He reeled. She was on the plain side, with eyes and lips too big for her face and skin dotted with uncountable freckles, but she possessed a grace and presence so few mortals could ever hope to attain.</p><p>\u201cYour name doesn\u2019t start with an A, does it?\u201d he asked her, suddenly suspicious of fate and master plans. Maddox had recently become a sap for a woman named Ashlyn. Lucien had abandoned his manhood for Anya. Paris refused to do the same for anyone.</p><p>Her brow puckered in confusion, and she shook her head, that fall of dark hair waving around her delicate shoulders. \u201cNo. My name is Sienna. Not that you care and not that you really asked. Sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to just blurt it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care,\u201d he replied huskily, thinking he would have the best time stripping her. One, her clothes bagged on her, hiding the secrets of her femininity. Two, she was skittish, her babbling charming, and he expected a similar reaction in bed. \u201cYou\u2019re...American?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Vacationing here to work on my manuscript. Again, not that you asked. I can\u2019t place your accent, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHungarian,\u201d he said, giving her the simplest answer. The Lords had been living in Budapest for a while, and there was no way to explain\u2014without sounding crazy\u2014 that he spoke languages she\u2019d never even heard of. \u201cSo you are a writer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, I hope to be. Wait, that\u2019s not right, either. I am a writer, but I\u2019m not published yet.\u201d</p><p>Now, of course, he knew the truth. She wasn\u2019t a writer. The pages of her romance novel had merely served as a launch pad for their sensual conversation, nothing more.</p> <p>When she\u2019d next asked him to grab a coffee with her, he\u2019d said yes, already throbbing with need for her. They\u2019d talked and laughed the entire time, and he\u2019d enjoyed every moment of it. He\u2019d relaxed with her, something he hadn\u2019t been able to do with very many others. But she had a contagious smile, a keen wit, and that grace of motion that matched her demeanor.</p><p>Meanwhile, his demon shot out wafts of his pheromones, so there\u2019d been no great difficulty in convincing her to rent a hotel room with him. Or so he\u2019d thought at the time. Along the way, she had pretended to change her mind. Or hell, maybe she had changed her mind. Maybe she\u2019d fallen in like with him, too, and had decided not to hand him over to her Hunter brethren. But sex fiend that Paris was, he\u2019d pressed her for more, dragging her into an abandoned alley and kissing the breath out of her.</p><p>That\u2019s when she drugged him, using a needle hidden in one of her rings. He\u2019d woken up strapped to a gurney, naked and groggy. She had crouched in front of him, and he\u2019d assumed the Hunters had taken her prisoner, too. Until she\u2019d said four little words that changed the nature of their relationship.</p><p>\u201cI locked you up.\u201d</p><p>His brilliant reply? \u201cWhy would you do something like that?\u201d He still hadn\u2019t wanted to believe this woman he so craved had something to do with his current circumstances.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you guess?\u201d she asked. She angled his head to the side, and, studying his neck, traced a fingertip over a sore spot. Puncture wound, he\u2019d realized, the answer to her question slipping into place, taking root.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Then she\u2019d added with a frown, \u201cThe wound isn\u2019t healing. I didn\u2019t mean to jab you with the needle quite so forcefully. For that, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed on her, feelings of betrayal and disbelief whisking through him. \u201cYou tricked me. Played me like a piano.\u201d</p><p>Again, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? And don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re Bait. You\u2019re not pretty enough.\u201d He\u2019d said it to be cruel, but now, remembering, he cringed. No wonder she had later done what she\u2019d done, said what she\u2019d said.</p><p>A blush stained her cheeks. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not Bait. Or rather, I wouldn\u2019t have been to any warrior but you. But then, you don\u2019t care who you screw, do you, Promiscuity?\u201d Every word had dripped with disgust, his charming, babbling romance writer long gone. But the grace...oh, that she couldn\u2019t banish.</p><p>\u201cObviously not.\u201d When her blush deepened, he added silkily, just to taunt her further, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid I\u2019ll hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You haven\u2019t the strength. I made sure of that.\u201d</p><p>Her newfound resistance to him, no matter how poorly he acted, irked. Females adored him, always. Well, almost always. \u201cYou enjoyed yourself while you were in my arms. Admit it. I know women, and I know passion. You were on fire for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Good. He was getting to her. \u201cWant to give me a go before your friends show up?\u201d</p><p>After that particular jab, she had stomped away from him, but she hadn\u2019t left the room. Remaining a safe distance away, she admitted her status\u2014Hunter\u2014and detailed exactly what her friends planned to do to him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to experiment on you. Observe you. Use you as Bait to capture more demons. And then, when we find Pandora\u2019s box, we\u2019re going to draw out your demon, killing you and trapping the monster inside.\u201d</p><p>Warrior that he was, and as many battles as he\u2019d fought, he\u2019d known to show her only indifference. \u201cThat it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well kill me then, sweetheart. My friends won\u2019t surrender themselves to save little old me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>When he realized antagonizing her wasn\u2019t helping his cause, he switched to seduction, his default setting. He projected sexual images into her head, something he hated to do. Didn\u2019t do anymore. He couldn\u2019t live with himself afterward. And as she had pictured what he wanted her to picture\u2014the two of them together, naked and straining toward climax\u2014her breathing became choppy, her nipples hard underneath her shirt. A white shirt that did nothing to hide the lace of her bra, proving she had a secret sensual side.</p><p>He\u2019d almost had her, but in the end, she\u2019d wised up. He\u2019d made the mistake of continuing to call her sweetheart, an endearment he\u2019d used on countless others, and she\u2019d known it. After that, it hadn\u2019t taken her long to figure out he used the term because he couldn\u2019t remember her name\u2014or anyone else\u2019s.</p><p>Finally she\u2019d left him for real, only returning a few days later when he was a few breaths away from death. That\u2019s when she at last stripped for him, at last pleasured him.</p><p>That\u2019s when he killed her.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING, Paris stood at the highest edge of a cliff overlooking the Realm of Blood and Shadows, his body poised for war. Finally, he\u2019d found his destination, hidden in a far corner of Titania, its portal invisible to everyone but William. What do you know? The guy had his uses.</p><p>Now Paris would find Sienna.</p><p>His blood boiled with the fury he\u2019d suppressed for far too long. His muscles burned with startling ferocity, and his bones vibrated with the need to act, to hurt someone. Multiple someones.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Sharp gusts of wind blustered, doing nothing to scatter the shroud of thick, black mist surrounding him, seeping inside of him. The scent of aged copper filled the air, leaving a moist film in his nose. Muted shrieks echoed from every direction, so many shrieks of pain. Above, the moon formed a sallow hook, its ends frayed, hemorrhaging into an endless expanse of unforgiving night. Below, an ocean of crimson tears frothed and hissed, creating a second symphony of anguish. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And there, in the center of it all, perched a nightmare of a castle. Dark stone crumbled. Withered ivy with dagger-sharp tips climbed the walls, every leaf reminding him of a spider. The roof knifed into several points, a body staked through the heart and hanging from each, dripping blood onto the glass panes of every window. There were several balconies guarded by multiple gargoyles of every size.</p><p>Gargoyles that would, apparently, come to life.</p><p>Writhing shadows, slick and oily in appearance, hovered around the entire structure, but they didn\u2019t touch a single stone. They maintained a generous distance, as if a rod of iron held them in place. The moment they heard the starting bell, whatever that was, Paris suspected they would burst free and attack whoever happened to be nearby.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s inside,\u201d he told his companions. \u201cI know it.\u201d He wanted to go in, guns blazing. Was desperate to go in, guns blazing and knives slashing, but he couldn\u2019t. Not yet, not yet. Information had to come first.</p><p>Death was in the details.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, wonderful, but why am I here again?\u201d William asked, scratching his head. He consumed the space at Paris\u2019s left, dressed for the runway rather than the front lines. Silk suit, no weapons. A bottle of conditioner in his pocket. Yeah. Conditioner. Again. For split ends. A little jaunt into hell had \u201cdamaged some of the precious strands,\u201d so he now carried his \u201cnecessary daily treatment\u201d everywhere.</p><p>Annnd hearing his voice caused Sex to purr like a kitten. It was disgusting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still recovering from agonizing physical and mental trauma,\u201d William added. The warrior had barely escaped from his encounter in hell, true, but being crushed by boulders and clawed by flesh-hungry fiends was hardly agonizing.</p> <p>\u201cJust, I don\u2019t know, consider this your punishment for abandoning Kane,\u201d Paris said. How many gargoyles would he have to battle? He did a quick head count. Fifty-nine from the front. Probably a similar number waited in back. Half of them were as big as dragons, but some were as small as rats.</p><p>As William could probably tell him, size didn\u2019t always matter. Which of the creatures would cause the most damage?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t abandon him. Per se.\u201d William brushed a piece of lint from his shoulder. \u201cI was pummeled by falling rock and woke up in a motel in Budapest. In my compromised mental state, I thought some demon damsel in heat had taken one look at my amazing body and rescued us, but then Kane thought to remove her from my rugged animal appeal, and so he dragged her out to get coffee, not yet realizing he was simply energizing her for the mattress marathon to come. A marathon with me, in case I wasn\u2019t clear on that point.\u201d</p><p>Paris didn\u2019t bother rolling his eyes. Clearly William was Viola\u2019s male counterpart. Wasn\u2019t that a nice little bouquet of roses?</p><p>\u201cActually, you\u2019re here because you owe Paris a favor.\u201d Zacharel flanked Paris\u2019s other side, the snowstorm now brewing above him. The change had happened the moment he\u2019d stepped into this realm. He still wore his robe, but blades were now strapped all over his muscled body. He was definitely warrior-appropriate. \u201cMore than that, you are avoiding your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>William gasped with outrage. \u201cFirst, I don\u2019t owe anyone a favor. Second, I don\u2019t have a girlfriend, you pansy-ass winged piece of shit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d A blink, all innocence. Zacharel didn\u2019t seem to care about the name-calling. \u201cWhat is young Gilly to you, then?\u201d</p><p>Gilly. A human with a crush on William. The warrior claimed they were just friends and nothing more, but if anyone could see secret longing in someone\u2019s gaze, it was Paris. And William definitely had a lot of secret longing going on for that girl. Shockingly, though, he hadn\u2019t done anything about it. Had only coddled and babied her, which was why Paris hadn\u2019t gutted him. Gilly had been through enough in her short life without William turning his lethal charm on her.</p><p>Dangerous as a lightning strike, as lethal as a pair of crisscrossing short swords, William whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re about to find out how your liver tastes, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have tasted it already,\u201d Zacharel said, his voice its usual monotone. The snowflakes began to fall in earnest, tiny at first, but growing in diameter. An arctic wind blustered around him. \u201cIt was a bit salty.\u201d</p><p>How the hell was a guy supposed to respond to that?</p><p>Apparently William didn\u2019t know, either, because he gaped at the angel. Then, \u201cMaybe if you added a little pepper?\u201d</p><p>O-kay. It was official. William had an answer for everything.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Paris said. Just then, he had his inner darkness on a leash. That could change at any moment. This was the closest he\u2019d ever come to saving Sienna. To seeing her again, to touching her, and urgency had him in a vise grip. Which was stupid. He knew it was stupid.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t know her, not really, had only interacted with her those two times, and yet, looking back, he was certain he\u2019d never felt so connected to anyone in his life. He could still remember the delicate rasp of her voice. Soft and lyrical, washing over him, entrancing him. Could still smell her sweet wildflower scent. Could still feel her soft body pressed against his harder one.</p><p>Now he wondered if he would even like her on any level but a sexual one. Would he find her annoying? And what about her\u2014would she still view him as evil, even though she herself now carried a demon?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s focus, ladies.\u201d That includes you, he added for his own benefit. If he could bypass the outside line of the fortress\u2019s defense completely, he\u2019d be in perfect condition when he got inside. \u201cZacharel, you will flash me inside the castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I will not.\u201d</p><p>He scowled but didn\u2019t bother asking why. As always, his ears picked up the web of truth woven through the angel\u2019s tone. Zacharel couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t flash him; the reason didn\u2019t matter. \u201cWilliam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only recently begun to flash myself, and yeah, I\u2019m damn good for a beginner\u2014not that I need to tell you that since anyone with eyes would have noticed\u2014but I\u2019m still honing my amazing skills. There\u2019s no way I can cart your carcass anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Paris stifled a sigh. No flashing with William, either. \u201cIs the water swimmable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not only is the water poisonous, but the fiends inside it have a hankering for flesh.\u201d William motioned to the dilapidated bridge leading to the front entrance, thick, arched double doors covered in spikes with a clear liquid dripping from their tips. \u201cYou have to use the drawbridge, and you have to let the guards carry you. There\u2019s no other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never battled a gargoyle before.\u201d Zacharel shook his head, a dark lock of hair tumbling into one emerald eye. Damp from the melting snow, the hair stuck to his skin. He didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cBut I am certain these will murder Paris before willingly carrying him inside.\u201d</p><p>As if he were the only intelligent life form left in existence, William splayed his arms. \u201cAnd the problem with that? He\u2019ll still be inside, exactly where he wants to be. And by the way,\u201d he added, blinking at Paris with lashes so long they should have belonged to a girl. \u201cYour new permanent eyeliner is very pretty. You\u2019ll make a good-looking corpse.\u201d</p><p>Do not react. He did, and the teasing about his ash/ambrosia tattoos would never end. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer the lip liner, though. A nice little feminine touch that really makes your eyes pop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, thanks,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>He wants us!</p><p>Stupid demon.</p><p>William grinned. \u201cMaybe we can make out later. I know you want me.\u201d</p><p>Tell him yes!</p><p>Not another word out of you, or\u2014</p><p>\u201cParis? Warrior?\u201d Zacharel said. \u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded, apparently not the least offended. \u201cI enjoy your honesty, though I believe you suffer from what the humans call ADD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I definitely have attention deficient demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, changing subjects, since I\u2019m not listening to the angel, either,\u201d William said. \u201cSince we\u2019re going with my diabolically genius plan, you\u2019re gonna have to scale down the cliff and step onto the drawbridge.\u201d He tented his hands and drummed his fingers, contemplating the bridge from every angle. \u201cThe moment you do, the gargoyles will come to life. They\u2019ll attack you. Oh, and the more you fight them, the harder they\u2019ll bite and claw you. So, if you remain relaxed, they\u2019ll only hurt you a wee bit before they cart you inside to chain to a wall. In theory.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful. But this was what his woman had to deal with every day. He could do no less. And if the gargoyles had broken her...</p><p>Broken... In, out, in, out, he breathed, oxygen scalding his throat, blistering his lungs. He twisted his head left then right to pop the bones in his neck. His fury bubbled to the surface, riding the waves in his veins. He would save Sienna and torch the castle to the ground\u2014along with every living creature inside it.</p><p>Zacharel folded his arms over his massive chest, the snow so thick now that none of the flakes had a chance to melt. His hair now boasted strands of glistening white. \u201cHow do you know so much about this place and its protectors, William of the Dark?\u201d</p><p>William of the Dark? That was new, yet fitting. \u201cYeah. How do you?\u201d Paris studied the gargoyles in question. They were hideous. The big ones were winged, with ramlike horns, fangs as long as sabers and probably just as sharp, and daggers for nails\u2014on both their hands and their feet. The small ones just looked hungry. Oh, and infected with rabies.</p><p>Another piece of invisible lint was brushed from William\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMaybe I was once co-ruler of the underworld and sought out all the hideaways of Cronus and his followers, intending to blackmail them, and discovered this little love shack. Or maybe I see the future and knew we\u2019d come here one day. Or maybe the gargoyles once served me, calling me Master Hotness.\u201d</p><p>Paris read between the lines. \u201cMaybe you once nailed a gargoyle, and she had a big mouth.\u201d If there was a bigger he-slut than Paris, it was William. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>William gave another shrug. \u201cOr that.\u201d</p><p>White wings threaded in gold lifted, shook and returned to their place of rest against Zacharel\u2019s back. \u201cAnd what makes you so sure your Sienna is in there, demon?\u201d</p><p>Do not react. \u201cI just am.\u201d Arca, the goddess he had seduced in Cronus\u2019s harem, the one he\u2019d vowed to rescue after ensuring Sienna\u2019s safety, had told him there were only two possible locations for her. If Sienna had been taken to the other, her soul would have withered within days. Therefore, she was here. End of story.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll provoke the guards,\u201d he said, thinking out loud, \u201cbut I won\u2019t enrage them. They\u2019ll cart me inside, planning to lock me up. I\u2019ll free myself before they can, search for Sienna, find her and escape with her. Simple, easy.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here and act as lookout.\u201d William nodded, clearly satisfied with the idea. \u201cIf you don\u2019t return in, say, the amount of time it takes my conditioner to penetrate my scalp, I\u2019ll go for help.\u201d He snickered. \u201cI said penetrate.\u201d</p><p>For freakin\u2019 real. \u201cKnowing you, you\u2019ll forget all about me and head to a salon for a mani-pedi.\u201d More than that, Paris wasn\u2019t sure Zach would have his back\u2014or stab it. \u201cSo, guess what? You\u2019re going in with me. Zach will act as lookout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve been living in Hungary for so long you\u2019ve forgotten English and didn\u2019t understand what I was saying.\u201d First in French, then in Spanish, then in Russian, he said, \u201cI\u2019m staying here, and that\u2019s final.\u201d William tangled a hand through his indigo mane, frowned when he encountered a snag. Scowling, he whipped out his conditioner, squeezed a few drops onto his fingers and combed the creamy mixture through until he achieved the desired smoothness. \u201cI\u2019m a lover, not a fighter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGuaranteed you stabbed your mother seconds after she birthed you. So do me a solid and strap on your big-girl panties because here\u2019s the deal. If you walk away now, I will follow you for the rest of your days, seducing every woman you desire away from you.\u201d</p><p>A heavy pause, rife with fury as cold as the angel\u2019s snow. \u201cFine,\u201d William eventually muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you, but only because I\u2019m in need of a decent cardio workout.\u201d</p><p>Good. Paris had meant every word. He hadn\u2019t come this far to welcome defeat. He would lie, cheat, destroy, whatever it took. Now, and until Sienna was safe.</p><p>He did a quick pat down. All of his blades were in their sheaths. A visual check on his guns ensured the safeties were off.</p><p>\u201cBullets won\u2019t kill them, you know,\u201d William said. \u201cThey\u2019ll only cause hissy fits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care.\u201d Bullets would buy him a few seconds, surely, and sometimes that\u2019s all a guy needed to bring home the victory.</p> <p>William slapped him on the shoulder, sending Sex into rapturous convulsions. \u201cBefore we do this, I\u2019ve got one question for you. And you can\u2019t lie. This is too important.\u201d</p><p>A bit sick to his stomach at what such a debaucher could want to know, Paris cast his attention to the black-haired, blue-eyed he-devil. \u201cAsk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to suggest I kiss you for good luck or strength or whatever it is your sex demon needs?\u201d</p><p>That earned the warrior a two-fingered salute.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a no?\u201d William asked.</p><p>Paris worked his jaw. \u201cHere, let me help you off the cliff to the drawbridge.\u201d With no more warning, he shoved William over the ledge. He thought he heard a fading, \u201cSo not cool,\u201d from the bastard as he fell...fell...</p><p>Splat.</p><p>Sex gasped in outrage.</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly a nice thing to do,\u201d Zacharel said, but there was a gleam in his eyes, one Paris had never seen before. Something akin to amusement.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d Paris asked him.</p><p>\u201cOnly time will tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wait here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>All righty, then. With the angel\u2019s cryptic nonanswer ringing in his head, Paris snapped a blade between his teeth and scaled the jagged rocks, down, down, his hands rapidly torn to ribbons. Vines slithered from cracks, stroking over him, attempting to shackle his wrists and ankles. Dangling by one hand, he stopped long enough to slice through the nearest green stalk.</p><p>Another soon came at him, and he sliced through it, too. But damn, they were everywhere. One wound around the arm he was using for balance. His heart tripped over itself with dread\u2014and anticipation. He glanced down at the bridge. No other way.</p><p>Paris carved into the vine holding him, kicked the rocks with his legs and fell. When he hit bottom, he really hit bottom, jarring the air from his lungs.</p><p>Suddenly William loomed over him, scowling, snarling and bloody, his suit dirt-stained and ripped. \u201cDo you know. How many strands. Of hair I lost. On my way down?\u201d</p><p>Whatever. \u201cMath was never my thing, but I\u2019m gonna say you lost...a lot.\u201d</p><p>Electric-blues glittered with menace. \u201cYou are a cruel, sadistic bastard. My hair needs TLC and you...you... Damn you! I\u2019ve gutted men for less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve watched you.\u201d Paris lumbered to his feet and scanned the rocky bank they stood upon, the crimson ocean lapping and bubbling in every direction. The drawbridge was only a fifty-yard dash away. \u201cDon\u2019t kill the messenger, but I\u2019m thinking you should change your dating profile to balding.\u201d</p><p>Masculine cheeks went scarlet as the big bad warrior struggled for a comeback.</p><p>No more playing. It\u2019s D-Day. Soon, I\u2019ll rescue Sienna, Paris thought. Maybe she would stay with him for a few days. If so, they could make love, over and over again, and for just a little while, he could pretend they had forever.</p><p>Or maybe she would leave him immediately. They wouldn\u2019t make love even once, and he would be forced to take someone else just as soon as the door shut behind her.</p><p>Who was he kidding? She would definitely leave him. There were too many obstacles between them. His demon. Her demon. The fact that he\u2019d slept with her and then countless others. The fact that he\u2019d inadvertently used her body as a shield, saving himself. Her former occupation. The fact that she\u2019d tricked him into lowering his guard so that she could drug him and allow the Hunters to capture him. The fact that she had watched as he was tortured. The fact that she hated him.</p><p>And maybe, once he\u2019d saved her, he would realize she was not the one for him. Maybe he would be the one to leave her. Maybe he would find that he truly couldn\u2019t sleep with her again. That he\u2019d made a mistake.</p><p>Maybe. But he was still doing this.</p><p>\u201cOne of these days you\u2019re going to wake up,\u201d William finally said, \u201cand I will have shaved you. Everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t make a difference. Women will still want me. But you know what else? What I did to you wasn\u2019t cruel, Willy.\u201d He offered the warrior a white-flag grin. A trick. A lie. \u201cThis, however, is.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed William by the wrist, swung the man around and around before at last releasing him and hurling his body directly onto the bridge. Frayed rope whined, and boards broke beneath his muscled weight.</p><p>William lay there, trying to catch his breath and glaring daggers at Paris. On the castle parapets, the gargoyles unleashed a chorus of battle cries.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>SHOULD SHE OR SHOULDN\u2019T SHE? Hours had passed since Cronus\u2019s ultimatum and departure, but the same question still rolled through Sienna\u2019s mind. Should she give herself to Galen, perhaps saving her sister, perhaps succumbing to her captor\u2019s deception, or should she continue to resist, possibly causing her sister\u2019s continued torture?</p><p>Another question, one far more important: If there was a chance she could save Skye, even the most minute chance, shouldn\u2019t she take it? She\u2019d vowed to do anything, everything, and Galen fell into the category of anything, didn\u2019t he.</p><p>Well, hell. There it was, laid bare, with no sugar-coating. The answer was a resounding yes. She\u2019d spent her life searching for Skye. If necessary, she would spend her death searching, too. At least now the blinders were off, and she knew the monster she was to seduce.</p><p>In bed. With Galen. She tried not to vomit.</p><p>She wished she were stronger, more capable, the outcome assured. She wished the battle for Skye could be waged on her terms, without Cronus there to pull her puppet strings.</p><p>And maybe...maybe she could arrange that. If she escaped this hellhole before the king\u2019s return, she could go to the keeper of Hope, torture him for the information she wanted and then kill him, without screwing him.</p><p>In theory, that was easy. In reality, it was probably impossible. A bitter laugh\u2014the only kind she had stored inside her lately\u2014escaped, mimicking the sudden chill in the air. She shivered. She\u2019d tried to escape this castle time and time again. While she could open doors and windows that led outside, she couldn\u2019t step or crawl beyond them. Her entire body would shake, pain would lance through her, a thousand needles pricking at her, and she would collapse, pass out.</p><p>The pain she didn\u2019t care about. She could endure. But the passing-out thing? There was no way to combat that.</p><p>She was curious to know whether or not someone else could pass through. And the good news was, there were three candidates upstairs who could put that question to the test. All she had to do was free them.</p><p>Time to pay them another visit, she thought with a shiver that had nothing to do with the cold. And what had caused such a huge drop in the temperature?</p><p>Her wings scraped the scarred marble floor as she lumbered down a hall, around a corner and into the wide, spacious ballroom. Her heart sank when the walls fell away and the memories Cronus had plucked from her mind began to play out. At her left, a young Skye began screaming for help. At her right, a horde of Gargl, as she\u2019d heard Cronus call the gargoyles that served as sentries here, dragged a slumped-over but very much awake Paris.</p><p>Sienna stopped, a sudden lump growing in her throat. Paris. Her body went hot and cold at the same time, goose bumps spreading over her skin, embers igniting in her veins. Cronus certainly knew how to torment her, didn\u2019t he? He knew exactly what images would drive her mad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And this one...whoever created him had outdone himself. How hauntingly lovely Paris was. No mortal could ever hope to compare to him. No other immortal or mythical god could ever measure up. He possessed a face designed for the luxuries of the bedroom as well as the savagery of the battlefield. Eyes of vivid blue seductively lined with kohl she\u2019d never before seen him wear, and hair a concerto of colors. Black, brown, even a few strands of flax. A tall body, muscled in the most delicious way.</p><p>He was perfection personified, and he was nothing more than a mirage. Still, she wanted to run to him so badly, to smother him with kisses as she begged for his forgiveness.</p><p>Forgiveness she did not deserve.</p> <p>At least he wasn\u2019t injured in this memory. A small comfort, but she had to take them where she could find them.</p><p>Another vision unfolded behind Paris, a second horde of Gargl carrying a second dark-haired warrior. This man was just as tall as Paris, just as muscled and, miracle of miracles, almost as lovely, but he was definitely injured. Bite marks covered his arms, and horn punctures created a canvas of pain on his chest. Odd. She\u2019d never had a vision of him before. Didn\u2019t even recall meeting him.</p><p>Her gaze returned to Paris. Two of the Gargl were...humping him? Yes. Their tongues were hanging out, their lower bodies gyrating against him. Why would Cronus show her something like that? To make her jealous? Of the Gargl?</p><p>Something was...off about this, she thought.</p><p>Before she could puzzle it out, Wrath slammed against her skull, again and again, distracting her. Her temples throbbed in tune with his motions even as the heat cranked up inside her, defeating the cold, leaving her sweating and flushed. Any time a memory of Paris materialized, both the demon and her body reacted this way.</p> <p>Heaven...hell... Always when they saw flashes of Paris, Wrath uttered those two words. He can help us.</p><p>\u201cI know he can,\u201d she whispered, no longer surprised when she found herself talking to the beast. \u201cAnd he is certainly our heaven, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Her only ray of hope.</p><p>Well, well. Look how far she\u2019d come. From hate to...love? Did she love him? Surely not. She hardly knew him. But if he were more than a cruel, heartless trick meant to bring her to heel, she could have learned about him, she thought wistfully.</p><p>\u201cSienna?\u201d Paris\u2019s voice, deep, harsh, rasping, uniting them once again.</p><p>Another shiver raked her as her gaze locked with his. Her entire body jolted with awareness. Enough, she almost shouted. You\u2019ve tortured me enough. I concede.</p><p>\u201cSienna!\u201d It was a hoarse cry layered with desperation and expectation. \u201cSienna!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnough!\u201d There was no holding the command inside this time. Tears burned her eyes. Her chin trembled, knocking her teeth together. She fisted the edges of her shirt lest she reach out to touch him as the Gargl carried him past her.</p><p>In the beginning, she had believed the illusions to be real. She had thrown herself into them, her failure to connect destroying pieces of her\u2014the only pieces she still liked.</p><p>Heavenhell. Help. Help!</p><p>\u201cSienna!\u201d Paris fought so fervently against his captors, twisting, turning, kicking, hitting, that one of his shoulders popped from its socket. \u201cI\u2019m here for you. I won\u2019t leave without you. Sienna!\u201d</p><p>HEAVENHELL. HELP!</p><p>She felt as if iron balls churned in her stomach, their swift motions tossing bile up her throat. She released her shirt to dig her nails into her thighs, cutting skin, trying to reach bone. Steady. Though she wanted to do something, anything to calm Paris, she knew the more she did, the more he would fight. This isn\u2019t real. He isn\u2019t real.</p><p>\u201cSienna!\u201d</p><p>Finally the group disappeared around the corner, and if they had been real, they would have been headed for the dungeon. Paris continued to rage, and she very nearly chased after him, mirage or not.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she rasped. \u201cSo sorry.\u201d</p><p>Wrath whimpered.</p><p>Though she wanted to collapse, curl into the fetal position and sob, she forced her mind to clear and her feet to move in the opposite direction. Just like that, another memory flickered to life, playing beside her as she walked. Her long-deceased mother sat in the dark, nursing a glass of vodka.</p><p>I wish you had been the one taken! Great, gut-wrenching sobs. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that, honey. I\u2019m so sorry. Slap. I hate you! Get away from me. More sobs. I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have hurt you.</p><p>Other families had suffered similar grief, similar fights, and Sienna tried not to let this recollection affect her. And anyway, it was safer than the vision of Paris. Still, she did her best to tune it out and concentrate on her task. Freeing the demon-possessed immortals upstairs, learning from them.</p><p>Cronus might have commanded the Lords to find and capture the other hosts of Pandora\u2019s evil, but the Titan king had never stopped searching himself. Now, three were chained in the bedrooms above. Obsession, Indifference and Selfishness. And not a one of them knew she was here.</p><p>Because she hadn\u2019t yet learned to fly and wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever develop the strength to do so, Sienna climbed the winding staircase. The tips of her wings caught in the frayed carpet at least a thousand times, razing her already sore muscles. Her thighs burned from the exertion necessary to propel herself upward. Twice she had to pause to hunch over and catch her breath.</p><p>When she reached the landing, she squared her shoulders, lifted her chin. The warriors up here sensed weakness of any kind, even if they couldn\u2019t see its source. And when they sensed weakness, they beat at the clear, invisible doors that contained them, tossed out the vilest of obscenities and vowed all kinds of retribution, as if she were responsible for their confinement.</p><p>Come on, come on, you can do this, you can make it. Look what you\u2019ve survived already. The pep talk worked. There you go. Good girl. The first bedroom she passed was Cameron\u2019s. Hadn\u2019t taken Sienna long to figure out he was host to Obsession. He was a creature of habit and because it was twilight, he was stretched out on his floor, doing push-ups. Up. Down. Up. Down.</p><p>As always, seeing him caused Wrath to erupt in a frenzy of movement. Pain exploded through her head, a precursor to images the demon would next throw into her mind. Violent images from Cameron\u2019s past. Bloody battles, a woman in his arms, limp, dead, then one of himself, cursing at the heavens, screaming...screaming...vowing revenge...</p><p>Sienna hurried past, but not before the very real image of his bronzed, glistening skin, sweat dripping along the sexy ridges of his muscles, was seared into her brain. His hair was a richer, deeper shade of bronze and plastered to his head. His eyes were downcast, but she knew they were a startling lavender rimmed with silver.</p><p>In the room next to his was P\u00fakinn. Indifference. Upon seeing him, Wrath went lethally quiet. A reaction Sienna didn\u2019t understand, and the demon wouldn\u2019t explain.</p><p>P\u00fakinn\u2019s Egyptian heritage shone through the sharpness of his bone structure and the sensuality of his dark eyes. His hair was long, black and straight as a pen. The rest of him, however, was more beast than man. Horns stretched from his scalp. His hands were permanently clawed, his legs muscled and furred.</p><p>Cameron called him Irish, because, despite his looks and ancestry, his voice dripped with the seductive accent of the isles. Sienna thought of him that way, too.</p><p>Finally, she reached Winter\u2019s room. Selfishness. Wrath was ambivalent about her, neither tossing out images nor shooting out lances of menace, something else Sienna didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Winter had her hip cocked against the jamb and her arms crossed over her middle. Her coral-painted nails drummed a steady song of impatience. She looked so much like Cameron they had to be blood-related. Bronzed skin, bronzed hair and lavender eyes rimmed with silver. Mile-long legs, curves that weren\u2019t just dangerous but fatal.</p><p>The lushness of her femininity would have been a perfect contrast to Paris\u2019s exquisite masculinity.</p><p>Sienna tensed, the thought alone causing thrums of jealousy to wrap around her chest and squeeze. He\u2019s mine.</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t, she forced herself to think, and he would never be. She\u2019d tried to reach him, but he\u2019d been unable to see her. And that was probably for the best. After everything she\u2019d done to him, all the ways she\u2019d hurt him, he would never be able to trust her.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is out there?\u201d Cameron growled. He\u2019d become obsessed\u2014naturally\u2014with ferreting her out. And perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have visited so many times, but even before today, she\u2019d planned to free them. Somehow, some way. \u201cI know someone\u2019s out there. Reveal yourself. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with one of Cronus\u2019s spies, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Winter said, her voice as smooth and sultry as a caress. Her gaze almost, but not quite, met Sienna\u2019s. \u201cI heard him talking earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...will...gut...you,\u201d Cameron seethed. He wasn\u2019t talking to Winter, but to Sienna. He might grouse at Winter, snap at her and sometimes even scream at her, but he never threatened her. And if anyone could find a way to slay a ghost...thing\u2014or whatever she was\u2014Sienna was willing to bet it was Cameron. Because, and here was a shocker, he wouldn\u2019t stop until he had what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cDo your tirades never end?\u201d Irish asked, that accent giving her a case of the oh-mys.</p><p>\u201cActually, Irish, you mythological douche,\u201d Winter fired back, \u201cthey don\u2019t, and he\u2019s going to tirade all over your ass if you don\u2019t shut your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone should have spanked you a long time ago, little girl.\u201d Irish.</p><p>\u201cTouch her and you\u2019ll soon be eating your own balls. And they\u2019ll just be the snack pack. Main course will follow.\u201d Cameron.</p><p>Sienna didn\u2019t mind their bantering. This was mild in comparison to what they\u2019d thrown at her. Besides, they only had each other. And while they loved to snipe and snark at each other, they united the moment Cronus appeared, their mutual hatred bonding them.</p><p>She held out her hand, reaching for the clear shield that blocked her from Winter\u2019s room. Contact. She sighed when the barrier refused to yield. Yesterday she had palpated the top half, searching for any vulnerable pockets. She\u2019d found none. Today she would tackle the bottom half. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSienna!\u201d Paris\u2019s voice echoed off the walls. \u201cSienna! Where the hell did you go?\u201d</p><p>Something lurched in her chest, and she was once again fighting tears. Damn you, Cronus. Of all his torments, this was the worst. Her hands continued to move along the shield, quaking now.</p><p>\u201cSienna!\u201d</p> <p>Those scalding tears flooded her eyes and splashed down her cheeks, leaving burning tracks. The memories had never followed her before. When she moved to a new room a new one would appear, one horror exchanged for another. This was the first ever to dog her.</p><p>And...she stilled, frowned. This couldn\u2019t be a memory, she realized, the answer to her earlier concern finally slipping into place. As far as she knew, Paris had never been to this castle, and she\u2019d never seen the Gargl anywhere else. So, the two had never fought in her presence.</p><p>Could he... Was he...</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat.</p><p>\u201cSienna!\u201d</p> <p>Another beat.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d Winter demanded.</p><p>\u201cAnother prisoner?\u201d Cameron.</p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s this Sienna?\u201d Irish.</p><p>They heard Paris\u2019s voice. They had never seen or heard the memories before. This wasn\u2019t... This couldn\u2019t be... Her heart stopped altogether.</p><p>\u201cSienna! Damn it.\u201d Grunt, bang. \u201cGet off me, you perverted bag of stone.\u201d Bang. \u201cSienna!\u201d</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t a memory, wasn\u2019t a vision. This was real and happening right now. Paris was here. He\u2019d come for her. Was searching for her, trying to get to her. A second later, her heart kicked back into gear, slamming into a too-fast rhythm, making her pant. The Gargl might have hurt him, might be hurting him even now.</p><p>\u201cParis!\u201d Panicked, she straightened and raced down the hall, down the steps. Just as before, her wings caught on the carpet. Her momentum propelled her forward, onto her face. She cringed, moaned, but two seconds after she landed, she was back on her feet and sprinting. \u201cParis, I\u2019m here!\u201d</p><p>If he continued to fight the Gargl, they would have his organs as snacks. She\u2019d seen it happen too many times to count. And once they tasted a man\u2019s insides, nothing and no one could stop the ensuing feast.</p><p>She quickened her step and prayed she wasn\u2019t too late.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>CRONUS FLASHED TO HIS private bedchamber in his favorite secret palace, gripping a puny, wretched Hunter by the scruff of his neck. The moment the wall murals appeared at his sides, a large bed crafted from the darkest ebony materializing in front of him, he shoved the Hunter to his knees, maintaining that hard grip. A thick crimson carpet kept the action from fracturing the human\u2019s kneecaps, the only mercy the man would receive this day.</p><p>Atop the bed, chains rattled. The naked female bound to the posts spotted him and struggled to free herself. Of course, she failed. The chains were not just reinforced steel; they were mystically enhanced. And really, she only had herself to blame for her confinement. Cronus never would have captured her if she hadn\u2019t come here with the intention of seducing and chaining him.</p><p>Had he not been in possession of the All-Key, she would have succeeded. Now, nothing could restrain him.</p> <p>Grinning, he studied her. Dark hair tangled around bruised shoulders, evidence she had struggled long before his arrival. Skin usually the color of flawless cream was now amusingly sallow. When eyes a mix of crystal and crimson flashed absolute hatred at him, his grin widened.</p><p>\u201cI will massacre you for this,\u201d she snarled. Before he had time to respond, she calmed, returned his grin with a wicked, wanton one of her own, and purred, \u201cBut only after I play with you a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now, darling.\u201d Cronus tsked under his tongue. If any female were capable of harming him, it was this one, but he would never admit it. \u201cIs that any way to greet your husband of countless centuries?\u201d</p><p>Rhea, queen of the Titans, eyed him as if he were an animal\u2014and she wanted to wear his pelt as a victory coat. \u201cA better way to greet you would be with a sword swinging at your neck.\u201d</p><p>He waved his hand through the air as if he hadn\u2019t a care, the action so patronizing it was sure to reignite the fuse of her temper. \u201cCareful, my dearest. You\u2019re in danger of protesting too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d With her demon, Strife, flashing ruby-colored scales and gnarled bone under the surface of her skin, she intensified her struggles. \u201cYou will pay for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said innumerable times. Alas.\u201d He let out a mocking sigh, barely audible over her raspy panting. \u201cHow you humiliate yourself, my heart of hearts, but do go on. My favorite part comes when you realize nothing you do, nothing you say, will aid you, and you sag in defeat.\u201d</p><p>Despite his taunt, she did indeed continue to fight. And as his own wrists and ankles throbbed in protest, he lost his amusement. He was connected to this horrid creature. Connected in a way he could not escape.</p><p>When someone injured her, he was injured also. No matter where he was or what he was doing. Likewise, when she experienced pleasure, so did he. Yes, he always knew when she bedded another man. But then, she always knew when he bedded another woman.</p><p>Perhaps that was why they despised each other so passionately, and why they had chosen opposite sides of the war that raged between immortals and their human enemy. Cronus had aligned himself with the Lords of the Underworld, and Rhea the Hunters.</p><p>\u201cDeath is too kind for you!\u201d she spat just before sagging against the mattress as he\u2019d predicted, perspiration dotting every inch of her body and making her glow.</p><p>He enjoyed seeing her this way. Helpless, naked and utterly unable to protect or cover herself. She had lush breasts with lovely tawny tips. A soft belly, and even softer thighs. And once upon a time, he truly had loved her. He would have given her anything, would have given everything, to make her happy. Actually, he had given everything.</p><p>Though he\u2019d known better, he had shared his throne with her. Had even shared his godly abilities. He\u2019d hungered for her so absolutely, he hadn\u2019t wished to exist if she could not be by his side, ruling with equal power.</p><p>As the centuries passed, however, she began to change. From sultry to grasping, from kind to cruel, her thirst for power surpassing his own. Ultimately, she betrayed him in an attempt to usurp him. She was the reason he\u2019d been incarcerated inside Tartarus. She was the reason the Titans had fallen to the Greeks. At least the ones she\u2019d aided in rising up against him had betrayed her in kind.</p><p>Now, nothing would save her from his eternal wrath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that time again, my pet,\u201d he said, all hint of his softer emotions gone.</p><p>During one of their many altercations in prison, after he had killed her lover and she had killed his, they had vowed to never again harm those closest to the other, and a vow given was unbreakable. Therefore, Cronus could not touch her precious Galen or any of Galen\u2019s top advisers\u2014though Cronus had finally found the bastard\u2019s lair, as well as his first in command, the new keeper of Distrust, Fox. In turn, Rhea could not touch any of his Lords.</p><p>They could, however, harm the minor foot soldiers. As he would soon prove.</p><p>\u201cYour choice, Rhea. I beat you, or I kill one of your Hunters.\u201d</p><p>The human kneeling at Cronus\u2019s side jerked at the threat, mewling sounds seeping from his bloody lips, but he never spoke a word. Just a guess, but that could be because Cronus had already cut out his tongue.</p><p>Cronus wanted Rhea to choose her punishment, and he didn\u2019t care that he would, essentially, be punishing himself. Causing her to suffer overrode all other concerns. \u201cWhich is it to be?\u201d Every day he offered her the same choice, and every day she gave the same answer.</p><p>\u201cYou think I care about a fragile, useless human?\u201d She lifted her chin, her narrowed gaze remaining on Cronus, completely lacking in fear or mercy. \u201cKill him.\u201d</p><p>A whimper escaped the Hunter.</p><p>No, her answer had not changed. Cronus could have beaten her anyway, and perhaps one day he would. For the time being, he liked giving her what she asked for. Liked thinking she would be haunted by her selfishness for decades to come.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Cronus stretched out his free arm, summoned a sword from nothing but air, and struck. The Hunter\u2019s head fell to the floor with a thump. His body quickly followed.</p><p>The scent of copper coated the air.</p><p>Rhea\u2019s thunderous expression remained the same, untouched by remorse. \u201cDo you feel better now, my stallion? Do you feel like a big, strong male?\u201d</p><p>Bitch. He would not allow her to gain the upper hand. \u201cDo you care nothing for your ever-dwindling army? The very men fighting for your cause.\u201d</p><p>One bare shoulder lifted in a casual shrug. \u201cI feel the same for my army as you feel for yours, I\u2019m sure. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>No, he did not care for his Lords, but he respected their strength and determination. Or rather, he had. Lately the warriors were too busy falling in love, too concerned with their own petty squabbles, and now too busy rescuing Kane, the keeper of Disaster, to heed Cronus\u2019s orders. Still, they were a buffer between Cronus and eternal death, so he needed them.</p><p>He frowned at the thought of all that had transpired to bring him to this moment. Long ago, the first All-Seeing Eye under his command\u2014a being capable of seeing into heaven, hell, past and future\u2014had prophesied that a man filled with hope would fly to him on wings of white and behead him. At the time, Galen had not yet been created. Therefore, Cronus had assumed an angel assassin would come for him, which was why he\u2019d pitted himself against the Deity\u2019s Elite soldiers. War had broken out\u2014among angels and gods, Greeks and Titans\u2014and even those on earth had suffered.</p><p>Weakened from the ceaseless fighting, Cronus found himself defeated by Zeus and thrown into Tartarus. Soon afterward Zeus created the Lords, Galen among them, to serve as his personal army, ready to defend him should the Titans rise up from their moldering prison. But in a fit of foolish pique, those same warriors opened Pandora\u2019s box, unleashing the demons from within and raining down more havoc on a world still reeling from the heavenly war. When Zeus meted out their punishment, decreeing that each would house a demon inside himself, Galen was paired with the demon of Hope, wings of white sprouting from his back. Then, upon Cronus\u2019s escape from the immortal prison, the newest All-Seeing Eye had painted the same future that had earlier been foretold, this time showing Galen\u2019s victory over him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What the first Eye had told him\u2014and the newest did not yet know\u2014was that there was a way for him to save himself. A woman with wings of midnight, who had lived among his enemy but craved a life with his allies, was to be his salvation.</p><p>That woman was Sienna. Everything about her fit the Eye\u2019s description, from her appearance to her circumstances.</p><p>Therefore, she had to do as the Eye had said she must do. Reign by Galen\u2019s side, despite her desire to aid the Lords. Only she could keep Galen\u2019s attention, though she didn\u2019t yet know how or why and Cronus wouldn\u2019t tell her. Only she could hold her own against Rhea, if ever his wife got free. Only she could stop the Lords from attacking Galen, for killing the keeper of Hope would not stop the prophecy from coming to pass. His demon would be given to someone else, and that someone else would then become the white-winged slayer of the Titan king.</p> <p>\u201cI will escape, you know,\u201d Rhea said, and she sounded confident.</p><p>Whether that confidence stemmed from her abilities or his capitulation, he wasn\u2019t sure. Didn\u2019t care. He rubbed a thumb over one brow, another dismissive gesture. \u201cNo, I do not know. I\u2019ve never seen so weak a goddess.\u201d</p><p>Only he could unlock her chains, and he planned never to do so. Among her most recent crimes, she had convinced her sister to become his mistress and spy on him. Another reason for Cronus\u2019s insistence that Sienna do the same to Galen.</p><p>\u201cOne day...\u201d she gritted out.</p><p>He moved to the side of the bed, away from the dead body and closer to his hated wife. \u201cYou will ruin me. You will imprison me. You will... What other threats have you issued, hmm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will peel away your skin, spit on your bones and dance in a pool of your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a truly spectacular evening. Until then, I think I\u2019ll have a bit of fun.\u201d With a single wave of his hand, he summoned one of the countless females currently residing in his harem. A redhead with deeply tanned skin and roses in her cheeks appeared beside him. Unlike some of the others he owned, she truly enjoyed attending to his needs.</p><p>Today she wore a transparent drape of silk and lace, jewels that had once belonged to Rhea and a smile brighter than any sun. Seeing the Titan queen so helpless on the bed, and knowing she herself was a favorite of his, she puffed with pride, flipped her hair over one shoulder, and waved smugly.</p><p>Rhea hissed.</p><p>And that\u2019s why I chose her, he thought with an inward grin.</p><p>Recognizing the diamonds curling around the girl\u2019s neck, Rhea released a spew of curses.</p> <p>\u201cMajesty,\u201d the girl said with a curtsy, talking over the queen to prove how little she mattered. The fragrance of citrus wafted from her. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can show the woman on the bed how much your man pleases you.\u201d He waved her in front of him, where he bent her over, her face right in front of Rhea\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDoes she not please you?\u201d the girl asked.</p><p>The queen gave another hiss and tried to bite her.</p><p>\u201cEnough of that.\u201d His gaze on his wife, he lowered the zipper to his leather pants. He despised wearing such constrictive clothing, but Rhea found this type of garment attractive, and his need for vengeance far surpassed any desire for comfort. \u201cYou know what you must say to stop this from happening,\u201d he told his wife. Rhea must only concede defeat, vowing to forever obey him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll die first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>He took the servant, and the pleasure was intense\u2014and he would never admit it was so satisfying only because he kept his eyes on his wife. She, however, closed her eyes to block his image. No matter. She felt every sensation along with him, and that was enough. For now.</p> <p>When he finished, he righted his clothing with hands trembling from the force of his release\u2014which was humiliating; a king should recover swiftly\u2014and sent the grinning servant away.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Rhea said on a panting breath. \u201cI hate you. With all of my being, I hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I hate you.\u201d</p><p>A smile of genuine amusement suddenly curled the corners of her mouth. \u201cYou know, Cronus, darling. You did not enjoy your whore half as much as I enjoyed mine.\u201d</p><p>The words were carefully calculated, a stinging blow to his masculine pride. But he was careful to keep his own expression equally amused. \u201cYou know, darling,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might have enjoyed your men, but you only ever had them once before I found and killed them. I, on the other hand, am already looking forward to having the redhead again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>FANGS IN HIS ARMS. Claws in his legs. Horns jabbing into his stomach. At least, Paris seriously hoped that it was horns jabbing into his stomach. For a while, some of the gargoyles had ground on him like dogs in heat as their friends attempted to chain him down. Won\u2019t gag. He would have allowed the restraints\u2014if he hadn\u2019t seen Sienna. She was here. Alive. Unfettered.</p><p>She\u2019d looked at him, had met his gaze, and sadness had wafted from her. Sadness and regret, and even horror. The horn-rimmed glasses she\u2019d once worn were gone, her eyesight probably perfect in the afterlife, but her features were the same. Big hazel eyes, plump red lips. A flow of mahogany waves, now to her waist.</p><p>His woman. His mine. One by one his friends had fallen in love, and he\u2019d been so jealous. Now, here was the woman who\u2019d fascinated him as no other. He\u2019d thought, Must reach her...must wipe away the horror...</p><p>Sex had thought, Must have her.</p><p>Now his demon retreated into the back of his mind, the coward, as Paris fought his way free of the gargoyles to run after her. In an instant, his captors swarmed him, their fervor intensified. He tossed one, then another, then another still, slamming the rigid stone bodies into walls. They recovered instantly and returned to him. More clawing, more jabbing.</p><p>They slowed him, but they didn\u2019t stop him. He was weak and growing weaker, because he hadn\u2019t had sex all day. Didn\u2019t think he\u2019d had sex yesterday, either. He\u2019d already forgotten. Whatever. Sienna was here, and with one glance, he\u2019d gotten hard for her.</p><p>He could have her again. No question about that now.</p><p>He just had to reach her.</p><p>As the darkness rose up inside him, clouding his mind with thoughts of destruction and death, he offered no more resistance, allowing it to drive him deeper and deeper into the place where only demolishing the obstacles in his path mattered. These gargoyles wanted to keep him from his woman. They did not deserve to live.</p><p>One step, two, three, the things clawing at his thighs, his calves, hanging on to his ankles, he eked his way into the ballroom. All the while he punched at heads, kicked and stabbed at middles. Stone cracked. Pieces scattered on the floor.</p><p>\u201cSienna! Where\u2014\u201d</p><p>She flew around the far corner, her dark hair tangled behind her, her hazel eyes wild and bright. In a blink, the world slowed down and he noticed details he\u2019d missed before. Her lips were more swollen than usual, with droplets of blood dried at the corners. A bruise colored her cheek, a blue-black testament of the pain she had been forced to endure. One of her obsidian wings was bent at an odd angle, clearly broken.</p><p>She\u2019d been hurt. Someone had hurt her.</p><p>Red mixed with the black, both swimming so thickly in his brain they compromised his line of vision. Shimmers of rage sparked a thousand must-kill-must-protect fires, each one warring with the others. In his veins, his blood was molten, turning jerky movements into fluid, lethal arcs.</p><p>With a roar, he tossed away two other gargoyles. He grabbed another by the neck and punched, punched, punched, creating a hole in the creature\u2019s cheek, the rest of the stone chipping away bit by bit. Still the creature fought Paris\u2019s hold, teeth chomping at his fist.</p><p>\u201cLet them chain you,\u201d Sienna shouted. \u201cPlease, just let them chain you.\u201d</p><p>She wanted him bound? Hated him as much as he\u2019d feared? No matter. Her command and plea were discarded, his determination unwavering. Must kill... Punch, punch. Enemy must die. Punch, punch, punch. Stab. Obstacles must be eliminated. Punch, stab. Debris flew in every direction. The gargoyles forgot about their desire for pleasure, or whatever they\u2019d felt while writhing on him, and went on full attack, no longer going easy on him.</p><p>Sienna reached him, smelling of wildflowers and...ambrosia? He inhaled deeply. Oh, yeah. Ambrosia\u2019s sweet, sweet perfume permeated his skin, overshadowed everything else, including the need to kill, but oh, he now wanted to imbibe. Had to imbibe. His mouth watered, even as he wondered why she would smell of the immortal drug he had forced himself to stop using not too long ago, when he was hurt during a fight he would have won if he\u2019d been clearheaded. His injuries had almost caused him to miss his appointment with a goddess to purchase his crystal blades, and he\u2019d decided then and there to stop using. Thankfully, he had gone through the worst of the withdrawal already; he couldn\u2019t afford to go through it again. He would stop caring about anything but his next fix.</p><p>Want her. As close as she now was, Sex perked up, pouring strength straight into Paris\u2019s system and changing the direction of his own thoughts. Must touch her...must have her...</p><p>For once, they were in agreement.</p><p>\u201cYou have to let them chain you.\u201d When she attempted to jerk two of the gargoyles away from him, they turned on her, some biting, some clawing, some head-butting her. Her knees collapsed under their weight.</p><p>Another roar ripped from his throat. She had tried to save him? The very idea was foreign to him. Ignoring the beasts still attempting to subdue him, he concentrated on the ones climbing on top of her. He grabbed one and threw. Grabbed another, threw.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d he commanded her.</p><p>The beasts returned to him in a snap. He tried to knock them away, clearing a path for her, but she didn\u2019t run. She lay panting, her limbs unmoving, not even trying to shield herself.</p><p>Her watery gaze pleaded with him. \u201cPlease, Paris. Be still. Don\u2019t fight.\u201d</p><p>Heated breath caught in his throat, and though every instinct he possessed screamed to continue fighting, continue hurting anything and everything in his way, he planted his heels on the floor, sheathed his blades and lowered his arms. She had tried to save him; he would trust her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He would surrender.</p><p>For a moment, the beasts took full advantage, converging on him like flies to honey. Steady. Like Sienna, he remained unmoving. Shockingly, the fighting frenzy soon eased. The gargoyles latched on to his arms and once again began dragging him to the prison where they\u2019d already locked William.</p><p>Sienna lumbered to her feet and followed, never allowing eye contact to break. A good thing. If she had, he would have erupted all over again. Can\u2019t lose even that much.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll leave you alone after they chain you.\u201d Her voice trembled, pain in the undercurrents. \u201cThey simply have to complete their task, and then you\u2019ll be free to do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Want her...</p><p>Despite his injuries, he hardened a second time, his demon\u2019s scent wafting from him, a rich chocolate mingled with the most expensive champagne. If he\u2019d needed more proof that he could have this woman again, here it was. He could have her as many times as he wanted her, however many times she would allow him. He was awed. He was vindicated.</p><p>He was undone.</p><p>Finally, he was with the woman he craved above all others.</p> <p>The beasts not holding his limbs leapt back on top of him, grinding, rubbing against him in that disgusting way. Harder this time, and much more determined. Even their need to complete their duty and chain him couldn\u2019t override his demon\u2019s allure, he supposed. He tuned them out, kept his focus on Sienna.</p><p>She was here\u2014he would never tire of the thought\u2014and she was breathtakingly lovely, the essence of all that was feminine. Even dirt-smudged and blood-caked as she was, he\u2019d never seen a more exquisite female. His mind had not built her up during their separation. On the contrary, his mind had not done her justice. Those hazel eyes glittered with swirls of emerald and copper, hints of summer and winter combined, framed by spiky jet lashes. Her lips were bee-stung and utterly wicked. The kind women paid to have and men paid to use.</p><p>Her hair wasn\u2019t too dark or too light, but the perfect shade of russet streaked with shimmers of the purest gold. The locks were longer than before, with waves as mesmerizing as those in an ocean.</p><p>Her freckles had lightened, but they were as decadent as ever, a treasure map for his tongue. The rest of her skin, cream and rose petals, glowed as if she had swallowed the sun. Her body, so slender, so elegant, was as graceful as a ballerina\u2019s. Her breasts were small, but they would fit amazingly well in his big hands as he tongued her nipples. Her legs were long and would wrap around his waist, holding him tight.</p><p>Mine, he thought. Mine.</p><p>Take her. Sex had abandoned the I wants and I needs, and was now all about the commands. As if Paris would argue. One question plagued him, though. Would being with her a second time actually strengthen him?</p> <p>Around the corner, William waited\u2014and he was grinning, his electric-blues calling Paris all kinds of stupid. He had broken free of his chains, as Paris should have done to avoid the beating, and waved as Paris passed him. The beasts paid him no heed, still clinging to Paris and proving Sienna\u2019s claim. He relaxed. So close to holding her, to touching her as he\u2019d dreamed.</p><p>Oh, the things he wanted to do to her...</p><p>She might push him away; she might not. Either way, at long last he would find out.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>PARIS WATCHED AS WILLIAM flowed into motion beside Sienna. Still she didn\u2019t look away from him and he wondered what thoughts she entertained. Was her body reacting to him, as his was reacting to her?</p><p>Blood-spattered walls framed her, and Paris cursed. He would have given anything to see her surrounded by silks and velvets. Would make it so, before he let her go. A vow, even as the thought of letting her go made him want to howl.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again, Sienna,\u201d William said, as pleasantly as he was able. The frost in his eyes belied his endearing facade.</p><p>Paris tensed. If the warrior hurt her...</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve met?\u201d she asked.</p><p>For a moment, William radiated absolute bafflement. Then his expression cleared, and he offered a sugar-sweet smile. \u201cIt distresses me that you don\u2019t remember, but I don\u2019t mind reminding you. Allow me to paint the scene. We were in Texas, and you were crouched on the concrete like a dog, holding on to Paris like a leech.\u201d His cruel, sneering pitch was meant to intimidate her, to put her in her place for everything she\u2019d done to Paris.</p><p>\u201cTone,\u201d Paris snapped. She might have done him wrong, but he would not allow her to be disrespected.</p><p>Sienna shrugged, apparently unconcerned by what the warrior had said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me for not noticing you back then. Next to him, you\u2019re kind of homely.\u201d</p><p>William choked on his own tongue.</p><p>For the first time in forever, Paris grinned with true amusement. The only other time he\u2019d witnessed such spunk from her was when she had drugged him. He hadn\u2019t liked it then, but he liked it now, especially since it was directed at someone else.</p><p>William caught his breath and added, \u201cJust so you know, I\u2019ll kill you if you harm him in any way. And I don\u2019t care how much it will upset him.\u201d So calmly stated, there was no arguing the warrior\u2019s intent. \u201cParis has proven to be stupid where you\u2019re concerned, and that means his friends have to pick up the mental slack.\u201d</p><p>There went his amusement. An animalistic growl left him, his lips peeling back from his teeth. Darkness rising again...rage returning... Paris struggled to free his arms, intending to wrap his fingers around William\u2019s neck and squeeze. No one threatened Sienna. No one. Ever.</p><p>You don\u2019t really want to injure him. Stop. A plea from deep inside himself, where remnants of the old Paris must still reside. William\u2019s loyalty was a nice surprise, and something he appreciated on a visceral level.</p><p>Where Sienna was concerned, however, Paris was not exactly rational, and his struggling intensified. Must defend her...</p><p>The gargoyles stopped dragging him, stopped humping him and returned to fighting him, shoving him to the floor and into a pile of bones. They raked at him with their claws and teeth.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d William splayed his arms, his point proven. \u201cStupid.\u201d</p><p>Biting the inside of his cheek, Paris forced himself to chill a second\u2014third?\u2014time. He huffed and he puffed like the big, bad wolf he was, knowing he would be given a chance to make his point about Sienna later, when he could get to his knives. His friends could do and say anything they wanted to him, but not to her.</p><p>Once again the creatures lost interest in the battle and resumed the trek to the prison.</p><p>Sienna and William continued to follow, and soon Paris\u2019s wrists and ankles were shackled to a crumbling stone wall in a four-by-four chamber devoid of any luxuries. Claws scraped the floor as the creatures filed out, each squawking happily about what they clearly considered a job well done.</p><p>Sienna severed visual contact and collapsed at his side, her trembling fingers working at one of the metal bands. He could have freed himself. Or hell, William could have freed him, but Paris liked having those soft, elegant hands on him. They were his favorite part of her body, every movement an exotic dance.</p><p>On a raspy catch of breath, she said, \u201cThey\u2019re tasked with chaining anyone who survives the walk from drawbridge to castle, and once that\u2019s accomplished, they lose interest. You\u2019ll be free to move about the place as much or as little as you want.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment, letting her voice drift through his mind. Husky, low, a caress he\u2019d missed more than he\u2019d realized. He could listen to her forever.</p><p>Did part of him still hate her? Yeah. Definitely. Hated what she\u2019d done to him, hated what he\u2019d done for her. Hated how strongly she affected him. And beneath all the hate, he resented that she hadn\u2019t seen beyond her own hatred to choose him all those months ago, the way he\u2019d chosen her.</p><p>He would have taken her home. He would have pampered her. At least, that\u2019s what he told himself now. He wouldn\u2019t contemplate what he would have done to her before the pampering commenced. Wouldn\u2019t think about the interrogation he\u2019d planned or the chains he\u2019d imagined buying for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having trouble... I can\u2019t... The fall must have hurt worse than I realized.\u201d Her voice had thinned to a mere wisp of sound, barely audible. \u201cSo...sorry...\u201d Her hands fell away from him, and she slumped forward, her slight weight resting on his chest.</p><p>\u201cSienna?\u201d he demanded, but there was no response. Anyone who could see and touch her could injure her spirit form; he knew that. And the gargoyles had certainly been able to see and touch her. But without a heartbeat or need to breathe, she should rebound quickly. Right? Except, the bloodstains around her mouth...how had she bled? he wondered now.</p><p>\u201cMust have fainted from the sight of my beauty,\u201d William remarked with a sigh. \u201cThere goes the tickle fight I had planned.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, Paris yanked one of his arms, ripping the chain from the wall. He wrapped that arm around Sienna\u2019s waist, holding her against him, keeping her steady.</p><p>She fit him perfectly.</p><p>After he ripped the other arm free, he eased her to her back and peered down at her, his heart causing a riot of sensation in his chest.</p><p>Her head lolled to the side, and she was pale, paler than before. Another rip, followed by another, and his ankles were free. Then he jerked at the cuffs themselves until they fell away. Then he did what he\u2019d wanted to do since the first moment he\u2019d seen her. He touched her, smoothing the hair from her brow. Her skin was as soft as it appeared, and warm, so wonderfully warm. He\u2019d craved a moment like this so desperately, had dreamed of it over and over again, and had nearly killed himself a hundred times over to have it. To his delight, reality was so much better than the dream. More than feeling her heat, he smelled her scent all around him, enveloping him. The wildflowers, the coconut sweetness of ambrosia, both creating a heady musk of arousal.</p><p>Why ambrosia? He couldn\u2019t get past that. Was she a user? If so, he\u2019d bet someone, like, say, Cronus, had forced her to become one. She wasn\u2019t the type to willingly fall into drugs. From what little he knew about her, she liked order and craved control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ll protect her from further abuse, he thought next.

Not while she\u2019s out.</p> <p>A sigh of frustration, maybe even a muttered you\u2019re no fun as Paris looked her over, shielding her from William\u2019s gaze as he moved her clothing out of the way to check for injuries. Every newly revealed inch of skin acted as a lick of flame to Sex, causing the demon to hiss and shake. Or maybe you are fun.</p><p>Though Paris admired the body beneath him just as fervently as his dark companion, he hissed and shook for a different reason. Another rise of darkness, another increase of boiling rage. Beneath fading bruises, his woman was as fang-and-claw-mark-ridden as he was, blood oozing from her in tiny rivers of pain.</p><p>His next mission crystallized. Finding out how to hurt the gargoyles and then making them pay for every mark.</p><p>Really making them pay, he decided when he spied a deep, angry gouge in her side. He sucked in a breath to try and calm himself down, but he inhaled so sharply his lungs felt like mini-vacuums, drawing the air in with commando force. His muscles tensed, his head fogged all over again and his mouth watered. He could actually taste the ambrosia in the air. Frowning, he bent down and sniffed along the line of her neck. The closer he was to her, the stronger the scent became.</p><p>\u201cKinky,\u201d William said.</p> <p>\u201cCan you be serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being serious. I always figured you for the in and out type. Kinda stealthy, leaving the girl wondering whether you\u2019d even been there or not. But I didn\u2019t know you were quite this stealthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to know you\u2019ve considered my sex life,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, hasn\u2019t everyone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is pointless.\u201d Another sniff. The fog thickened, Paris\u2019s brain practically swimming through it. Could the fragrance originate in Sienna\u2019s blood? Yet another sniff, another infusion of that ever-thickening fog. Yeah, it was definitely in her blood\u2014and a lot of it. More than even an addict could handle. Her scent was as strong as if she were actually growing in an ambrosia field.</p><p>Which should be impossible. Right? Ambrosia was harvested in special meadows elsewhere in the heavens, as far from this dark realm as the moon was from the earth. Lavender petals were plucked from the foliage, the clear, intoxicating liquid squeezed out before those petals were dried and turned into powder. No one could handle the liquid, not even immortals, and humans certainly couldn\u2019t handle even the powder.</p><p>But Sienna wasn\u2019t human anymore, was she.</p><p>He was ashamed to admit he was tempted to bite her, to drink her down and savor every drop. He\u2019d walked the path of addiction, sprinted it, really, but he had somehow managed to skirt the edge of need during his journey here, knowing his wits were required to succeed. If only that would lessen the sweet, tantalizing lure of her right now...but no.</p><p>\u201cAs interesting as this is, and honestly, I don\u2019t mean to interrupt your seductive process,\u201d William said, air-quoting the last two words, \u201cbut are you gonna get to the good stuff or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you to shut it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you told me to screw you, and that was five minutes ago. A lot\u2019s changed since then. Like, I\u2019m currently bored.\u201d</p><p>Biting his tongue until he tasted copper, Paris finished his search for injuries. And shit, there was another shot of desire\u2014his own rather than his demon\u2019s. He shouldn\u2019t notice those lovely pink nipples, shouldn\u2019t notice the soft dip of her belly or the trim length of her legs. Shouldn\u2019t be counting her freckles, already planning his tongue\u2019s attack. (He would start with the darker ones on her stomach, and work his way to the lighter ones on her thighs.) He was a bastard. He was sick, disgusting. He should be whipped.</p> <p>When she woke up, she\u2019d take care of that for him, he would bet.</p><p>Hate myself. \u201cShe\u2019s already dead,\u201d he gritted out. He noticed her right wrist no longer bore the tattoo of infinity, a symbol the Hunters used. \u201cWhy is she bleeding? Shouldn\u2019t she heal as quickly as we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now you want to talk to me?\u201d the warrior quipped.</p><p>\u201cJust answer the question before I cut out your tongue and nail it to the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really lost your sense of humor, you know that? But okay. Fine. I\u2019ll play along. She\u2019s dead, yes, but she\u2019s also possessed by a demon that is very much alive. His heart beats for her. His blood fills her veins. I shouldn\u2019t have to explain demon physiology to you. And what the hell is that smell? It\u2019s mouthwatering. A real party for my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop breathing!\u201d Paris didn\u2019t want anyone else breathing her in.</p><p>\u201cO-kay. Possessive much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the subject that won\u2019t get you maimed. She\u2019s possessed by a demon, yes, but she\u2019s also a dead human spirit. So...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re still able to touch her.\u201d</p><p>To borrow the bastard\u2019s phrasing: Obvious much? \u201cWhat I\u2019m asking is, will she heal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, because her demon will heal. And here\u2019s a little tip for the next person held captive by your stunning conversation. You should have started with that and saved us time and trouble.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Okay, then. Good. She would heal. Paris scooped her up in his arms\u2014pissed all over again with the gargoyles. What they\u2019d left on him...was now on his woman.</p><p>Sex adored the contact and purred his approval.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking her upstairs, looking for a bedroom.\u201d Paris would clean and bandage her. If she didn\u2019t wake up and demand he leave her the hell alone first. \u201cYou\u2019re not invited.\u201d</p><p>As much as he wanted her awake, looking at him, talking to him, he hoped she slept through the cleaning. He was desperate to get his hands on her, really on her. Yeah, he was a sick, sick bastard. But that wasn\u2019t the main reason, he told himself. He didn\u2019t want her to feel any pain while he doctored her.</p><p>He studied the chains for a split second, thinking it might be a good idea to tie Sienna to a bed while he had the chance. That way, she couldn\u2019t run until after they\u2019d discussed a few things. But he hadn\u2019t come all this way, done all those things, only to enslave her himself. His goal was, and had always been, her freedom.</p><p>And shit. She might not run from him. Earlier she had ignored him, had watched as he\u2019d passed her, but a few minutes later, she had rushed to his rescue. Whatever the reason for the change, she hadn\u2019t sought to get rid of him.</p><p>He rubbed his cheek against the top of her head, luxuriating in the feel of her silky hair before carrying her out of the cell. The gargoyles hadn\u2019t bothered shutting the iron bars that would have kept him and William inside. At least until they\u2019d picked the lock, that is.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a wuss,\u201d William said, pacing beside him. \u201cI hope you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019m not the one carrying conditioner around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why your hair has so many split ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about your hair one more time. You\u2019ll wake up bald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a ridiculous thing to say. We both know I\u2019d have your guts spilled before you ever got the razor near me.\u201d William raised his chin. \u201cBy the way, only a real man can accept his feminine side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who fed you that line of garbage, but I can promise she\u2019s laughing at you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise! It was your mom\u2014after I boned her.\u201d</p><p>A mom joke. How original.</p><p>The gargoyles were no longer in the ballroom. Paris hadn\u2019t noticed the interior before; he\u2019d been a little too busy getting his ass kicked. Now he had a look around. It was dark, crumbling like the rest of the place, with blood dried on the walls and bones tossed about haphazardly.</p><p>Up the stairs they climbed, the carpet threadbare in multiple places. On the new rise were statues, a lot of damn statues. Male, female, old, young. Only thing they had in common were their expressions of horror.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re gonna be busy for a few hours, since I suspect that\u2019s how long she\u2019ll be out and you can do your thing.\u201d William brushed his fingers over a large pair of alabaster breasts. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m not invited to join you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better shut your mouth while you still have a head.\u201d Even as irritated as he was with William\u2019s suggestion, pulses of desire shot through Paris at the thought of being alone with Sienna and touching her as easily as William had touched the statue\u2014little flames he wasn\u2019t sure whether to douse or welcome.</p><p>\u201cShout if you need me. Like, if she\u2019s too much for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat day will never come.\u201d Paris veered left as the warrior veered right. \u201cBy the way, if you knock on my door, you better be dying. \u2019Cause if you\u2019re not, you soon will be.\u201d He shouldered his way into the first room he came across. His luck was holding, because it was a furnished bedroom. All he had to do was remove the thick layers of dust and the tarp draping everything.</p><p>Or maybe he should leave the tarp. Because when Sienna woke up, this might become a war zone.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>KANE, KEEPER OF THE DEMON of Disaster, could not believe his luck. Usually his life took the express train to hell, whether he\u2019d purchased a ticket or not, with rocks falling on his head, lightbulbs shorting out and holes opening up at his feet. Stuff like that could really mess with a guy\u2019s mind, so over the years he\u2019d developed a philosophy that had saved his life: bad shit happened, but whatever, he would deal and move on.</p><p>Now he was actually in hell, but he wasn\u2019t being tortured. He wasn\u2019t being questioned, and catastrophes weren\u2019t occurring. He was being worshipped. By demon minions, sure, but worship was worship, right? Their scaled, clawed hands caressed him, their horned heads rubbed against him gently, and the rest of their bodies...he wouldn\u2019t think about. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mine, Disaster whispered inside his head, pride bubbling to the surface and washing through Kane\u2019s entire body.</p><p>Yeah, Kane knew these minions belonged solely to Disaster. Long ago, the High Lord had lived in this section of hell, had ruled here, and then had chosen to leave it all behind and escape. And even though thousands of years had passed since that time, the connection hadn\u2019t faded. The minions, or lesser demons, had sensed their leader inside of Kane and rescued him from his attackers.</p><p>Currently Kane was perched on a throne of the freshly...excavated bones. Okay, okay. That was a nice way of saying the bones used to belong to the Hunters who\u2019d thought to hurt Kane, and only a few days ago they\u2019d been plucked out. And, when you considered the fact that Kane\u2019s shirt and pants were made from the tanned and leathered skins\u2014because of the heat, the process had been swift\u2014well, a chair of femurs? No biggie.</p> <p>They were gifts, the minions had said. And like he could really say, \u201cThanks, but I\u2019d rather have a toaster.\u201d In return, all they wanted was his sperm.</p><p>Yeah. That\u2019s right. His baby juice.</p><p>Seemed his demon had once possessed a jealous streak and, true to his name, had caused a disaster that wiped his male minions from existence. Only females remained and they were desperate to procreate with their favorite Evil Overlord.</p><p>Kane hadn\u2019t had sex in centuries; the act was simply too risky for his partners. So yeah, his body was primed and ready. Gnarled the demon hands might be, but they still stroked and gripped just fine. His mind, however, was so not on board.</p><p>\u201cBack up, ladies,\u201d he commanded. He could have been nice about it, sure, but something he\u2019d learned was that demons only responded to strength. Nice wouldn\u2019t get him crap.</p> <p>Still, he expected a fight. Instead, moans of disappointment echoed and contact ceased. They obeyed him, inching backward. But they lingered nearby, prostrate, still reaching for him, clearly hoping he\u2019d change his mind.</p><p>Inside his head, Disaster prowled with purpose, unhappy with the distance. The females belonged to him, they were his right, and he wanted to mate with them. Take, he said.</p><p>No. Kane wasn\u2019t the type of guy who could walk away from his kids, even half-demon ones, and that\u2019s what he\u2019d have to do in this situation.</p><p>Take!</p><p>I said no. He\u2019d rather find a way out of here. But every time he stood, and no matter what he said while he was standing, within seconds the females would swarm him, pushing his pants around his ankles. He wasn\u2019t sure whether Disaster had trained them to react so swiftly, or if Kane was just special.</p><p>Two things he was certain about. His friends were worried about him, and they were searching for him. He didn\u2019t want them coming down here, risking their lives when his was no longer in danger.</p> <p>Take one, then. Just one.</p><p>Ah, so they were supposed to negotiate now, were they? Well, the answer was still a resounding hell no. But...maybe he could pretend, Kane thought. Maybe if he picked one of the females, got her alone, he\u2019d have a better chance of sneaking out of the cavern.</p><p>His gaze skated over the kneeling, writhing bodies. Some had horns protruding from their spines, some had pointed wings. Some had red scales, some had green. Beyond them was the cavern, blood caked on the jagged rocks, fires blazing in every corner, and screams of the damned floating on the hot, sulfur-scented air. When he found a smaller body with no horns or wings, her scales on the lighter side of jade, he pointed.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d If for once in his eternal life, his good luck held, she would be a weak link.</p><p>Gasps of surprise. Hisses of jealousy.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he reiterated.</p><p>His chosen stood. Her legs were twisted, facing the wrong way. Her feet were hoofed, and when she smiled, he saw a mouthful of bloodstained fangs. Disaster slammed against his skull, bang, bang, desperate to leave him, to touch her, to pound inside her.</p><p>Mine. She\u2019s mine!</p> <p>And just how would the bastard react when\u2014hypothetically\u2014Kane nailed her? Murder Kane, the same way he\u2019d once murdered his own people? Probably. Because if he managed to end Kane\u2019s life, he could remain here, a place he\u2019d once fought to escape but now realized he missed. Sure, if that happened, Disaster would be crazed from the loss of his human host, but the demon would be free to screw whoever he desired, all by himself.</p><p>Talk about a messed-up sitch.</p><p>Demon Girl limped to the throne, and the wanton gleam in her eyes suggested she intended to climb Kane like a carnival pony the second she reached him, while everyone watched.</p><p>Bang, bang. Disaster was on board with that.</p><p>Kane shook his head and extended a hand, palm up, to stop her progress. \u201cNope, sorry. Don\u2019t come any closer.\u201d</p><p>A frown pulled at the corners of her mouth as she obeyed.</p><p>\u201cPrivacy,\u201d he said. Bang, bang. Harder, faster. \u201cI want to...take you in a tent.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure what verbiage these demons would understand.</p><p>\u201cMassster?\u201d Her forked tongue swiped over too-thin lips.</p><p>\u201cI will not take you out here.\u201d Or anywhere. Bang, bang. Damn it. His demon needed to settle the hell down. \u201cSo, build me a tent.\u201d Bang. \u201cAll of you.\u201d Bang. And hell, maybe, with his present run of good luck, he wouldn\u2019t have to wait for its completion. Maybe the females would be so distracted during the building of the tent, he could stomp out of the cavern while yelling, whistling, whatever, and they wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cTent?\u201d she asked, still so clearly confused.</p><p>\u201cYes. I want one. Build the tent now, and you can have babies later.\u201d With someone else.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Most of the minions rushed away to gather the necessary supplies, shoving each other out of the way, but a few stragglers remained behind, staring at him. And by a few, he meant a little over one hundred. He sighed. So, there\u2019d be no stomping, yelling or whistling his way out.</p><p>He wished he were more like Paris. Wished he could plow through them\u2014in bed and out\u2014and be stronger for it while remaining emotionally distanced and unconcerned with the consequences.</p><p>Of course, then he\u2019d also be a drug addict obsessed with finding the woman who\u2019d tried to kill him, but at the moment, drugs and obsession seemed like a nice change of pace. And damn. When Kane got home, he was gonna be teased mercilessly about his precious seed, his needy harem girls, and his refusal to fertilize their petunia patches.</p><p>Bring it, boys. At least he\u2019d be home.</p><p>Home... The word echoed through his mind, a wave of foreboding slamming through him.</p><p>Something was about to happen, he realized with a twist of sickness. Something terrible was about to happen. A disaster...a tragedy of the worst sort...inside the fortress in Buda, where all the Lords and their significant others lived. His fortress. His demon knew it, sensed it, and in turn, so did Kane.</p><p>He was on his feet and running for the exit, not slowing even when multiple females latched on to him and held on for the ride.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>VIOLA TRAILED AFTER the gorgeous warrior named Maddox as he carried his very pregnant wife, Ashlyn, up the stairs, past naked portraits of his friends holding rainbow-colored ribbons and stuffed teddy bears. This was the fourth time one of the Budapest residents had foisted her off on someone else, and she couldn\u2019t understand why no one wanted to spend more time with her.</p><p>From Lucien to Anya, whom she\u2019d met in Tartarus centuries ago. They\u2019d been cell-block-B mates. Anya had always been jealous of her, of course. Who hadn\u2019t\u2014and wasn\u2019t? Earlier today the minor goddess had pretended not to recognize her, but Viola had taken the lie for what it was. A plea to hear all about Viola\u2019s magnificent life.</p><p>An hour later, Anya had handed her off to Reyes and his Danika. Viola was still puzzling over Anya\u2019s parting words to the couple. \u201cHere you go. Take her. And you\u2019re welcome. You won\u2019t need to stab yourself to please your demon for at least a year, Reyes.\u201d</p><p>Just how was Viola supposed to have pleased an anguish-happy fiend like Reyes? He was possessed by the demon of Pain, yet she was perfectly...perfect, a joy to look upon and listen to, a veritable fount of shiny, priceless pearls of wisdom, with a keen sense of fashion and a knack for home decorating.</p><p>Speaking of those little life skills, she\u2019d already decided to put them to good use. From now on she would be dressing everyone here, as well as redesigning their mansion\u2019s interior and exterior. And she wasn\u2019t even going to charge them\u2014more than a few hundred thou.</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears as her hand fluttered to her heart. She was such a giver.</p><p>At one time, centuries ago, she\u2019d done something not so giving and sent herself catapulting into a shame spiral, but she couldn\u2019t recall what that something was. She never did. Her demon stored negative memories away, hiding them from her. Anything to continue her love affair with herself. As if she would ever end it.</p><p>Anyway. An hour into their conversation, Reyes had handed her off to Aeron\u2019s angel, Olivia. And fifteen minutes after that, Olivia had sweetly suggested that Viola shouldn\u2019t deny Maddox the pleasure of her company. Five glorious (for him) minutes later, Maddox had stomped away, muttering something about finding his wife and Viola could join him if she insisted. So, here they were, headed to the couple\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I could whip up some kind of mechanical chair that would cart your wife around,\u201d Viola told the warrior. He was shirtless, and the crimson butterfly tattoo stretching across his shoulder blades\u2014the mark of his demon\u2014seemed to be scowling at her. \u201cI\u2019m handy with tools, as you probably guessed, and your back is probably strained from her massive weight.\u201d</p><p>Ashlyn smothered a laugh with one hand, but she failed to smother Maddox\u2019s snarl with the other.</p><p>\u201cShe is light as a feather,\u201d he snarled. \u201cI enjoy carrying her. I also enjoy having her all to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but it\u2019s your back\u2019s funeral. In a few years, you\u2019ll probably need a brace.\u201d Oh, yes. His tattoo was indeed scowling at her. A gnarled, skeletal face had formed between the wings, fangs extending from a tiny mouth. The edges of the wings sharpened into daggerlike points, curling toward her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cool, but in no way comparable to hers. The front of her butterfly stretched along her chest, stomach and legs. The back of her butterfly stretched along her shoulders, thighs and calves. A total body tat that glimmered with the radiance of crushed pink diamonds.</p><p>Ashlyn\u2019s honey-colored eyes found her over Maddox\u2019s muscled shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s not trying to get rid of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d Maddox said.</p> <p>\u201c\u2014he\u2019s just cranky,\u201d the human finished.</p><p>Viola\u2019s brow wrinkled as she attempted to figure out how the poor, addled pregnant woman could have come up with such a preposterous idea. Get rid of her? Please. Men, women and children, mortals and immortals, fought to keep her by their sides. \u201cDon\u2019t worry your pretty little head about me,\u201d she said. Wasn\u2019t that what humans said to one another to prove they weren\u2019t offended by stupid ideas? \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s simply overwhelmed by my magnificence.\u201d</p><p>Maddox was the one to scowl this time, tossing the dark expression at her before stopping in front of a closed door. But then Ashlyn giggled and his gaze shot to her face. His entire body softened, melting like an ice cube in the summer heat.</p><p>A pang throbbed in Viola\u2019s chest. She thought back, but couldn\u2019t remember anyone ever looking at her like that, as if she were the morning sun, the midnight moon, and every star perched in the endless sky. Even though she\u2019d had thousands\u2014no, bazillions!\u2014of admirers.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your dog?\u201d Ashlyn asked.</p> <p>\u201cPrincess Fluffikans is exploring these new surroundings without any hindrance from mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains the screaming downstairs,\u201d Maddox muttered.</p><p>Ashlyn kissed her husband on the lips, then reached out to twist the knob. The door creaked open, and Maddox carried her inside. Fresh, clean air wafted to Viola. Out of habit, she scouted every inch in a single sweep, searching out all the mirrors and reflective surfaces. To the left was a vanity, and she made a mental note to avoid it, even as her demon urged her to close the distance...to take a teeny-tiny peek...just one, just for a second, because she would look so very beautiful....</p><p>She gritted her teeth. Dewy flowers spilled from colorful vases balanced on every piece of furniture in the room except the bed. Flowers had been woven in the wrought-iron bedposts, though, twining and clinging like ivy.</p><p>A portrait hung in the center of the far wall. And sweet heavens. Viola approached the thing slowly. The attention to detail was stunning. She could only take in a little at a time, studying one small section, looking away, then turning back to study another, repeating the process again and again until she\u2019d gone over every inch.</p><p>In it, Ashlyn lounged in a lush, jewel-toned garden, flower petals in her hair, draping her body and dripping all around her. But the petals were not actually petals; they were faces. So many faces. The warriors here, their women, faces Viola didn\u2019t recognize and others she did\u2014including her own. She quickly looked away from her own image, deciding to ponder its presence at a safer time.</p> <p>One of Ashlyn\u2019s arms was bare, her skin tattooed to her elbow. Flames and snowflakes twisted together, and while the flames should have melted the flakes and the flakes should have doused the flames, the two somehow fed off each other, growing in color and intensity the higher up her arm they moved.</p><p>There was a reflective pool in front of her, and Maddox peered at her from its murky depths. Ashlyn reached for him with that tattooed arm, a silver ring winding along her index finger, glowing majestically.</p><p>Viola\u2019s nerve endings tingled. She\u2019d seen paintings like this one before, but couldn\u2019t recall where or when. What she did know: every color, every face, every inch meant something. For real. This was symbolism at its finest. Only she didn\u2019t know how to decipher it.</p><p>\u201cWho painted this?\u201d she asked, her awe unmistakable. She straightened, turned away from the portrait before she lost hours of her life puzzling over the thing. Same as she lost hours every time she caught sight of her own image.</p><p>\u201cDanika, Reyes\u2019s woman,\u201d Maddox muttered.</p><p>Danika. Hmm. Now that the painting was behind her, Viola allowed herself to question her inclusion in it. She\u2019d met Danika for the first time this morning. The female appeared human, but after seeing this, she knew there had to be more to her. \u201cIt\u2019s an exquisite piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer work always is,\u201d Ashlyn said proudly.</p><p>\u201cShe sees into the future?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe will not discuss that,\u201d Maddox said.</p><p>So yes, she did. \u201cShe\u2019ll want to paint one of me all by myself, of course. I\u2019ll have to check my schedule and make sure I have the time to pose for her.\u201d If not, I\u2019ll make time. Must question her. Must learn more about myself.</p><p>Another giggle from Ashlyn. Another scowl from Maddox.</p><p>He\u2019d placed his female on the bed and tucked the covers around her. Now he smoothed the hair from her brow, as gently as if he were caring for a fragile infant. \u201cWhat do you need, sweetheart? Name it, and it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Dainty fingers rubbed at that swollen belly even as a soft smile played at her plump lips. \u201cI would really, really love an orange. Just one this time, though. Last time this particular craving hit, you brought me the entire grove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will bring you the best, most succulent orange you have ever tasted.\u201d He caressed her cheek for a moment, as if he couldn\u2019t bear to look away from her. Then he forced himself to do so and shot Viola a threatening glare.</p><p>\u201cYou will guard her with your life. And if you hurt her, even accidentally...\u201d His hands fisted at his sides.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t think of anything vile enough?\u201d Viola thought for a moment. \u201cMay I suggest disembowelment? You can hang me from the ceiling with my own intestines. That would be really gruesome.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at her.</p><p>\u201cWord of warning, though. Intestines are pink and pink is my best color. Wait. Who am I kidding? All colors are my best color. So, if you go that route, be ready to fall in love with me all over again.\u201d</p><p>His mouth snapped shut, a grimace contorting his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m staying. Viola, you go find the orange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. Unless we go together and you carry me.\u201d All that walking had caused her feet to throb.</p><p>He looked at the door, then Viola, then the door, then Viola again.</p><p>Oh, come on. \u201cYour resident angel already told you that I\u2019m pure of heart, can be trusted, blah, blah, blah.\u201d That had surprised Viola, because she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever been pure of heart. The fact that the warriors believed the dark-haired girl without a moment\u2019s hesitation had really surprised her. Supposedly, they were the most suspicious beings on earth. \u201cOh, and bring me an orange, too, but put it beside a hamburger and fries. I skipped lunch.\u201d</p><p>After issuing a few more threats to her life, he finally stalked from the room.</p><p>\u201cOverprotective momma grisly,\u201d she muttered. \u201cGeez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you never been in love?\u201d Ashlyn asked.</p><p>\u201cHello. I\u2019m not a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, that\u2019s a no.\u201d</p><p>A serene smile met her vehemence. \u201cWhy so much horror at the prospect?\u201d</p><p>The ache in her chest returned. She rubbed and rubbed, nearly peeling off her shirt and the skin underneath, but the damn ache persisted. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Time to change the subject. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about planning a singles\u2019 night here at my new home\u2014fingers crossed it\u2019s forever\u2014and letting the unattached warriors court me.\u201d She strolled to the bed and eased onto the edge. \u201cMaybe a speed-dating-type thing, since I usually can\u2019t stand a man for more than a few minutes at a time. Afterward, I\u2019ll give the ones I like a rose and the others will have to pack their bags and leave the fortress permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Well.\u201d Ashlyn tapped a finger against her chin, the corners of her lips twitching as if she were fighting another laugh. \u201cBelieve it or not, there are only a few singles left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s Torin.\u201d</p><p>His image rose in Viola\u2019s mind. White hair, black brows, brilliant green eyes. Gorgeous face and muscled body. \u201cHe\u2019ll do. You may continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not that he\u2019s not wonderful, but I should warn you there\u2019s a potential drawback to dating him. He\u2019s the keeper of Disease, and he can\u2019t touch another living creature skin-to-skin without causing a plague. You wouldn\u2019t get sick from him because you\u2019re immortal, but in turn you also wouldn\u2019t be able to touch another living creature without passing on the illness. Besides him, that is.\u201d</p><p>Viola rubbed her tongue against the roof of her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I wouldn\u2019t get sick if I touched him. I\u2019m sure you noticed how killer my immune system is. But even still, I\u2019m not sure I want someone so flawed worshipping at my temple. Who else is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Kane, but he\u2019s...\u201d Sadness dulled Ashlyn\u2019s amber eyes. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t date. Says it\u2019s not worth the hardship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d change his mind for me, of course, but that\u2019s not why you\u2019re sad, right? I believe I heard something about him being missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. As soon as he finds out I\u2019m here, he\u2019ll find his way back. Even if he\u2019s dead. I don\u2019t like to brag, but that\u2019s happened a few times before. I\u2019ll just shoot out a quick little Screech, and boom. The race to reach me will begin.\u201d</p><p>Rather than cheer the girl up, her reassurances tossed worry into that storm of sadness. \u201cUh, you\u2019re not supposed to Screech,\u201d Ashlyn said. \u201cRemember?\u201d</p><p>Viola\u2019s shoulders slumped. That\u2019s right. Within five minutes of arriving here, Lucien had dragged her to the luscious Torin\u2019s bedroom and told the guy to check out her blog and website\u2014evidently he was the resident computer guru. Afterward, both men had issued the same warning. Screech or post anything online about her location or her new BFFs and she would never be allowed back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho else?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Ashlyn nibbled on her bottom lip. \u201cThere\u2019s Cameo, but I\u2019m pretty sure she likes men.\u201d</p><p>Viola shook her head. \u201cI could change her mind, no problem, but I\u2019m so over that stage of my life. Who else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s William the Ever Randy. He\u2019s not a demon keeper, but he\u2019s some kind of immortal.\u201d</p><p>William the Naughty Boy Toy. Oh, yes, she knew him. Like Anya, Viola had met him in Tartarus. \u201cHe\u2019s more than immortal, but whatever.\u201d He was also arrogant, conceited and highly annoying. \u201cI\u2019ll put him in the maybe category.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than immortal? What does that mean? He\u2019s claimed to be some kind of god a few times, but I always assumed he was bragging, padding the truth. Which is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough about him. We\u2019re talking about me. Who else can I date?\u201d</p><p>Annnd a return of the nibbling. \u201cThere\u2019s Paris, but he\u2019s kind of obsessed with another woman right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe dead one. Yeah. I know. I could still change his mind, but I don\u2019t think I want to, because...\u201d There was a reason, wasn\u2019t there? As Viola pondered the answer, she clinked her teeth together.</p><p>Paris had asked her how to see the dead, and she had told him. Then he\u2019d asked her something else, but Lucien arrived and ended their conversation. What had he asked? She tuned her mind\u2019s radio in to their past conversation, and her eyes widened as the answer at last slammed into place.</p><p>Consequences. He\u2019d wanted to know if there would be consequences for tattooing himself with Sienna\u2019s ashes. Oops. She\u2019d let him get away without telling him that yes, there would be.</p><p>Oh, well. It wasn\u2019t her problem. It was his.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>DAZED, SIENNA WALKED down a long hallway. Just as her past had played along the walls of the castle, Paris\u2019s past played here, a concerto of colors, faces, voices...limbs. On both sides of her, above and below her, women writhed, so many women. At first, she saw them smiling, heard them laughing, each one eager for what he offered, quickly falling for his charming facade.</p> <p>Why wouldn\u2019t they? Whatever they wanted, he gave them. A touch, a kiss, a lick. A gentle ride. A rough pounding. He made love to all of them, knew exactly where to stroke and taste for maximum pleasure. He knew precisely the right amount of pressure to use as he kneaded their breasts, their thighs. Soft for some, firm for others.</p><p>He knew what position to place them in. On their backs, their hands and knees, right side up, upside down. Knew some wanted slow, and some wanted fast. They loved him for it, their pleasure unparalleled.</p><p>Then he left them and they cried with gut-wrenching sobs, their bodies heaving, their hearts breaking as the grief overcame them. Interspersed throughout the females were males. Paris had been with men, too, and he\u2019d left them in the same condition as the women. They wanted him, and though they were not his preference, he took them so that he might survive. Afterward, they asked him to stay and he bailed.</p><p>One woman, Susan, was a beauty he\u2019d truly cared for. He\u2019d tried to make a relationship with her work, but Paris, being Paris, had hurt her in the worst way, choosing survival, as always, over her heart.</p><p>When Sienna caught an image of herself, she stopped, gasped. There, practically overshadowed by the other images, Paris was strapped to her boss\u2019s table, naked, the lights dim, and she was on top of him. She didn\u2019t need the vision to serve as a reminder. She would never forget.</p><p>She had been unable to see him, needing the darkness to relax, and he had alternated between snapping at her, hating her, hating himself, and aiding her, moving his hips to increase her pleasure. Now, however, she saw into his mind. Part of him had hoped to punish her afterward. Part of him\u2014the deepest, most secret part\u2014had wanted to hold on to her and never let go. To him, she had been a balm unlike any other.</p><p>Nausea rose, threatening to erupt. He had thought such beautiful things about her, and still she had condemned him.</p><p>Wrath slammed into her frontal lobe, urging her forward. To see more, to see all. She stumbled along, her feet as heavy as boulders.</p> <p>Other scenes bled into the image of her and Paris, and someone must have cranked the volume control because suddenly she heard grunts, groans, moans and screams. Screams of pleasure, of pain and even of fury. Accusations were hurled, followed by pleas.</p><p>The pleas were followed by curses.</p><p>Sometimes, when Paris could find no one willing to be with him, his strength would wane, his will to live would wither and his demon would pull free of his reins. A dark, rich scent would seep from Paris\u2019s pores, intoxicating everyone nearby, luring them closer. These people would flock to him, regardless of their previous reservations about him or their disgust for casual sex. They would take him, or allow him to take them.</p><p>When this happened, Paris always battled intense guilt, because he knew the dastardly thing he was doing\u2014but he took whatever was offered anyway.</p><p>These bedmates did not cry when he left. They watched him through narrowed eyes, detesting him, shamed by what they\u2019d done with and to him, horrified by what they would soon lose. A loved one\u2019s respect.</p><p>He had broken up marriages, had committed adultery and performed sexual acts that left him cold and shaken. He then allowed those same sexual acts to be performed on him. A self-imposed punishment of sorts, she thought. All of that she could have guessed. But what astonished her? He detested himself far more powerfully than any of the humans ever had or could.</p><p>Oh, Paris, she thought. He was heaven and hell, just as Wrath had said, wrapped in the same luscious package.</p><p>Sienna wanted to cover her eyes to block the sights. She wanted to scream and scream and scream to block the sounds. Everyone in the crowd was crying now. Even Paris. Their tears poured from the ceiling, raining down, battering at her. But her hands remained at her sides and her mouth remained shut, her feet moving automatically. Her body was no longer connected to her brain.</p><p>Wrath wanted her to know, and so she would know.</p><p>The volume cranked up another notch, a shriek resounding at her left, spine-chilling, nauseating. All of the tears ceased. Another shriek sounded, then battle scene after battle scene came to life. Blood, a canvas of scarlet. Blades glinting with menace. Guns firing one after the other. Bombs exploding. Limbs separating from bodies, guts spilling. Death, so much death. Each delivered by Paris.</p><p>Paris, the FedEx deliveryman of Pleasure and Fatality.</p><p>There was no guilt here, however. No shame. Only cold, hard logic. Kill or be killed. No room for emotions or regrets. No hope for something better. This was it; this was the card he must constantly play. Fight for what he wanted or curl up and die.</p><p>He would not curl up and die.</p><p>Even though Sienna\u2019s own demon seemed to like Paris on some level, Wrath, being Wrath, still hoped to castigate him for all the wrongs he\u2019d committed. The demon urged her to sleep with Paris and leave him. To break his heart. To make him sob and beg for another chance with her. Then, of course, would come the stabbing, hurting him as he had hurt so many others.</p><p>No! No, no, no. She jerked free of whatever leash the demon had used to bind her to his will and flattened her hands against her stomach, as if the puny action could settle the sickness still churning there.</p><p>\u201cI will not punish him,\u201d she shouted, proud of her strength and conviction. Paris had done all those things, yes. And no, there was no excusing him. Though he\u2019d been influenced by the evil creature inside him, he was responsible for his own decisions. He could have found another way.</p><p>But who was she to condemn anyone? Had she yet found another way? No.</p><p>Wrath offered no argument, and she frowned. That was unlike him. Usually he threw fits until she caved. But then, perhaps Aeron, Wrath\u2019s former keeper, had already fought and won this particular crusade. After all, Aeron and Paris had lived together for centuries, plenty of time for the demon to have either gotten a taste of what he desired or to have been berated into submission.</p><p>If ever she met Aeron\u2014and if he could actually see her and didn\u2019t try to kill her\u2014she would ask. She would do anything to return Wrath to him, too, despite the fact that such an action would kill her.</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d Warmth drifted over her cheek, sliding along the line of her jaw.</p><p>Her nerve endings perked up, firing back to life, making her skin tingle.</p><p>\u201cWake up for me. Come on, that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the way.\u201d</p><p>Yes. That voice...sexual and primal, blatant in its masculinity...a summoning finger she must follow. Where the voice originated, pleasure awaited her. So much pleasure.</p><p>She blinked open her eyes. Things were hazy at first, but the more she blinked, the better she could see. She was inside one of the second-floor bedrooms of the castle. The air was musty and yet chocolaty and\u2014Paris loomed above her, peering down at her.</p><p>Breath snagged in her throat. He was just so beautiful, his face flawlessly chiseled. He could seduce anyone, anywhere. His hair was the richest shade of black, the purest shade of brown, with lighter strands woven throughout like ribbons of gold. His eyes were a wanton crystal, his lashes so thick and black they weighed down his lids, keeping them at half-mast, forever come-to-bed tempting. His lips were lush and red, and perhaps the most decadent part of an already decadent man. His skin was like crushed diamonds mixed with honey and cream. Pale, yet kissed with shimmers of the sun.</p><p>He bore a few scratches and had shadows under his eyes, but neither acted as an imperfection. They simply enhanced his appeal, adding depth. Lover, warrior...protector of those of his choosing. And he was here. With her.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked, the words scratchy now, as if there were glass shards stuck in his throat.</p><p>Was that a note of concern she detected? If so, this must be a hallucination. Paris wouldn\u2019t care for her well-being. Not after everything that had happened between them. With a shaky hand, she reached up and pressed her fingertips into the rose tinting his cheeks. Solid, warm. Real.</p><p>She gasped out a startled, \u201cYou really are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I... Yes.\u201d His pupils expanded, concealing all the blue with a spiderweb of black, before snapping back into place. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d There was a slight twinge in her stomach, a definite ache in her wings, but nothing that was unmanageable. A perk of being undead as well as Wrath\u2019s host, she supposed. No matter the severity of her injuries, death had no hold on her and she healed quickly.</p><p>\u201cI cleaned you up, bandaged the worst of your wounds.\u201d Guilt layered his tone, a deeper flush blooming across his cheeks. Those pupils expanded again, staying that way\u2014nope, they snapped back.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen eyes do that. \u201cThank you.\u201d She moved her hand to her hair, grimaced when she encountered tangles. She must look like total crap. \u201cAnd you? How are you?\u201d Her question trembled with the same intensity as her hand.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d he parroted, offering no more than she had.</p><p>He straightened, increasing the distance between them, though his hip remained pressed against hers. One of his arms slid forward and stopped beside her rib cage, taking the brunt of his weight.</p><p>They stayed like that for a long while, silent, looking at each other, then looking away.</p><p>This was...awkward. Really, really awkward. They hadn\u2019t seen each other in so long, and the last time they had, well, things had not ended well. No one but yourself to blame, she thought sadly.</p><p>\u201cA lot has happened since we were last together,\u201d he began, then lapsed into silence as if contemplating all that had occurred.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed, though she had spent too much time contemplating it already.</p><p>\u201cI know you were given a demon. What I don\u2019t know is how you\u2019re handling him,\u201d he said, staring somewhere far, far beyond her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe have our moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shows you the sins of others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd forces you to punish the wrongdoers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAeron, the guy who had Wrath before you, used to hate that. He would resist for as long as he could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then Wrath would overtake him,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the same problem.\u201d Usually she saw the images of a person\u2019s sins while she was awake, and things would progress from there. She would fight the urges and win, or she would fight the urges and fail. She wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the fact that she\u2019d seen Paris\u2019s transgressions while she was asleep.</p><p>Another bout of uncomfortable silence ensued. There was so much to say, but she didn\u2019t know where to begin.</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d she breathed at the same time he sighed and said, \u201cSienna.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other now, searching, unsure. Annnd once again silence reigned, so heavy she could feel the weight of it pressing her deeper into the mattress. Her heart careened against her chest in a useless attempt at escape. If the damn thing had been hooked to a battery, she would have pulled the plug. Anything for relief from this suspended, anxious sensation, fear of sending Paris fleeing preventing her from saying all the things she\u2019d imagined saying to him.</p> <p>\u201cYou go first,\u201d he said, a muscle ticking in his jaw.</p><p>Very well. She could do this. She could. \u201cI just wondered how you got here and why you...why you came for me.\u201d And he had definitely come for her, and her alone. Why else would he have shouted her name like that? Did he hope to punish her for what she\u2019d once done to him?</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI changed my mind. I\u2019ll go first. Tell me why you came to me, that night in Texas when William saw you at my feet. William being my homely friend.\u201d Through those slitted lids, she saw that his irises had frosted over, the darkness still evident. His expression became granite-hard, ruthless determination cloaking him.</p><p>The man who sat before her now was not the one who\u2019d fought the Gargl to reach her; he was not the one who\u2019d taken such care with her wounds. And he had cared for her wounds. She\u2019d been cleaned, bandaged, just as he\u2019d said.</p><p>No, the man who sat before her was the one she\u2019d first met in Rome. The one who had kissed her one minute and woken up strapped to a torture table the next. The one who had cursed her with one breath, and praised her with the following.</p><p>Whoever he was, she wouldn\u2019t lie to him. She would never lie to him again. \u201cI needed help,\u201d she admitted, \u201cand Wrath knew where you were, how to reach you. He had taken over, and I came to there at your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Wrath? Yes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, losing that knife edge of ruthlessness. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t see you that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to apologize for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he said after clearing his throat. \u201cI figured you would have trouble adapting, though you\u2019re doing far better than I did at this stage, so I asked Aeron if he had any tips for you. He said you\u2019ll have an easy time of things if you feed the bastard a little bit every day. Someone lies to you, you lie back. Someone cheats you, you cheat them back. Someone hits you, you hit back.\u201d</p><p>How willingly he offered the information. He didn\u2019t make her beg. Didn\u2019t taunt her because he knew and she didn\u2019t. And Aeron hadn\u2019t withheld the information, when he had to hate her for taking his companion\u2014and they had been companions. Wrath had been an extension of him, still missed him to this day. But as grateful as she was for the advice...what a terrible way to live, she thought. \u201cThank you for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d he said stiffly. Then, \u201cDo you still think I\u2019m evil and in need of snuffing out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re not evil.\u201d That she had ever placed the man in the same category as the demon... She was so very ashamed. How foolish she\u2019d been. How gullible. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I ever thought you were.\u201d</p><p>The visual perusal he next gave her peeled away her clothing, leaving her bare, trembling. \u201cAnd I should believe you?\u201d</p><p>He would never trust her, but then, why should he? \u201cBeing paired with Wrath, well, my eyes were opened. I saw the truth for the first time. The things I did...the things I\u2019m urged to do...you\u2019ve been dealing with that for thousands of years, and still you fight. Doubt me all you want, but I vow to you now.\u201d To stop herself from reaching out to him, she fisted her hands at her sides. \u201cI will never hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>In his hooded eyes she saw flecks of anger, a blaze of arousal. Then, nothing.</p><p>He looked away from her, gaze landing on the room\u2019s only window. There was a crack in the thick, black curtains, a single ray of moonlight slipping inside. Then he offered a shrug of one strong shoulder. \u201cYou asked why I came for you.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment rocked her. A response to her vow would have been nice. But then, she didn\u2019t deserve it. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 Damn it. I couldn\u2019t let you suffer.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t...let her...suffer...oh... Here was a mercy she was no longer capable of offering to others, so she knew how precious it was. Tears sprang to her eyes and tracked down her cheeks, a trickle at first, then a flood. Until her body was heaving with the same force as the women in that dream hallway. Until she couldn\u2019t see the bedroom or Paris.</p><p>What happened to growing a pair of lady balls? Breaking down now, in front of him, was humiliating, but she couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Her shame exploded, little pieces tossed into every corner of her body, saturating her. All her life, she\u2019d only ever been able to rely on herself. Her mom\u2019s alcoholism, which had started right after Skye\u2019s abduction, had eaten away at any love the woman had felt for Sienna. Her dad had eventually taken off and started another family, forgetting the little girl he\u2019d left behind.</p><p>Then in college, she\u2019d begun dating Hugh. He\u2019d listened to her stories about her past, offered sympathy and aid. He\u2019d told her about himself, and his belief in the supernatural. When she expressed doubt, he promised to show her\u2014and he had. She\u2019d been scared yet thrilled at the same time, because then she\u2019d had someone to blame for every single one of her troubles.</p><p>How freeing that had been. How marvelous to realize that her mother wasn\u2019t at fault. Her father wasn\u2019t at fault. She wasn\u2019t at fault. How soothing to think her parents would have loved her still if not for the evil the Lords had brought into the world. So, yeah, she\u2019d jumped headfirst into the good-versus-evil game.</p><p>And yet, the Hunters had gunned her down to get to Paris.</p><p>Paris, who hadn\u2019t wanted her to suffer.</p><p>Her sobs emerged so powerfully, she was soon hiccupping, eyes and nose running freely, and that sent her embarrassment to a new level. Stalwart arms wrapped around her, careful not to brush against her fragile wings, lifting her, drawing her into a hot, muscled chest. His heartbeat hammered as swiftly as hers.</p><p>And wouldn\u2019t you know, that made her cry even harder.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d he commanded, clearly uncomfortable. And wow. You would think a man who\u2019d been with as many women as Paris had would know how to finesse one who was nearing hysteria, but no. He patted her back a little too roughly, then glared down at her when she failed to obey him.</p><p>How could he not want her to suffer? How could she ever have judged him so harshly?</p><p>\u201cSienna. Stop this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t...help...it. Did such...terrible things to...you. And you...you\u2019re here. And you\u2019re being so nice.\u201d</p><p>A pause, as if he couldn\u2019t quite digest her words. Then, very gently, he said, \u201cBut I did terrible things to you, too. Didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>SIENNA TOLD HERSELF TO SHUT UP, to lock down tight, but the words poured out of her of their own accord. \u201cYou were going to have sex with me and walk away. Not the most chivalrous behavior, but that hardly justifies being drugged, tortured and nearly killed. I tricked you, let them hurt you. And then I raped you. I think I raped you.\u201d She choked, but still the words kept coming. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Paris. I\u2019m so sorry. I know that\u2019s not good enough. Nothing I say will ever be good enough, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I am. And afterward, when I was dying, I blamed you, but it wasn\u2019t your fault. I told you I hated you, and I\u2019m so very sorry for that, too. You didn\u2019t deserve any of it.\u201d</p><p>Another pause. His hands began to move down her back, caressing now, before sliding back up again, soothing her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t rape me,\u201d he said, and there was a surprising tinge of amusement in his tone. \u201cI wanted you. I wanted you so damn badly, even though I didn\u2019t want to want you.\u201d Or maybe she\u2019d imagined the amusement. His timbre was now an abrasive rasp.</p><p>\u201cI slept with you because I was told to, because I wanted to destroy you,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI slept with you to strengthen myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I still wanted you,\u201d she added in a soft whisper.</p><p>His fingertips pressed into the muscles just under the rise of her wings, but the pressure eased all too soon. \u201cAnd I still wanted you. That\u2019s one of the reasons I took you with me when I got free, because I wanted to be with you again.\u201d</p><p>Another sob left her. \u201cI thought you used me as a shield, and I...I...\u201d Well, crap. The sobs became so great her voice box finally closed up.</p><p>He pressed a kiss into her temple. \u201cI didn\u2019t use you as a shield. Not intentionally, at least. I\u2019m sorry for how things ended, so very, very sorry. If it helps, I\u2019ve punished myself a thousand times, will probably punish myself a thousand more. Had I known what would happen, I would have left you there...and come back for you later.\u201d</p> <p>The last was offered hesitantly, as if he feared her reaction to such a truth. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>An eternity passed just like that, the two of them clutching at each other, the silence no longer prickly but calming. And, okay. Maybe she was the only one doing the clutching, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind. He continued to caress her.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized how much she\u2019d craved contact with another body until just that moment. That the body belonged to Paris, well, that made it even better. He was so strong, and smelled so sweet, and if she wasn\u2019t careful, she would soon be rubbing her cheek against his chest, burying her nose in the hollow of his neck and twining herself around him like a vine.</p><p>When at last she quieted, exhaustion set in and she just kind of sagged against him, her head resting on his shoulder. Her eyes were swollen, heavy, her nose stuffed up, and her throat raw from her tears.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you. I...I... Paris.\u201d Her lips parted, and she inhaled through her mouth. \u201cDespite everything, you came here to help me. You put yourself in danger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDanger is nothing to me.\u201d His voice had become gruff, as if he disliked the direction the conversation had gone in.</p><p>Danger might be nothing to him, but she\u2019d seen him with his friends. They were everything to him, and still he\u2019d left them to save her. A surreal\u2014and even more shaming\u2014realization.</p><p>What did his unwillingness to let her suffer mean? Did he, dare she hope, have feelings for her? Crave something more with her? Though she wasn\u2019t ready to release him, she did just that, pulling back, taking another deep breath and drawing in the dark-chocolate scent of him. If the movement hadn\u2019t disrupted the angle of her wings, lancing a sharp pain through her, she would have sat there, savoring him, drowning in a sudden burst of arousal, for hours.</p><p>Frowning, Paris maneuvered the gossamer extensions of her wings into a more comfortable position. He was infinitely careful, his every motion checked. When he finished, he eyed her warily. \u201cBetter?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>He had to have feelings for her. Impossible, and yet, possible all the same. \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d She looked down at her hands. They were wringing her shirt, twisting and wrinkling the material, yet she hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d moved them. She should ask him about his feelings. She should\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhy did you walk away from me when you first saw me?\u201d he asked, his tone curious rather than accusatory. \u201cWhen the gargoyles had me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a hallucination. A memory. They\u2019re like film reels, playing around me in a never-ending stream.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened, pulling those lush lips tight over perfect white teeth. \u201cEven now?\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze darted around the room, and she could only gape. She saw crumbling stone, portraits draped by sheets, but no memories. \u201cNo. It\u2019s just you and me.\u201d Probably because they couldn\u2019t steal her attention away from Paris. \u201cParis, I want to tell you things. About the Hunters. Things that could help you and your friends. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, cutting her off.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gave an abrupt shake of his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he reiterated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to tell me anything about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d Even when she had been poised over his helpless body, moving on him, even when he had rightly blamed her for his condition, he had not peered at her with such harsh resolve. Red flickered through his eyes, those shadows once again dancing through his irises.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to consider the problem long before the answer slithered into place, a boa ready to suffocate its prey. He thought she would mislead him, send him straight into a trap, and there would be nothing she could say to convince him otherwise. That hurt, but then she deserved that and more.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, she shied away from the topic. \u201cHow can you see me, hear me? Touch me? You couldn\u2019t before.\u201d</p><p>The red faded, the shadows stilled. His pupils did that expanding, contracting thing, taut rubber bands ready to snap.</p><p>\u201cI learned a few tricks about the dead,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>And he wouldn\u2019t share those tricks or anything else with her; his tone made that clear. An ache ignited in her heart, dropped into her stomach and guillotined every bit of happiness his presence here had wrought.</p><p>\u201cDid you also learn how to break a curse and bust someone out of a castle they can\u2019t leave?\u201d she asked. Good. Back to business. Without another breakdown.</p><p>A terrible stillness came over him. \u201cI knew you were trapped here, but I\u2019m still not sure how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where here is?\u201d She could guess, but the answers that came to her made her sick.</p><p>\u201cA hidden kingdom in the Titans\u2019 section of the heavens.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cHeavens? Really? I would have bet somewhere in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when you try to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some kind of invisible block. I approach a door or a window and I hurt, and if I remain in front of the portal for too long, I pass out. But sometimes...sometimes Wrath takes over and the blocks fall away. I end up outside the castle\u2019s walls, not too far from here, I don\u2019t think. And I do things. Terrible things,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThen I come back here, I can\u2019t stop myself. I step inside and the blocks immediately go back up.\u201d</p><p>He reached out as if he meant to cup her cheek, to offer comfort. Then he growled, low and guttural, and his arm dropped to his side. That made her want to erupt into a fresh round of sobbing, but she didn\u2019t allow herself the luxury. Not even when he jerked to a stand, stalked to the window and tossed the curtains aside, the distance a great chasm between them\u2014symbolic.</p><p>Dust wafted around him. A few tugs, and he had the pane lifted. Hot, pungent air drifted inside, stinging her nostrils. He palmed a blade, extended his arm into the darkness\u2014and met no resistance.</p><p>Others could leave, she realized. Only she was trapped.</p><p>He slid the glass into place and spun to face her. He didn\u2019t return to her side, but leaned back, propping himself against the wall. The bulge of his muscles stretched the black material of his T-shirt. His pants hugged his thighs\u2014and an impressive erection.</p><p>Could he possibly...want her? The way she wanted him?</p><p>Who are you trying to fool? He\u2019s the Lord of Sex. He probably has that reaction with everyone.</p><p>\u201cCan you let Wrath take over your body without taking over your mind?\u201d he asked, a catch in his voice.</p><p>She forced herself to meet his eyes as heat flashed in her cheeks. \u201cI, uh... He takes over both, but I\u2019ve never just let him. I don\u2019t always win, but I always fight him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop fighting him. Let him take over your body, but try to maintain some kind of tether to your mind.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open, snapped closed. Just like that, he wanted her to allow the being that thrived on punishing everyone to consume her, to drive her every action? \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what would happen if I did that.\u201d</p><p>He gave a bitter laugh that did nothing to mar his masculine perfection, and everything to enhance it. Maybe because with the unveiling of his bitterness came a need to kiss him better. \u201cOh, but I do.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she supposed he must. \u201cWrath hurts people. I hurt people. And what if I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Melted steel in his eyes, bubbling from his voice. \u201cI can take care of myself, and I want to get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that, too.\u201d Just not enough to risk hurting him. And really, her demon wasn\u2019t the only\u2014or even the worst\u2014worry. Her eyes widened. How could she have forgotten, even for a moment? \u201cCronus,\u201d she gasped out. \u201cIf you help me, Cronus will come after you. I\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay I hear it, he\u2019s been too busy to concern himself with me.\u201d Paris grinned, slow and wicked. Eager. \u201cBut he and I are due a reckoning, and we\u2019ll soon have it.\u201d</p><p>Her hand fluttered to her throat. \u201cNot on my account. I don\u2019t want you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any family?\u201d he asked, interrupting her. \u201cAnyone I can take you to once I get you out of the heavens?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. He\u2019d saved her, still felt desire for her if his erection was any indication, but he didn\u2019t intend to keep her, or even be with her. He wanted to foist her off as quickly as possible. Of course. Stupid, stupid Sienna for ever hoping otherwise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They couldn\u2019t make anything work between them, anyway. She knew more about his demon now and knew Paris couldn\u2019t sleep with her again, despite...that. Right? He was a one-time only joyride. Right?</p><p>\u201cSienna,\u201d he snapped. \u201cEyes on my face. Please.\u201d</p><p>The heat in her cheeks rose to scalding as she jerked her gaze away from his man business a second time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel like a piece of meat. I was just lost in thought.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout my di\u2014uh, junk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped with the force of his astonishment, and she had to wonder why the god of sex would find such a revelation so unbelievable.</p><p>Anyway. What had he asked her before? Oh, yeah. Her family. \u201cNo. There\u2019s no one who could take me in, no one who could even see me.\u201d As she spoke, she looked the rest of him over. He was still cut from the Gargl, the wounds now scabbed. He had healed, but only slightly. And his skin had lost a bit of its glittery sheen. Was he weakening from lack of sex? That\u2019s what had happened in the Hunters\u2019 prison.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you had a woman?\u201d she asked, trying to act nonchalant about a very sore subject between them.</p> <p>The frost she\u2019d seen earlier fell over his entire body. His eyelids narrowed, the gleam in those ocean-pretty irises flint hard.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>The confession relieved and thrilled her, she was ashamed to admit. He was clearly hurting. \u201cWell, I\u2019m...uh, I\u2019m, you know...available. For you. If you can, I mean. And if you, you know, want me and can use...that on me.\u201d How pathetic she sounded, but she wanted to touch him again, to be with him one last time. Even if she had to reduce the act to a simple clinical procedure. \u201cI owe you.\u201d Or a favor between pseudo-friends.</p><p>The ice thickened, cracked, thickened again, as if a battle raged inside him. The ice won. \u201cReally? You\u2019re available to me? You owe me?\u201d He popped his jaw. \u201cThank you for that generous offer. How could a guy like me ever refuse?\u201d</p><p>A guy like him? \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, I didn\u2019t come all this way to enjoy your availability or to collect on a debt. So, while I can, in fact, screw you again, I hope you\u2019ll understand when I do the unthinkable and pass. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll still help you. Screwing me isn\u2019t a requirement.\u201d</p> <p>She chewed on her bottom lip to stop herself from responding. Deserved, deserved, deserved, she told herself again. And maybe his refusal was a good thing. He still resented her. And as he\u2019d already proven, he didn\u2019t trust her. Being with him, and watching him walk away afterward, would slice her into pieces so jagged she\u2019d never be able to fit herself back together.</p><p>More than that, she had to go after Galen. The thought hit with so much force her entire body shook. She had toyed with the idea, but hadn\u2019t decided officially. Now, she saw the truth. She\u2019d told Paris she had no family, but what if she did? And what if only she could save them? If there were the slightest possibility that Galen was torturing her sister and her child, Sienna had to act, which meant she might have to...do things with him. Necessary things. Things she wouldn\u2019t be able to bring herself to do if she forged any kind of bond with Paris. A white-hot toxin flooded her veins, stinging.</p><p>\u201cYou look disgusted and scared,\u201d Paris said, his voice as sharp as any dagger. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither emotion is for you,\u201d she said quietly. Never for him. Not anymore.</p><p>A hard knock sounded at the door, followed by the homely guy\u2019s rough timbre. \u201cParis. This isn\u2019t exactly life and death, my man, but things are quiet in there so I figure you haven\u2019t quite learned how to undo her bra strap. Give it a rest and come out here. You have to see this.\u201d</p><p>Paris looked like he\u2019d just been granted a reprieve from a firing squad. He straightened. \u201cOn my way,\u201d he called. He stood there for a moment, grinding his molars, thinking about something unpleasant, judging by the expression on his face. Then he stalked to the bed and held out his hand, helping her lumber to her feet.</p><p>His calluses abraded her palm in the most delicious way, and she shivered. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d He didn\u2019t lead her out, but leveled her with a fierce frown. \u201cDon\u2019t try to leave my side. Understand?\u201d</p> <p>Was he afraid she\u2019d run from him? Afraid she\u2019d tell someone where he was so they could kill him?</p><p>Deserved, she reminded herself. What really sucked about the whole situation was that she couldn\u2019t ask for a second chance with him, or even an opportunity to redeem herself. As she\u2019d just realized, they were already doomed, her path already decided.</p><p>Another realization struck. That same path could give him what he wanted more than anything. Victory against the Hunters. Not that he would ever know the part she\u2019d played. If Cronus had his way, Paris would assume she was Galen\u2019s mistress. His sexual toy. And...and she would be, at least until she learned the truth about Skye. Then she would kill him, as she wanted, no matter the consequences to herself.</p><p>\u201cSienna,\u201d Paris snapped, drawing her back to the present.</p><p>She peered up at him. No matter how things shook out, she was going to lose him, and that was a hard fact given that she\u2019d only just found him again. But for today, she was with him. That would have to be enough. \u201cI won\u2019t leave your side.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>GALEN, KEEPER OF HOPE, leader of the Hunters, leisurely explored the rooms inside his enemy\u2019s fortress. He\u2019d only recently healed from battle wounds he\u2019d received courtesy of the Lords of the Underworld. Now it was time for payback.</p><p>The blade he held was new and had never seen a single moment of action. Today, that would change.</p><p>\u201c\u2014shut that damn thing up,\u201d Cameo, keeper of Misery, was saying as she snaked around the corner and stomped past him. Draped as he was by the Cloak of Invisibility, she failed to spot him.</p><p>He studied her as she passed. In all the centuries since their creation, she hadn\u2019t changed. She had long, dark hair made for fisting, and the slim body of a dancer made for screwing. Her eyes were liquid silver\u2014and made for dangling from his necklace. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, I will stab both of you. And let me tell you, one-point-eight people die every second. I never mind adding to the tally.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she had changed. The low, raspy resonance of her voice carried the heavy burden of a world\u2019s worth of sorrows. Enough to spring an ache in his chest, one that promptly seeped outward, invading more and more of him. In the heavens, her voice had brought only pleasure.</p><p>Scowling, Galen tucked the length of his wings into his sides and pressed against the wall. The action caused a white feather to loosen and drift to the floor, no longer hidden by the Cloak. He bent to pick it up, stopped.</p><p>A short, curvy blonde clutching a black dog...thing darted after Cameo. \u201cAll\u2019s I\u2019m saying is that with a little makeup you could look like my country cousin rather than my undernourished uncle. Maybe no one\u2019s told you this, but bags are meant to be carried in your hands, not under your eyes.\u201d</p><p>The\u2014mutant dog\u2019s?\u2014head twisted, twisted, its beady eyes locked on Galen. A lethal growl rent the air, fangs spearing its lower lip. Evidently the Cloak\u2019s magic did not work on all creatures. (What was that thing?) He flipped it off, and it yipped.</p><p>\u201cHush, princess. Mama\u2019s teaching Beauty 101 to the clueless. Besides, we don\u2019t want the silly Lords upset with you again, do we?\u201d</p><p>Galen didn\u2019t recognize the blonde or her ugly \u201cprincess.\u201d What he did know? The Lords welcomed only a select few into their exalted midst. That meant she was either a new addition to the Lords\u2019 army or a warrior\u2019s girlfriend. Pitiful how many of the once-stalwart men had fallen in lurrrve recently.</p><p>Whatever or whoever she was, she would die like the others.</p><p>The duo and their not-quite-canine companion stormed into one of the bedrooms. A door slammed. No alarm was sounded.</p><p>His scowl melted into a grin. They couldn\u2019t see him, but they could have sensed him. That they hadn\u2019t meant this would be easier than he\u2019d thought.</p><p>Strider, the idiot, had given the Cloak of Invisibility to the Unspoken Ones, beings so vicious, so evil, even Hercules would have trembled in fear at the slightest mention of them. Cronus had enslaved them before his own imprisonment, had once thought to control them. In turn, they wanted him dead. Now they were trapped on their private island in Rome and reduced to bargaining.</p><p>A point in Galen\u2019s favor. They knew he was destined to remove the Titan king\u2019s head, and so when he visited their island, they sought his support. Their first gesture, giving him the Cloak. Their second, teaching him exactly how to use it. He\u2019d assumed it was a shield against prying eyes, but he\u2019d assumed wrong. The Cloak was also a weapon. A very effective one at that.</p><p>He needed every advantage he could get, even if that meant aligning himself with the worst creatures ever to roam this earth. His men were disappearing right off the streets, never to be heard from again. His queen had disappeared, as well. He\u2019d had no contact with her for weeks.</p><p>She knew him well enough to know he looked out for Number One. He would betray anyone to get what he wanted, and if she\u2019d decided to walk away, to betray him as he\u2019d betrayed so many others, that was her problem. He would go after her the same way he continued to go after her husband. With everything he had.</p><p>Galen planned to rule the heavens. And I\u2019ll succeed this time. He knew it, but then, he always \u201cknew\u201d his plans would work. His demon could convince anyone to do anything\u2014and Galen was included in that number. Hope built up everyone\u2019s dreams, then laughed when those dreams came crashing down.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Hope driving him this day. It was Jealousy. His other demon.</p><p>Oh, yes. His former friends might not have been bright enough to figure this out yet, but Galen was possessed by two of Pandora\u2019s demons.</p><p>Because he had convinced his fellow warriors to steal her box, because he\u2019d then betrayed them, thinking to become leader of the Elite Guard himself, taking Lucien\u2019s place, he\u2019d committed two crimes. Therefore, he deserved two punishments. Or so Zeus had said when he\u2019d set about pairing each Lord with their demon and restoring order to the heavens. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He despised having two demons. Hope built him up only to tear him down, then Jealousy would rile him back up, whispering things like, That male has a female, yet we are far better. Why don\u2019t we take her from him? Hope would then fill him with an urge to do just that, to take, the need becoming a living thing inside him, every ounce of his being certain he would succeed\u2014but somehow always falling short of victory.</p><p>Well, today he would not fail.</p><p>Today he landed a stunning blow to his enemy.</p> <p>He would steal away Legion, the devil-woman they\u2019d once sent to kill him. The she-cat who had seduced him. The innocent virgin who\u2019d been living inside a porn star\u2019s skin. She\u2019d screwed him within an inch of his immortal life before biting him with her poisoned fangs. While he had writhed in pain, she had left him to die, only to be carted into hell thanks to a deal with her maker gone bad.</p><p>Galen had hunted her, but the Lords had found her first. They\u2019d brought her here, and Galen wanted her back. Wanted to have her again. Wanted to punish her. To kill her and cut the tether she seemed to hold him on.</p><p>He was sick of wondering about her, sick of thinking about her.</p><p>How many warriors had she given herself to since her return?</p><p>Yeah, like that. He was sick of imagining her with a thousand others, sick of the constant rage of jealousy concerning her.</p> <p>He would discover the answer, though, and if any of the Lords had enjoyed her luscious body, they would pay a higher toll than their friends. Oh, each and every one of them would die, but some would scream for months before he took their heads.</p><p>Except...he searched the fortress from top to bottom, looked in every chamber, accounted for every warrior still in residence\u2014and not even Torin, who monitored the place, noticed him\u2014but there was no sign of the girl.</p><p>Very well. He\u2019d go with Plan B. He would take a page from the Unspoken Ones\u2019 book and \u201cbargain\u201d before he struck.</p><p>Despising the delay, he stalked to Maddox and Ashlyn\u2019s bedroom and ghosted through the wood. He wasn\u2019t just invisible, he was insubstantial. Maddox, keeper of Violence, was no longer inside. His very pregnant female reclined on their bed, reading a book to her unborn babe. A babe Maddox would be desperate to save.</p><p>Ashlyn was a pretty thing, with hair, skin and eyes the color of a honeycomb. Truly, she was as golden as the moon on the brightest of nights, and she was delicate and fragile as only a human could be. Her voice was soft, lilting, and filled with love.</p><p>No question, Maddox would move heaven and earth to get her back.</p> <p>Galen padded to the side of the bed and pushed the Cloak from one shoulder. As he materialized, another grin quirked the corners of his mouth. Ashlyn noticed him and quieted, her entire body jolting with fright.</p><p>\u201cGalen,\u201d she gasped out.</p><p>\u201cScream for me, little Ashlyn,\u201d he said, reaching for her. And she did.</p><p>WILLIAM KIND OF EXPECTED to be pulverized the moment Paris emerged from the bedroom. Fists hammering at his face, teeth ripping at his jugular, something menacing like that since he\u2019d dared to interrupt the happy reunion. After all, madness and mayhem were a Paris Lord staple. What William hadn\u2019t expected was a half grateful, half thunderous stare, but that\u2019s exactly what he got.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want to show me?\u201d the Lord of Sex snapped.</p><p>Paris had moved mountains to get here. Had done things that made a reprobate like William look like a choirboy, all to save the girl he currently had tucked into his side. And that he was holding her hand as if she were a life raft and the flood had come, rather than swinging at the man who had just cock-blocked him...well, that was just weird.</p><p>It could mean one of two things. Paris had already had sex with her, so there\u2019d been nothing to block. Yet only an hour had passed since their parting. So that would mean Paris was quick on the climax trigger and, as many ladies as he\u2019d nailed, William would bet the guy could go all night and then some.</p><p>Option two was slightly more likely, but still improbable. Paris hadn\u2019t known what to do with the girl and had wanted to bail.</p> <p>But why would he want to bail? For that matter, why, with every second that passed, did he appear more pissed than ever? Had Sienna turned him down flat?</p><p>Impossible, William thought next. She was clutching Paris\u2019s hand as desperately as he clutched hers.</p><p>William raked his gaze over her. She was pale, her freckles stark in contrast, and she was a bit shaky on her feet. Hmm. Studying her like this, he wondered what Paris saw in her.</p><p>At first glance, and hell, maybe even at second, she appeared plain. He looked deeper, though, and that\u2019s when the delicacy of her bone structure became evident. What\u2019s more, those hazel eyes were large and unbelievably lovely, the perfect blend of emerald and copper. Her hair was a waterfall of mahogany, cascading around her. And her lips...yeah, he would have committed a few crimes himself to have those fit around his shaft.</p><p>She was on the slender side, small-breasted and even underweight, but damn if she didn\u2019t call on every protective instinct a man possessed.</p><p>\u201cAre you just going to stare at her?\u201d Once again Paris snapped the words. This time, menace poured from him, the threat of attack very real.</p><p>Now William doubted his face would be the only thing rearranged. His favorite appendage would be on the receiving end of a nice little slice and dice. Sooo. The biggest he-slut ever created was possessive as hell over a woman who\u2019d once wanted to kill him. Talk about comeuppance. But then, wasn\u2019t that what Wrath specialized in?</p><p>Paris took a step toward him, the menace intensifying. \u201cI asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>William cut off a grin and held his hands up, palms out, questions rolling through his mind. How much did Paris really want the girl? Did he regret coming here? How much influence could she wield over his emotions? Was the plan still to get in, get out and get rid of her? Only one way to find out.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me,\u201d Paris snapped.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d William said. \u201cI don\u2019t just plan to stare.\u201d</p><p>A growl erupted from the warrior. They both knew he\u2019d just implied he meant to do more.</p><p>Good. Maybe William would survive what came next, maybe he wouldn\u2019t. \u201cI like your shirt,\u201d he said, directing the compliment to Sienna. \u201cI really like your pants.\u201d She wore a plain white T-shirt, dirt-smudged and torn, and baggy cargo pants. Her tennis shoes were missing laces.</p><p>\u201cI... Thanks?\u201d Her brows knit with her confusion.</p><p>\u201cMay I make a wardrobe suggestion, though?\u201d</p><p>Another growl sounded from Paris before she could reply, a hand darting out and wrapping around William\u2019s windpipe. Pinpricks of red glowed inside those ocean-blues. No, Paris\u2019s irises were no longer blue. They were black, no difference between pupils and the rest. \u201cAre you now implying her clothes will look better on your bedroom floor?\u201d</p><p>So. Much. Fun. \u201cWho, me?\u201d He couldn\u2019t breathe, so the words squeaked out. No, Paris did not regret coming here.</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d Sienna said, utterly calm. \u201cI know I have no right to ask this, but will you please not kill him? I\u2019m not a fan of the rotting body scent.\u201d</p><p>Tighter...tighter...then the pressure eased, fell away. \u201cShow us what you found.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. She wielded a lot of influence. He wondered if Paris realized how much\u2014and exactly what the warrior thought of the development. But no matter what, William assumed the plan was still of the get-rid variety. No relationship lasted without trust, and these two had not a spark of it between them. Even as Paris eyed William like a slab of beef to carve for dinner, he kept Sienna in his crosshairs, as if afraid she\u2019d bolt, or even do a little carving of her own.</p><p>\u201cCome on, or you\u2019ll be ticked I didn\u2019t show you sooner.\u201d William turned on his heel and marched down the hallway and up another flight of stairs to the third floor. He didn\u2019t have to look back to know the couple followed him. Paris\u2019s booted footfalls reminded him of stampeding buffalo.</p><p>He slowed his pace and Paris came up beside him. At some point, the warrior had picked Sienna up. She was cradled in his arms, her wings tucked around her, her head resting in the hollow of his neck. Even more interesting was the fact that she hadn\u2019t uttered a complaint.</p><p>Her gaze met William\u2019s, steady as a rock. She frowned. \u201cWrath goes silent around you. He doesn\u2019t show me any of your perceived sins. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. He wasn\u2019t veering down that conversation path. Not with a former Hunter and a dead, though brought back to life, newly possessed whatever the hell she was. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his tongue to the roof of his mouth. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he offered no response, so I decided it\u2019s because you have to live with yourself, a punishment worse than anything Wrath could mete out.\u201d</p><p>Miracle of miracles. The demon wasn\u2019t tattling on him. \u201cThe answer will just have to remain a mystery, then. Oh, and a word of warning. Smart mouths really crank my chain. Keep talking dirty to me, baby.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>Paris inserted himself into the conversation with a hesitant, \u201cDid he show you mine?\u201d That he didn\u2019t threaten William proved the depths of his uncertainty about what Wrath might have broadcast.</p><p>William had seen Paris aroused (not on purpose), playful, pissed off, blood-soaked, stubborn, drugged out, relaxed, stressed and everything in between. But he had never seen the warrior frightened. Just then, Paris was frightened, his expression haunted, his muscles knotted over bone.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied so quietly he had to strain to hear.</p><p>A taut beat of silence. \u201cDo you want me to put you down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Color flooded her cheeks when she realized just how loudly she\u2019d shouted the word. \u201cNo. I like where I am.\u201d</p><p>From a mouse to a lioness. Adorable really, and William thought he might make a pass at her when Paris finished with her. Because, even as fierce as Paris was about her, he would let her go. Resolve had bled into the fear. Even though Paris had suspected she would not want to be touched by a man who had done the things he\u2019d done, even though she had proven him wrong and that had to be a relief, he was determined to live without her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just meant that, uh, my back hurts,\u201d she added. \u201cI need your support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a good jockstrap,\u201d William said, patting his boy on the shoulder. \u201cBut then, that\u2019s Paris for you.\u201d</p><p>Even with Sienna in his arms, Paris managed to give him a two-fingered salute. Mentally, of course, but William saw it all the same.</p> <p>\u201cI should have asked him to finish you off, rather than to let you go,\u201d she muttered. Then, \u201cAre we heading to the fifth floor?\u201d</p><p>Ah. So she knew what was up there. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Paris asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d William replied.</p><p>Sienna opted to ruin the surprise. \u201cOther demon-possessed immortals are up there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOther demon...\u201d Paris increased his speed, leaving William eating his dust. \u201cAre they armed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they\u2019re trapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was trying to do,\u201d William muttered as he chased after them. One day it would be nice for someone to place him first. Not a lover, though, and not the girl who haunted his dreams. The girl he would protect with his life now and always. She wasn\u2019t meant for him.</p><p>His one true love would die\u2014or kill him. It had already been foretold, and there was no other option.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p> <p>CAREFUL TO KEEP HIS MIND on the situation at hand, rather than on his aching, needy body, Paris stopped in the center of the fifth-floor hallway. He was shocked by what he found. Only Sienna\u2019s slight weight in his arms, her tropical, feminine scent in his nose, her silky hair brushing against his skin, grounded him.</p><p>Funny, that. The magnification of her drugging scent should have sent him flying straight into a round of withdrawal\u2014or chewing at her neck. Instead, the need to protect her, even from himself, beat everything else.</p><p>There were three immortals up here, a female and two males. They stood at the back of their rooms, staring at him, making no moves toward him. He\u2019d never met them, which meant he hadn\u2019t locked them in Tartarus before his possession. Still, they were glaring at him. Did they know who he was? What he was?</p><p>I want them, Sex said.</p><p>Wow. What a shock.</p><p>A whiny I\u2019m becoming weaker by the minute followed.</p><p>Believe me, I know. How he longed for the days when Sex retreated into the land of silence and led him simply through urges. Now, do me a solid and stuff it.</p><p>That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do!</p> <p>Crude bastard.</p><p>Like Paris was really any better. Over the years Paris had slept with thousands of different people for thousands of different reasons, and not all of them had been about passion. He truly needed to take a woman, like, yesterday, and that\u2019s one of the reasons he was here, to be with Sienna again. But he hadn\u2019t so much as kissed her, even though he was desperate to do so, because he didn\u2019t want to be with her for any reason but passion.</p><p>Mutual desire mattered.</p><p>She desired him, yes. At least, he was pretty sure he\u2019d caught the scent of her arousal while she\u2019d offered to \u201cservice\u201d him, but he\u2019d treated her shabbily. She\u2019d looked at him with those sad, watery eyes, hopeful for forgiveness, and he\u2019d snapped at her.</p><p>Damn it, he didn\u2019t want her apology or her gratitude. Didn\u2019t want her pity, and certainly didn\u2019t want her to want him because of his demon\u2019s pheromones. Had he taken her up on her offer, gratitude and pity would have been in that bed with them, as well as anger, distrust and regret. He hadn\u2019t done the m\u00e9nage thing for a long time.</p><p>Maybe he should have taken what he could get, though. Waiting was kind of stupid. Case in point\u2014his current weakness. More than that, Sienna might not give him a second chance. She might run, as he\u2019d feared. It was just, she wasn\u2019t like any of the other women he\u2019d been with, and he didn\u2019t want to treat her as if she were.</p><p>What makes her different from the others?</p><p>The question sprang from deep within him, throwing him. She was gutsy, but so were others. She was witty, but so were others. She was sometimes sweet and sometimes spicy, but again, so were others.</p><p>Mmm, spicy.</p><p>Stupid Sex. Anyway. Sienna was also guarded, yet vulnerable. Determined, yet kind. She was willing to go to any lengths to see a mission through to the very end. Just like him. She had seen visions of his past, yet had thrown no judgment his way.</p><p>Once, Paris had asked Aeron exactly what the demon revealed in regards to him. The reply had been brutal: all the hearts you\u2019ve broken, all the tears you\u2019ve caused. That\u2019s what Sienna had seen and forgiven. So, yes, she was different, and he liked those differences.</p><p>She stiffened when Paris returned to the first door from the landing. That suggested there\u2019d been conflict between her and the man inside. So, of course, Paris studied the guy intently. He was tall, muscled and glaring more fiercely than the others, as if Paris were already tagged and under a microscope. Handsome, if you were into deeply tanned skin and freaky bicolored eyes. Not that Paris was jealous or anything.</p><p>But just how much time had the guy spent with Sienna?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Cameron. He\u2019s the keeper of Obsession,\u201d she said with a tremble.</p><p>A tremble born of fear...or desire? I won\u2019t ask. I won\u2019t. With the way they\u2019d left things in the room, and hell, with the things Paris had done since their first parting, the answer wasn\u2019t his business.</p><p>\u201cHas he ever touched you?\u201d Damn. He\u2019d asked, and with a whole lot of force.</p><p>She looked surprised. \u201cNo. The same invisible doors that keep me inside the castle keep them imprisoned in their rooms.\u201d</p><p>Her voice. Would he ever get enough of it? His ears hummed with sensation every time she spoke. \u201cDid you want him to touch you?\u201d He had to stop this.</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>A beautiful reprieve. \u201cThen he can live,\u201d Paris muttered. He repositioned her in his arms, reached out and, yep, sure enough, there was an invisible block preventing him from entering the room.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to murder him? That\u2019s quite generous of you,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>Irreverent humor from her, with him, was a shocker every time. In each instance they\u2019d been together\u2014and granted, there weren\u2019t many\u2014things had been serious between them, gravely so. He liked that she now felt comfortable enough to tease him.</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d He stopped at the second doorway.</p><p>\u201cThis is P\u00fakinn, aka Irish. He\u2019s bonded with Indifference,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>Indifference was half man, half animal. Horned, clawed and furred. Something out of a nightmare. For real. The man beast just looked Paris up and down and turned away, as if Paris were of no importance.</p><p>At the third door, Sienna twirled the ends of her hair around her finger. \u201cHere we have Selfishness,\u201d she said with a hint of...anger? Or the same stinging jealousy he (hadn\u2019t) felt?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very pretty, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Sienna asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The female had the same bicolored eyes as the first male, the same deeply tanned skin. She was attractive, there was no denying that, but he hungered only for the woman in his arms.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. How long have you been here?\u201d Paris asked, looking down at Sienna instead of the immortal. Her lids were downcast, her lashes causing shadows to tumble over her cheeks. \u201cHow long have they been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost track.\u201d The pink tip of her tongue slid over her mouth, leaving a glistening sheen of moisture. \u201cThey were here first, though.\u201d</p><p>I want to taste her. I will taste her.</p><p>His blood heated another degree. Get in line.</p><p>With all of Paris\u2019s experience, he was clueless when it came to this woman. What would soften her toward him totally and completely? Not just light a fire under her sympathies, but truly seduce her? She had changed since they\u2019d last met in Rome, but she was still just as much of a mystery to him.</p><p>That she\u2019d cried, that she\u2019d apologized, that she\u2019d sounded sincere, all were far more than he\u2019d ever unexpected from her. Try hell had just frozen over shocking. But she had, on all three counts, and she\u2019d looked at him like she\u2019d never looked at him before. As if he were a man worthy of affection and attention. As if he weren\u2019t some dirty, disgusting thing on the bottom of her shoe. As if she wanted to protect him.</p><p>How the hell was he supposed to deal with that? How was he supposed to react?</p><p>Was he a fool for wanting to believe her? Hell, not wanting to, but actually doing so.</p><p>Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have been so offended by her offer to service him. Maybe he should have just taken her up on it. He\u2019d had her on a bed. He could have stripped her, spread her legs and pounded inside her. Her hands would have been all over him, her passion cries ringing in his ears.</p><p>He cut off a bitter laugh. He was all twisted up, confused, waffling and contradicting himself. He didn\u2019t trust her; he trusted her. He wouldn\u2019t touch her without passion; he\u2019d touch her any way he could get her. And shit. Why hadn\u2019t she run from him, despite her vow? Or was she too busy regretting her offer to service him to launch into motion?</p><p>And really, what did that mean to her? That he could take her here, now, anytime, or that she would go down on him? Don\u2019t think about that. He\u2019d just get hard again.</p><p>The bitter laugh escaped. Make that, just get harder. His erection had yet to dissipate, acting like a heat-seeking missile as the female immortal strolled to her doorway, her hips swaying in a totally feline way. Didn\u2019t matter that Paris wasn\u2019t attracted to her. His demon saw, his demon wanted.</p><p>Part of him had hoped that being in Sienna\u2019s presence would stop this kind of thing from happening. But, no. Even though he could have her again, his demon still sought other women and always would.</p><p>I\u2019m such a prize. No wonder she\u2019d once hoped to slay him.</p><p>As carefully as he was able, he set Sienna on her feet. When she moved to his side, he dragged her back in front of him, pressing his erection between the curves of her ass. He hissed at the beauty of the pleasure. Pure, undiluted.

At least she didn\u2019t jump away, and she didn\u2019t chastise him. Eventually, she even softened against him, as if she was exactly where she wanted to be. Well, hell. She must have feared he\u2019d set her away from him, rebuffing her, and that\u2019s why she\u2019d gone board-rigid\u2014and why she\u2019d relaxed when he hadn\u2019t. Talk about an ego boost. He wanted to beat his chest King Kong\u2013style.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you know about them,\u201d he said, barely stopping his hands from flattening on her stomach, burrowing under the waist of her pants and seeking the warm, wet heart of her.</p><p>\u201cAbout who?\u201d the immortal in front of him asked. \u201cAnd who the hell are you?\u201d</p> <p>One question answered, at least. They didn\u2019t know him, either. \u201cWasn\u2019t talking to you,\u201d he said.</p><p>The female splayed her arms. \u201cThen who? You\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t see me,\u201d Sienna interjected. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to some of their conversations, and that\u2019s how I know who and what they are.\u201d As she spoke, her stomach growled.</p><p>The sound gave him the excuse he needed. He moved his hands to her belly and rubbed. \u201cHungry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Then he would feed her. He would like that, he thought. Would like knowing he was fulfilling at least one of her needs. \u201cWhat do you eat?\u201d What could she eat?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. And it\u2019s only recently, within the last few weeks, that I\u2019ve developed an appetite.\u201d She covered his hands with her own, her skin growing clammy. \u201cCronus brings me a glass of something sweet once a week. He forgot this time.\u201d</p><p>A glass of something sweet. Sweet. Sweet. The word echoed in his mind, an answer to one of his earlier questions sliding into place. His stomach bottomed out as he said, \u201cIs it transparent, with tiny purple beads floating inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her neck craned, allowing her to look up at him, and he watched as her brow wrinkled. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>That bastard! Paris kept the curse inside his head and his expression neutral. \u201cDoes it taste like coconut, this liquid?\u201d he asked, ignoring her question.</p> <p>\u201cYes. But again, how did you know? Do you know what it is? He\u2019s never told me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he knew what it was, and now understood why she smelled as delicious as ambrosia. Cronus had done more than enslave her. He had condemned her. And he would pay. Oh, would he pay.</p><p>For better or for worse, though, vengeance would have to wait. Cronus liked to visit Torin, keeper of Disease, and have the computer genius find things for him. Currently he wanted cell locations for the Hunters, and had given orders for the Lords not to attack. Torin was giving him the info, all right, but only a piece at a time, as per Paris\u2019s request, keeping the king busy traveling back and forth between the heavens and earth as he stalked his prey and did whatever he did to them. That way, he had little time for Sienna. But \u201clittle\u201d had been too much.</p><p>I should have gotten here sooner. There was no way to fix the damage that had been done to Sienna. There was no cure for what ailed her. Paris would have to tell her, have to prepare her for what would happen when she was out of here and on her own. Not now, though. She would be upset, and rightly so. More than that, he wanted to first taste her blood to be sure.</p><p>\u201cYo. Dude. Who the hell are you talking to?\u201d the immortal demanded. \u201cDon\u2019t make me ask again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you\u2019ll what?\u201d he snapped. \u201cFlip me off? Call me names?\u201d</p><p>Winter opened her mouth to respond, and judging by the fire in her eyes, the words would scorch, but then her gaze shifted to Paris\u2019s right and her lips pursed in disapproval.</p><p>Oh, goodie. William had just decided to throw himself into the convo.</p> <p>\u201cYou again,\u201d she said, and she did not sound happy.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d the warrior replied with a heartfelt sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky to see me twice in one day. You\u2019re honored by my presence, yada, yada, heard it all before. Let\u2019s just move on, shall we. I don\u2019t handle fawning very well.\u201d</p><p>She flashed a scowl full of fangs, and Paris did a double take. Fangs? She was a vampire? He knew such creatures existed, knew William liked to bed them, but he\u2019d never met one himself.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going anywhere, and Sienna\u2019s hungry,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s find the kitchen. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the immortal female stumbled backward, landed on her ass. Her skin leached of color, and as she crawled farther and farther from the doorway, her gaze began moving throughout her chamber. She was babbling about shadows and pain. The same babbles erupted from the other doorways.</p><p>Sienna dug her nails into Paris\u2019s arm, a great shuddering wave moving through her. \u201cNo. No, no, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The panic spread into him. He forced her to turn, to face him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d Her eyes filled with horror as she peered up at him.</p><p>\u201cWho is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shadows. The pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I do,\u201d William said, all hint of teasing and self-praise gone. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m right, we\u2019re in trouble, Paris.\u201d Never had he sounded more solemn. \u201cHold on to your girl, because I\u2019m not sure how many of us will be walking away from this.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>\u201cWHERE\u2019S MY WOMAN! My...woman...need...her...\u201d</p><p>Viola watched as the hulking black-haired giant tore down the other half of the entertainment room. The TV, pool table and an odd assortment of other things had been destroyed already. So had everything in the room next door, and the room next to that one. She knew because Maddox had busted down the walls between them, giving her a clear view into the other side of the fortress. Only rubble remained.</p><p>The other warriors jumped on the giant, again, knocking and pinning him down. Still he fought, screaming viler curses than she\u2019d ever heard, even from the prisoners locked in Tartarus. Last time, his friends had lost their hold on him. This time, they managed to keep him there. Still, she was kind of scared, a foreign emotion for her.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she? I have to find her!\u201d</p><p>The last word left him, and he just sort of collapsed into the mess, sobbing so hard his ribs had to be cracking. Tears filled her own eyes, but she blinked them back. He wanted his wife back, the loss of her destroying him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d someone said.</p><p>\u201cShe and the babies will be unharmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe at ease, friend.\u201d</p><p>The warriors spoke calmly, but even she heard the tension and doubt in their voices. Maddox cried harder.</p><p>Viola felt like a voyeur. She felt useless. There was too much emotion here, too much loss, and she\u2019d never handled this kind of thing well.</p><p>\u201cStay calm, we all have to stay calm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have answers soon, and we can head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few minutes more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has her,\u201d Maddox managed to say between shudders. \u201cThat bastard has her. I don\u2019t know where to look. There\u2019s no sign...nothing... Just the feather, just the feather.\u201d</p><p>One by one the warriors released him, and inched backward. Maddox stayed down by choice, his hand moving over his face to shield his eyes from the too-bright light overhead. How deeply he must love his woman and their unborn babies. Viola had suspected when she\u2019d watched them together earlier, but seeing this proved she hadn\u2019t realized the limitless depths.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go hunting,\u201d Cameo said, speaking up for the first time since they\u2019d heard Ashlyn scream and Maddox roar.</p><p>Viola wished the female warrior hadn\u2019t spoken then, either, and had to rub her chest to ward off the ache Cameo\u2019s shattering voice always left behind.</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d the one named Reyes growled. There was a deep gouge in his neck, blood dripping from it. \u201cNo later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe managed to get hold of Amun, and he\u2019s on his way back to Buda.\u201d Strider, the fiercest in the room, was actually trembling. His gaze kept returning to his wife, who stood a few feet away with her sister, as if he needed to reassure himself that she was here and well. \u201cHe\u2019ll learn something. Point us in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if not him, Lucien will handle this,\u201d Anya said, ever the proud girlfriend. Lucien had taken off to track Galen\u2019s spiritual trail.</p><p>\u201cGalen wouldn\u2019t dare hurt Ashlyn or the babies.\u201d Haidee, Amun\u2019s girlfriend, paced back and forth, back and forth, too agitated to remain in one place.</p><p>\u201cGideon and Scarlet are coming home with Amun. Scarlet can tell you if the babies are still...still...\u201d Aeron scrubbed a hand over his closely shaved scalp. He was supposed to be with the others, searching for Kane, but had remained behind for some reason no one would tell her.</p><p>Viola hadn\u2019t been here long, but she\u2019d memorized the warriors\u2019 names, faces, demons and abilities. Scarlet was the keeper of Nightmares and by entering the dream world, she could search for a specific person\u2019s mental doorway. A closed doorway meant they were asleep. An open doorway meant they were dreaming. No doorway at all meant they were dead. But Maddox and Ashlyn were bonded, one destined to die when the other died, so no one had to wonder about her. The babies, however... Don\u2019t go there. Scarlet could also murder people while they dreamed, killing them in real life. Perhaps Galen would take his last breath tonight. Then again, perhaps not. If Scarlet could enter his dreams, she would have done so already, but Viola guessed that something blocked her.</p><p>I could take him.</p><p>Enough of that, she thought with a scowl. Once she hopped on the train to self-love, there was no turning back.</p><p>She concentrated. The warriors. Yes. They didn\u2019t trust her, and she was a little surprised they hadn\u2019t turned on her, blaming her for this catastrophe. She was the stranger, after all, and the kidnapping had happened soon after her arrival. But then Olivia, the angel who\u2019d made them relax about her presence the first time around, had said Viola wasn\u2019t responsible in any way, and they\u2019d all believed her without question. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Besides Olivia, Scarlet, Anya, the still-pacing Haidee and Danika, who had her arm around a girl named Gilly, there were two Harpies, half-sisters Gwen and Kaia. Gwen belonged to Sabin, and Kaia to Strider. The pair had their heads together as they whispered. Galen was Gwen\u2019s father, and, if Viola\u2019s superior hearing was on target\u2014and it always was\u2014Gwen planned to hunt him down herself, crack open his ribs and rip out his black, rotted heart. Just her little way of making up for the lenience she\u2019d once shown him.</p><p>\u201cThat Torin guy didn\u2019t get any recordings of Galen?\u201d Viola asked, recalling his wall of computers and monitors.</p><p>No one looked her way or paid her any attention.</p> <p>Her demon scraped sharp, pointed horns against the inside of her temples, and she bit back a moan. Ignoring her was the fastest way to gain Narci\u2019s attention. And when Narci\u2019s attention was locked...oh, stars above. Trouble followed. Always. Viola didn\u2019t want her other half intruding on this heartbreaking event, determined to make everything about her.</p><p>\u201cNo, there are no recordings,\u201d a soft, gentle voice said from beside her.</p><p>With a gasp, she spun. She hadn\u2019t heard anyone approach, but now a tall, slender female with long, blond hair was at her side. The girl looked fragile...haunted. Pain consumed those dark eyes. More pain than any one person should ever have to bear. She watched Maddox, a tear streaking down her pale cheek.</p><p>Viola thought she\u2019d interacted with everyone in the house, but this girl was new. She had a blanket draped around her, the material clutched tight to her chest, her knuckles without a shred of color. \u201cDid you talk to him? To Torin?\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s chin was trembling too violently for her to speak; she shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cThen how do you know about the recordings? Better question\u2014who are you?\u201d</p><p>More tears tumbled. They had to burn, because whatever path they traveled, they left red welts behind. \u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m Legion.\u201d Such a soft, soft whisper.</p><p>Legion. Ah, yes. Once a demon who had made a deal with the devil. The devil that granted her a human body. A deal she\u2019d lost, forcing her to return to hell, where she was tortured in the vilest of ways, raped, abused, passed around and tortured some more.</p><p>Viola looked at the girl. Really looked at her, the way only she could. Past skin, past bone, and into soul. Legion was dying. Actually, some part of her was already dead. Her will to live had been obliterated. She was a brittle leaf hanging on by the thinnest thread, the next cold wind all that was needed to pull her loose and finally send her tumbling away.</p><p>By nature of her birth, Viola could be that wind. All she need do was reach out, curl her fingers around Legion\u2019s wrist and draw her close. Not usually so simple, and not usually so easy; but then, willingness made all the difference. A deep breath in, and there would be nothing remaining of Legion\u2019s soul. She would cease to exist on every level.</p><p>Perhaps Viola had stared a bit too long or a bit too intently because Legion began to quake, shifting from one foot to the other, and then, when that wasn\u2019t enough, inching away.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d Viola said.</p><p>Legion stopped as if she\u2019d shouted. Poor, broken girl. A china doll already shattered. She drew the blanket closer, trying to fold herself within and hide.</p><p>\u201cLucien.\u201d Anya\u2019s relief was palpable, filling the room after the keeper of Death appeared.</p><p>Viola turned, watching as the minor goddess threw herself in her man\u2019s arms. He hugged her with unyielding strength, their love a tangible thing. Once again Viola\u2019s chest ached. She wanted that. Wanted that so badly she would kill to have it. But, of course, she could never have that. She was destined to love herself, and only herself.</p><p>Everyone else in the room quieted, waiting to hear what the warrior had to say, so tense their bodies were ready to snap. The scarred warrior looked them over, opened his mouth, closed it.</p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d Maddox commanded. He\u2019d worked his way to his feet, was checking the clip on one of his guns. \u201cTell me what you learned.\u201d</p><p>Lips compressed, Lucien gave the room another sweep. This time he stopped on Legion, who had bravely eked her way back to Viola\u2019s side. \u201cLegion, sweetheart,\u201d he said, his tone so gentle he could have been talking to a child locked in a closet, afraid a monster waited under her bed, \u201cgo on up to your room. This isn\u2019t for you. All right? Okay?\u201d</p><p>After everyone turned to face her, and she had wilted under the attention, she spun and ran away. Several agonizing heartbeats passed before Maddox broke.</p> <p>\u201cTell me. Now.\u201d</p><p>Lucien drew Anya deeper into his body. \u201cGalen didn\u2019t try to hide. He knew I would follow his trail, and so he waited for me to catch up. Ashlyn wasn\u2019t with him,\u201d he added as Maddox opened his mouth to say something. \u201cHe said I would no longer be able to follow him, that I\u2019d found him only because he\u2019d let me get that far. And he was right. Afterward, I tried. I failed. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d Maddox had stashed his gun and now clutched two blades. One of them he held by its body rather than by its hilt, and his palm had already sliced open. He didn\u2019t seem to notice as blood dripped, dripped. \u201cFinish it.\u201d</p><p>A stiff nod. Lucien looked as if the words were being jerked out of him, and the jerking hurt. \u201cHe said she\u2019s safe, for now, and that he\u2019ll send you a video of her to prove it. He said...he said...if we want her back alive, we\u2019ll trade Legion for her.\u201d</p><p>Viola wasn\u2019t sure anyone else heard the gasp and frantic footfalls beyond that shattered wall, but she did. And she knew. Legion hadn\u2019t gone up to her room. She\u2019d hung back and listened. Now, though, she was at last running for her chamber, no doubt seeking sanctuary between its walls.</p><p>The warriors argued, words shooting between them with rapid-fire precision.</p><p>\u201cWhere does he want to meet? When?\u201d Maddox.</p><p>\u201cRome. The Temple of the Unspoken Ones. Tomorrow. Midnight.\u201d Lucien.</p><p>\u201cTake me there. Now.\u201d Maddox.</p><p>\u201cBe sensible about this.\u201d Strider. \u201cThose bastards are hard-core, and if they\u2019re on his side\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care! Get that through your heads. I don\u2019t care about anything but my woman and my children. And you will take me there, and I will hunt him down, and when I find him I will kill him. Do you hear me? Take me to that island. You have five seconds to flash me or I\u2019m catching the red-eye, and there\u2019s no one in this world or the other that can help the mortals who get in my way.\u201d</p><p>Deciding not to wait for Lucien\u2019s reply, Viola snuck out of the room. No one noticed, and that once again pricked at Narci.</p><p>Be a good girl, she told her other half, and I\u2019ll show you how pretty you are.</p><p>The demon bounced up and down inside her head. When?</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Now. A whine.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Now. A demand.</p><p>Never.</p><p>Soon? Another whine.</p><p>Soon. You drive a hard bargain. Viola followed Legion\u2019s spiritual trail\u2014Lucien wasn\u2019t the only one with such a talent\u2014flashing herself into the bedroom. The girl was pacing, her hair flying wildly behind her. She hadn\u2019t abandoned the blanket, but clutched the material ever closer.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t leave. I can\u2019t go to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegion,\u201d Viola said gently. Yes, she was uncomfortable with other people\u2019s feelings, but she\u2019d peered at this broken doll\u2019s soul and wanted to help.</p><p>How odd. Once, Viola had fed on souls, on their energy. She had drained them, ended them. One day, though, she\u2019d taken the wrong soul at the wrong time\u2014the only terrible memory she\u2019d managed to retain\u2014and found herself imprisoned in Tartarus. Then, of course, she was paired with Narci and the only soul she\u2019d been able to feed on was her own.</p><p>Like an immortal\u2019s limb, her soul kept growing back and she kept feeding on it, but it never grew back in its entirety because she never actually stopped eating. For lack of a better word. So, basically, she was half of a person, as well as a spiritual cannibal, and she never ever concerned herself with others.</p><p>Why had she come here again? She should leave.</p><p>Those dark eyes found her, tears catching in equally dark lashes, and Viola\u2019s feet rooted in place. \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t do it. He\u2019ll want to touch me. Hurt me. I...can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Legion raced to her bathroom, hunched over the toilet and vomited. Viola\u2019s feet tugged free, but still she didn\u2019t leave. She walked into the bathroom and held back the girl\u2019s hair, only to realize she hadn\u2019t actually vomited. She had dry heaved. Poor thing. She probably hadn\u2019t eaten a decent meal in weeks.</p><p>Hours seemed to tick by in endless misery. Between each of her heaves, the girl sobbed. And when she wasn\u2019t sobbing, she was shaking so violently her teeth chattered. No one ever came to the door, and Viola decided the Lords had opted not to trade the girl for Ashlyn\u2019s safe return.</p><p>Finally, blessedly, Legion\u2019s outburst drained her. She slumped over the toilet, her tear ducts tapped out.</p><p>Viola stepped away, and those red, swollen eyes followed her.</p><p>I really must leave now, she thought. She\u2019d stayed far too long, the sense of unease returning. \u201cI\u2019ll tell the warriors you\u2019re a no-go, okay?\u201d Maddox might try and slay her for her efforts, but Narci would dig the attention, so whatever.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go, I can\u2019t go,\u201d Legion whispered. \u201cHe was here, I smelled him, knew he was here, but I couldn\u2019t make my voice work, haven\u2019t spoken since I got here, couldn\u2019t even scream, even though I wanted to scream and scream and scream. I hid under the bed. I should have screamed, I should have screamed.\u201d</p><p>Her words were heavy on the guilt, an emotion Viola refused to tangle with. \u201cYeah, so, uh, good luck with that. It was nice meeting you and everything.\u201d One step, two, she backed her way out. She didn\u2019t do the friendship thing. Ever. With anyone. Especially not broken china dolls that would require way too much time and effort. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Legion\u2019s tear ducts clearly hadn\u2019t dried, because a new waterfall began. \u201cI can\u2019t leave Ashlyn with him, either.\u201d She sniffled, gulped. \u201cAshlyn is so nice, and the babies, she let me feel them kick once. She\u2019s due any day. She needs to be home. Maddox needs her to be home. What should I do?\u201d</p><p>So badly Viola wanted to reach for her phone, Screech the question and follow the ensuing flood of advice, but much as she yearned to leave this room, she wanted to stay in the fortress.</p><p>For all their faults, the Lords hadn\u2019t tried to take advantage of her. Hadn\u2019t tricked her into looking into a mirror, and they utterly adored her. And okay, maybe that last one wasn\u2019t the truth and merely came courtesy of her demon, but nothing was a lie if you believed it. Therefore, the Lords did, in fact, adore her.</p> <p>\u201cI think you should, uh, follow your heart?\u201d Oh, ick. That sucked. Like, majorly. The girl didn\u2019t know what her heart wanted, which was why she was asking for guidance.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do?\u201d Legion asked.</p><p>She could weave a pretty speech about always being willing to help others, Viola supposed. The guys downstairs would probably prefer that. Only problem was, lying to anyone but herself created messes. Viola hated messes.</p><p>\u201cI would save myself, no matter the cost to those around me. But then, I\u2019ve only ever cared about myself, so...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you. Who do you love more? Yourself, or the ones who took you in?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p> <p>STRIPPED AND PINNED to a boulder, Kane gritted his teeth at the humiliation. Hadn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt taken the minions long to catch him after he\u2019d bolted. His innocent little chosen had been the worst of the lot, ripping out his Achilles tendons, hobbling him.</p><p>Now everyone in the crowd took turns attempting to steal what he\u2019d refused to give.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t give them what they wanted. He wouldn\u2019t. But how much longer could he survive the torment? The pressure was building, so intense it was painful.</p><p>You\u2019ve survived this kind of thing before. He could survive this. Breathe, just breathe. His lids were squeezed together, his blood molten in his veins. All the while, his demon laughed inside his head. Laughed. Enjoying the disaster as it happened.</p><p>Maybe surviving wasn\u2019t the right path, he thought, the humiliation morphing into rage. Kane had never liked his demon, but now, now he hated the creature with every fiber of his being. He wanted to be free of it, and that meant dying. He wanted to punish Disaster for taking pleasure in his misery, regardless of the fate that would befall him.</p><p>And he would. Yeah. He would do some punishing. No matter what he had to do achieve the desired end, he would do.</p> <p>PARIS CROWDED SIENNA into the wall, leaned down and got in her face. Her breath emerged choppily, her eyes were wild and her pupils dilated with panic. Sex enjoyed the contact, was already begging for more. Paris tuned him out and kept things as nonsexual as possible. Sienna was too upset for more.</p><p>\u201cYou have to hide,\u201d she said, the words emerging brokenly. \u201cI\u2019ll try to draw them to me, away from everyone else. Okay? Yes? But you really, really have to hide.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her jaw, forcing her to peer up at him rather than scanning her surroundings for a hiding place. As if he would ever hide from an enemy and leave a female to fight for him. \u201cWhat\u2019s coming? Talk to me, baby.\u201d He knew she wasn\u2019t too keen on endearments from him\u2014at least, she hadn\u2019t been before\u2014but then, he\u2019d never called another woman his baby. Only sweetheart and honey, meaningless words like that, and never with such a note of affection.</p><p>Those lush lips parted on a gasp, and she blinked in bafflement. \u201cBaby,\u201d she whispered, and he decided she liked it. There\u2019d been a note of reverence in her tone. Calm suddenly smoothed out the panic. \u201cThe shadows. They dart through the walls, and they feed on us. All of us. Even the gargoyles hide. There are so many of them. They\u2019ll cover you, they\u2019ll be all you see, all you know, and they\u2019ll eat at you.\u201d</p><p>Corporal shadows with a hunger for flesh. He thought he\u2019d traveled every corner of the heavens, but he\u2019d never heard of such a creature.</p><p>William had, though, because he muttered, \u201cOh, shit on a brick. This is bad. Exactly what I feared.\u201d</p><p>Paris met his troubled gaze. \u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stay where you are.\u201d The grim-faced warrior reached up and unsheathed a knife from behind his shoulder blades, then sliced his arm open from elbow to palm. Instantly crimson flowed. He closed the distance, bent down to the floor, and smeared a bloody circle around Paris and Sienna. \u201cDon\u2019t step out of this, do you hear me? Both of you, stay there. Disobey me, and you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t wait for a reply, but sprinted to the entrance of the female immortal\u2019s room and dashed his wound across the clear shield separating them. The female was too busy clawing at her walls to notice. Before William reached the second room, his wound closed and he had to make another incision. He painted a line of blood over that shield, as well.</p><p>He didn\u2019t make it to the third room.</p><p>Just as Sienna had predicted, shadows burst through the walls. In a snap, it was lights-out, the black so thick oil could have been saturating the air.</p><p>The entire castle rattled and shook. Screams echoed, fervent songs of pain and anguish. The darkness inside Paris responded, practically purring with approval the way Sex always purred for physical contact, enjoying every terrible note. Wanting out, wanting loose. Wanting to cause everyone around him to hurt, too.</p><p>Paris was on the path to giving in, to stepping out of the circle William had drawn and fighting with the shadows, hell, fighting with William, when Sienna trembled against him. He pressed against her more firmly. Must protect, he thought. That\u2019s why he was here. For her. To be with her. To ensure her safety.</p><p>She trembled again, this one worrisome in its intensity. He wasn\u2019t sure what was happening behind him or around him or even how long this would last, but she knew, and it terrified her. And yet still she had thought to protect him, he realized. Still she had wanted to hide him. Him, not herself. His warrior core had been offended by that, true, but just then he could only thrill over her concern. She cared about his well-being.</p><p>I want her, Sex said. Of course, the purring started up again.</p><p>So do I. And he would have a taste of her. Finally, here and now, the circumstances be damned. She was too worried for sexual contact? Hardly. She needed a distraction, and there was nothing better than desire.</p><p>Paris felt his way to her jaw, cupping her to hold her steady while luxuriating in the silky warmth of her skin, the delicacy of her bones. \u201cConcentrate on my voice, baby. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>A jerky nod.</p><p>He wished he could see her and discover whether or not color was returning to those delicate cheeks. At her ear, he whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re so soft. I\u2019ve never felt anything softer. And your scent intoxicates me. I can\u2019t help but think you\u2019ll be even sweeter between your legs.\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched, her hands finding his chest and flattening over his pectorals.</p><p>\u201cWhen I drive my fingers deep inside you, you\u2019ll be so wet for me, won\u2019t you, baby? I\u2019ll eat you up, drink down every drop of your honey, and you\u2019ll scream for more.\u201d</p><p>Yesss, Sex said on a moan. Pleassse.</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d Sienna breathed.</p><p>A needy plea for more? That\u2019s what his demon heard in her tremulous tone. Paris found himself leaning down, the rest of the world forgotten, his nose in her hair as he sniffed the heavy waves. He scented the wildflowers and the coconut, now mixed with something rare, a bloom found only at night.</p><p>Oh, hell, yes. That was her arousal.</p><p>Sex liked it, too, tossing out his own special fragrance. The two combined, the most wondrous bouquet enveloping Paris. Wondrous\u2014and torturous. Instantly he was revved up, more than primed, more than ready, desperate to sink inside this woman and thrust his way to orgasm. All he had to do was rip open both their pants and kick her legs apart. He\u2019d drill her deep and sure. She would be hot, dripping and so tight around him.</p><p>Sharp little nails burrowed past his shirt and into his skin, as if to hold him in place. He could feel the heat of her, pulsing, seeping into him, blending with his own and lancing straight to his cock. He ached unbearably. Before he even registered that he\u2019d moved, he\u2019d edged her legs apart with his foot and arched into her, fitting his erection against her feminine core.</p><p>Hello, sweet damnation. Either he\u2019d just made the biggest mistake of his life, or the best. They fit together like matching puzzle pieces. He rubbed against her, slowly at first, just enough to tease and tantalize them both. The pleasure built, right alongside the pressure. Yeah, he definitely should have taken her earlier. His demon was ready to burst free of his skin.</p><p>Paris couldn\u2019t gauge Sienna\u2019s reaction through sound because of the surrounding screams, so he moved one of his hands to her throat, keeping his touch gentle. Nothing could stop him from feeling her moans, and the vibrations were so damn gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cParis.\u201d Her lips pressed against his ear. Definitely not a plea this time, but not a warning, either. \u201cYou can\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>He circled his hips, pressing, retreating, pressing. \u201cWhat is this, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA treat for the only available woman in the room.\u201d</p><p>The words were like a slap across the face, and his volatile inner darkness responded poorly, rampaging through him and demanding he hurt the one who\u2019d harmed him. He bit back the urge and snapped, \u201cSo a guy like me can only want what\u2019s available?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want me before, in the room. So maybe this is punishment.\u201d Anger threaded her tone.</p><p>Punishment? His hands clenched in reflex, his own anger becoming an echo of hers.</p><p>Sadly, she wasn\u2019t done. \u201cBelieve me, I understand the concept far better than I ever did. Maybe you didn\u2019t come here to save me, after all, but to wound me the same way I once wounded you.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t trusted her, couldn\u2019t, no matter how badly he\u2019d wanted to, and even told himself he did, and now he saw that she couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, trust him, either. Not really. He\u2019d suspected this would happen. That hadn\u2019t bothered him (much) before, but it bothered him now. He hated that there were so many barriers between them. Clothes, reservations, doubts and worries. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m nothing like the women you\u2019re used to,\u201d she went on. \u201cI know that. I know that I\u2019m not pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re beyond gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>A gasp. \u201cA-and my lips are ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf ridiculous is the new word for a wet dream.\u201d</p><p>Her little fists hammered at his chest. \u201cStop! Just stop. You need sex and you\u2019re trying to make a sale. I did the same to you earlier, wanting to be with you one last time. I shouldn\u2019t have thrown myself at you like that.\u201d</p><p>His back straightened. She had offered herself to him, not because she had felt guilty, but because she had wanted him. She should not have admitted that. There would be no stopping him now. He would have her, one way or another.</p><p>He licked at her lips, saying, \u201cBaby, I\u2019ve never had to try. I breathe, and the women offer.\u201d</p><p>The abuse stopped, a mewling sound leaving her. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re trying to put me in my place, then. Trying to tease me with what I can never fully have.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, you can have it, all right. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not true. Not because you trust me, but because of your demon.\u201d Wrath would have been all over any deception on Paris\u2019s part.</p><p>A pause the agonizing length of three heartbeats. \u201cYou\u2019re...right. How odd,\u201d she said, both awed and hopeful. Her nails once again found purchase in his chest. \u201cI hated the fact that a demon was placed inside me, wanted to be free of him, ranted and railed and even planned to give him back, and yet I\u2019ve begun to count on his ability to read other people\u2019s intentions.\u201d</p><p>Once possessed, always possessed. For the most part, anyway. So give Wrath back to Aeron? That would be a big fat hell, no. That would kill her. Again. \u201cYou can believe me when I say that I do want you, Sienna. You\u2019re all I\u2019ve thought about for months. Resisting you in that room was one of the toughest things I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>A vibration in her throat signaled her moan. \u201cYou\u2019re really attracted to me, despite everything?\u201d Wonder saturated her voice, dripping over him like warm honey.</p><p>He had a thing for warm honey.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Backward, forward he arched, renewing the decadent contact. He wanted to push for more still, but didn\u2019t. Not yet. He wanted her focused only on the pleasure, all her fears about ulterior motives assuaged. \u201cLet there be no doubt on that score.\u201d</p> <p>Another vibration, this one reaching a deeper part of him. \u201cWhy me?\u201d Her nails plucked free of his chest, her hands smoothing over him. \u201cI mean, you could have anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I could, and I chose you. For so many reasons. You\u2019re smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDebatable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re witty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than a thousand others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re argumentative and can\u2019t accept a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d She reached up and tugged at his hair.</p><p>Despite the grimness of their surroundings and circumstances, he found himself grinning. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Her fingers slid to his scalp, massaging. \u201cNot just beyond gorgeous?\u201d she asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exquisite, and I don\u2019t want to hear you put yourself down again. Do you understand?\u201d He had killed others for doing so. Her, he would simply spank. \u201cYou may or may not be happy with the results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you thinking paddling? Because I\u2019m getting a few images in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well. There\u2019s something else to like about you. You understand me.\u201d</p><p>A snort. One he relished, because he had caused the humor behind it. \u201cYou must be blinded by horny demon-colored glasses,\u201d she said.</p><p>And she thought there were thousands of others just as stubborn as she was. He\u2019d just issued an order alongside a threat, yet she had ignored both and continued on her merry way.</p><p>\u201cHas your demon ever let you be with the same woman twice?\u201d she asked, the words layered with a husky edge of arousal, as well as a note of nervousness. \u201cI\u2019d heard you\u2014 Never mind.\u201d</p><p>She had gotten a lot of her info from the Hunters. He stiffened, hating the reminder of her past, but that didn\u2019t stop him from admitting, \u201cNo one but you.\u201d</p><p>The warmth of her breath trekked over his neck as she angled her head, placing them cheek to cheek. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Sex doesn\u2019t know, either. I\u2019ve asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he should have picked someone else. I have small breasts,\u201d she whispered, as though ashamed.</p><p>He cupped the pint-size morsels in question. They. Were. Perfect. His hands were big, her nipples beading against the centers of his palms, and damn if that wasn\u2019t the most exquisite sensation in the world. He fit his lips against her ear, nibbled on the lobe.</p><p>\u201cI want them in my mouth,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>A groan of approval. Nails in his scalp now, digging deeper and deeper.</p><p>Paris kissed and licked his way to her lips. They were parted, warm, the sweetness of her breath sawing in and out, scented with the spice of coconut. He hovered there, still not taking what he wanted. What they both wanted. If he started this, he was going to have a hard time stopping. A very hard time. He\u2019d been without a female for too long, and his demon was too needy, but...</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to take Sienna in a hallway, in front of others, he realized. Yeah, he\u2019d done that shit before, and it had gotten old hella fast. He wanted this one all to himself, each of her cries for his ears alone, her every reaction to his touch his personal discovery. Her scent, his. Her skin, his. His, his, his.</p><p>Take what\u2019s yours! Take, take, take!</p><p>Well, as alone as he could get with a demon trapped inside him.</p><p>\u201cParis?\u201d she said, her tone unreadable.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA word of warning. I\u2019m really bad at this.\u201d</p><p>Confusion rocked him, his brows furrowing toward his hairline. \u201cAt what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing.\u201d</p><p>Before he could contradict her, she fit their mouths together and sucked the breath right out of his lungs. She wasn\u2019t bad at kissing; she was hesitant, unsure and tentative, but he craved her too viciously to teach her better. He took over, unable to stop himself. His tongue thrust forcefully, demanding she concede to his mastery.</p><p>Concede she did not. After his teeth banged into hers the third time, she bit down on his bottom lip, hard, drawing blood.</p><p>He jerked back before she cut the thing in half. \u201cDamn it, woman.\u201d</p><p>Sex performed some sort of kickboxing move against the side of his skull. Not in complaint or to hide from the violence, but in excitement, to get closer to the violence. More, more! Kiss her more!</p><p>\u201cI might be bad at it, but I know when someone else is, too. Do it right,\u201d Sienna demanded.</p><p>Was she frickin\u2019 kidding? \u201cNo one\u2019s ever criticized my technique before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because they didn\u2019t want to hurt your feelings,\u201d she shot back. \u201cYou and I are past that stage, so I feel okay in admitting that I got a superior kiss from Carl Knickerbocker in the third grade.\u201d</p><p>Spirit again, and damn if that didn\u2019t rev him right back up, demolishing any lingering hint of anger. He wished he could see her face. Those hazel eyes would be sparkling, her skin flushed, her lips swollen. She would be passion incarnate. \u201cShould you be giving pointers? You\u2019re far worse at this than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to teach you.\u201d She patted his cheek. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to learn how to do this together.\u201d</p><p>More, more, more!</p><p>His lips twitched with his amusement. Funny, that. Amusement, when his body and his demon were on fire, desperate for this woman. I\u2019m on it.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>\u201cOKAY. LET\u2019S SEE WHAT I CAN do to give little Carl a run for his money.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Slowly Paris went back in, pressed his mouth gently against Sienna\u2019s, lifted, pressed again, teasing her with the contact, barely tasting. She softened against him, her nails scraping against his scalp, her hands tracing down, down, until winding around his neck to lock him against her.</p><p>He licked at the seam of her lips, sipping at her, giving her what she wanted, slow and easy, and when she opened for him he licked his way inside, deep, tasting more of her, taking more. Her tongue met his, connecting, dueling with long, languid strokes. They learned each other, learned every nuance of tongue and teeth, breath and flavor, and it was the sexiest damn thing he\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>During their first meeting, she had kissed him and used his distraction against him, shoving the needle in his neck. She could have done something similar now, but he wouldn\u2019t have cared. His body smoldered with passion, his blood already molten in a way it had never been. His heart was a war drum in his chest, pounding out its cry for more from this woman, this obsession. His limbs shook.</p><p>With the darkness so thick around them, his sight was still razed and his other senses picked up the slack. Sienna\u2019s floral bouquet was branded inside his nose, causing his head to swim all over again. His tattooed fingertips tingled, memorizing the satiny feel of her. His ears twitched, every sound she made a caress. And her taste...oh, hell, yeah...ambrosia in its most potent incarnation.</p><p>But then, that\u2019s what she was now, what Cronus had made her. A supplier. A walking ambrosia dispenser. Stick a straw in her vein and you could get high for eternity.</p><p>When consumed by humans, ambrosia killed. Had once nearly killed Maddox\u2019s woman. Sienna, though, was already dead and no longer human. By feeding her the nectar mixed with the bulbs necessary for the plant\u2019s growth, something that would kill even an immortal, she was, in essence, an ever-fertile breeding ground for the drug.</p><p>What ran in her veins was more addictive than what Paris used to pour into his alcohol. And if anyone immortal ever tasted her blood, they would be instantly addicted to her. They would need her, keep her, and fight to the death anyone who tried to take her.</p><p>Why in the name of all that was unholy would Cronus do that to her? Why would he make her such a target? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something else for the two of them to hash out\u2014with blades.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about that right now. You\u2019ve got her. She\u2019s safe, and she wants you as much as you want her. He gripped her waist, lifted her off her feet, then pressed her more firmly into the wall. \u201cWrap your legs around me, baby.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, and he rubbed his erection against her clitoris so hard she cried out. That was...that was... There were no words.</p><p>More.</p> <p>All. Everything. There were a few words, after all. \u201cAre you wet for me?\u201d Usually he had a stream of lovely, meaningless praise to give. Sienna was lucky to get more than mine, more and yes out of him.</p><p>There was a beat of hesitation, then she whispered shyly, \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Wanton abandon splashed with a hint of reserve...a sultry combination.</p><p>Their tongues rolled together, faster, faster still. Her kiss was like sex. Overwhelming, consuming, necessary. He couldn\u2019t get enough, didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever get enough. Everything he\u2019d done to reach this point, absolutely worth it.</p><p>He\u2019d been with so very many people, had done so very many things. Some he\u2019d liked, some he hadn\u2019t. Ninety percent of the time he operated on autopilot, going through the motions to get what he needed while leaving his partners with a smile of satisfaction, even when he\u2019d hated who he was with, loathed the smells, the grasping hands, the knowledge that he was inside someone he didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t on autopilot right now. Instinct drove him, a need to possess and to be possessed. A need to become one, as corny as that sounded. So he kissed her again, because he couldn\u2019t not kiss her. Because he had to know more of her taste, more of her. He slanted his head, angling for even deeper contact, moving his tongue faster, faster still, taking her mouth the way he wanted to take her body.</p><p>This time, she offered no complaint. All the while he rubbed against her. His nerve endings were so sensitized he thought they\u2019d be raw by the time he finished.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she moaned, and clearly, this time she liked his fervor. \u201cParis...I\u2019m going to... You have to...stop... Don\u2019t stop...please stop. Paris!\u201d</p><p>There would be no stopping. He pressed ever harder, heard her cry out at the bliss, and hell, he was on fire. Burning for her, desperate to sink so damn deep inside her that she\u2019d know she belonged to him.</p><p>More!</p><p>\u201cParis...stop...please.\u201d</p> <p>There was that word again. \u201cStop.\u201d Her hands tugged at his hair, forcing his head to lift.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she rasped, \u201cbut not here. Somewhere else. Somewhere private.\u201d</p><p>MORE.</p><p>He\u2019d take her back to the bedroom, he thought, dizzy with need. Yeah. That\u2019s what he\u2019d do, because he had to strip her, had to see her, had to get inside her now, now, now.</p><p>He straightened, dragging her with him. One step, though, just one step, and thousands of needle pricks shot through his lower leg. Reason returned, and he jolted back into the blood circle. He was panting, could feel the warm flow of blood down his calf, would be surprised if he had any muscle left. In the time it took to snap a finger, the shadow-things had chomped on him as if he was a steak and they were starving dogs.</p><p>That\u2019s what Sienna had endured?</p><p>Sex retreated into the back of his mind, the pain too much for him.</p><p>Darkness...rising... Paris\u2019s hand was on his blade hilt, squeezing, as he contemplated jumping into the midst and slashing.</p> <p>Sienna\u2019s fingers curled around his biceps, stilling him. She, too, was panting. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt?\u201d He patted her down, searching for injuries.</p><p>\u201cNot me. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Her nipples were still beaded, her belly quivering. Need was still galloping through her, yet she\u2019d had the strength to stop when he had not. Impressive. Irritating.</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Just as suddenly as the shadow creatures had arrived, they left. The castle ceased shaking, the screams died. Light swept back through the hallway. Paris had to blink against the burn in his eyes.</p><p>Sienna\u2019s cheeks were flushed a deep rose, her lips soft, swollen and parted, gleaming with his taste. He must have plowed his hands through her hair numerous times. The strands were tangled around her. She looked wanton and wicked, and so sexy his shaft throbbed against his fly.</p><p>He turned away before he fell on her, devoured her. In the center of the hallway, William crouched in his own blood circle, his head bowed. The female immortal was at her door, her eyes wide, unsure. The male William had protected was at his door, too.</p><p>The other male, the one William hadn\u2019t reached in time, was lying on the bedroom floor, a sea of crimson and...other things spilled around him. He writhed in agony, even as he fought to put himself back together.</p><p>\u201cYou know what those things were?\u201d Paris demanded. When his world spun, he scowled and threw out an arm to catch himself on the wall. But it wasn\u2019t because of blood loss or pain.</p><p>Sex whimpered, spurting weakness straight into Paris\u2019s veins. Bastard had been primed and disappointed too many times in the past few days, and with the denial of Sienna the countdown to \u201cmeltdown\u201d had begun. That meant, if he failed to have sex, and soon, he would rapidly fade until he was completely useless. Until he collapsed, the pheromones wafting from him, drawing people to him. Until someone simply climbed on top of him.</p><p>No way he\u2019d let that happen. His reasons for resisting Sienna hadn\u2019t miraculously vanished, but they weren\u2019t going to stop him anymore. He\u2019d take her however he could get her, because the alternative was taking someone else and he wasn\u2019t willing to do that.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know what they are,\u201d William finally managed after catching his breath. Eyes of otherworldly blue lifted and pinned Paris in place. Tension crackled in the air between them. \u201cA long time ago Cronus created them the same way Zeus created you, but I\u2019d heard after Cronus\u2019s imprisonment that someone else had taken over their care. Cronus must have reclaimed them. And now I\u2019m gonna have to have a chat with him about houseguests and manners.\u201d Utter menace poured from him.</p><p>Clearly he anticipated a chat for two, from which only one would walk away. Yeah. Paris intended the same.</p><p>\u201cThat ever happen to you?\u201d he asked, whipping back to Sienna and jerking his thumb at the guy split open from neck to navel. Because of what had been done to Sienna\u2019s blood, the creatures would have gone crazy over her. Would have converged en masse, concentrated solely on her, not leaving until they\u2019d drained every drop possible.</p><p>There was no reply.</p><p>\u201cSienna. What\u2019s\u2014\u201d Her eyes were glazed over, he realized, glassy and glowing a bright, vibrant red.</p><p>\u201cPunish,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Wrath had taken over her mind and body.</p><p>\u201cMust punish them,\u201d she repeated in a voice she had never before used with him, all gravel, no passion. A second later, her wings burst from her back, clouds of midnight tipped with violet. They flapped up, down, stretching to their full width and scratching the wall, the floor.</p><p>\u201cSienna,\u201d he said. Calm, he had to remain calm. Otherwise Wrath would turn that need to punish on him. He snapped his fingers in front of her face. \u201cI need you to listen to me, okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPunish.\u201d Her wings glided faster, until she hovered in the air.</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she darted straight at the only window, shattering the glass and disappearing into the night.</p><p>Paris made a swift dive for her but missed and ended up with half of his body ready to free-fall too many stories into that frothing lake of doom. Well, hell. He\u2019d asked her to let the bastard take over, hadn\u2019t he? Stupid. No telling where Wrath would take her, or what the demon would make her do.</p><p>One way or another, he was going after her.</p><p>Never had to chase a woman this much. He pulled himself back in and studied the incline, trying to decide the best and fastest way down without drawing the notice of the gargoyles. And wouldn\u2019t you know it? There was only one way. He was gonna have to make the fifty-foot dive, after all, and pray his legs wouldn\u2019t shatter on impact.</p><p>Problem was, now that he was on the downward slide to gotta-have-sex-or-die, he would hurt himself and he wouldn\u2019t heal very quickly. Whatever. She was in danger; he would do what was necessary. He threw a leg over the pane.</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d He tossed the words over his shoulder. \u201cSee if you can help the immortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay ahead of you,\u201d came William\u2019s muttered reply.</p><p>When his other leg was in place, Paris counted down. Three. Two. So stupid. One\u2014</p><p>And suddenly Zacharel was there, white wings spread and waving gracefully through the air. Snowflakes drifted around him, the perfect frame for his emotionless features. He arched a dark brow. \u201cWould you like a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you when the shadows were here?\u201d he demanded gruffly.</p><p>\u201cI can answer, or I can help you.\u201d</p><p>So sick of his manipulations, but there\u2019s no denying I could use his help. And aren\u2019t I just the cutest damsel in distress ever? Aeron had carried Paris through the skies a time or two, so he knew there was nothing sexual about it. He only prayed Zacharel realized the erection he currently sported had nothing to do with their close proximity.</p><p>The angel wrapped his arms around Paris\u2019s waist. \u201cYou\u2019ll find good deeds are balm for the soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just peachy.\u201d For a greater sense of being anchored, Paris wrapped his own arms around the angel\u2019s neck. Solid muscle, ice-cold skin. Even as primed and needy as Sex was, the demon stayed quiet. \u201cBut can we do this without conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we? Yes. Will we? No. While you are my captive audience, I wish to discuss your unhealthy obsession with the dead girl and the fact that she will be better off without you.\u201d</p><p>O-kay. Paris brought his legs between them, pushed their bodies apart, and jumped.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>BLOOD DRIPPED FROM SIENNA\u2019S hands, caked her clothing and made her tennies squish disgustingly with every step she took. As with every other time Wrath had taken over her body and whisked her out of the castle, he had forced her to follow the shadows to their lair so that he could wage an attack and hurt the creatures far worse than they had hurt others. His crimson-bright gaze had shone through hers, cutting through their skin...or ooze...or whatever comprised their outer shell, burning them. He had laughed and laughed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The shadows had been too sated from gorging to fight back, their helplessness an aphrodisiac to Wrath, making him crave more, more, more, and the moment he\u2019d finished with the shadows, he had turned his sights on the other beings living in this hidden realm, rhapsodizing when they, too, screamed in pain.</p><p>When his hunger was finally satisfied, he tried to force her to walk back to the castle. For the first time, she had known what he was doing while he was doing it, her mind refusing to break its link with Paris, and she\u2019d fought him\u2014and fought hard. Ultimately, as replete as he\u2019d been, he\u2019d given up and retreated to the back of her mind. Now she was at the wheel and driving the (short) bus.</p><p>Sadly, her fighting wasn\u2019t yet done. There was an invisible cord connecting the castle and her neck, trying to pull her closer and closer. She wasn\u2019t sure how much longer she could resist. Her wings were shredded\u2014not that she knew how to fly without Wrath\u2019s guidance\u2014and though they would heal in a few hours, they were currently unable to hold her weight. Still, she dug her heels into the ground and managed to slow her momentum. Pain vibrated in her bones. She cringed as she turned...turned...and began to slip away in the opposite direction. Yes. Yes!</p> <p>To go back, even to see Paris, to say goodbye, to kiss him one last time, to make love to him, was to imprison herself. And though she was tempted, oh, was she tempted, she had to do this. For him. For Skye. Before Cronus learned of her escape, thought to punish Paris and started pulling her strings all over again.</p><p>If she could reach Galen, interrogate and kill him before Cronus realized she was gone, she wouldn\u2019t have to seduce him, and the war between the Lords and the Hunters would at last end. Even if the keeper of Hope never told her where her sister was, he couldn\u2019t hurt the girl if he was dead. That would have to suffice.</p><p>Footsteps echoed, jerking her out of her mind. There were beings behind her, she realized, following her. She didn\u2019t have to glance back to know they were empty-eyed males with sagging, gray-tinted skin and jaws that split into rows of four, each loaded with razor-sharp fangs. They were killers without a conscience, the blood of their enemies their source of life.</p><p>A few weeks ago, Wrath had struck at their camp, leaving blood and death in his wake. Of course, that meant Sienna\u2014the face the survivors had seen\u2014had become Enemy One. They\u2019d been gunning for her ever since, and would have attacked the castle if not for the Gargl.</p><p>The urge to run was nearly irresistible. From the glimpses her demon had given her of these creatures, she knew how they\u2019d hunted in the past, knew how mercilessly they\u2019d killed. Knew they enjoyed the chase more than they enjoyed the slaughter. So maybe if she kept a calm head, maybe if she stayed on her current path, they\u2019d lose interest in her.</p> <p>Yeah, maybe. Not.</p><p>\u201cYou took our ssslavesss, female. Now you become our ssslave.\u201d</p><p>That lisp came courtesy of his fangs, which sliced at the words as they emerged.</p><p>\u201cThe thingsss we\u2019ll do to you...\u201d A calculated snicker. \u201cThe ssscreamsss you\u2019ll utter...\u201d</p><p>Offering no reply, but remaining highly attuned to their every move, she forced herself farther and farther from the castle. Her surroundings became darker, the air thicker, scented with blood and other things. She bypassed piles of bones, crimson-colored ponds, caverns that sprang from the mouths of large, carved skulls. She had no weapons, and wasn\u2019t exactly sure where the realm\u2019s exit was\u2014only knew it was here because Cronus had brought her through while she was semi-conscious, and besides, how else would Paris and his friend have entered?\u2014or where in the heavens she would next find herself.</p><p>Should have questioned Paris. Hindsight sucked.</p> <p>\u201cYesss, keep walking, female. You\u2019re headed ssstraight for our camp.\u201d</p><p>Truth or lie? Wrath was no help this time. Should she stop? Fight them? Her self-defense skills were laughable, considering she had trouble balancing her weight. No matter what she did or where she went, the men were going to attack her, and that was that. Waiting for them to strike merely delayed the inevitable.</p><p>A pain-filled grunt rent the air behind her, followed by another. Then another. The men must be fighting among themselves, she thought with a tide of relief, saving her the trouble.</p><p>A head\u2014without a body\u2014rolled past her. The empty-eyed stare flashed, disappeared, flashed, disappeared. She tripped over her own feet as another head rolled past. Her stomach churned, even as her relief tripled.</p><p>\u201cMust you kill so needlessly?\u201d a male voice asked. Emotionless, and yet there was something in the cadence, something that caressed her ears.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I must.\u201d</p><p>Paris! Sienna whirled around, her heart a thunderstorm inside her chest. Her gaze cut through the darkness. Where was\u2014 There! Her knees nearly buckled from the ensuing flood of happiness.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The speaker was a dark-haired man dressed in a robe, keeping pace beside Paris. He had a sublime face, wicked in its heartless beauty. Majestic wings of white-gold stretched from his back. He looked like a fallen angel, but then, so did Galen. Still, if Paris trusted him, so would she. Snow wafted around him, but only him. The flakes seemed to absorb into his skin and crystallize.</p> <p>\u201cThey were looking at her, threatening her,\u201d Paris said, but if he knew where Sienna waited, he gave no indication, \u201cand my demon knew what they were thinking. They deserved a hell of a lot worse than they got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI caught you, saved you from painting the ground with your organs. You owed me a favor, and I asked for a single day without bloodshed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you didn\u2019t specify which day.\u201d With that, Paris dismissed the angel and at last focused on her.</p><p>Tall and strong, scowling, he strode toward her. He had bruises under his eyes and cuts that rode the length of his arms, but his gait, though slow, was steady. Bodies were piled up behind him. She\u2019d thought only two of the creatures were following her, but oh, had she miscalculated. At least eleven had trailed her.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Paris demanded the moment he reached her.</p><p>Her gaze fell to his lips. Those lush, red lips that had kissed her and sipped at her and smashed against her own. Lips she craved all over her. \u201cSomewhere else. I\u2019m trying to escape, and doing an excellent job of it, thank you,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cWithout saying goodbye?\u201d He latched on to her bloodstained wrist, turned her arm left and right, searching for any damage. \u201cNice, Sienna. Real nice.\u201d</p><p>Was he actually mad about that? Guilt rose, followed by shame and even delight. She raised her chin, refusing to buckle under his stare. \u201cIf I had returned to the castle\u2014and believe me, my body wants to return and even standing here is a chore\u2014I\u2019d be stuck there again. You said you wanted my curse broken. Well, I\u2019m doing my best to break it.\u201d</p><p>He released her, sighed. \u201cFine. You did the right thing, but I hate the fact that if I hadn\u2019t come after you I never would have seen you again.\u201d He could have accused her of abandoning him, of leaving him there to suffer, or any number of other things. That he hadn\u2019t...</p><p>\u201cI hate that, too,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Clearing his throat as though uncomfortable with the direction of their conversation, he massaged his neck. Those ocean-blues looked as if the sun shone behind them, glistening off the water. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t want you out here by yourself. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want me out here by myself, either.\u201d A wave of dizziness suddenly hit her, and she swayed.</p><p>He examined her from head to toe, some of the angel\u2019s frost setting up shop on his skin. \u201cThat\u2019s not just other people\u2019s blood you\u2019re wearing, is it? You\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>Concern. For her. If she\u2019d had any resistance left, she would have lost every bit of it in that moment. \u201cI\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho hurt you?\u201d Lethal menace in his tone.</p><p>\u201cWrath, when he burst through the window. The other times he took over, he made me walk to the parapet on the castle\u2019s roof. This time he was afraid you\u2019d slow me down. So\u2014\u201d she shrugged \u201c\u2014he picked a faster route.\u201d</p><p>The long spikes of Paris\u2019s lashes fused together, barely masking the menace resting behind them. \u201cDon\u2019t let him take over anymore.\u201d</p><p>Not the least bit intimidated by the warrior\u2019s growing anger, she rolled her eyes. \u201cEarlier you wanted me to do just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind,\u201d he said, leaning down until they were nose-to-nose. \u201cDon\u2019t push me on this, woman. I\u2019m too keyed up.\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that for several seconds, breath mixing, emerging faster. She wanted him to kiss her again, to finish what they\u2019d started.</p><p>\u201cThis area is not safe,\u201d the other man said, ruining the sensuality of the moment.</p><p>Paris jolted upright, his back going ramrod straight. \u201cSienna, meet Zacharel. He\u2019s a warrior angel for the One, True Deity. Zacharel, meet Sienna. She\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>A shiver rippled through her. Uh, had he just claimed her? Had he just warned the other male away from her, as if he were possessive of her? Pleasure warmed her up, chasing away the numbing cold the angel had brought with him.</p><p>Zacharel offered his hand to her, his fingers long and thick. \u201cI will protect you,\u201d he said, the words somehow an invitation\u2014and a vow.</p><p>\u201cNo touching,\u201d Paris snapped, pushing the angel away from her. \u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel\u2019s neutral expression never wavered, nor did the intensity of his gaze.</p><p>She shifted uncomfortably, uncertain why he wanted to protect her. There was a note of truth in his tone, however, one she could not refute. Somehow she knew he would do everything in his power to keep her safe.</p><p>Or...maybe that was a trick. Maybe, like Galen, Zacharel built up hopes and smashed them down. Gulping, she looked to Paris for answers. \u201cIs he...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Galen?\u201d he asked, sensing the direction of her thoughts. \u201cNo. He\u2019s the real deal, as well as a self-righteous prig who will test every limit of your patience. He\u2019s also impotent. Now, where are you headed?\u201d He cupped her jaw and forced her focus on him and him alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The heat of his touch...the rough texture of his palms...another shiver stole through her. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Did she sound as breathless to him as she did to herself? \u201cI was walking aimlessly, searching for the exit. You wouldn\u2019t happen to know where it is, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Two days\u2019 walk in the other direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She\u2019d have to pass the castle, then, and if she passed it, she would be drawn inside. No question. If she went inside, she wouldn\u2019t come out again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you,\u201d he said at the same time Zacharel said, \u201cI can fly you there in just a few hours. And I am not impotent. I have simply never experienced desire.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Talk about an attention stealer. Questions immediately poured through her mind. Why not? Were angels asexual? How old was he? What kind of woman could break through that icy shell and jump-start his hormones?</p><p>Maybe when things settled down she would set the angel up with someone\u2014not that she knew anyone\u2014because no one should go without physical contact of some kind. It hurt.</p><p>When she\u2019d first opened her eyes and discovered her new ghostly form, she had tried to touch someone, anyone. No one had sensed her, in any way, and her mind had threatened to snap from the lack of sensation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not flying her anywhere,\u201d Paris growled. He\u2019d been watching her, she realized, gauging her reaction to Zacharel\u2019s offer. \u201cI told you. No touching. Besides that, she stays with me, by my side. That\u2019s nonnegotiable.\u201d</p> <p>She could have argued with him. Should have argued with him. They had no future together, and prolonging the inevitable would destroy her in the end. But the thought of two more days with him proved irresistible.</p><p>\u201cI stay with him,\u201d she said with a nod.</p><p>A flare of satisfaction sparked in Paris\u2019s eyes as he, too, nodded his approval.</p><p>\u201cAfter you have a woman, you quickly grow tired of her,\u201d Zacharel said. \u201cIs that why you are so eager to be alone with this one?\u201d He sounded genuinely curious rather than waspish, yet the words stung all the same. \u201cIf that is the case, then I will gladly allow you some time together.\u201d</p><p>She must have flinched, because Paris released her and spun for attack, two daggers in his hands.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d</p> <p>Zacharel remained focused on her. \u201cYou have only to say my name, female, and I will come for you.\u201d He vanished.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>PARIS LUNGED FOR ZACHAREL, encountered only air and let loose a dark stream of curses. The main one being, \u201cStupid cock block.\u201d He turned back to Sienna with narrowed eyes. \u201cSay his name, and sign his death warrant.\u201d He didn\u2019t give her a chance to respond\u2014not that she knew what to say\u2014but returned to her side and swooped her into his arms. He started forward, his pace smooth, her weight seemingly insubstantial. \u201cThere\u2019s a cavern up ahead. We\u2019ll get you patched up before heading for the exit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know there\u2019s a cavern?\u201d She\u2019d lived here for months, far longer than Paris had, yet she hadn\u2019t known about any caverns.</p><p>\u201cI scouted out the area when I first arrived.\u201d</p><p>Such a warrior thing to do, and sexy as hell. She sighed and let her head drop onto his shoulder. The muscles bunched beneath her cheek. And now that they were heading toward the castle, the tug became less pronounced, allowing her to relax.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ve only been reunited a short time, but this is, like, the hundredth time you\u2019ve had to carry me.\u201d</p><p>A snort. \u201cYour math might be a little off, baby. Besides, I like carrying you.\u201d</p> <p>Baby. She loved when he called her by the endearment, loved the way his voice dipped so huskily. Her chest constricted, and her belly quivered. He was the first to ever speak to her in such a way and, unlike the time he\u2019d called her \u201csweetheart\u201d so long ago, he clearly meant it to be something special just for her.</p><p>As she rubbed her cheek against him, his champagne-and-chocolate scent hit her, more intense than ever before, and derailed her thoughts. She pressed her nose against his hammering pulse, drinking in as much of the aroma as she could. Her nerve endings perked up, singing for his touch, his caress.</p><p>His gait slowed. A few steps later, he tripped.</p><p>Was he distracted by her, or injured? Concern overshadowed her arousal when she recalled the cuts on his arm. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he replied gruffly. The reassurance was ruined a second later when he stumbled over a rock.</p><p>Definitely injured. \u201cPut me down.\u201d She struggled against his hold. \u201cI want to walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d he hissed, as though in pain. \u201cDistract me. Tell me why you joined the Hunters. You told me before, that day I woke up in your cell, but some of the details are missing.\u201d</p><p>She struggled until the rest of her strength drained, and got nowhere. Even in a weakened state, he was stronger than she was.</p><p>Every new thing she learned about him made her want him more, and made him that much sexier.</p><p>Ultimately she relaxed back against him, conceding defeat only long enough to plan. Or not. Her thoughts derailed a second time as more and more of his scent permeated her skin. Desire for him began to overwhelm her.</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d</p><p>His question. Right. And, okay, fine. If he wanted to carry her despite his weakness or whatever was wrong, she would let him carry her. Being close to him was a need. \u201cI bought into their ideology. I was convinced the world would become free of hurt, disease, badness and evil if only you and your friends were destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling us won\u2019t turn the world into a utopia. Humans make their own choices, bringing the bad and the evil on themselves. But let\u2019s say we do influence the world. Would that matter? People still have choices. They can resist, fight, and choose to act as they were meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d She licked her lips and imagined licking her way to his\u2014then lower. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I repeat my answer, will you finally believe me?\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence. A silence as thick and heavy as the air around them. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise, momentarily distracted from the subject at hand. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to believe you.\u201d</p><p>Not because he trusted her, she thought, and tried not to be disappointed. But then, asking for his trust would be like asking a human male to gift her with the moon and the stars. Impossible. And yet his faith, even given for that reason, was a promising start.</p><p>\u201cThen, yes, I truly believe killing you would serve no purpose.\u201d</p><p>The edge of his jaw appeared chiseled from stone as he nodded. \u201cNext question. Has Cronus ever told you why he enslaved you?\u201d</p><p>A dangerous topic, but she said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He shifted his hand, his fingers brushing the underside of her breast. Just like that, the desire returned. \u201cWell. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>Trying to seduce the information out of her? No need. She\u2019d lied to him once upon a time, and she\u2019d already decided never to lie to him again. Trust was a precious thing, and she wouldn\u2019t turn her back on his, no matter the trouble she courted. \u201cHe wants me to return to the Hunters, watch their leader and steal his secrets.\u201d</p><p>Against her cheek, she felt his heart stop beating. Just stop. One second, two. Finally the organ kicked back into gear, but its strikes were too fast, too brutal.</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d he asked. They\u2019d reached the entrance of the cavern, which just happened to be the mouth of one of the giant skulls. Paris had to hunch his shoulders to get inside without scraping his head on the teeth.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, praying her inner torment over the fact remained hidden. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Cronus or for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor...all of us. For answers about my younger sister. She\u2019s missing, has been for years. For vengeance. I hate the Hunters. Hate what they do.\u201d For you, she added silently. \u201cThough hopefully I won\u2019t have to do things Cronus\u2019s way.\u201d No reason to mention the mistress thing. Her plan to sneak in now, interrogate and kill could work.</p><p>Whether Paris believed her or not, he didn\u2019t say. He carted her to the center of the enclosure, where a natural spring rested, and set her on the ledge. He arranged her wings so that their tips wouldn\u2019t scrape the dirt floor.</p><p>A frigid breeze blasted through, filling up the entire space and making her shiver. Silent, Paris started a fire the old-fashioned way, sparking two rocks together and letting the flames catch on the twigs he\u2019d gathered. Golden flames illuminated his face, bathing his features in a heady mix of light and shadow.</p><p>He was always beautiful, but just then he was mouthwateringly exquisite. A mythical god of the heavens, no mere mortal worthy of him. Especially not her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to punish you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She remembered the accusation she\u2019d launched at him while he\u2019d had her pinned to the wall, her lips stinging from the brutal kiss he\u2019d forced on her. A kiss she might have enjoyed under any other circumstances. But at that moment, as scared as she\u2019d been of the shadows and of her feelings for him, she\u2019d needed gentle.</p><p>Until gentle hadn\u2019t been enough for her riotous body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou believe me? Just like that?\u201d He snapped his fingers.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His gaze jerked to her, crackling with the same flickering heat as the fire. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to.\u201d</p><p>An angry shake of his head, dark hair whipping against his cheeks. \u201cOr maybe because you\u2019re grateful to me.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, tasting him in the air, knowing they were now talking about something entirely different. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr because you merely wish to keep me strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not because you desire me,\u201d he said, his tone sharp as a whip. \u201cNot because you hunger for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wanted her to say it, wanted her to admit her desire for him while they were separated. That way, she couldn\u2019t claim passion spoke for her. More than that, he wanted her to say it without offering her the same admission. Not at first, and maybe not after. Either way, she\u2019d be taking a risk. While a denial could save her pride, he might turn away from her, now and always. And while agreement could cause her major embarrassment, it could also bring her a pleasure unlike any she\u2019d known before. So, no contest.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBecause I desire you, hunger for you.\u201d</p><p>Silence once again reigned, and she wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d heard her or cared. Then his gaze shifted away from her, only to jerk back to her a second later, as if he lacked the strength to battle his own needs, the blue of his eyes mixed with glimmers of demon-red and black. Eerie and haunting, but not frightening. Not anymore.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what I would do with you when I found you,\u201d he said, his voice more gravel than anything. \u201cSave you, yes. Definitely. Sleep with you, yes, that, too. I want you so badly I ache. All the time, I ache, but even though I want to keep you, part of me has always known that I would have to leave you afterward. I can\u2019t do permanent, even with you.\u201d</p><p>Even, he\u2019d said, as if she were special. And the fact that he\u2019d copped to his own feelings of desire caused her hunger for him to return in full force. Her entire body trembled, and had she been standing, she would have collapsed. \u201cI know you\u2019ll have to leave me,\u201d she said. It wasn\u2019t something she could blame him for, because she couldn\u2019t stay with him, either.\u201d</p><p>He dragged in a breath, his fingers clenched on the rocks he still held. \u201cI will not lie to you, and I will not cheat on you, and if we tried for something more, I would have to do both.\u201d</p><p>Like he\u2019d done with that woman, Susan.</p><p>\u201cBeing with you may not affect my demon, may not strengthen me. I don\u2019t know, because I haven\u2019t had the same woman twice since my possession. If it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll have to leave you sooner than expected and find...someone else.\u201d</p> <p>There was no reason for him to know that the thought of him with another woman ate at her, leaving raw, oozing wounds. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you saw...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusan. Yes.\u201d</p><p>Sadness flickered in his eyes, then anger. He ran his tongue over his teeth, as though her response had somehow pricked his temper. \u201cIf that happens, I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019ll tell you first, before I leave, and no matter what, I\u2019ll come back to you. I\u2019ll make sure you reach the exit. But after that, we have to... We say goodbye, once and for all.\u201d</p><p>The fire must have been doing its job, but the cavern seemed to warm in an instant, the cold vanquished. Perhaps her body had simply sucked that cold inside. She felt chilled to the bone. Paris wasn\u2019t going to protest her return to the Hunters. She wondered if he would object to her involvement with Galen, if it became necessary, but wasn\u2019t going to ask. As much as she wanted to know the answer, she didn\u2019t want to know the answer.</p><p>\u201cKnowing all of that, do you still want to be with me?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>His tone implied he didn\u2019t give a shit about her answer. That he\u2019d shrug and easily find someone else if she said no. But he was holding his breath, she realized, his cheeks flushing under the strain. He did want her, and he did care whether or not she wanted him back.</p><p>\u201cI still want to be with you,\u201d she said. \u201cStill want you.\u201d</p><p>He searched her face, clearly satisfied by what he saw, because he nodded. \u201cGood. Now take off your clothes and get in the water.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>PARIS WATCHED AS SIENNA dropped her shirt on the floor, where she\u2019d already kicked her pants. Now she stood in her bra and panties. Plain, white. And yet, clinging to her perfect little body, they were the sexiest garments he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>His erection stretched past his navel, the base wider than his wrist. Yeah, he wanted her that badly.</p><p>More, Sex pleaded.</p><p>\u201cThe rest,\u201d he croaked. She was so beautiful...so strong. He\u2019d come all this way, done all those terrible things, and yet she had freed herself from Cronus\u2019s hold. When Paris looked past his own masculine pride, he was glad about that. She had fought her demon and won, something he had never been able to do. Whatever happened outside this realm, she would be okay.</p> <p>What happened inside of it, however...</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t do this, he thought, even as he repeated, \u201cThe rest. Now.\u201d</p><p>She unhooked the bra, dropped the garment on top of the others. Rosy nipples pearled from the lingering coolness in the air, topping off breasts he wanted in his mouth. Her thumbs slid under the waist of her panties and tugged. Down the exquisite length of her legs, until she was a whole lot of naked. His gaze was riveted on the dark triangle of curls shielding his favorite place in this realm or any other.</p><p>She shifted uncomfortably, her arms lifting and lowering as if she wanted to cover herself but kept talking herself out of doing so.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect. So sweet and perfect.\u201d Slender, finely boned, with that deliciously freckled skin, each mark reminding him of a little drop of candy. He was going to lick her from top to bottom.</p><p>When they parted, there would be no part of her he hadn\u2019t tasted.</p><p>Frowning, she looked herself over. \u201cHow can you say that about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re about to insult yourself, I suggest you zip your mouth and get in the water.\u201d</p><p>His waspish tone had her blinking. \u201cYou\u2019re mad.\u201d</p><p>Hell, yeah, he was mad. \u201cWhen I tell you how beautiful you are, and you express doubt, you\u2019re basically calling me a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean... It\u2019s just that...\u201d She paused, reminding him of the babbling, uncertain woman he\u2019d smacked into in Rome. The one who had fascinated him so completely, the one who\u2019d prattled so charmingly. \u201cMen just don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Men. He cursed with enough heat to blister. \u201cThat\u2019s good, because otherwise I\u2019d have to kill them.\u201d She was his and anyone else who looked at her, anyone else who thought to touch her\u2014 Stop right there. Keep the possessiveness to a minimum. This is temporary. Has to be temporary.</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d she said, a hitch to her voice.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He wanted to look away, couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re beautiful, too.\u201d With that, as if she hadn\u2019t just undone him, she turned toward the spring. He saw the elegant, and bruised, line of her back. Saw where those violet-and-jet wings grew in two perfect rows, saw the obsidian butterfly tattoo etched between them.</p><p>The curve of her spine made his mouth water. There were two indentions at the base, just above her ass. And speaking of her ass...had he ever seen anything more lovely? Enough to grab while he pounded deep inside her, toned, four freckles forming a starlike pattern on the right cheek.</p><p>He could worship there for hours, days.</p><p>More. Please, more. Need to touch.</p><p>A moan of bliss left her as she sank into the steaming water. She disappeared underneath the surface, saturating her hair, then came back up sputtering.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d His arm shook as he withdrew a thin, wrapped bar of soap from his pocket. Embarrassment doused him when he noted he was trembling.</p><p>She accepted gratefully, her fingers brushing his palm. Beads of sweat broke out on his brow. \u201cThank you. You were smart to travel with one of these. I\u2019ll have to remember to do that.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. He wasn\u2019t going to explain his reason for doing so. He wasn\u2019t going there with her. Ever.</p><p>Telling her that he always carried a bar, that he never knew whose bed he\u2019d end up in, or what kind of person he\u2019d be with, or how dirty he\u2019d feel afterward, or that he carried soap like other men carried condoms...not smart. A mood ruiner for sure.</p><p>And speaking of condoms, could he tell her the truth? He couldn\u2019t catch an STD, so he couldn\u2019t pass one on; pregnancy was rare between an immortal and a human, much less a dead human; and while he hated sleeping with strangers, hated being so intimate with them, his demon needed the skin-to-skin contact. So, no condom, even though his shaft had come into contact with thousands of people. She would be disgusted.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have pushed her for a sexual relationship when he had nothing more to offer her. He should have given her time to make a more informed decision, but he didn\u2019t have time. They didn\u2019t have time. In two days, he would lose her. And the thing was, Sex needed fulfillment now. So, yeah, if she would let him, he would take her.</p><p>He settled at the spring\u2019s ledge, need for her clawing at him. If they did this\u2014they were so doing this\u2014and Sex wasn\u2019t satisfied immediately afterward, Paris would...what? Do what he\u2019d told her he would do and find someone else?</p><p>Don\u2019t think about that right now. He would lose control of his temper.</p><p>Already the darkness inside him swirled, craving a release of its own, making him feel as though he were possessed by two demons, each with separate needs. Sex, needing sex, and Violence, needing bloodshed. But Maddox carried the demon of Violence, so there went that theory.</p><p>Whatever. It doesn\u2019t matter. Only Sienna and this moment matter.</p><p>Sienna.</p><p>Soon she would leave this realm, the heavens, and hide from Cronus. No way would Paris allow her to hunt Galen. He would convince her to remain tucked away, and that was that. She would be safe, and Paris would return to his friends. To his war. To his old life.</p><p>A sick, pitiful existence, but, hell, after all the people he\u2019d hurt throughout the centuries, he deserved it. Especially for what he\u2019d done to Susan.</p><p>He\u2019d truly admired and respected Susan. Had promised her fidelity even though he couldn\u2019t give it, and had slowly broken her heart. He wouldn\u2019t do that to another woman.</p><p>But... He yearned for more than random couplings. He yearned for monogamy.</p><p>He yearned for Sienna.</p><p>You can have her, Sex said.</p><p>Only to lose her.</p><p>No argument there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why have you allowed me to harden for her on multiple occasions, even though we\u2019ve had her, yet you have never done the same with another? Over and over he\u2019d asked this question, and always the answer was the same.</p><p>I don\u2019t know. It just happens.</p><p>A lot of things \u201cjust happened.\u201d While Paris hated the prospect of the upcoming separation from Sienna, she had easily agreed to their two-day limit. Had to be that way, yeah, but damn. Would a little fight about it have killed her?</p> <p>Shit. He was being unreasonable, the darkness still driving his emotions. If he wanted this woman, he should have her. If he wanted to keep her, he should have her always. End of story.</p><p>Should, should, should. You couldn\u2019t live with shoulds, could you. Only woulds.</p><p>He shook his head, clearing his thoughts. He had a direct view of Sienna as she bathed. She lathered herself up, and damn if he wasn\u2019t transfixed as the bubbles cascaded down her breasts, caught on her nipples, then resumed their journey to her navel.</p><p>\u201cSienna, I have to tell you something.\u201d He ducked his head, too humiliated to face her. After this, she might walk, no chance of sex, but he had to do this or his conscience would never forgive him.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me anything.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019d soon find out. \u201cAfter your death I had to...you know...and even on my way here, I...\u201d</p><p>What are you doing? You know it\u2019s better if they never know what happens when we\u2019re done with them.</p><p>We. You mean you. When you are done.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, quieting both the demon and him.</p><p>No accusations, no making him unload the gory details. He liked that about her. A lot. She probably had no idea how rare that acceptance was, but he did. \u201cThe last time was a few days ago, I swear. I kept thinking I\u2019d find you, and I wanted to be with you and only you when that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis, we weren\u2019t dating. We weren\u2019t committed. The last thing I said to you was that I hated you. And I\u2019m sorry for that, I really am. So don\u2019t beat yourself up about your actions. You did nothing wrong.\u201d Water splashed as she closed the distance between them. She stood and warm, wet hands wound around his neck, twirling the ends of his hair.</p> <p>He rested his forehead on the curve of her shoulder. Soft, soft skin, scented so sweetly his head did that fogging thing. Sex went crazy, too, perhaps even more desperate to touch and taste her than Paris was. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so understanding with you. If you had slept with another man, even though we weren\u2019t dating, even though we weren\u2019t committed, I would...rage.\u201d He still wouldn\u2019t lie to her.</p><p>And what he would do afterward, when they split...</p><p>\u201cAt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Maybe. I don\u2019t know.\u201d His arms shot out and dragged her closer, needing her closer. Water soaked his shirt to his chest. Her nipples rasped at him, creating the most sizzling of frictions. \u201cI want you all to myself.\u201d</p><p>She carried the sun under her skin, lighting him up every time he neared her. The jade and copper in her eyes were a lush, thriving valley he could lose himself in. Her mouth inspired every one of his most erotic fantasies.</p><p>Yes! This is what I\u2019ve needed, what I\u2019ve been craving.</p><p>What Paris had been craving.</p><p>\u201cSince you,\u201d she told him softly, \u201cthere\u2019s been no one, and before you, years had passed.\u201d</p> <p>Years. The concept baffled him as much as it pleased him.</p><p>\u201cHe was...the only man I\u2019ve ever... I thought I would marry him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was a Hunter, the one who recruited me.\u201d A pause rife with a thousand sharp edges, then, \u201cI\u2019m changing the subject, but only a little. I would like to express one more doubt about, um, myself, before we continue.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, suspecting where she was headed and dreading it with every fiber of his being.</p><p>She hurried on. \u201cI know we\u2019ve been together before, and you know I\u2019m just me. But this time it\u2019s different, because I know you better, know myself better, and I\u2019m afraid that you\u2019ll... That I won\u2019t be... That I can\u2019t compare. To the others.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Exactly where he\u2019d thought she was headed. He dropped a kiss onto her collarbone, licked where his lips had been, then sucked hard enough to leave his mark. She gasped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t measure up, too,\u201d he admitted. \u201cHere I am, the keeper of Sex. What if I can\u2019t please you? What if I can\u2019t live up to your expectations? And Sienna,\u201d he added before she had time to respond, \u201cthe others, they can\u2019t compare to you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been with thousands, yes, and he\u2019d done his best to leave each one satisfied. He\u2019d been using them, after all, so it was the least he could do. But making them come hadn\u2019t been for their benefit; it had been for his, something to ease the sting of his guilt. Had he actually cared about their pleasure? No.</p><p>\u201cOh, Paris.\u201d Those dainty, beautiful hands smoothed over his back. The motions were rhythmic, graceful, waking up parts of him he hadn\u2019t known existed. \u201cHow about this? Today you\u2019re just a man and I\u2019m just a woman. There\u2019s no past, no future, only the present. We do what feels good. Nothing more. Nothing less.\u201d</p><p>Ah, hell. She kept that up and he would blow before he got inside her. She\u2019d offered him the sexiest words he\u2019d ever heard, ever hoped to hear, and it was another reason to like her. She did more than arouse him. She comforted him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019d like that,\u201d he said.</p><p>Me, too!</p><p>That\u2019s enough out of you. He settled his big hands on Sienna\u2019s tiny hips, lifted her out of the water and set her on the rocky edge beside him. The warmth of the water had flushed her skin, and now, droplets traveled all the places he wanted to go. He moved in front of her, crouching, rocking back on his heels before settling on his knees. Slowly he drew his hands along the tops of her thighs. He stopped at her knees, his thumbs dabbling underneath for several minutes before he applied pressure and opened her up as wide as he could get her. She was pink, wet and glistening.</p><p>He should tongue her nipples first, and he meant to. That had been the plan. Open her up, slide closer and pay proper homage to those sweet little buds. Except, now that he had a direct view of the prettiest feminine core he\u2019d ever seen, there would be no starting up top and working his way down. He wanted that. Now. Wanted her dripping.</p><p>\u201cI need you in my mouth. Down my throat. All over me. Tell me you need that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please, Paris. Now.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>NO TEASING HIM, NO TORMENTING him. His woman deserved a reward. Paris pressed a soft kiss where his thumbs had played, just behind her knees, then licked and nibbled his way up...up... A tremor moved through her, a perfect mimic of the vibrations Sex was throwing at him.</p><p>He leaned closer...closer still...breathed deeply, taking in the erotic scent of her desire. His blood fired, burning through him, scorching everything in its path and leaving only the desire. It was all he knew, all he wanted to know. Then he was there, right on her, licking his way up her center.</p><p>She cried out, the hoarse sound blending with his moan of rapture. Her arousal coated his tongue and he swallowed her, instantly addicted. His eyes closed as he savored. Wasn\u2019t just ambrosia he was tasting, either. Beneath the tropical syrupiness of the drug, there was a unique flavor all her own, something wine-rich and decadent. And for the first time in his life, he thought he could actually taste the aphrodisiac his demon released. Sweet as honey, rich with spice, it filled his mouth, coated his throat, seeped from his skin, blending with Sienna\u2019s succulence.</p><p>How many times had he dreamed of doing this to her, with her? Countless. He\u2019d waited so long, and at times, he\u2019d feared he would never know the reality. Nothing should have been able to live up to the languorous feasting he\u2019d envisioned, but this not only lived up, it surpassed. She was everything he\u2019d ever craved, and more.</p><p>Her fingers tangled in his hair, applying the most arousing sort of pressure. His woman wanted him back, attending to her need. There was no headier knowledge. He licked back up her core, but this time he didn\u2019t pull away. He swirled the tip of his tongue around her clitoris, teasing, taunting, driving her passion higher. Hell, driving his own higher.</p><p>He was starved for her, his cock throbbing against his fly.</p><p>\u201cNot there,\u201d she instructed. \u201cYou\u2019re almost there. Please, just a little closer and you\u2019ll be there.\u201d The words gasped from her. Her hips undulated as she sought to place his tongue directly on that swollen clitoris.</p><p>And she thought she was bad at kissing and sex? Silly female.</p><p>He penetrated her core, sinking his tongue inside her, fast, faster, glorying as she panted his name, as her essence covered his face, as he swallowed her down, as her nails sank into his scalp, as her hips twirled and met his thrusts, as she arched into him, retreated, arched again.</p><p>\u201cParis! Yes, yes. There!\u201d</p><p>When he felt her tensing, edging ever closer to release, he fit his lips over her clit and sucked, hard, at the same time driving two, then three, fingers deep, so deep. He scissored them, shifting depth and width in a constant stream of motion, and just when she reached the pinnacle of climax, he backed off a fraction, slowing his movements. Her moans tapered into incoherent mumblings, her hips following him, circling, trying to lure him back within those satiny walls.</p><p>\u201cParis! Finish me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d A ruthless plunge of his fingers, scissoring over and over, his tongue flicking over that swelling bud, and she climaxed with violent force, her inner walls clenching on him. A scream tore from her, so loud and bracing it cracked her vocals. He loved it, reveled in the knowledge that he had brought her to this point.</p><p>His desperation grew critical, and he had to remove his fingers from her and clamp onto her thighs to hold himself steady, to stop himself from ripping at his zipper and slamming home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stayed like that until she calmed. Finally her shoulders sagged, and her head lolled forward. Those midnight wings trembled, glimmering like polished ebony. She was panting shallowly, her bottom lip cut from where she\u2019d bitten down.</p><p>When her slumberous gaze met his, he brought his fingers to his mouth and licked at her arousal. He couldn\u2019t get enough of her, didn\u2019t think he would ever get enough.</p><p>Her pupils expanded, consuming those hazel irises and leaving only black. Black velvet, smooth and endless. He could lose himself and never care to be found.</p> <p>\u201cTake off your clothes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease. Let me have you now.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the collar of his shirt and tugged, ducking to free his head from the material\u2019s confinement. Her hands found his pecs a second later, her palms pressing into his nipples.</p><p>\u201cYour heart is racing,\u201d she said, clearly awed by that fact.</p><p>In that moment, his heart beat for her. Only her. He\u2019d never craved a female this much. And that she knew what he was, what he\u2019d done, and wanted him anyway... He moved in and fit his mouth around one of her rosy little nipples, sucking hard then easing the sting with a flick of his tongue. He turned his head and did the same to the other, leaving his mark on them both. Branding her, so that when she saw herself in a mirror she would know she belonged to someone else. To him, only him.</p><p>\u201cLet me see the rest of you,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cParis...\u201d</p><p>Another shake. To remove his pants, he would have to stop touching her, and he didn\u2019t want to stop touching her. Couldn\u2019t conceive a good enough reason to ever stop.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I need to see you.\u201d</p><p>Trembling, he pressed his forehead between her breasts. He swallowed, found his voice. \u201cYou never have to beg. Not with me. Whatever you want, I will give you.\u201d Always before, he\u2019d taken from his partners. With her, he wanted to give anything, everything. \u201cBut if I strip, I will lose control. Let me savor you, Sienna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cControl is overrated. I want you, however I can get you.\u201d</p> <p>Such beautiful words. \u201cI wish we were at my home, and in my bed, and I had you splayed on my pillows. You deserve better than a dirty cave.\u201d</p><p>She cupped his cheeks and forced his eyes to meet hers. \u201cAfter everything I\u2019ve done to you, how can you say that?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t remind her that this moment had no past. He couldn\u2019t. The past flooded him, too. \u201cSienna, you ran to me when you were in trouble, when Cronus first enslaved you. Before that, you slept with me to strengthen me despite the fact that you were horrified by our potential audience, despite the fact that I was your greatest enemy. Before that, you were involved in a war and batting for your team, same as me. You did nothing I wouldn\u2019t have done, had the situation been reversed.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes, splashed down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cNone of that. Not here, not now.\u201d He captured them with his tongue, kissing them away. Now the reminder came. \u201cJust a man and a woman, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...I always get emotional after mind-shattering orgasms,\u201d she said with a dry undertone, and he laughed. \u201cOr I must, considering that was my first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour other man didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her smile was silky, wanton. \u201cWhat other man?\u201d</p> <p>Good girl. He chuckled, surprising himself. Genuine humor between lovers wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever experienced before her.</p><p>\u201cI want you anywhere I can get you.\u201d Nibbling on her bottom lip, she reached down and pushed at his zipper. Her fingertips brushed the weeping tip of his cock, which stretched far past the waist of his pants. \u201cMmm, no underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was...hopeful.\u201d</p><p>Now she was the one to chuckle.</p><p>He gripped her under the ass and urged her forward, even as he leaned back on his haunches. She slid from the rocky foundation, held up only by his hands. He positioned her core just over his erection. So hot, so wet, but he didn\u2019t push inside. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he commanded, even as Sex got his purr on. Guess the demon was so excited, he couldn\u2019t stay quiet a moment longer. At least he wasn\u2019t talking. \u201cLike before. Own me with your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d A shiver rocked her as she meshed their lips without any hesitation, thrusting her tongue into his mouth and feeding him all that she was. Owning him, just as he\u2019d wanted.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hold back,\u201d he said. All thoughts of savoring her, this moment, fled. They had here and now, and not much else. He had to know the rest of her, had to join them. \u201cMust be in you. Need to be in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019ll own me.\u201d</p><p>He thrust deep and sure, filling her. They moaned in unison. Paris, Sienna, Sex. It was like coming home after a year in the desert, when you were so thirsty, so hungry, you felt as if you were drinking and eating for the first time. As if you were alive for the first time. His senses awoke, aware of her every need, attuned to her every nuance.</p><p>This was what he\u2019d yearned for so desperately. Not just a communion with her body, but with her mind. Her soul, their every breath intertwined.</p><p>Yes. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>She was tight, tighter than a fist, and he knew he stretched her. Knew he was too big for such a slender body, but that didn\u2019t stop him from moving her up and down, up and down from the root of his shaft to the very tip. She was so wet, the glide was smooth. Her nipples rasped at his chest, creating the most delicious friction. Friction that lanced spears of pleasure throughout his entire body.</p><p>He was utterly consumed by her. She was in his mouth, pressed against him, her weight sliding her down on him...down...all the way...her legs squeezing at his, her hands on his back, her nails scraping and clawing at him. Even the ends of her hair acted as a stimulant, dancing over his skin, tickling.</p><p>Paris kneaded his hands up her spine and stopped between her wings. Occasionally over the years, he\u2019d had to massage his friend Aeron to work out the stiffness from battle. So he knew just how sensitive the slits in these wings could be. Keeping in mind that she had to be sore, he kneaded gently, rolling the muscles and tendons under his fingers.</p><p>A hoarse cry left her. \u201cParis! Oh, Paris!\u201d</p><p>His name on her lips did it for him, totally, completely. He rarely ever told his partners his name, not wanting to hear them say it and increase his shame. But now, with Sienna, he was once again undone.</p><p>He pounded into her, harder, so damn hard their teeth banged together when she dove in for another kiss. Their tongues sparred with the same strength, the same intensity. His testicles were drawing up, the skin around them tightening. White-hot waves of pleasure and strength swam at the base of his spine, ready to burst through him, to devour him and brand her.</p><p>So badly he wanted to come, but he wouldn\u2019t, not until she\u2019d exploded on him. Her pleasure came first, now and always.</p><p>He reached between their bodies and circled his thumb against her clitoris. And, oh, sweet heaven, that\u2019s all she\u2019d needed. Another scream that cracked her vocals echoed around him, her inner walls milking him. He jetted inside her, pouring all of his desire, all of his need and passion straight into her core. Roaring, roaring, so caught up in the incredible sensations, uncaring about anything else.</p><p>And when, an eternity later, she collapsed against his chest, her legs lax against his, he continued to hold her, unwilling to let go. Just then, he wasn\u2019t sure he would ever be able to let go.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>HE\u2019D BEEN ABUSED, his skin like pretty pink ribbons curling from a Christmas box.</p><p>Violated in the worst ways.</p><p>But Kane never gave the female minions what they wanted.</p><p>He was ashamed that he couldn\u2019t fight his way free, that his demon had somehow taken him over and held him down as surely as the chains shackling his wrists and ankles. He was a warrior, thousands of years old, with experience honed on the bloodiest of battlefields. This should be child\u2019s play to him. He should have escaped long ago.</p><p>More than any of that, however, he was humiliated by all kinds of other things he wasn\u2019t ready to acknowledge or face. The things they\u2019d done to him...</p><p>Later. He would deal with it later. Maybe. Right now, all he could do was distance himself from what was happening to his body, as if it wasn\u2019t actually his body enduring the abuse. As if someone else had teeth in his thigh, hands where no others had been.</p><p>Drip, drip went his blood.</p><p>Kane had been tortured before. Many times, in fact. This was just more of the same, he told himself. Yeah. Right.</p><p>Disaster laughed, a cruel, happy sound echoing in his mind. If only that were the first time, but no. Disaster had laughed and laughed and laughed, a never-ending stream of amusement.</p><p>Hate utterly consumed Kane, kept him conscious. Every time he felt himself slipping into darkness, he thought about the demon High Lord inside him. Despite his instinct to remain distanced, he wanted to know every deed done to him. One day, he would return the favor in kind\u2014a thousandfold. His demon would suffer this way. His demon would die this way.</p><p>Yes, one day.</p><p>His gaze pulled from the blood-spattered cavern wall above him and slipped down his body. He was a raw slab of scarlet. Dripping...dripping... Were those his ribs? Yes, he thought hazily. They were, one of them even pointing in the wrong direction.</p><p>One. Day.</p><p>Distantly he heard the pound of...horse hooves? Maybe. Whatever it was caused the minions on top of him, under him, even those around him who were awaiting their turn, to scatter in the winds, leaving him atop the boulder, naked, still bleeding...still dripping. Crimson, such a lovely yet horrifying color. Life and death, bound together.</p><p>He should be in tremendous pain, but there was nothing. Only a strange, welcome numbness.</p><p>A horse\u2019s whinny. Booted footsteps. He should care. Someone was here, looking at him, seeing him at his worst. He did care, but there was nothing he could do about it. No way to cover himself or hide what had been done to him. He wanted to kill this newcomer the same way he wanted to kill the minions and Disaster. Anything to wipe away all knowledge of this day. Forever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A shadow fell over him, then someone was leaning down and peering into his eyes. Dark hair, eyes of the cruelest blue. \u201cI know you. You are Kane, keeper of Disaster. Had a bad day, have you?\u201d</p><p>Kane gathered enough strength to turn his head away. The action, small as it\u2019d been, zapped every bit of that strength, leaving him cold, hollow. He had nothing left. Of course, the guy reached out and turned his head for him, forcing his attention to return.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d</p> <p>Silence.</p><p>The guy grinned, and it was not nice. \u201cOnce, I could not have paid a Lord of the Underworld to visit me here. Now you guys keep popping up for free. By the way, your friend Amun called me Red while he was down here. Well, he thought it. Boy doesn\u2019t speak much, does he?\u201d He gave a genuinely amused chuckle, and yet, there was bite to the sound. \u201cWish I\u2019d picked up on that thought while he was in front of me, but then, I didn\u2019t have these, a gift from Amun before he left.\u201d</p><p>Red held up two hands\u2014and they weren\u2019t attached to his body or any other. They were dark-skinned and held together by a strap of leather. A strap of leather he had wrapped around his neck, as if he were carrying boxing gloves. The insides of the hands had been scraped out, the flesh leathered.</p><p>They were gloves now. Human gloves.</p><p>Acid bubbled in Kane\u2019s stomach. Amun had come down here to rescue Legion and in the process had been infected by hundreds of demon minions, evil becoming a slick oil over his skin. The only solution had been to send him back down here to release them.</p> <p>The gloves were the same mocha color as Amun\u2019s skin, possessed the same lines.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean...gift?\u201d Kane managed to work past his shredded throat. A throat scraped raw when the minions had stuffed things into his mouth. They hadn\u2019t cared that he\u2019d tried to bite them, and hadn\u2019t tried to prevent him from doing so. They\u2019d actually liked that. They had just\u2014 You aren\u2019t thinking about this yet. You\u2019ll become as crazy as Amun was.</p><p>\u201cI won the mitts in a poker game,\u201d Red said, his tone casual. \u201cYou play? Wait. Don\u2019t answer that. Let me learn your secrets with my new, favorite toy.\u201d Grinning his not-nice grin, he stuffed his hands into the skin gloves and reached out.</p><p>Contact.</p><p>Those hands pressed against Kane\u2019s temples, cool and tough. Red closed his eyes, his entire body jerking as if hooked to a car with a lot of stallions under the hood. A moment passed, the only sound that of his heavy breathing.</p><p>Then another round of hoofbeats reverberated. Booted footsteps came next. A blond male with a similar toothy grin was leaning over Kane. \u201cWhatta we got here? Another demon warrior?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLooks like.\u201d Red straightened, his blue gaze boring into Kane. \u201cHe\u2019s quite the mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he heal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d A shrug as if the answer wasn\u2019t important either way, then, \u201cThe man beside me is my brother. Amun called him Black. I call him Asshole. You may use whichever you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me use the hands,\u201d Black said, rubbing his own with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d A growl sprang from Red, an animalistic warning. \u201cI just got them today, and this is my week to own them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to borrow them for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. You\u2019ll keep them, claim it\u2019s your turn already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill, too.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m dreaming. I have to be dreaming. At the very least, hallucinating. Feral killers\u2014and they were killers; they possessed the same hard edge as his friends\u2014were not arguing like children.</p><p>\u201cFine. Just tell me what you learned,\u201d Black said, clearly sulking.</p><p>\u201cHe was with the Dark, and recently.\u201d Love and hate bathed Red\u2019s tone. \u201cThe Dark thinks this one will take White from us. The pair of them were captured, brought here and marked for death. A cave-in separated them. He doesn\u2019t know where the Dark is. The minions brought him here, tried to mate with him.\u201d</p><p>The Dark? Only person who thought Kane would take someone named White was William. And how did Red know\u2014the hands, Kane realized. Those hands had belonged to Amun, then. Amun, the keeper of Secrets. Red had put those...gloves on, had touched Kane and dug deep into his mind, ferreting out information. A handy little weapon to have. He should be enraged, but he was still too numb.</p><p>Black popped his jaw. \u201cWhite will have sensed your joy at finding a new demon, as did I. She will be here soon. We cannot allow her to meet this keeper.\u201d Emerald eyes bore into Kane. \u201cYou will not take her from us.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want anything to do with her, dude.</p><p>\u201cShall we kill him and be done with it?\u201d Red asked as if he were contemplating what to serve for dinner.</p><p>Black rubbed at the golden stubble on his jaw. \u201cThat would put him out of his misery. A good deed on our parts.\u201d</p><p>Kane wanted to help him with the answer. Hell, yeah, you should kill me. Because when this numbness wore off, when his body shrieked with the pain and his mind merged with his emotions, he was going to suffer. He was going to scream. He was going to rage.</p><p>Vengeance, he told himself. He could not have vengeance if he was dead.</p><p>\u201cNo, no killing,\u201d Black finally decided. \u201cNot until I\u2019ve had my turn inside his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Then they would kill him a week from now, after Black had his turn. Seven days. Kane didn\u2019t know whether to laugh, thank them or just go ahead and start screaming and raging now.</p><p>The two freed him from the chains, but he didn\u2019t have the strength to move. He could only lie there, waiting, helpless to their whims.</p><p>\u201cGreen is going to rip into us for saving him,\u201d Red said. \u201cYou know how protective he is of White.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue that.\u201d Black hefted Kane over his shoulder, unmindful of his exposed rib cage. \u201cShe\u2019s the only female he can tolerate.\u201d</p><p>The action disrupted some of the physical numbness, shooting sharp lances of pain through him. His mind began to fog, oxygen a faraway dream.</p><p>\u201cBut by then,\u201d Black continued, as Kane faded...faded... \u201cI will have had my turn, so that is a moot point.\u201d</p><p>Kane didn\u2019t hear Red\u2019s reply. For him, it was finally, blessedly lights-out.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>HIGH IN THE HEAVENS, Cronus stood at the foot of his bed, glaring down at his wife. She was still naked, still chained, but with two words, she had just changed the very foundation of their war.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Surely he had misheard.</p><p>Her chin lifted haughtily, her eyes a shimmer of midnight hatred. \u201cBeat me and let him go.\u201d</p><p>No, he had not misheard. His narrowed gaze shot to the male Hunter kneeling at his feet. Cronus had come here, as he\u2019d come here every day for the past few weeks, and offered Rhea the choice. Watch a Hunter die or feel the hammer of his fists. Or in this case, watch two Hunters die\u2014a male and the female who had refused to release him as Cronus dragged him from the cage. Always she preferred to watch a Hunter die. Always.</p><p>Except today.</p><p>What had changed? The Hunter in question? He was the only variable that was different. Did that mean she cared for the male? No, he assured himself after a heartbeat of bewilderment. Rhea cared only for herself. Did he mean something to her heavenly campaign? But what could a lone puny human do to aid a goddess? The answer was simple. Nothing.</p><p>That left only one option. She desired him.</p><p>Rage unfurled inside Cronus, iron fists that battered at his chest. His skin pulled tight against his bones, his marrow sharpening into dagger points and cutting at him. He gripped the human by the hair, jerking him to his feet and studying him anew. Late twenties, blond, handsome in a quiet, distinguished way only a mortal with a limited amount of time could manage. Lean, with only the barest hint of muscle.</p><p>Clearly, he wasn\u2019t a fighter. A scholar, perhaps. There could be no asking him, however. Like all the others, Cronus had already cut out his tongue. A must for these meetings. Allowing someone to speak to Rhea, to deliver a secret message Cronus could not decipher, would have been a huge tactical error.</p><p>Cronus never made tactical errors.</p><p>He looked at his wife. Her stubborn expression gave nothing away.</p><p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d she said, chin going ever higher. \u201cI\u2019ve made my choice. I will be beaten in exchange for his life.\u201d</p><p>Let the male go? Alive and well, forgiven for his crimes against the greatest king Titania has ever known? The concept was inconceivable. Laughable. \u201cAnd the female?\u201d he snarled, tugging her hair to lift her head.</p><p>She whimpered, her obvious distress causing the male to grunt. How sweet, Cronus thought dryly. The humans cared for each other.</p><p>Eyes the color of a blood-soaked battlefield swept over the girl. \u201cI don\u2019t care about her. Do whatever you wish with her, just let the male go.\u201d</p><p>Rhea\u2019s demon must be giving her fits. Either that, or Strife simply enjoyed the show. Well, it would be Cronus\u2019s pleasure to offer another blast of discord. \u201cI do not approve of your choice, wife. Therefore, I think I will behead the man before I release him.\u201d</p><p>The queen sputtered for a moment, her chains rattling against the bedposts. \u201cAre you completely lacking in honor, husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. To win, one must do whatever is necessary. Besides that, I never promised to let your Hunters go while their hearts still beat, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wish to save this one, you will tell me what\u2019s so special about him. That is our new bargain.\u201d</p><p>The male quaked with fear, his clammy sweat creating an acrid scent in the air. The female, still kneeling at Cronus\u2019s other side, reached for him, clasped his hand in a show of comfort and support. Her hair was cropped to her shoulders, and so black the tint had to have come from a bottle. Her eyes were brown, a deep chocolate, and filled with anguished tears. She was pretty in a delicate sort of way, and somehow familiar to him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the first female he\u2019d brought to Rhea, nor would she be the last. There were several others waiting below in the dungeon. Now he wondered if he\u2019d slain a sibling of hers, a sister perhaps, and that was why he thought he recognized her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExplaining my reasons was never part of our bargain,\u201d Rhea said in that haughty voice of hers, the one he loathed. The one guaranteed to make him see red. \u201cLet. Him. Go.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Cronus\u2019s rage intensified. He returned his attention to the male. Shadows formed half circles under his eyes, his cheeks were hollowed out and there was blood dripping down his chin, all proof of his mortality.</p><p>Had Rhea once welcomed him into her bed? Was this man one of the many Cronus had felt his wife enjoying these past few months? Had this bastard climaxed inside her?</p> <p>When her passions came upon her, she become wild and wanton, and unaware of\u2014or unconcerned by\u2014the damage she inflicted.</p><p>Each new deliberation tossed another smoldering log onto the fires of his rage, until the only thing inside his body was thick, black smoke with crimson flames trapped throughout. He couldn\u2019t see past them, could only choke on them. And only then did he realize that it was not the human who was quaking with such intensity; it was him, and the knowledge humiliated him.</p><p>The human had to pay.</p><p>\u201cLook at me. Now.\u201d</p><p>Long golden-brown lashes lifted. Eyes filled with challenge and hatred stared up at him. Resentment, too. Did this human yearn for what he himself possessed? A connection to Rhea?</p> <p>Well, that ended now. Before Cronus realized he had moved, he\u2019d released the girl, palmed a blade\u2014and slashed. He watched as the man\u2019s throat split in the center, blood welling and flowing. Watched as pain took the place of the resentment...watched as even that dulled...faded...and his body sagged.</p><p>The girl screamed, the shrill noise scraping at his ears, annoying him. Frowning down at her, intending to reprimand her, he uncurled his fingers from the man\u2019s hair and reached for her. Thump. The lifeless body hit the floor, and she released another scream, darting out of his way.</p><p>Not before he caught Rhea\u2019s gasp of horror.</p><p>His attention whipped to her, the girl suddenly forgotten. His wife had just gasped. Misery was to be her only companion in the countless eternity that awaited her, yes, but the fact that she\u2019d dared to find that misery in the demise of some frail mortal failed to fill him with any kind of satisfaction.</p><p>Such a reaction meant he\u2019d miscalculated, that she had, indeed, cared for the man. Even as his temper flared all the hotter, he struggled with understanding. Why care for a creature so limited by time and capability? A creature so fragile, so easily killed. As he had just demonstrated.</p><p>The black-haired wench scrambled to the body of the fallen male and gathered him close. She cried, her tears a flood of emotion. Obviously, she had cared for the man, too. But...why? What had he done to draw two women\u2019s loyalty?</p> <p>Cronus\u2019s lip curled up in a snarl. The answer didn\u2019t matter, not really. The bastard was gone now, never to return. \u201cLet him go,\u201d he commanded the girl.</p><p>She looked up at him, hatred shining in her eyes. She carefully laid the body upon the floor, pressed a kiss to his forehead and stood. Her steps clipped, measured, she approached Cronus, horrible sounds of grief rising from her.</p><p>Had he not taken her tongue, curses would have been hurled at him, he was sure. But she could not blame him for her lack. He had given her a choice. Return to the cage and die another day, or stay with the man, lose her tongue and die on this one. She\u2019d chosen to stay.</p><p>\u201cI am not a monster,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pair of you sanctioned the wrong side of the war, and you paid for it.\u201d One thing he\u2019d learned while whiling away the centuries inside Tartarus: a king without a firm hand was a king without a throne.</p><p>What came next was expected. She threw herself against him, her fists pummeling at him, her fury and heartache infusing every blow. He didn\u2019t try to defend himself. There was no need. Did she truly think she was hurting him? That she could hurt him?</p><p>A resounding no to both, yet her relentless effort soon aggravated him. He had better things to do. \u201cStop, female.\u201d</p><p>Either she didn\u2019t hear him or she didn\u2019t care to obey. He set her away from him, a concession on his part, and one he did not often offer, but she just came back, a catapult of feminine ire. He could have frozen her in place with a wave of his hand, but he refused to venture down that path. Pride dictated she obey of her own accord or suffer the consequences.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to die, too?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Somehow the question reached past her mania, and she stilled, a whisper of emotion-charged air separating their bodies. Panting breaths sawed in and out of her mouth, those heart-wrenching tears continuing to flow.</p><p>What came next was not expected.</p><p>With a cry springing from the depths of her soul, she threw herself into his blade. Her eyes widened with her pain; blood gurgled from her mouth. His blade. Oh, yes. He still clutched the hilt, the sharp, silver tip facing her\u2014now inside her.</p><p>She did indeed want to die.</p><p>\u201cVery well, female. Once again, I will support your choice.\u201d A tug of his arm, and she was freed from the intrusion. A flick of his wrist, and he killed her the same way he\u2019d killed her man. Quick, easy. A mercy slaying, he told himself.</p><p>Her eyes rolled back in her head as her body slumped beside her man\u2019s.</p><p>A long moment passed in silence. Something burned in his chest. Regret, perhaps. Though why he would feel such a strong emotion for someone he did not know and did not care about was a mystery. Violence walked hand in hand with victory. In the heavens, you could not have one without the other.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d Rhea said, and there was no longer a hint of remorse in her tone. No anger or betrayal, either. \u201cMy compliments on a job well done, darling.\u201d</p><p>He spun to face her. He was not met with tears, recrimination or even sorrow. He was met with glee. Lips he\u2019d once kissed with reverence lifted in a smug grin. \u201cHow did that feel, murdering two innocents?\u201d</p><p>He schooled his expression to blankness, unwilling to reveal his confusion. \u201cWhy so haughty, wife? It is your man bleeding all over my carpet, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not.\u201d She arched a brow at his flinching response. \u201cDo you think I know not our prophecies? How it will be my Galen to take your head\u2014unless you bind him to the female with wings of midnight.\u201d</p><p>He wiped his blade on the coverlet at Rhea\u2019s feet, a stark reminder of his prowess. One she would be forced to see for the rest of her stay here. \u201cIf your Galen takes my head, you die, as well.\u201d</p><p>Laughter layered with ice left her, causing a chill to crawl down his spine. \u201cI know.\u201d And she didn\u2019t sound as if she cared. \u201cI also know how your mind works. You expect Galen to want to use the winged girl and her new demon, but you doubt he will desire the girl herself. How, then, could you force a bonding? Let me think, let me think. Oh, yes, I know. By turning her into a walking fountain of ambrosia and addicting Galen to her blood. How am I doing so far?\u201d</p><p>Not since Zeus ambushed him and drove him to his knees had Cronus experienced such fear. \u201cShut your mouth. You know nothing!\u201d</p><p>Rhea continued on, her voice a silky caress. \u201cYou could not infect a living girl with ambrosia; you could only infect a dead one. And who better to pick than someone the Lord of Sex desired? He will convince his friends to leave her alone, and she will convince him to leave Galen alone. Finally, peace will reign and your head will be safe. Yes? That\u2019s what you believe, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>His heart slammed against his ribs. \u201cWrong,\u201d he croaked. \u201cYou are so wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you disgrace us both with your lie. Did you think I would have no idea what was predicted all those centuries ago?\u201d</p><p>Remaining silent, he once again schooled his features, unwilling to give her any more of a reaction.</p><p>\u201cAnd did you truly think I would do nothing when I learned you\u2019d given the demon of Wrath to a dead human girl, and she was growing wings of midnight?\u201d Another grin, devious in its joy. \u201cWell, what I did, husband, was learn everything I could about her. About her missing sister, Skye, and Skye\u2019s mate. The two people you just killed.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed as he digested her claim. When he did, he stumbled backward, shaking his head vehemently. \u201cNo. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I allowed you to capture me, hmm? Why do you think I allowed you to capture my people? How else do you think your spies learned where they were hiding? I have been waiting for just this day. The day you brought about your own ruin, the day you realized that because you carry the All-Key inside of you, I do, as well. Think your Sienna will aid you now?\u201d</p><p>With that, Rhea vanished from the bed, the chains that had bound her thudding onto the vacant mattress.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>LEGION PACED HER BEDROOM floor as if her feet were on fire. The Lords had already left the fortress, destination Rome, determined to find and kill Galen, thereby saving Ashlyn and the babies. That they hadn\u2019t come for her...she knew they\u2019d never once considered trading her.</p><p>They were that honorable.</p><p>How did Legion repay them? By hiding herself away. And because of her actions, Ashlyn would suffer.</p><p>Sweet, sweet Ashlyn. What was Galen doing to her? If he hurt her the way the demons had hurt Legion... Stomach rebelling, she raced to her bathroom and hunched over the toilet. As many times as she\u2019d thrown up the past day\u2014week?\u2014she was surprised when her lungs remained in her chest. Surprised, and disappointed.</p><p>She wanted to die. She would rather die than go through another pawing, having hands rip at her clothing, having things...done...to... \u201cArgh!\u201d She cut off the venomous thoughts before they could fully form. One unbidden image and she would collapse, hysterical, useless for days to come.</p><p>With a shuddering sigh, she rested her temple on the lid of the toilet. That beautiful blonde minor goddess had asked her a question. Who did she love most? The men who had saved her, or herself? Finally she copped to the answer. The men, definitely. They could have left her in hell, but they\u2019d come for her, rescued her. She owed them. But...if she gave herself to Galen, he would torture her. She\u2019d poisoned him, after all. Had tried to kill him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He would expect her to warm his bed. She knew that. Before she had poisoned him, she had slept with him. Her first time with a man, and she had liked it, had craved more, until...</p><p>She gulped, once again forcing her mind to blank.</p><p>If she went to Galen, she would willingly place herself in another version of hell. But then, that\u2019s what sacrificing yourself meant, didn\u2019t it? Enduring pain so that someone else wouldn\u2019t have to.</p> <p>That\u2019s what the warriors had done for her, time and time again. Could she really do any less for them?</p><p>A shudder of revulsion worked through her, and she closed her eyes. She was decided, then. She would go to Galen. She would trade herself for Ashlyn.</p><p>There was no other way, no other choice.</p><p>And now that the decision was made, she had only to close her eyes and think of him, and she would appear before him. The Lords had forgotten that, like Lucien, she could move from one location to another with only a thought. Only difference was, she didn\u2019t have to follow a spiritual trail. Once she knew someone, she could appear before him anytime, anyplace.</p><p>Someone knocked on her door gently, as if afraid to startle her. She sniffed the air, recognized the sky-drenched scent of Danika, Reyes\u2019s woman. She must have come to talk to her. Probably meant to reassure her that she was protected and safe, that no one thought to use her as Bait.</p> <p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cNo, I need to\u2014 Wait. You\u2019re speaking. You\u2019re speaking to me. It\u2019s been so long\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said go away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegion, let me in. Please. I need to talk to you. Need to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d she whispered, knowing she had to leave now or she would lose her nerve. Knowing she would never return. After the trade, after Ashlyn was safely returned, she would kill herself. She would rather die than be touched.</p><p>She pictured Galen\u2014blond, beautiful and wicked. A moment later, the floor beneath her fell away.</p> <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>SIENNA RIGHTED THE CLOTHING Cronus had given her when he\u2019d first brought her to the castle. The shirt fit around her arms while tucking under her wings without having to wrap around the tops and drape over her shoulders. No fuss, no strain, but complete coverage. She was shaking.</p><p>What she\u2019d just done with Paris...she\u2019d never experienced anything like it. Not even with him. Nothing could have prepared her for the total body awakening. He\u2019d pleasured her with soul-shattering thoroughness, had known exactly where to touch her, how to kiss her, what to say to ramp her desire up, up, oh, sweet heaven, up. She\u2019d been completely into him, her mind focused on him, the rest of the world forgotten.</p><p>And yet, as beautiful as the loving had been, they were now, half an hour later, steeped in all kinds of awkward. For her, that had been way more emotional and meaningful than she\u2019d been equipped to handle, and she had to wonder. Was it always like that for him, with everyone?</p><p>\u201cSo, uh, did being with me work?\u201d she asked, then wished she could swallow her tongue, both dreading and excited about the answer. \u201cFor your demon?\u201d</p><p>He nodded as he sat at the edge of the spring. \u201cYes. I\u2019m strong now.\u201d</p><p>Despite the affirmation, her dread increased. He\u2019d closed off his expression, hiding his feelings behind a blank mask.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to use a weapon?\u201d he asked abruptly. And clearly, that was the end of the demon conversation.</p> <p>O-kay. So they weren\u2019t going to talk about what had happened. Which meant they wouldn\u2019t be talking about what came next in their relationship.</p><p>Two days does not a relationship make, idiot.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of weapon?\u201d Dumb question. Whatever he said, the answer was the same.</p><p>\u201cAny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. When Wrath overtakes me, he kills using my body or whatever\u2019s available. I\u2019m never aware when he does it\u2014it\u2019s only after the fact that the memories flood me\u2014so the skills aren\u2019t something I\u2019ve retained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about before your possession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was always a behind-the-scenes girl.\u201d Oh, damn. Why\u2019d she have to go and mention the one thing sure to turn him into Mr. Distant? Or rather, Mr. Way More Distant.</p><p>But he surprised her. He showed her a small handgun thingy, then how to flip the safety. He released the clip, revealed the bullets and taught her how to put everything back together. \u201cAll you do is point and tap the trigger,\u201d he said. \u201cHollow points will do enough damage to whatever you\u2019re aiming at, no matter where you hit.\u201d</p><p>And what about when she missed, which was a very real possibility? Because just thinking about holding the gun made her hands shake. \u201cSo, you want me to buy one and carry it, like, all the time?\u201d She\u2019d never, in all her life or death, fired one.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He leaned over and stuffed the metal in the waist of her pants. Cold, heavier than she would have guessed. \u201cI want you to carry this one. The safety\u2019s on, so you won\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid I\u2019ll shoot you in the back?\u201d The joke fell flat, their relationship\u2014or whatever\u2014too new, and she blushed</p><p>Of course, he surprised her yet again. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d Utter confidence coated the words.</p><p>Relief swept through her. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cDo I have your full attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d And right then she knew, reality crashing into her hard enough to hurt. This was his way of saying goodbye. His way of preparing her to live without him. Her knees threatened to buckle, but she managed to remain upright. \u201cYes,\u201d she reiterated.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now listen up, and listen well.\u201d His gaze drilled into hers. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of research about the living dead. If anyone threatens you, that means the person can see you. And if he can see you, he and his weapons will be solid to you. I won\u2019t remind you about the men out there, how they saw you and would have been able to touch you. If they can touch you, that means you can touch them. So you need to act first, and think about it later. That means you shoot the culprits without hesitation. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Moving on.\u201d Next he withdrew a crystal blade. He stretched out his free hand and motioned her closer.</p><p>One step, two, until she was at his knee. Apparently, though, that wasn\u2019t good enough. He latched on to her hip and dragged her between the deep vee of his legs. Though he wasn\u2019t in a sexual mood, the touch excited her all over again.</p><p>He forced her to curl her fingers around the hilt, those ocean-blues grave. \u201cIf someone gets in your grille, they deserve what they get. Go for vitals, where they\u2019re soft and you don\u2019t have to worry about cutting through bone. Like here.\u201d He moved her hand to his side, laying the blade flat a few inches above his hip. \u201cAnd here.\u201d He moved her hand to the ropes of his stomach.</p><p>Touching him there reminded her of just how hungry she was, and not just for his body, causing her own stomach to growl. Her cheeks heated all over again. Was she cursed to always embarrass herself in front of this man?</p><p>His beautiful lips curled into the semblance of a smile. \u201cStill haven\u2019t eaten, huh?\u201d</p><p>Though a mere shadow of what it could be, that half smile lit up his entire face, dialing \u201cbeautiful\u201d to \u201cexquisite.\u201d She, too, lit up, her nerve endings pulsating. Gulping back her always increasing desire, she nodded. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed. He cursed. \u201cThis goes against what few morals I have left.\u201d Frowning, he released her to dig around in his pockets. He withdrew a plastic baggie filled with dark purple powder.</p><p>\u201cWhat does?\u201d Holding her? Giving her weapons? Now that she was aware of her hunger, the pains started up, her blood heating to the point of boiling, her skin shrinking over her bones.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about it, and you\u2019ll be fine.</p><p>He set the baggie aside, stared at it for several minutes, and released a ragged breath.</p><p>Wanting to give him time to come to grips with whatever was bothering him, she studied the knife he\u2019d given her. The crystal blade was jagged, rainbow shards trapped under the clear exterior. The handle was a dull copper, solid, and warm with his body heat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you never will again. There are only two in the world, and I\u2019ve got the other one. That baby will kill anything, even a god of this world, and do whatever you command, as long as it\u2019s in your hand. Like, if you need to hide it, grip it and think invisible.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and her jaw dropped. \u201cI can\u2019t accept this. The two are obviously a matched set and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me.\u201d His tone was hard, uncompromising. He withdrew a small flask from his other pocket, picked up the plastic baggie and dumped half of its contents inside.</p><p>She\u2019d told him where she was going when they parted, and who she would be with. He had clearly forgotten, or he would be insisting she give the crystal back and pretend she\u2019d never seen it.</p><p>\u201cParis, listen to me. I\u2019m going after the leader of the Hunters. Do you understand what I\u2019m telling you? You can\u2019t risk something like this falling into enemy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t say another word right now. I\u2019ve decided you\u2019re not going near that psycho, and that\u2019s that, so just take the knife and say thank you.\u201d He swirled the liquid in the flask before lifting the small round rim to her lips. \u201cNow drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve decided? You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>She had no choice but to obey; he\u2019d already begun pouring the contents down her throat. And sweet heaven, she loved the taste. A diluted version of what Cronus gave her, but delicious all the same. She gulped back one mouthful, then another and another, the warmth sliding into her, dancing through her, easing her pain faster than a blink.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d He removed the flask before she could start licking at any stray droplets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She moaned her disappointment, then closed her eyes for a moment and savored. Her skin plumped back up, and wow, she could have floated away on a cloud of bliss, forever lost.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that stuff, anyway?\u201d Cronus had never told her.</p><p>\u201cAmbrosia.\u201d</p><p>Huh. A substance consumed by the immortals, she recalled reading, used for pleasure and the reaffirmation of power. As she now knew, myths often misled, straight-up lied or barely touched upon the truth. \u201cWhy do I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. No questions about this particular subject right now.\u201d He hooked the flask to one of her belt loops and tucked the baggie carefully in her pocket. \u201cWhen you feel yourself going into withdra\u2014I mean, when you feel yourself getting weak, take a few swigs. You\u2019ll perk right up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d</p><p>He met her gaze, the blue of his eyes frosting over in seconds, turning the ocean into a river of glass. \u201cYou said you could go a week with what Cronus brought you, right?\u201d</p><p>So. She couldn\u2019t question him, but he could question her? She could have refused to answer, or demanded they trade answers. She didn\u2019t. \u201cYes.\u201d The change in him upset her, and she wouldn\u2019t add to his obvious stress.</p><p>\u201cWhat you just drank should last a few days.\u201d He gripped her forearms and shook her. \u201cI need you to listen to my next words. If you retain nothing else I say, retain this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she repeated, tensing as his anxiety bled into her.</p><p>\u201cNever, under any circumstances, are you to allow someone to taste your blood. Do you understand? They do, and you are to kill them before they can escape you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would want to taste my blood?\u201d Humans? Impossible. They couldn\u2019t see her or even sense her. Vampires? Maybe. The nocturnal creatures existed, but they wanted everyone\u2019s blood. Why target a ghost of a woman?</p><p>A muscle ticked in Paris\u2019s jaw, a sign of his growing anger. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. Now promise me. Promise me you\u2019ll kill anyone who does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d Her hands fluttered to his shoulders, an offering of comfort. He was trying to tell her something without freaking her out. She knew it, sensed it. Trying to protect her, even though they were destined to part.</p><p>He released her to shove his hair off his brow. There were dark smudges on his fingers, she saw. Wanting to help him, even in so small a way, she took one of his hands and rubbed at the inklike spots. They remained. She frowned.</p> <p>\u201cThey won\u2019t come off. They\u2019re tattoos,\u201d he explained, no inflection in his voice. He\u2019d gone very still, had even stopped breathing at her first touch.</p><p>Why would he tattoo smudges on his fingertips? Her eyes met his, a tangle of confusion and an ever-present desire. She ignored the first and concentrated on the latter, lifting the tip of his finger to her mouth and sucking.</p><p>His pupils did their pulsing thing, stretching, snapping back into place, stretching again. The scent of dark chocolate and expensive champagne drifted from him, enveloping her, fogging her thoughts, electrifying her already sensitized nerves. She bit his pad lightly, and a hoarse groan left him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any children?\u201d she asked, then had to fight a wave of sadness. I can\u2019t. Never again. To distract herself, she sucked his finger deeper than before, swirling her tongue at the root and sliding the appendage out with a pop.</p><p>The sudden topic switch didn\u2019t faze him. \u201cNo. I always know when a woman is...I mean, Sex knows, and he wants her that much more, but impregnating a stranger is one of two things I\u2019ve never let him force me to do.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted to the side. \u201cWhat\u2019s the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie with someone under the age of consent.\u201d</p><p>How vigilantly he must have to fight for such concessions. She knew firsthand how powerful a demon\u2019s compulsions could be. \u201cDo you want them? Children, I mean. One day, with a woman you love?\u201d Stop this. It\u2019s too painful.</p> <p>He offered a casual shrug, or tried to. The lifting of his shoulder was stiff, jerky. \u201cI want you, here and now,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me have you. One more time before we head out.\u201d</p><p>One more time, a thought as arousing as it was depressing. Refusal, however, was not an option. She hadn\u2019t lied earlier. She would take him however she could get him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A slight whistling behind her, a cold splash through her, and then Paris\u2019s entire body jerked. His eyes widened, and his hands fell from her. He frowned, looked down. A blade hilt protruded from his chest.</p><p>Sienna screamed and whipped around, using her own body as a shield for his. Except, one blade had already gone through her, as if she were nothing more substantial than mist. For whoever had thrown the weapon, she wasn\u2019t. He could not see the dead, nor touch the dead, so neither could his blade.</p><p>The culprit was a large\u2014really large\u2014guy with pink hair and tattooed teardrops of blood under one of his eyes. He stood in the entrance of the cavern.</p><p>His punked-out features blazed with hatred. \u201cHow\u2019s that for not fighting fair?\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Paris shoved her behind him, and she stumbled from the force he used, falling into the water and sputtering. Her heart raced out of control as the two men slashed each other with their eyes. A physical slashing would follow, no question. Both were familiar with the dance of death, an undeniable truth as they got into position.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find me? You know what, never mind. I don\u2019t care. You tossed that dagger at my woman. For that I\u2019m taking your throwing hand.\u201d With a tug and a grimace, Paris removed the blade from his chest. His eyes glowed bright red, casting a crimson spotlight on the man he clearly wanted splayed on the chopping block.</p><p>\u201cYour woman?\u201d A snort, a sneer. The newcomer reached up and slid two serrated blades from a crisscross at his back. \u201cWhat woman? It\u2019s just you and me, demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a flying flip that you can\u2019t see her.\u201d The words emerged on a growl, more animal than human. \u201cShe\u2019s mine, and you brought violence to her door. For that, you\u2019re losing your balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? Well, I say you hurt me over my woman, so now I\u2019ll hurt you over yours.\u201d He grinned without humor, metal glistening and whistling as he twirled the hilts.</p><p>\u201cDoubtful.\u201d Paris clasped the other crystal blade.</p><p>Another snort. \u201cIf you want to walk out of here alive, you\u2019ll tell me where my goddess is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who likes more pain and less talking, right?\u201d Paris said. \u201cCome on, then. Come get your pain.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, they were on each other. They fought faster than she could track. What she caught, like clicks of a camera: the pause as Paris pinned the punk, his boot coming down on a throat. The horrible suspension as a blade arched toward Paris\u2019s midsection. The heart-stopper of hope as Paris swung for a knee, connected. The terrifying beat of time as Paris hit the ground, his opponent snarling on top of him.</p><p>And what followed that was a ballet of hammering fists and kicks with enough vigor to snap bones. Knees going for sensitive places. Teeth ripping. Claws tearing. Metal clanging. They slammed into walls, rolled around on the floor, hacked at each other. Blood splattered in every direction. Never had she seen anything more brutal.</p><p>They wielded their blades beautifully, horrifically. Annnd yes, as promised, there went the newcomer\u2019s throwing hand. Blood sprayed anew. That didn\u2019t stop him from launching at Paris and going for Beat Each Other Senseless, round two.</p><p>So badly Sienna wanted to take out her new gun and fire, but the two were tangled together, and she was afraid she would shoot Paris. Having joked about nailing him in the back, she was now faced with the very real possibility and couldn\u2019t risk it. More than that, the bullet probably wouldn\u2019t hurt the punk, would probably soar right through him the way his blade had soared through her.</p><p>So...what could she do? Unsure, but knowing her current position helped no one, she slogged her way out of the water and stood. A cold blast of air hit her, making her shiver so vehemently her teeth rattled and ice crystals formed on her skin. A second later, the angel Zacharel towered in front of her.</p><p>\u201cStop them,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>His green eyes were hard, unflinching and totally focused on her. \u201cCome. We will leave them to their battle.\u201d</p><p>Her impromptu swim must have waterlogged her ears. She could not have heard him correctly. \u201cCome with you, as in leave Paris behind?\u201d Weren\u2019t the two men friends?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He waved his fingers with definite impatience. \u201cYou grasped my meaning correctly. Paris would prefer you not be around such violence, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care. I\u2019m staying.\u201d Warriors like him and Paris were unfamiliar with denial, and took every measure of resistance as a challenge, she was learning. Before this one could leap at her, she held her hands up, palms out, and backed away from him.</p><p>Cowardly, perhaps, but effective. He frowned at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying, and that\u2019s final,\u201d she added.</p><p>Paris sensed the new threat and unleashed an unholy roar. He dove on Zacharel, knocking the robed warrior down. The angel didn\u2019t shove him off. Didn\u2019t touch him in any way, in fact, and yet Paris propelled across the cavern and slammed into the opposite wall.</p><p>The pink-haired punk was on him a second later, the fight speeding into a new level of ferocity. But through it all, Paris never dropped the blade that had done a meet and greet with his heart. He cozied the tip, and then the hilt, up to those extra-special soft spots in the guy\u2019s side and stomach, just as he\u2019d showed her.</p><p>A pain-filled grunt, a black curse. Then the guy was slumping over and Paris was whipping back around, his crimson sights once again on Zacharel\u2014who was now standing beside Sienna.</p><p>With a gasp, she skirted around the spring, creating as much distance between them as possible. \u201cBack off, angel boy.\u201d</p><p>Black brows winged into his hairline. \u201cHardly, demon girl. I do this to save you, to save thousands of others.\u201d</p><p>Uh, what now?</p><p>\u201cWalk to me, Sienna.\u201d Paris was panting, bleeding, shaking, and the crazy, animalistic glaze hadn\u2019t left him. \u201cNow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With every fiber of her being, she wanted to run rather than walk to him. And she would have, if the angel hadn\u2019t said, \u201cI cannot let her do that, demon,\u201d and appeared at her side in the next blink, taking hold of her wrist and locking down.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>OH, HELL, NO, PARIS THOUGHT. Two pansy wingers\u2014one of them practicing, one of them fallen\u2014were not gonna get the drop on him. He hadn\u2019t killed the fallen, not yet, he\u2019d just hurt the guy a little. Or a lot. Whatever. Now he wanted the bastard to suffer for a long damn time.</p> <p>His need to protect Sienna burned hot. The fact that the fallen had interrupted their sexual play, the fact that someone other than himself had seen her delicate features overcome with desire, were reasons to kill. Savagely.</p><p>Zacharel he actually kind of liked, but that didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d tolerate interference in this matter. Only thing going for him right now was the fact that Sex was either asleep or hiding, and thankfully had no opinion.</p><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d he snarled. He was losing blood fast, his chest like a waterspout that had sprung a leak. Hurt like a son of a bitch, and he knew he\u2019d go down sooner or later. He was determined to make it later, when Sienna was safe.</p><p>The angel gave a single shake of his head. \u201cYour temper is too fierce.\u201d</p><p>So the hell what? \u201cI\u2019ve got myself under control.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you really?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cI said I did, didn\u2019t I? So let her go before I make you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy taking my hand? My balls, as you told the fallen?\u201d A pregnant pause, anger fighting to be freed from a man who clearly denied his emotions\u2014but couldn\u2019t fully suppress them. One day he would erupt, no question. \u201cWhat will you do to yourself when you accidentally hurt your female?\u201d</p><p>One stomping step, two. \u201cBack off. Now.\u201d The darkness inside him was so deeply rooted, he knew the stuff had moved in and set up shop and he\u2019d never get rid of it, even when he and Sienna parted. Especially when they parted. Already he was going to sink into despair when he lost her, and if he allowed himself to relax with her, to like her that much more, he would only drag her down with him. That\u2019s why he\u2019d fought his emotions so hard after having sex with her.</p><p>Now he was glad for that. If he had to murder the angel, he would, and the darkness would be shooting out happies over the deed rather than remorse.</p><p>\u201cYour darkness,\u201d Zacharel said.</p> <p>\u201cYou reading my mind?\u201d The invasion would cost him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the angel replied, saving his life. \u201cYour eyes. The darkness is there. Do you know what it is, warrior? Do you know what you play with? No? Well, allow me to explain. As a human body can grow a child, a demonic one can grow evil. That is what you have done. You have allowed your demon to birth another demon, for lack of a better word. This one is all yours, your baby, and like the other possessing you, he will never leave you.\u201d</p><p>Should have surprised him, didn\u2019t. Shouldn\u2019t have angered him further, did. Sienna had heard those damning words. \u201cUnless you want a personal introduction, you better step away from my woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d she said, sadness dripping from her tone.</p><p>Sadness rather than anger, leaving him confused. Whatever. If she tried to tell him that she wasn\u2019t his woman, that this second demon\u2014or whatever it was\u2014was a deal breaker, he\u2019d lose it. When he had to let her go, fine, whatever, he\u2019d reevaluate and dial back the possessiveness. But here? Now? There\u2019d be no dialing back. He\u2019d just pounded inside her, had just come inside her, branded her, and he still had her decadent taste in his mouth. She\u2019d cried his name, had wanted more, and would have given him more.</p><p>\u201cI still have your present,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cShould I... Do you want me to...use it? I thought he was your friend, but...\u201d</p><p>He blinked. She would stab the angel? For him? The thought probably shouldn\u2019t have cranked up his desire for her, but it did. And that she would do this after hearing Zacharel\u2019s condemnation of him was heartwarming.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Behind him, he heard the punk lumber to his feet. His hand tightened on his weapon.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zacharel said, stopping him. At last he released Sienna. \u201cThe red is receding from your eyes. That is good. You will not hurt the girl now. Therefore I will take the fallen elsewhere and return later. As for you, you will head for the doorway leading out of this realm.\u201d He vanished a moment later, the fallen going with him though Zacharel had never touched him.</p><p>As if his presence had been the only thing keeping Paris upright, he collapsed, toppling to his knees. Sienna rushed to his side and eased him the rest of the way down. Thick black spiderwebs wove through his line of vision. Any moment, and he\u2019d sink into unconsciousness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you. I won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to say what he now needed to say, didn\u2019t want to spoil what had happened before with what had to happen now. He\u2019d been here, in this very situation, a thousand times before. Injured and fading\u2014with only one way to heal.</p><p>\u201cI have to... You have to... Sex, I need sex.\u201d</p><p>His demon was all over that, torpedoing out of hiding to shoot blood into his cock. Happened so fast, Paris suspected the demon would battle whiplash for days. This was uncharted territory, though. Until Sienna, he\u2019d never been with the same woman twice. Now that he had, he knew it would keep him level, strong, but would being with her more than once actually mend his body?</p><p>\u201cSex? But you\u2019re in no condition for that. You should rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo resting. I hate that it has to be this way, but I can\u2019t change it.\u201d When he was injured like this, he needed full-on, hard-core sex with as many different partners as possible. But even if a hundred beauties had surrounded him, he\u2019d still only have wanted the one looming over him, silent, her hands gentle as they explored his wounds. A woman he shouldn\u2019t trust, especially while he was like this, but one he couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, turn away from.</p><p>No matter what happened next.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Sienna. Ride me.\u201d</p><p>Only the slightest pause. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to beg me for anything, Paris,\u201d she said, using his own words to comfort him. \u201cI told you I\u2019d take care of you, and I will.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p>IF I EVER GET PARIS completely naked, Sienna thought wistfully as she unbuttoned and unzipped the black, flowing material of his pants, I\u2019ll probably spontaneously combust.</p><p>Not wanting to jar him, she stretched the fabric apart rather than tugging it down his legs, allowing the massive length of his shaft to spring free, just as he\u2019d done earlier. No man should be so beautiful all over, a study of hard strength and dark sexuality no matter where you looked.</p><p>He threw an arm over his face, hiding his features from view. \u201cI hate this.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been reaching for him, but now reared back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can find you someone else if you\u2019d rather\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he rushed out. He must have heard the horror and distress in her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t hate being with you, and I don\u2019t want anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Good, because she wasn\u2019t sure she could have followed through. Becoming his pimp would be a special kind of hell.</p><p>\u201cWhat I hate is that we\u2019re chasing something meaningful and organic with something clinical and mechanical. Something forced.\u201d</p><p>Her first thought: he\u2019d enjoyed the sex, too, and considered it meaningful. Joy careened through her, bright starbursts that warmed each of her cells. Her second thought: he was ashamed right now. The joy withered, cooled. They had so much working against them already, she couldn\u2019t allow him to add such an awful emotion to the mix.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not forcing me to do this, Paris. Before we were interrupted, I was wet. I\u2019m still wet.\u201d And she didn\u2019t mean from the water. \u201cWhy does this time have to be any less meaningful than the other when we were headed in this direction, anyway?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d groaned at wet. Now his arm fell away, and he peered up at her with those amazing eyes of searing azure. \u201cYou\u2019re so lovely.\u201d</p><p>When he looked at her like that, all heavy-lidded and dreamy, she felt lovely. \u201cLet me show you the rest of me.\u201d She pushed to her feet and disrobed, his gaze tracking her every movement.</p><p>Throughout the centuries, he had seen countless others naked. She knew that; she had seen them. He had been with tall women, short women, skinny, heavy, black, white and everything in between.</p><p>Sienna was nothing special, and yet, when he said, \u201cBeyond gorgeous,\u201d with a fine sheen of sweat dotting his brow, she believed him this time. He was right. Her demon would sense a lie. The joy returned.</p><p>\u201cI think the same about you,\u201d she admitted. Naked, emboldened by his praise, she straddled his hips and eased down. But she didn\u2019t impale herself on his thick length. Not yet. He needed the sex, and time was imperative, but he needed stroking more. Needed assurance that she was here, in this moment with him, all the way.</p><p>His arousal jutted out between her legs, her warmth all over it. She traced her fingers over the tip, and he sucked in a breath.</p><p>\u201cClimb up here and straddle my face,\u201d he croaked. His palms found her breasts and kneaded, rolling her beaded nipples through his fingers. \u201cI want to taste you again.\u201d</p><p>The desire to do just that nearly slayed her. Blood rushed through her veins at an alarming rate and heated dangerously, chasing away any lingering chill. \u201cI\u2019ll hurt you. My weight... Your chest is injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about this? I need to taste you again, and I don\u2019t care if my chest hurts.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cHow about this? I\u2019ll taste you.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, even seemed to stop breathing.</p><p>\u201cUnless you don\u2019t want me to,\u201d she hurried to assure him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d The words sawed from him, hoarse and throaty, more grit than substance. \u201cI haven\u2019t let anyone do that to me in more than a thousand years.\u201d He sucked in a breath. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not actually true. I let a slave perform the act on me on the journey here, and I hated every moment of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Bafflement widened her eyes. All men loved receiving oral sex. Right? So why had he stopped the women from sucking on him? And he\u2019d stopped them, she knew that he had. Every woman he\u2019d welcomed to his bed had probably wanted to fit her lips over that cock and drink him down.</p><p>\u201cBut you,\u201d he went on, still on edge. \u201cI will let you. If you want to.\u201d</p><p>She flattened her hands on his stomach, felt the cords of the muscles clench. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable or do something you don\u2019t like\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. You misunderstand.\u201d His shook his head, all that astounding hair performing a ballet around his temples. Strands of black and brown and gold she longed to fist. \u201cI didn\u2019t let the others do it because I was already using them and didn\u2019t want them doing me any more favors. And the only reason I let the slave was because I needed answers, and that was the fastest way to get them.\u201d</p><p>Answers about me.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sienna? The slave was...he was a male.\u201d</p><p>And that was not his preference. Sympathy washed through her. To have no control over your body and its reactions, to be forced to submit to a desire you yourself did not feel, had to be torture. \u201cJust so you know, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. And I won\u2019t be doing you a favor, Paris. You are a beautiful, charming, intelligent, sexy as hell man, and I\u2019m dying to have you. Just as you are. With all the others you were simply practicing for this moment,\u201d she said, hoping to tease him into seeing the truth of her claim. \u201cIn doing this, I\u2019ll be pleasuring us both. I hope. I mean, I have about as much experience with blow jobs as I do with sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m about to come my brains out. You\u2019ll be perfect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuiet. Sienna\u2019s not done putting you in your place.\u201d</p><p>A smile bloomed. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. But, uh, what\u2019s my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pedestal for the most admirable man I know. I don\u2019t care what you\u2019ve done, or who you\u2019ve done it with. You could have rampaged the entire world, could have raped viciously, constantly, but you don\u2019t. As for the sex of the slave, well, I hope you respect me in the morning, because I think you\u2019re even sexier now and I\u2019m going to be very upset if I don\u2019t get my turn.\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips. \u201cYou want a turn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than anything.\u201d</p><p>Already his hips were writhing underneath her, as if he were imagining her mouth on him, working him over. \u201cPlease, Sienna. Please, do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. But only if you\u2019ll like it.\u201d She shimmied down until her lips were poised over that beautiful erection. This is mine, she thought, dazed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll like it. I swear I\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find out for sure.\u201d Her tongue emerged, licking up and down his shaft, treating his length like a lollipop. Groan after groan left him, and she took that for approval. On her third upward glide, she fit her fingers around his base and her lips around the head. As she gloried in his flavor, her hand continued the erotic journey on his shaft.</p><p>Her wings arced down and around, the tips stroking his sides. For the first time, she understood the joy of having them. Surrounding him like this, she forgot about the rest of the world. Only they existed. Only the pleasure.</p><p>A curse roared from him as his hips jerked, thrusting him deeper. Immediately he apologized and backed off. \u201cMore. Please, more.\u201d He pounded his fists against the floor. \u201cI have to have more.\u201d</p><p>She sucked harder, tasting him deeper, savoring, then swallowed him down as far as she could go. He was too big and stretched her jaw, but she didn\u2019t care. His entire body shook with the force of his enjoyment. She never stopped working him with her hands, either, one doing the stroking, the other tugging at his testicles.</p><p>But then she started wondering what those tasted like and released his cock with a pop to run her tongue over the tightness of his sac. He enjoyed that, too, especially when she drew one, and then the other, into her mouth.</p><p>Would she ever get enough of this man?</p> <p>When he was shouting her name, she returned to the main event, taking him in, taking him down, his wild reaction spurring her on and on and on, her body lighting up, desperate for him, for all of him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close, baby, I\u2019m so close. If you don\u2019t want to taste me, you need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>In answer, she sucked him so hard her cheeks hollowed.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah!\u201d His hips jerked up, his muscles knotting on his bones, and a roar far louder than any that had come before ripped out of him. He jetted down her throat and she swallowed every drop, holding on until the very end, when he sank onto the ground, his panting breaths filling the entire enclosure.</p><p>\u201cRide me,\u201d he commanded in that voice full of gravel. \u201cI need to be in you. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now.\u201d She knew she had just repeated what he\u2019d said, again, but that rich scent was seeping from him, surrounding her, blinding her to everything but him. And this. Oh, sweet heaven, this.</p><p>She lifted, surprised to find that she was shaking. A quick glance, and she saw that his wounds were no longer bleeding, and the skin had even sewed itself back together. And despite his recent climax, he was still rock-hard and ready for her.</p><p>Once again she straddled him, and this time she took him in, all the way, until she was sitting on him, her ass resting on the backs of his thighs. Now she was the one to cry out. Like before, he stretched her, but it was such a good, burning stretch and she was so damn wet, so damn eager.</p><p>He clamped his fingers on the rise of her hips and moved her, up and down, his strength a shock. Because when he moved her down, he slammed her, forcing himself as deep as he could go, lifting himself up to meet her halfway.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he growled. \u201cLean down and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Even as she rocked on him, she obeyed, her chest smashing into his as she slanted her head and meshed their lips together. His tongue immediately shot inside her mouth, claiming her as his, owning her. His hands went to her back, sliding under those slits that housed her wings. It was as though he\u2019d put his fingers and his mouth on her clitoris at the same time, using his nose and his chin and his beard stubble, anything and everything to stimulate her to the fullest.</p><p>Release slammed through her with the same force Paris used. Wild exhilaration pumped through her, the pleasure so intense her nerve endings were electrified. Pinpricks of white behind her lids, fire in her veins. A storm of satisfaction through every inch of her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mean to, but she bit his lip until she tasted blood, and even that was a stimulant. Her nails dug into his scalp, holding him still for her abuse as she rode out the thunder and the lightning. But he didn\u2019t seem to mind, seemed to like it. One of his hands fell to her ass and pressed her down as he rose up, and then he was roaring, spurting inside her, sending her over the edge a second time.</p><p>When at last they calmed, they collapsed on the ground in a tangled heap of arms and legs, shaking together, gasping, desperate for air but not caring that they couldn\u2019t find it.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he panted.</p><p>\u201cYou liked?\u201d she replied when she found her voice.</p><p>\u201cWoman, you nearly killed me. I should be manning back up, putting us back on track, but I\u2019m completely blissed out.\u201d</p><p>So was she. Each time together was better than the last. \u201cI hope we do that a thousand times today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s an accurate guesstimate and not hyperbole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anything, I underestimated. You\u2019re very good with my wings.\u201d</p><p>She felt the warm stroke of a chuckle against her skin. \u201cI\u2019m not too rough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d A kiss at the cord that bound his shoulder to his neck, a scrape of her teeth. \u201cEver been with a winged woman before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...I...\u201d He hesitated, even as his skin prickled with heat beneath her mouth.</p><p>His shame had returned, and once again she experienced sympathy for all he\u2019d endured. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes. Was she an angel, like your friend?\u201d He needed to purge the memories and the feelings that accompanied them.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother yes. A demon, too?\u201d</p><p>Only the slightest pause. \u201cYeah.\u201d He ducked his head in the opposite direction, as bashful as a schoolboy.</p><p>Adorable. Just adorable. As strong as he was, as fierce as he was, he cared about her opinion. \u201cParis, it\u2019s okay. I know you have a past, and I wasn\u2019t pressing for details to embarrass you or to make you uncomfortable. I just wanted you to know there\u2019s nothing you could have done to disgust me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he relaxed and turned toward her. Those dark shadows swirled in his irises, but as she watched, they thinned and misted away. Zacharel had said those shadows were another demon, an evil inside of Paris that he could never get rid of. She wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d welcomed that evil, or \u201cbirthed\u201d it, and she didn\u2019t care. To her, he was Paris, only Paris, and she would never again make the mistake of hating someone for a perceived malevolence.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said again, tightening his hold on her.</p><p>\u201cListen, you. If I can\u2019t put myself down, you can\u2019t thank me for my stunning common sense.\u201d</p><p>One of his hands slid to her face, cupped her jaw. She\u2019d meant to make him smile, but his expression had never been fiercer. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>Emotion clogged her throat, and she forced a cough. \u201cHow about I tell you something embarrassing about me, so that we\u2019re even?\u201d</p><p>A rough, ragged, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was little, I played beauty shop with my younger sister. I was the stylist and put her gorgeous honey-blond hair in a ponytail\u2014then I hacked off the entire thing. She was the makeup artist, and painted my face with permanent markers. Our parents were horrified.\u201d A bombardment of nostalgia had her choking back a sudden sob.</p><p>Enna, Tommy from class says I have too many freckles, and that they make me ugly. Tears rolled down cheeks still baby-round. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, Tommy from class is stupid. You don\u2019t have half as many as me, and I\u2019m the prettiest girl in the world. You said so.</p><p>A girlish giggle. And I never lie!</p><p>I miss you so much, Skye, she thought now. I\u2019ll find you. I\u2019ll save you.</p> <p>Paris\u2019s thumb caressed the rise of her cheek. \u201cI lost you there for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I was just saying your story isn\u2019t embarrassing. It\u2019s cute. By the way, I think your wings are hot, and I\u2019m curious to know why I never wanted to lick them when Aeron had them.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hand over his and forced herself to smile. Soon she would lose him, so she had to enjoy him while she had the chance. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but I hope you get stabbed again. Like, real soon. I loved kissing you all better.\u201d</p><p>Finally, a surprised laugh barked from him. He pulled her down until her body covered his. \u201cBaby, I\u2019d willingly stab myself for that kind of kissing. But thankfully there\u2019s no need. I already have another owie and it needs your special doctoring skills.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p><p>BY THE TIME THEY WERE DRESSED and stepping out of their private cave into the big, bad realm where Zacharel the Chastity Belt waited, Paris had regained every bit of his strength and then some. His muscles were jacked with adrenaline, his bones fortified with steel. His steps were heavier from his increased weight, surer with his superior balance.</p><p>All because of Sienna.</p><p>\u201cI used my energy escorting the fallen...someplace else. We\u2019ll have to walk to the doorway,\u201d Zacharel said to Sienna. His cheeks were a little gaunt, his bronzed skin now lacking any shine. \u201cThat is what you still prefer, yes? Before, you told me you would rather walk with Paris than fly with me, anyway, and though you will soon discover why that is unwise, it is the best I can offer at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d she replied, ever polite.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to hang with us, make yourself useful.\u201d Paris took the lead, urged Sienna to follow him and forced the angel to take up the rear. \u201cGuard her with your life.\u201d</p> <p>A gust of wind danced around the angel, and only the angel, more chilling with every second that passed. \u201cI plan to do so. No matter the threat against her.\u201d</p><p>An easy tone, but his expression implied Paris himself was a threat, and Zach would take him down if necessary.</p><p>Good to know.</p><p>During the trek to find Sienna, hardly any creatures had been out and about, and there\u2019d been a small measure of light, a crimson glow from the moon. Now, there were a lot of those hungry, oozing shadows slithering in every direction, and the only light came from the occasional fiend\u2014like the ones who\u2019d followed Sienna, with every intention of harming her. They were staked to poles and burning alive.</p><p>Paris reached back and hooked her fingers around the waist of his pants. \u201cDon\u2019t let go of me unless you have to fight.\u201d I don\u2019t want her to have to fight.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Confident, unafraid.</p><p>That\u2019s my girl. Their little train crept through the wilderness, and, like now, some sort of campground. Tents stretched on either side of him. Sex kept his big mouth closed, and this time Paris knew beyond any doubt that the demon was sleeping off the pleasure rather than hiding.</p><p>A hiss. A snap of teeth.</p> <p>Enemy.</p><p>Paris searched through the darkness, found the source just up ahead at the top of the closest tent, and leapt into action. He went low, sliding on his knees, running his blade along the trunks of the same vinelike creatures he\u2019d encountered on the climb down that cliff. He was back on his feet a second later, watching as the remains slithered along the sides of the fabric.</p><p>No time to relax. Three more rained down. He kept his pimp hand moving, arcing, slicing, and from the grunting he heard behind him, he knew Sienna and Zacharel were doing the same.</p><p>A quick look to check on his woman\u2014she had her gaze on his back, swiping at anything that made a play for him\u2014proved she had no wounds, hadn\u2019t been hurt. One of the vines snapped in her direction, dripping fangs protruding from a pair of razored leaves. She was too busy protecting him to protect herself.</p><p>Paris swiped out his arm, and got a hunk of skin and muscle torn away. He sucked back a howl of pain. Okay, so now he knew what dribbled from those teeth. Acid.</p><p>\u201cFly her out of here,\u201d he commanded Zacharel, even as he spun, hands crisscrossing and chopping, pieces of vine flung away. He\u2019d rather lose her that way than another, more permanent way.</p><p>\u201cTold you. I expended the rest of my energy removing the fallen.\u201d</p><p>From the beginning, Paris had known he should off the punked-out bastard, but noooo. He\u2019d sympathized with the guy\u2019s plight. Lesson learned, though. Show a softer side, and boom, you\u2019d be punished later.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you,\u201d Sienna said while grabbing on to a stalk and hacking off the head with the crystal blade he\u2019d given her. She was fast, but not fast enough, and soon they would be all over her. \u201cMust have dropped the gun in the water. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Darkness...rising... Paris dropped his daggers and went for his own crystal blade. A single mental command, and the metal elongated...becoming a torch crackling with flames. He pressed those flames against the leather walls, the material soon engulfed...and the sparks jumped to the next tent.</p><p>Shrieks blended with the blaze\u2019s crackle as he, Sienna and Zacharel raced away.</p><p>After a mile or so they slowed down and Zacharel said, \u201cI thought you wished to remain inconspicuous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe needed to send a message.\u201d Thankfully, the shadow creatures got the message, too. Mess with Paris\u2019s ragtag group, and fry. They kept their distance. Only Sienna\u2019s presence prevented Paris from stomping over and doing some damage.</p><p>He wanted to hurt them, but he wanted her safe more.</p><p>You can always return for them. True. When Sienna left him, he\u2019d need a good fight to level him out.</p><p>Great. Now, at the thought of her leaving him, he was ticked all over again. He only began to calm a few hours later. Nothing and no one dared approach, and more than once his thoughts skipped back to what Zacharel had said.</p><p>Paris\u2019s darkness...his temper. Zacharel had implied that Paris would one day hurt Sienna. Yet, when they had been inside the cave and he\u2019d been worked into a dark, consuming rage, he had remained totally aware of her. He hadn\u2019t let the action near her.</p><p>With the vines, same deal. He\u2019d remained aware of her. Had sought to protect her, placing that need above the one to maim.</p><p>Good news, right? Except, what if she ever pricked his temper? What if all his darkness focused on her?</p><p>Oh, hell, no. That wasn\u2019t happening. Zacharel had made him paranoid, that was all. But doubts, once planted, could take on a life of their own, and Paris found himself sweating over the possibility.</p><p>Sienna affected him in a way no one else ever had. She accepted him as he was, good, bad and ugly. But if she ever betrayed him, if she ever lied to him, if she ever fought him or turned against him, he couldn\u2019t predict how he would react. Especially now that he knew the thrill of her complete surrender.</p><p>What are you doing, pondering the worst? He\u2019d given her a small measure of his trust. By succumbing to these fears, he would dishonor them both. He\u2019d never minded dishonoring himself, but the thought of dishonoring her weighed heavily on his shoulders.</p><p>She\u2019d taken him in her mouth, tasted all that he was, and loved his body with such shattering sweetness he would never be the same. She\u2019d seen him at his worst. She knew his past, his future, and yet she still watched him with awe in her eyes, as if he meant something to her. He would not diminish that gift. And it was a gift.</p><p>A stumble over a rock propelled her into the side of his body and jerked him out of his head. He caught her with his free hand before she fell.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to space out,\u201d she muttered as she straightened. While the sex had strengthened him, it had clearly tired her.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have felt such pride about that, but he did. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear me complaining about having you in my arms.\u201d</p><p>Her lush, lovely grin flashed up at him. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel might have rolled his eyes.</p><p>Paris gave him a mental bird before scanning the stretch of land ahead. There were miles of dark yet to travel, filled with lots of little landmines. Like the puddle he next had to jump over, then help Sienna do the same. His nose wrinkled. The water smelled like rotting corpses. Probably because...yep, he saw a pair of dull, dead eyes floating underneath.</p><p>A fly as big as his fist darted past, then another. One landed on his arm and immediately bit his biceps. He slapped the insect, meaning to fling it away from him, but he ended up smashing it, the damn thing splattering all over him.</p><p>The entire realm was a cocktail of creepy from some of his favorite worst horror movies ever. Yeah. He dug the cheese. He also enjoyed romance novels, bench pressing buses and baking chocolate chip cookies.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t had time for that stuff in a while, and now...now he realized just how much he\u2019d missed it. How cool would it be to throw in a DVD, kick back with Sienna beside him and watch the bloody good times roll. After that, they could curl up together and maybe read a few scenes from a romance novel.</p><p>None of that would happen, though. He and Sienna were parting as soon as they reached the exit. And what do you know. Now he wanted to kill something\u2014simply hurting was no longer good enough\u2014with his bare hands. Was actually praying some feral, foaming-at-the-mouth male would jump out and attack him.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t good. Meant his obsession with Sienna had reached the next level.</p><p>Paris maybe could have forced himself to let her go without much of a fuss before their time in that cavern. Now? Not likely. She was everything he\u2019d ever wanted for himself and everything he hadn\u2019t known he needed, all rolled into one sexy little package. A warrior when she needed to be, a siren when he needed her to be, yet always soft and sweet and giving. And brave, so brave.</p><p>When that pink-haired punk had invaded their private space, she hadn\u2019t run. She\u2019d stayed put. In case Paris needed her, and to keep Zacharel out of his face when things got dicey. He admired that about her. Hell, he was beginning to admire everything about her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly Paris understood his man Amun in a way he never had before. Amun\u2019s woman was a former Hunter, too, and once upon a time she had helped murder their bestie Baden. Because of that, every single Lord of the Underworld had despised her and had wanted to see her guts spilled all over their fortress, Paris included, but Amun had stood his ground and defended what was his, and everyone eventually\u2014reluctantly\u2014climbed on board the welcome train.</p><p>Maybe, after he\u2019d taken care of Cronus, he would do the same for Sienna\u2014take her home and play house. Things would be difficult at first, sure. She hadn\u2019t killed anyone, but the Lords still didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t like her. They\u2019d seen his cut and bruised body after her comrades had finished torturing him. They\u2019d watched him suffer over her loss\u2014and heard him curse himself for caring about her when she had never felt the same for him.</p><p>Until now. She\u2019d changed her mind about him, and he\u2019d changed his mind about her. He wasn\u2019t sure what had done the changing on his end, though he suspected it had more to do with simply wanting to believe in her, as he\u2019d claimed. He wasn\u2019t even sure when the change had happened. All he knew was that she wasn\u2019t out to get him.</p> <p>Accepting that once again drove home the point that his earlier fears, planted by Zacharel, were foolish.</p><p>Paris knew women, and he knew sex, and he thought he was pretty good at reading the former\u2019s emotion while engaged in the latter. More than that, he\u2019d been with Sienna before. She might have wanted him back then, but that want had nothing on what she felt for him now. Total, all-encompassing and real.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what had changed her mind, either, but he was glad that something had. He loved being with her. She eased him. In so many ways, she eased him. So what the hell was he supposed to do without her, while he hunted Cronus?</p><p>Who would he take to bed when the first wave of weakness hit him?</p><p>Oh...damn. The thought of being with someone else made him sick. Like, vomit blood sick. He wanted Sienna and only Sienna, and when they parted, and they would because he couldn\u2019t take her with him to hunt Cronus\u2014too dangerous for her, considering the ambrosia in her system\u2014he would have to take someone.</p> <p>If he continued on this thought path, he would break down.</p><p>Maybe she sensed his turmoil. She twined her fingers with his, brought his hand to her mouth, and kissed the pulse hammering in his wrist. The world came back into focus with a whoosh.</p><p>\u201c\u2014did you do with that other guy, the fallen you called him?\u201d she was saying to Zacharel. \u201cDid he, uh, survive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lives, yes,\u201d the angel said, but offered no more.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come back for me.\u201d That kind of blame and hatred wouldn\u2019t fade. But by the time the fallen healed, Paris and Sienna would have already parted. She would be safe.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zacharel said. \u201cHe will.\u201d</p> <p>A spike of fear added a layer of spice to the sweetness of Sienna\u2019s scent. Paris traced his thumb over her knuckles, reveling in the softness of her skin as much as in her worry for him. \u201cHe won\u2019t get the drop on me.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly a shadow at his left surged into motion, darting at Sienna with the speed of an arrow. The only color in the six-foot slash of darkness was the flash of bloodstained fangs inside its mouth.</p><p>Without missing a beat, Paris stepped in front of her, whipping out of Sienna\u2019s clasp to grasp the creature by the neck. He was surprised by the solid feel of flesh and heat. He commanded his crystal dagger to become whatever was needed to destroy a living shadow and stabbed, going deep into that mouth and feeling those fangs cut into his skin.</p><p>The dagger began to pulse with the light of the sun, bright enough to cause his eyes to tear. There was a howl of pain, a gurgle, before the writhing mass exploded into particles of mist and scattered on the breeze.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sienna said on a wispy catch of breath. The roses had faded from her cheeks, making her freckles stark.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t thank each other for this kind of thing, remember?\u201d Protecting her would never be about the accolades.</p><p>Those exquisitely plump lips curled into a radiant smile he would see in his fantasies for the rest of eternity. Desire for her spun to new life.</p><p>She reached up, perhaps planning to trace a fingertip along the seam of his now aching mouth. Then Zacharel said, \u201cMay the Deity save me from such nonsense,\u201d and she dropped her arm to her side.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think your deity will have to worry about saving you,\u201d Paris snapped. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure females will recognize the fact that you\u2019re not worth the effort from glance one.\u201d</p><p>The angel seemed pleased by that.</p><p>Polar opposites, Paris thought; that\u2019s what he and the angel were. Zacharel had never experienced a spark of arousal, so he had no idea what he was missing. Paris pitied the poor girl who finally gained his notice. She\u2019d have to have balls of steel. Zach would fight her every step of the way to the bedroom, and probably even blame her for his introduction to passion.</p><p>Now that might be fun to watch.</p><p>If the circumstances had been any different, Paris might have unleashed Sex\u2019s special scent upon the angel. More than likely even Zach would fall prey to the lush, candlelight-and-silk-sheets imagery that always consumed everyone else, and his horror at wanting Paris would amuse for centuries to come.</p><p>Sienna stiffened. As attuned to her every nuance as he was, Paris\u2019s attention whipped to her. The roses had returned to her cheeks, but they were too bright, as if she were suffering with a fever. Her eyes, now more emerald than gold, were glued ahead\u2014on the castle that had just crested into view.</p><p>Her bond to the structure must be growing stronger, he thought.</p><p>Paris wrapped his arm around her and tugged her as close as he could get her, remaining careful of her wings. She didn\u2019t protest. In fact, she nuzzled her cheek against his neck, warm and soft and his.</p><p>He kissed her temple. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><p>A sigh of relief and unmistakable gratitude. \u201cThan\u2014 I mean, whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>Zacharel frowned at them. \u201cDo you still mean to part?\u201d</p><p>Paris lost his good humor, and shot the angel an I-hope-you-die-painfully glare. Now was so not the time to get into that.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sienna said in a tone as cold and biting as the wind buffeting against Zacharel. Then, contradicting the harsh affirmation, she rubbed a fist against her chest as though a hot poker burned there. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to part.\u201d</p><p>Indignation rose up, but Paris swallowed it back. That was the way it had to be. He knew it, had agreed to it. Shit, he\u2019d even been the one to suggest it.</p><p>\u201cThis is good.\u201d The angel nodded his approval, the action allowing several snowflakes to catch in the satin of his hair.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Paris demanded. He still hadn\u2019t figured out the reason for Zacharel\u2019s continued presence.</p><p>A shrug of one strong shoulder. \u201cI would not say I care. I simply know that the two of you cannot successfully sustain a relationship.\u201d</p><p>With that note of truth in his voice, it was clear the angel wholeheartedly believed what he\u2019d said. \u201cOur relationship isn\u2019t your business, so your opinions aren\u2019t welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, the two of you were made my business.\u201d</p><p>Paris saw red. Demon-red. A volatile reaction when one was not needed, but he was helpless against it. Sheer will alone kept his hands at his sides rather than hammering into Zacharel\u2019s face. \u201cBy who?\u201d</p><p>Wings of white and gold spread, the angel beside him one moment, then in front of him the next. Zacharel\u2019s feet floated above the ground, those wings flapping slowly, holding him steady. Paris had to grind to an abrupt stop to avoid slamming into him. Around them, snowflakes tumbled and swirled only to land and melt.</p><p>In case things got ugly, he shoved Sienna behind him. \u201cWhat happened to being too weak to fly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have regained my strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answer will not change what is about to happen.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow, weapon at the ready. \u201cAre you sure you want to go this route?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome part of you hopes to keep her. Otherwise, you would not have reacted so violently to my observation.\u201d Before Paris could respond, he added, \u201cDo you recall when I told you that if you continued on your current path, you would lose everything you\u2019d come to love?\u201d</p><p>He popped his jaw. Only the gentle caress of Sienna\u2019s hands on his back prevented him from hurling obscenities.</p><p>\u201cI did not lie, demon. I never do. And now I think it\u2019s time I proved just how terrible an enemy I can be.\u201d</p><p>Paris blinked. Suddenly he hovered in the air, high above the castle\u2019s drawbridge, Zacharel cradling him against a hard chest honed on the battlefield. His heart pounded an unsteady beat.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did you do that?\u201d And where the hell was Sienna?</p><p>\u201cWith powers you cannot begin to imagine. But this is not what I wished to show you.\u201d One finger at a time, the angel loosened his grip. \u201cI hope that you will soon learn I can help you...or destroy you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better not do what I think you\u2019re going to do, you dirty piece of\u2014\u201d</p><p>His anchor vanished, and Paris free-fell toward the dilapidated slats of wood. He landed on the creaking boards with a hard slam and good loss of oxygen. Behind him, he heard the gargoyles screaming out their war cries, the flap of their wings, the scrape of their claws.</p><p>Zacharel had. He really had. \u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p><p>\u201cCOME. I WILL ESCORT YOU to the exit.\u201d</p><p>Sienna gaped at Zacharel, who had just appeared in front of her. Paris and the angel had been standing in front of her, bucking up against each other, ready to throw down as testosterone charged the air, only to disappear without warning. The angel had returned the very next second. Without Paris.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she demanded, though she wasn\u2019t too worried about the answer. Paris and Zacharel were friends despite their differences, and Wrath had yet to make a peep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI took him to the castle and dropped him on the bridge.\u201d</p><p>Reevaluation time.

Sure, he would escape, and he would be fine. But none of that mattered to her just then. Fury rose, dark and hot and dangerous.</p><p>Calm down. Before she whipped out that crystal blade Paris had given her and went to town on angel flesh. She\u2019d so had enough of males and their abuse of supernatural abilities.</p> <p>Zacharel blinked as if the answer should be obvious to one and all. \u201cThat, as you called it, is what one male does to another when they are arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>His lips edged down in the slightest of frowns. \u201cThat is what your Paris did to William of the Dark only this morn.\u201d</p><p>Well, she had no comeback for that, did she?</p><p>Zacharel shook out his wings, the white-and-gold feathers lifting slowly, elegantly. Snow glistened between the down. Her anger did nothing to lessen the impact of his beauty, the murky landscape somehow providing a suitable backdrop for him, dark where he was light.</p> <p>No, not light, she mused. An aura of dawn radiated from him, causing him to glow.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she prompted. \u201cWill you take me to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes...\u201d he said, his frown deepening.</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that Paris\u2019s darkness has taken root inside you already.\u201d</p><p>He spoke the words and somehow she knew they were true, the knowledge simply becoming a part of her. Paris\u2019s darkness, the one his demon had given birth to, was indeed inside her. A small twinge of worry was quickly followed by a shrug of unconcern. Wrath lived inside her. What was one more entity?</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve ignored my first question long enough. Now I\u2019m taking over. Listen up, and listen good. I want you to take me back to the castle.\u201d</p><p>The demand was unwise, unnecessary and counterproductive to her screw-Cronus plan, followed by her bagging and tagging of Galen, as well as her search for her sister, but that wasn\u2019t going to stop her. Paris would fight to reach her, that protective side of his demanding he witness her escape from the realm, she knew that now. If that happened, he would be harmed.</p><p>\u201cYou intended to part company in two days,\u201d he said, unwavering. \u201cI merely sped things along.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been looking forward to those two days with Paris, had wanted to make love to him again and again and brand him inside her mind, her body, until her every cell smelled like him.</p><p>\u201cYou keep reminding us that we can\u2019t be together.\u201d Suspicions tangoed with her thoughts as she crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you both need reminding.\u201d Simply stated, as if she should be ashamed for asking.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to be with him?\u201d Zacharel\u2019s dark head tilted to the side, his study of her intensifying. \u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p> <p>Did she, when doing so would cause their break to hurt that much more? \u201cI like him.\u201d A lot. Like, really, really a lot. And she respected him. Admired him. Craved him like a drug. He was witty and kind and protective and loyal, and even though he had every reason to despise her, he hadn\u2019t once treated her as if she were the enemy.</p><p>\u201cWe need you in the heavens, Sienna.\u201d</p><p>Did they, now? \u201cWell, get in line. Lately, everyone needs me.\u201d And no one would explain the reason. She fisted her hands and propped them on her hips. \u201cWhat is it you think I can do for you? Because right now, I\u2019m having trouble taking care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I know is that you will herald our victory in the most gruesome war this world has ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Forget sputtering. She gaped. Her, responsible for winning a war. No pressure, though, right? She so couldn\u2019t deal with this right now.</p><p>Zacharel stiffened, glanced over one strong shoulder. \u201cCronus comes,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has the answers you seek, though I would not trust him were I you.\u201d</p><p>Stomach cramp. Not Cronus, not now, and not outside the castle. He would flip. Although, keeping him out of the castle would keep him away from Paris, so... \u201cGet lost, angel boy.\u201d</p><p>At that, he quirked a brow. \u201cI will allow you to leave with him. I don\u2019t think you will thank me afterward, however. Until we meet again, demon girl.\u201d</p><p>He was gone a moment later, and what do you know, Cronus appeared a moment after that. No longer dressed as a Goth reject from hell, he now wore a gray silk suit tailor-made for his frame, all elegant lines and overflowing bank account.</p><p>Wrath stopped prowling and started slamming at her skull, very much wanting a go at him, but unable to figure out why. What he didn\u2019t do was fill her mind with images of the king\u2019s sins. Weird.</p><p>Cronus glanced left, right, and frowned. \u201cWhy are you outside the castle? For that matter, how did you get outside the castle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrath took over,\u201d she said, lest he puzzle out that she had been aided by other immortals.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Smiling, revealing his dazzling pearly whites, he extended a crimson rose in her direction. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh...\u201d Not just stunned but completely flummoxed, she accepted the dewy bloom. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head ever so slightly as he accepted her appreciation. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not the only gift I come bearing. I have what you need.\u201d A clear vial filled with glittering violet liquid followed the same path as the rose. \u201cMy apologies for the tardiness in its delivery.\u201d</p><p>His apologies? Seriously? \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it?\u201d A question when it should have been a statement.</p><p>Cronus cleared his throat, clearly uncomfortable. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>Because she had no desire to confess that she\u2019d already been fed, she took a small sip of what she now knew was ambrosia. What she didn\u2019t know was why she needed ambrosia, or why Paris had looked ill when he\u2019d handed her that flask.</p><p>Cool coconut flowed down her throat, sprouted wings and flew through her entire body. And wow, it packed a powerful punch. Both strength and weakness blazed through her, cannibalizing off each other and leaving her in a fog.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good slave girl,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>I love being patronized, I really do. \u201cWhy are you being so nice to me?\u201d she asked, swaying as she returned the vial to him.</p><p>He waved his hand and the glass disappeared. \u201cI must show you something,\u201d he said, and with another wave of his hand, her surroundings fell away. From warm to cold, dark to light.</p><p>From salvation to damnation.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p><p>SUDDENLY SIENNA WAS STANDING inside an unfamiliar chamber with white walls that stretched so high she could barely discern the domed ceiling above. Portraits hung everywhere. There was no furniture, just marble columns that boasted the occasional string of ivy, and stands that held sculptures and other crafted artifacts.</p><p>To stop herself from screaming from the mental calamity of the location switch, she bit her tongue until she tasted blood.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d Cronus said, splaying his arms and slowly pivoting, \u201cis the Chamber of Futures.\u201d There was a reverent quality to his voice, one she\u2019d never before heard from him. \u201cHere, destiny takes shape and endless possibilities await, for this is where my All-Seeing Eye records her visions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll-Seeing Eye?\u201d She was still so disoriented that it was nearly impossible to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cA female who sees into heaven and hell, time and space, present, past and future.\u201d Every syllable held a new layer of urgency. \u201cWhen one dies, another takes her place. Over the centuries, many have served me. There are no limits to how far back or how far forward these women can view. No limits to how high or low their scope.\u201d</p><p>To have such a power would be both a blessing and a curse, she thought.</p><p>\u201cEverything you see here was created by my Eyes.\u201d</p><p>Sienna tucked the rose behind her ear, forgetting about his weird mood as she tripped her way to the nearest portrait. In it, an older, frailer version of Cronus stared back at her. He had gray hair, wrinkled skin, and wore a long white robe. This was the god she\u2019d first met. Only this one was dirty, bruised and trapped in a cage.</p><p>\u201cI have learned that everyone has several different futures, and the choices they make ultimately decide which road they will travel. Come,\u201d he added without a breath, taking her by the forearm and ushering her through the long, seemingly endless expanse of the room. \u201cThere is something you must see.\u201d</p><p>With every step she took, the portraits rearranged themselves, gliding over the wall, changing places with fluid grace. She didn\u2019t try to pull away from him. Dizziness held her in thrall, and she needed the anchor of his hand to keep her upright.</p><p>\u201cThese Eyes, they do not always understand what they see, for they cannot determine the context of the actions they record. They do not know if they see past or future, how to stop something or how to make it come to pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you have to guess,\u201d she finished for him.</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d He stopped, and so did the movement of the portraits.</p><p>In the frame now in front of her, warriors fought to the death in every direction. Not just any warriors, but familiar faces. There was Galen, his white wings outstretched, his long, bloody sword raised. Before him was Cronus, with a thin line of blood connecting one ear to another\u2014his head about to slide from his neck.</p><p>Sienna\u2019s heartbeat quickened as she took in the rest. There was Paris, off to the side, watching what happened to Cronus with wide, shocked eyes. Blood caked him. His mouth was open, as if he were shouting something.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of the futures that await me,\u201d the king said. \u201cLong ago, my first Eye warned me that a warrior with wings of white would someday slay me. I assumed it would be an angel, only to later realize there were other warriors, like the Lords of the Underworld, who were equally capable of doing so. And then my newest Eye painted this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill all the Lords, then?\u201d Sienna asked. She knew he\u2019d already considered that route. A being like him wouldn\u2019t have been able to help himself. \u201cJust to be safe.\u201d</p><p>He moved two steps forward. Again the pictures danced into new locations. \u201cThe reason is here.\u201d He stopped, as did the pictures. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Sienna obeyed. In this one, a young Cronus sat on a throne of solid gold, the Lords of the Underworld lined up behind him, expressions reverent and stances determined. They were clearly protecting him, guarding him with their very lives. So badly she wanted to reach out and trace her fingertips over Paris\u2019s lips. How beautiful he was. How strong.</p> <p>\u201cThis is my real future,\u201d Cronus said. \u201cOr rather, the one possibility I must ensure comes to pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answer lies in the two warriors missing from this army.\u201d</p><p>She gulped, studied every face. \u201cGalen is missing. And...no one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see the keeper of Wrath?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. Aeron is right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not speak of Aeron. He is no longer the demon\u2019s keeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>\u201cYes. You are the key to this future, Sienna.\u201d</p><p>Disbelief thrummed through her. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d The angel had mentioned she would get her answers\u2014and that she shouldn\u2019t trust what she heard. Seemed like an eternity had passed since he\u2019d issued the warning. She wasn\u2019t sure what to believe, what to discard. \u201cHow am I the key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook closely at the bottom.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned over, gaze homing in on the portrait\u2019s lower edge. Surrounded by a crowd of onlookers was a woman. Her profile was to Sienna, her skin freckled, her nose and cheeks and chin\u2014 Her eyes widened. Hers. Those features were hers. The woman\u2019s hair was brown and wavy, just like hers, and black wings stretched from her robe. She stood beside a kneeling man who had his arms wrapped around her calves, holding on as if she were precious to him.</p><p>Galen, Sienna realized. He wasn\u2019t missing from the painting after all.</p><p>\u201cAll those centuries ago, when my Eye spoke of my death, she also told me there was a way to save myself...or, to be precise, a woman who could help me do so. I looked for this woman around every corner. She never appeared, and I despaired.\u201d</p><p>What came next was going to hurt, Sienna thought, straightening. Didn\u2019t take a genius to figure that out.</p><p>\u201cEons passed, and I was imprisoned when the worthless Greeks conspired with my wife, whom they later betrayed. I knew I would escape, for that, too, had been foretold, though the Greeks were too foolish to believe. When I at last reclaimed my rightful place on the heavenly throne, I sought out the Lords, thinking to destroy them before they could destroy me.\u201d</p><p>He paused, sighed. \u201cBut newly returned to power as I was, I did not like the idea of killing the Lords and freeing their demons, thereby having more enemies knocking at my door. More than that, I liked the idea of controlling Zeus\u2019s warriors, of using the beings he created as my own personal errand boys as I searched for the one among them with the power to kill me.</p><p>\u201cAnd oh, has that decision paid off. I have kept a close eye on their comings and goings and indeed, the Lords have proven surprisingly useful to me. That is why I know that the future you see before you in this painting, of me reigning in harmony with these warriors as my stalwart army, is already coming to pass.</p><p>\u201cBut still there is the matter of my predicted execution\u2014and my predicted rescuer. Just when I had given up hope, you at last appeared, a woman who belonged to neither side of the war and yet also belonged to both sides. A woman who pledged her allegiance to Galen but whose interest had unmistakably been captured by Paris. A woman who had the power even in death to influence a warrior\u2019s every thought and action.\u201d</p> <p>She could only shake her head.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. He\u2019s thought of you, only you, and that\u2019s what brought you to my attention. I had never before noticed a human soul, but I had to know why he craved yours so very much. That\u2019s when I discovered you were the one the Eye had foreseen. You look like the woman in the painting, and you have the same past as the woman I was told would save me. Both of those revelations can mean only one thing. You are to be my salvation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about your salvation,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know. But you care about Paris\u2019s, and if Galen dies, so does he.\u201d He waved his hand and another portrait appeared. In this one, Galen, Paris and a few other Lords lay in pieces on a blood-soaked floor. Her heart sank at the sight.</p><p>\u201cAnd so we are back to your role as savior\u2014mine, Paris\u2019s, in the end it makes no difference, as either path leads you to Galen. You should thank me,\u201d he went on. \u201cI gave you Wrath. Made you strong enough to survive whatever the keeper of Hope chooses to do with you.\u201d His gaze pierced her, a swirling black that increased the intensity of her dizziness. \u201cGalen adores power, and you are to be his mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A gasp, a plea.</p><p>Merciless, he continued. \u201cBecause of your demon, you will know those who lie to him, who befriend him when they truly hate him, and you will stop them before they are able to harm him.\u201d</p><p>First sleep with him, and now protect him? \u201cNo! I hate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not say you had to love him to carry out your task. Merely think of the alternative if you do not carry it out. Paris dies.\u201d</p><p>No. No, no, no. \u201cWhat happened to learning Galen\u2019s secrets and betraying him?\u201d Fury sparked to life. \u201cWhat happened to finding my sister? And why would you want me to stop others from harming him if he\u2019s the man destined to kill you?\u201d</p><p>Red flashed within the black of his eyes, scarlet pools of his own fury. \u201cLet us say that I have my reasons, and my plans. So listen and listen well. There are but a few possible futures for me and thus, the world. The first is that I reign as king for eternity. The second, I am killed, which means my wife is killed. If we are both lost, chaos will become king and the Lords will die.\u201d He twirled his finger and the portraits began their dance anew.</p><p>A new frame stopped beside her and she looked it over, her mouth going dry. Angels, so many angels, bloody tears raining down wings of white and gold. Men and women wearing togas fought each angelic warrior savagely.</p><p>And there on the ground at their feet were the Lords, bloody, broken...lifeless. She wanted to cry, to collapse.</p><p>\u201cTo answer your other question,\u201d Cronus continued, \u201cI do wish to know Galen\u2019s secrets. I do wish for you to betray him. For this to occur, I need you to protect him, as well. As I said, I have my reasons and my plans, and by rights I should punish you for daring to question their logic.\u201d</p><p>All she could think about was Paris\u2019s death. Paris, dying. Paris, dead. Paris, gone forever.</p><p>Cronus added, \u201cBefore you think that my faithless wife had the right idea when she conspired to lock me away, before you think to put in place any plot that would result in finding a way for my wife alone to reign\u2014\u201d his voice went low, harsh \u201c\u2014know that if Rhea rules, your sister\u2019s killer will control the fate of your world.\u201d</p><p>Her head spun with even more disbelief, fury and dread. Cronus had just said...had just claimed... \u201cBut you told me she was alive,\u201d Sienna croaked.</p><p>\u201cShe was.\u201d</p><p>Was. Not \u201cis.\u201d Was. \u201cAnd now?\u201d Another croak.</p><p>Wrath chose that moment to get his slam on, and this time, he snarled. Something is wrong. I don\u2019t like this.</p><p>His voice jolted her. He\u2019d spoken to her before, of course, but usually he limited himself to words like punish, kill, heaven and hell.</p><p>Is he lying? As Zacharel had implied. Please, tell me he\u2019s lying.</p><p>I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know anything right now.</p><p>A whimper slipped from her.</p><p>\u201cI have done my research. Skye became a Hunter,\u201d Cronus said. \u201cPerhaps for the same reason you did\u2014to right the wrong of her abduction. You could have met her, talked to her, and never have known it, for she was a child when you saw her last. Nor would she have known you. She eventually got out, but she was married to a Hunter. She was trying to get him out, as well. She...died with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d This was too much to take in. She couldn\u2019t process it all.</p><p>\u201cAnd when Rhea learned that you, my winged savior, were searching for the girl, she had her...\u201d His gaze skittered away. \u201cRhea had her killed.\u201d</p><p>Wrath released another snarl. Something is wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying. You have to be lying.\u201d Sienna\u2019s knees shook and she barely managed to remain upright. That she could have been so close to Skye and not even realized it...that now she would never have another chance... \u201cProve it. Prove she\u2019s...that she\u2019s...gone.\u201d A lump of grief congealed in her throat. Her eyes burned, tears bubbling at the backs.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>The air in front of her shimmered, crystallized, and then, as if she were looking through a magical peephole, she saw a bedroom, a black-haired girl sprawled on the floor, her throat slit, her body resting beside a man who\u2019d clearly met a similar fate. A lake of crimson pooled around them, thick and black at the edges.</p><p>Sienna fought down her instinctive revulsion\u2014how many gruesome images of those she cared for would she be forced to endure this day?\u2014and pushed herself to think back. To the best of her recollection, she had not interacted with this girl during her time with the Hunters, but then, there were hundreds, if not thousands, of Hunter compounds and cells, and she\u2019d never had access to the database of members.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not her,\u201d she said with a violent shake of her head. \u201cMy Skye had blond hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does this girl. You know the black is not her natural color. Her lashes prove this.\u201d</p><p>Sienna made herself look closer. Long brown lashes framed dulled brown eyes.</p><p>Enna, when you grow up and get married, will you still love me? Brown lashes fluttering innocently as Skye awaited her answer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ll always love you more than anything or anyone.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Plump lips, soft and pink, and as big as Sienna\u2019s. A delicate bone structure, a stubborn chin. \u201cNo.\u201d Acid created a toxin of rage and sorrow in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cYes. When I...found her like this, I scoured her mind, her memories. This is your Skye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Her sister...lying on the floor. Ruined. Dead. Gone forever, like Paris would be. No longer a little girl, but a woman. Gone...forever... The words echoed in her mind, horrifying and shocking and sickening. Gone...</p><p>Is that truly her? she asked Wrath.</p><p>Yes. I can see her life, and you in it, but I cannot see her death. Why can\u2019t I see her death?</p><p>Sienna locked on the affirmation, nothing else registering. Skye was...was...dead. Dead. Her precious Skye was dead. \u201cBring her back.\u201d She pushed through the shimmering air and fisted Cronus\u2019s lapels, shaking him. \u201cBring her back the same way you brought me back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is not always so simple, even for me.\u201d Guilt, so much guilt in his tone, all over his features, radiating from him.</p><p>Wrong, so wrong.</p><p>Enough with the babbling! \u201cYou\u2019re the self-proclaimed king of the gods.\u201d She shook Cronus all the harder. \u201cRuler of the Titans. Jailer of the Greeks. Leader of the Lords of the Underworld. What\u2019s one little soul compared to all that? Bring. Her. Back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are laws of life and death even I must obey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer soul\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs no longer savable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Her palm darted out of its own volition, slapping his cheek so sharply she would not have been surprised to find she\u2019d peeled away his skin. \u201cYou lied to me. Said she was Galen\u2019s prisoner.\u201d</p><p>When he failed to retaliate, or block himself from further abuse, she struck again.</p><p>\u201cYou lied!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo ensure you obeyed me and kept Galen under control, I did what I felt I had to do,\u201d he at last admitted. \u201cI knew you would not kill him if you thought only he knew where your sister was. And as I said, I have my reasons for wanting him protected for now. But no, Galen never imprisoned her. She never had a child with him.\u201d</p><p>Another slap, this one so hard she thought she fractured her own bones. Still he accepted the abuse without comment. \u201cHer death could be another of your lies. Anything to jerk my chains, right?\u201d</p><p>Wrong, so wrong, but she is dead. She is dead.</p> <p>A blink and Sienna was standing in the very room Cronus had shown her. The woman\u2019s body, motionless at her feet. She could smell the coppery tang of blood and death. And here, in this chamber of fatality, there was no missing the resemblance to her mother.</p><p>To their mother.</p><p>Wrath released another snarl, another and another, something \u201cwrong\u201d continuing to prod at him. But he didn\u2019t know what the problem was, and Sienna didn\u2019t have the strength to reason things out with him. Grief slammed through her hard, knocking the breath out of her lungs. Breath she couldn\u2019t steal back, no matter how hard she tried. The fog thickened in her mind. Razors dipped in flames razed her chest, burning her up.</p><p>Her surroundings faded as she waded in and gathered the girl to her chest, clutching her close, letting her heart beat for both of them. The tears finally cascaded, falling, falling, a never-ending river of pain.</p><p>\u201cI will return you to the castle,\u201d Cronus said, voice as gentle as if he were speaking to a babe, \u201cand I will give you time to come to terms with what has happened. Your memories will no longer haunt you, and you will be able to leave the realm, should you wish it. In this, you have my word. But I will come back for you, Sienna, wherever you are, and I will expect you to aid my cause. And now...now that you\u2019ve seen what my wife, Galen\u2019s ruler, is capable of, I think you\u2019ll want to, yes?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>THE LORDS OF THE UNDERWORLD were here, on the island in Rome, and nearing the Temple of the Unspoken Ones at that very moment.</p><p>They would have a plan of attack, Galen thought. The most likely: all but one warrior would surround him, staying hidden in the shadows, and that one would approach him to speak to him. Unless, of course, they all thought to hide, shooting him full of arrows and bullets now and asking their questions later.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t matter either way. The warriors must know they were walking into a trap. That Galen would not have set the meeting here if he could not use the Unspoken Ones to his benefit.</p><p>Once the Lords reached the threshold of the temple, the Unspoken Ones would have them, would whisk them here into their inner sanctum, as one, right in front of Galen, and lock them in place with invisible bindings, allowing him to do his thing.</p><p>However, Galen didn\u2019t want to go that route. It was too time-consuming, with too much risk. Not to his life, but to theirs. If he killed one of the Lords, none would ever complete the trade he\u2019d demanded. All he wanted right now was Legion.</p><p>His hands fisted. If the warriors had failed to bring her, he would honor his word for once in his life. As he had told Lucien, he would take another loved one from the Lords, and another and another\u2014until they broke down. He would not kill, but he would harm.</p><p>Every day Galen\u2019s need for Legion worsened. Hope had built up dreams of having her, of punishing her, of taming her...of owning her. Jealousy had tossed fuel on an already smoldering fire of resentment as he wondered where she was and what she was doing.</p><p>A rustle behind him had him tensing.</p><p>He whipped around. Standing between fat white pillars were all five of the Unspoken Ones. The furred one with a headful of hissing snakes in place of hair. The scarred one, with more muscles than three roided-up boxers fused together. The female, with the face of an ugly bird and horns lining the length of her spine. Lastly, the tallest two\u2014one with shadows seeping from his skullet, and the other with blades that dripped poison spiking from the crown of his head.</p><p>Each creature was bound by chains they couldn\u2019t break. And yet, the tenuous bonds mattered only as long as Cronus lived. The moment he kicked it, these beings would be loosed upon an unsuspecting world. No one, not even Galen, would be able to stop the destruction they would undoubtedly mete out.</p><p>On an altar in front of them lay Ashlyn, pale and panting, sweating, like a virginal sacrifice of old. Only this virgin was heavily pregnant and about to give birth. The fright he\u2019d given her had caused her to go into labor.</p><p>Oddly enough, Galen didn\u2019t like that she was in pain. She wasn\u2019t a bad sort, and hurting the fairer sex had never been a particular favorite of his. He\u2019d do it, had done it\u2014he\u2019d do anything\u2014but he never enjoyed it.</p><p>\u201cCut the babes from her belly,\u201d the horned, beaked she-devil commanded him. \u201cI would have them for my own.\u201d</p><p>Babes? As in more than one?</p><p>\u201cThey must die,\u201d the scarred male snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo. We will use them as barter,\u201d one of the mountains of muscle said.</p><p>Ashlyn moaned in pain, in supplication, her glassy gaze pleading as she looked to Galen. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Begging the enemy. To do so, she must love those babies with her whole heart, even though she had yet to meet them. He thought he understood that. Nearly twenty-nine years ago, he\u2019d inadvertently fathered a daughter; he had not learned of her existence until she was fully grown. Knowing she was of his blood had been all that was needed for him to...not love her, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever experienced that emotion, but to feel a sort of kinship with her despite the fact that she was as different from him as he was from the Lords.</p><p>His Gwendolyn. A Harpy. A female he could not bring himself to hurt. A female who would cut him down without a moment\u2019s hesitation. He liked that about her, felt pride in her ruthlessness.</p><p>Galen had done terrible things throughout his life. Betrayed his friends, killed for power, razed cities, purposely addicted his own people to drugs so that they would need him, follow him. He had destroyed their families when they dared to disobey him\u2014or even so much as thought to betray him. He\u2019d slept with females he shouldn\u2019t have, in ways he shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>There was no line he hadn\u2019t crossed. No line he wouldn\u2019t cross. He had done all of that\u2014and would do a thousand times worse\u2014yet he had never cared about the consequences. Still didn\u2019t. Unlike the warriors he\u2019d been created with, he hadn\u2019t come with a sense of honor, a bond of brotherhood or a need to help anyone but himself.</p><p>Baden, the first to be created, had gotten most of the goodness and the rest a mere trickle. Galen, the very last to be created, had gotten what remained\u2014nothing but the cold and the dark.</p><p>Perhaps that was why he had gone after Baden first.</p><p>None of the Lords knew he had spoken with Baden before he\u2019d sent his Bait to lure the man to his death. A private meeting Baden himself had arranged. None of them knew Galen had vowed to leave the immortal army alone, to stop the war, if Baden sacrificed himself.</p><p>Possessed by the demon of Distrust, Baden had not believed Galen\u2019s vow, but he\u2019d made the bargain anyway, just in case. Galen knew it was because he\u2019d blamed his demon for his instinct to mistrust, and hoped for the best\u2014because of Galen\u2019s demon.</p><p>The Bait\u2014Haidee, one of the keepers of Hate\u2014had gone to the warrior, unaware that her victim knew where she would lead him. Baden had not wanted his friends to know he willingly rushed to his grave. He had not wanted them to witness the event, either, but of course they had followed him. There had been no stopping the war after that, even if Galen had wanted to. Which, of course, he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGaaaaaleeeen.\u201d A low, pained moan echoed as Ashlyn writhed atop the stone. Her face was red, swelling, her breaths coming in shorter puffs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look to me for aid, female.\u201d The next half hour was mission critical, and he could not allow her to distract him. \u201cI told your man what he must do to save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Pleeeease.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A pang in his chest. If he told her the only way to ensure he would give the babies to their father was for her to crawl to him, she would find the strength to do so. She\u2019d even kiss and lick his boots. She would do anything and everything he asked, no matter how vile.</p><p>Oh, yes, she loved her children. They were flesh of her flesh, blood of her blood, and they would love her in return.</p><p>Nothing and no one had ever belonged to him and only him\u2014except Legion. Not that she would do anything necessary to save him, nor would he do anything necessary to save her. But. Yeah, there was always a but with him. He had been her first lover\u2014and he wanted to be her last.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t sure what had happened to her during her forced stay in hell. Didn\u2019t know what she had welcomed, and what she hadn\u2019t. But she would no longer be his alone, that much he knew. Something else to punish her\u2014to punish all of them\u2014for.</p><p>\u201cThe babes,\u201d the female Unspoken said again. Was that...yearning he detected in her voice? Did she actually crave a chance at motherhood? \u201cGive. Me.\u201d</p><p>The males turned on her, scowling, tossing obscenities, arguing over what should be done versus foolish desires. Whatever happened to the mother, Galen decided in that moment, he would not allow the Unspoken Ones to have or hurt those children.</p><p>Finally, a decent act on his part. One of goodness, without guile or selfishness. Never let it be said he was all bad all the time.</p><p>\u201cG-Galen. I am h-here, as requested.\u201d</p> <p>Every muscle in his body went taut, his blood instantly firing, blistering through him. A hallucination? He sniffed, taking in the earth, a hint of hellfire and the subtlest trace of sea salt. No hallucination.</p><p>Legion was here.</p><p>The wealth and variance of emotion he felt nearly overwhelmed him as he spun to search her out. And there she was, a few feet away. She stood at the edge of the temple grounds, trees stretched out behind her. She was lovely, though not exactly as he remembered. Tall, buxom, with a fall of pale hair and eyes of the smoothest brown. Her lips were chapped, as if she\u2019d been chewing them, and she\u2019d lost so much weight her T-shirt and sweatpants bagged on her.</p><p>The Lords hadn\u2019t taken proper care of her. For that, they would suffer more than he\u2019d originally planned. She was to be punished, yes, but by his hand and only his hand. Anger became the front-runner inside him.</p><p>\u201cAre you armed?\u201d he asked, not expecting the truth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Her hand fluttered to her throat, and her gaze skittered past him, widened. \u201cAshlyn.\u201d She raced forward, only to jolt backward when he stepped in her path, her desperation to avoid him palpable.</p> <p>\u201cYou will stay where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cL-let her g-go.\u201d The stutter told him more than her words. She was afraid of him. \u201cYou said y-you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegion, gooooo!\u201d Ashlyn screamed, speaking through a contraction. \u201cTell Maddox\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d Galen snarled. He would accept no interference in this matter.</p><p>Legion grabbed her stomach, her skin taking on a greenish tint. Her chin trembled.</p><p>This fear of hers scraped at his nerves. Before, she had been brave and full of the fire she had been raised in.</p><p>\u201cThe warriors are almost upon us,\u201d one of the Unspoken said. \u201cWe will whisk them here the very moment we can. Now, give the females into our care, so that you may fight without distraction.\u201d</p><p>That had been their plan, and one he\u2019d pretended to agree with. Then and now, the thought of allowing anyone to touch his woman grated. And when he noticed Legion\u2019s reaction to the idea\u2014a cold wash of horror in eyes glassy with unshed tears\u2014he was decided.</p> <p>\u201cBack away,\u201d he told her. \u201cStand in the rubble at the edge of the trees. And if you so much as think about flashing away or running, I\u2019ll hurt the human.\u201d</p><p>The tears finally fell, but she did as commanded. He hated the increased distance between them, and blamed the Unspoken Ones.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d one growled.</p><p>\u201cGive them to us,\u201d another shrieked.</p><p>They had only one weakness that he knew of. They could not take what they wanted; it had to be given to them. Usually they used trickery to ascertain free will, as they had done to obtain the Cloak of Invisibility from Strider. When trickery failed, they resorted to scaring their victims into submission.</p><p>They would learn. Galen feared nothing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move from that spot, no matter what happens,\u201d he told Legion, peering at her until she nodded to acknowledge she had heard him.</p><p>Then she gulped, raised her chin. \u201cBut only if...only if you give Ashlyn and the babies back to Maddox. Alive.\u201d</p><p>Of course, the Unspoken Ones reacted first.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will leave you the moment you comply!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not be a fool!\u201d</p><p>Legion glanced behind him. The greenish tint returned to her skin, and damn if she didn\u2019t look ready to scream.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me,\u201d he snapped, and she immediately submitted. Such lovely eyes. Rich and dark and boundless, even with their cascade of tears. \u201cDo not look away from me.\u201d</p><p>A tremor in response.</p><p>He backed up until he stood beside Ashlyn, then twisted and bent, sliding his arms underneath her, picking her up. She was heavy, her muscles knotted from strain. Legion maintained the connection between them.</p><p>The Unspoken Ones demanded to know what he thought he was doing. He ignored them, carrying the girl to Legion\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cWe gave you the Cloak, Hope. You owe us the females.\u201d</p><p>Had they meant to keep the humans as their due, then? He laughed with just a bit of humor. Probably. Something he would have done, as well, so he couldn\u2019t really blame them.</p><p>Wait. Yes, he decided. He could.</p><p>\u201cShould you betray us now, we will hunt you. We will destroy you in the old way.\u201d The female let loose a cackling laugh. \u201cDo you have any idea of the awfulness that entails?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her, saying to Legion, \u201cVow to me here and now that you will not try to escape me, that you will go with me willingly and do everything I tell you, when I tell you to do it. A blood vow.\u201d One she would not be able to break, even if she wanted to.</p><p>For immortals, keeping blood vows became a compulsion.</p><p>Another tremor shook her. Those liquid eyes with their spiky lashes roved over him, causing his cock to fill and harden. He would have her. Tonight. \u201cI w-will, but only if you vow to give Ashlyn and the babies back to Maddox, without hurting her. Or them. Today. And without fighting the Lords.\u201d</p><p>The girl had learned to bargain, to cover all the bases. A complication, but not anything that would stand in his way.</p><p>Galen placed the still panting, pregnant female on the ground as gently as he was able. She was in too much pain to notice or speak. As he straightened, he removed one of his daggers.</p><p>Legion shrank away.</p><p>That fear would have to be dealt with. He wanted his firecracker back. The one who had seduced him at the bar, screwed him in the bathroom. Bitten and poisoned him before he could finish.</p><p>Speaking of, she owed him an orgasm. And so many weeks had passed, she now owed him more than one. Interest was a bitch. But first, ensuring her cooperation. \u201cIn exchange for what I have asked you to promise, I vow to you here and now, this day, that I will give the female Ashlyn and her offspring back to her male Maddox, and I will hurt none of them. I will fight not with his friends, but give her and the babes over, unharmed by my hand or any other, and go on my way.\u201d He pressed the tip of the blade into his palm and cut so deeply he hit bone.</p><p>Blood welled. He smeared crimson on both sides of the blade, making sure to saturate the tip. Then he offered the weapon to Legion, hilt first. Part of him expected her to take it and slash at him, but no. She knew she was beaten, merely watched him, undecided about her next move. Cooperation was her only option. Unlike Lucien, she did not have the power to flash others alongside her, so she couldn\u2019t spirit Ashlyn to safety.</p><p>\u201cHurry.\u201d Any moment now, the Lords would arrive and it would be too late to walk away with what he wanted. He couldn\u2019t fight the Lords and watch Legion. And he couldn\u2019t run with her, avoiding battle, because she could flash away from him any time she wished. He needed her vow. \u201cBefore I change my mind.\u201d As if he would ever change his mind.</p><p>With a trembling hand, she accepted the blade. Nervously she licked her lips.</p><p>He waited, on edge.</p><p>Finally, he heard the words he craved. \u201cIn exchange for what you have already promised, I vow to you here and now, this day, to willingly accompany you to wherever you wish.\u201d Those glitter-ripe tears continued to rain down her cheeks. \u201cI will do w-whatever you ask. And stay as l-long as you demand my presence.\u201d</p><p>She pressed the blade\u2019s tip into her palm and cut. Not as deeply as he had, but enough to ensure a successful exchange. Her blood welled, mingling with the droplets he\u2019d left behind. He liked that, liked knowing some part of him was now inside her.</p><p>He reached out, clasped her hand against his, her wound against his. At the moment of contact, he felt a pop inside him, a tear on his soul, and though he\u2019d never done anything like this before, he knew the vow had just made a place for itself inside him. Judging by her grimace, hers had just done the same.</p><p>At last, she belonged to him.</p><p>Legion flinched.</p><p>Had he said the words aloud? Or perhaps she, too, had snapped back to reality as the Unspoken Ones hissed and cursed and threatened behind him. Galen cupped her cheek with his uninjured hand, his thumb caressing the rise of satin-covered bone. She trembled, but didn\u2019t pull away.</p><p>He rattled off the coordinates to his home. \u201cLeave now, make no other stops, talk to no one, and I will give the girl and her babies to her man as promised.\u201d And the Unspoken Ones could not stop her as they could the Lords. Well, all the Lords save the ever-annoying Lucien. \u201cHurry, I am almost too late.\u201d</p><p>She gulped, jerked from his clasp. He mourned the loss. Wanted to roar as she vanished before his eyes. She goes to your home. You will be with her again.</p><p>He had only to take care of two tasks. Ashlyn, and the Unspoken. They could lure anyone, him included, with their gazes, cast illusions and hypnotize. And they liked to do so; they also liked to play with their prey. Something they didn\u2019t need a willing spirit to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He knew, because he\u2019d fed them some of his own men. The ones he\u2019d disliked, the ones who hurt the innocent. Ironic, yes, considering all the things he himself had done, but also another of his very good deeds. He did them upon occasion, if for no other reason than to amuse himself.</p><p>Soon the Lords would be too close for him to divert. As promised, he couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, fight them, but the Unspoken Ones could. If he allowed that to happen, the Unspoken would forgive him for his unwillingness to share the females. Except, Ashlyn could be hurt during the battle, which meant Galen could not allow it. Soooo, he couldn\u2019t take care of the Lords or the Unspoken this day. Both would have to be dealt with later.</p><p>Keeping his gaze trained on the ground, he approached the pillars. Heard chains rattle. Stealthily he dug the Cloak from his back pocket and unfolded the material. The creatures tracked him, even as they hissed at him; he felt the heat of their gazes.</p> <p>Acting quickly, he flared his wings and the Cloak at the same time. His feet lifted off the ground, and he spun...spun...letting invisibility overtake him as the razor-sharp edges of his wings sliced into the Unspoken closest to him while the Cloak extended like a tentacle and wrapped around the neck of the farthest, crushing his windpipe.</p><p>The first lost his insides, and hunched over with a howl of pain. The second couldn\u2019t breathe and collapsed, unconscious.</p><p>Galen was on the next two a split second later, a tsunami of movement, twisting, diving, cutting and doing a little more of that crushing. They couldn\u2019t see him, couldn\u2019t fight him, and oh, he had fun.</p><p>Less than a minute after his initial attack, all five were on the ground. The Cloak sagged in Galen\u2019s grip as he planted his feet on the ground, his body coming back into view.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t have taught me how to use the Cloak properly,\u201d he tsked.</p> <p>He bent down and scooped Ashlyn into his arms. Sweat soaked her, her cheeks were puffed from the strain, and she clutched her stomach as she wheezed. Without the Cloak, he couldn\u2019t flash her, and with it, her man would not sense her. That left Galen with only one option. He stalked away from the temple without any explanation. Tree branches reached out, slapping at him. Twigs snapped under his boots.</p><p>\u201cYou. Will. Die,\u201d he heard one of the injured choke.</p><p>\u201cThat is our vow to you,\u201d another panted.</p><p>\u201cYour screams will echo into eternity.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring them, again, he picked up his pace. After this, they might opt to aid the Lords. No matter, though. They were stuck here, so what could they really do to him, even with immortal help?</p><p>\u201cCry out for your man, Ashlyn.\u201d</p> <p>That fall of honey hair remained plastered to her scalp as she shook her head wildly. A moment passed. She cringed and covered her ears with her hands, an action he understood. Wherever she stood, she could hear every conversation that had taken place there.</p><p>Using the arm wrapped under her shoulders, he angled his wrist to tug one of her hands away. \u201cYou heard my vow to Legion. I cannot hurt you or your man today. Call for him. Bring him to you.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps she meant to deny him a second time, but she opened her mouth and a scream of pain was unleashed. Birds flew from the tops of trees. Insects ceased midsong. Animals of the four-legged variety raced for cover.</p><p>He could have set her down and left her there, but he didn\u2019t. Whatever the Lords had planned to do to him, they changed their minds when they heard that scream and came running. He heard the thunder of their footsteps and ground to a halt, waiting. A few seconds later, they ruptured the thick green foliage, becoming a half circle of menace around him.</p><p>They were closer than I realized, he thought. Interesting. They might have won this round, after all.</p><p>Maddox cared not for his own safety. \u201cGive her to me.\u201d He sprinted the rest of the distance, and with a tenderness belying his savage expression, he took his woman into his arms. \u201cOh, my love. I am so sorry. So sorry.\u201d</p><p>Another pang ripped through Galen\u2019s chest.</p><p>She moaned. \u201cHurts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, darling, I know. Lucien,\u201d the warrior growled as his narrowed gaze landed on Galen. \u201cFlash her out of here. Now. She\u2019s in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaddox,\u201d she panted. \u201cDon\u2019t want...to leave...you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, love. Shh. We\u2019ll get you help. Let Lucien take you. Then he\u2019ll come back for me. He can\u2019t take the two of us at once, but I\u2019ll only be moments behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf something happens and I can\u2019t get back to you\u2014\u201d Lucien began.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ashlyn screeched. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you be able to get back?\u201d</p><p>Maddox gave the scarred warrior a hard look.</p><p>\u201cRemember what Danika said to us.\u201d Lucien gently took the still protesting Ashlyn from Maddox\u2019s arms. \u201cWe won\u2019t be at the fortress.\u201d</p><p>Maddox maintained contact for as long as possible. When the keeper of Death and the pregnant female disappeared, he straightened to his full height and once again met Galen\u2019s stare.</p><p>Galen wasn\u2019t sure why he stayed, even then. Each warrior had weapons, and all of those weapons were trained on him. Guns, blades, a crossbow. His own daughter, Gwen, was the holder of the bow, an arrow notched and at the ready.</p><p>Ah, now he knew why he\u2019d stayed. Deep down he\u2019d known she would come, and he\u2019d wanted her to see what he\u2019d done. See one of his rare good deeds. And maybe...maybe even decide to like him.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you give her back?\u201d Maddox demanded. Despite the fact that his woman had been returned healthy and whole, he reeked of rage.</p><p>\u201cWhy else? I now have what I wanted from you.\u201d</p><p>The warrior\u2019s brows lowered, surprise a slash of crimson in his eyes. \u201cYou have Legion?\u201d</p><p>So. They hadn\u2019t brought her. She had come to him on her own. Another interesting tidbit\u2014and enough to ripen every thread of possessiveness inside him. \u201cShe is mine, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He grinned slowly with glee. \u201cHow do you think?\u201d</p><p>A flash of bone and scales under Maddox\u2019s face, his demon rising to the surface. \u201cThere\u2019s something you should know about Legion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d He knew what would happen next, knew exactly what the warriors planned to do. Knew it would hurt like a son of a bitch. He could have covered himself with the Cloak, could have flashed away. Instead, he stood there, his grin widening.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going back to her.\u201d Maddox raised a Glock, as Galen had known he would, and fired, nailing Galen in the chest.</p><p>On the heels of the bullet, blades sliced into his stomach, an arrow right into his heart. He met his daughter\u2019s gaze as he fell to his knees, reached back and at last grabbed the Cloak. \u201cNow we\u2019re even,\u201d he told her, voice faint as he shielded himself from view.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p><p>WILLIAM WATCHED AS PARIS was carted closer and closer to him by those horny, humping gargoyle fiends, amused as ever-loving hell. In fact, he nearly busted a gut laughing. Yeah, he knew taunting the new and improved Paris 2.0 was borderline idiotic, and that the warrior would come gunning for him in the next few minutes, but like William could really pretend to be sad about this, so, bring it.</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve already got several money shots wetting your chest. Classic!\u201d</p><p>Sex didn\u2019t say a word. Just gave William the finger and held steady, emotion seething in his eyes. Emotion in the form of badass shadows, yeah, but that failed to lessen William\u2019s amusement.</p><p>Paris was clearly planning to murder someone other than William before the day finished ticking out, because, also clearly, more was going on here than simple humiliation. And William suspected that someone would be...the suspiciously missing Sienna? Nah. She was already dead. Zacharel? Had that pisser come back for more? William really hoped so. Hoped Paris gave it to the winger but good.</p><p>William didn\u2019t have a good history with the sky-bound, and though they didn\u2019t seem to recognize his too lovely mask of a face, they\u2019d jump him like a pack of rabid dogs if he revealed his true form.</p><p>Not that he ever would. Anyways. It was best not to go there, even mentally. Mind readers abounded in this realm.</p><p>Just as Paris disappeared around the corner, a grave and desperate Lucien materialized right in front of William, a screaming, panting Ashlyn clutched in his arms.</p><p>The words exiting her bleeding lips were things only back-alley whores and junkies in need of a fix would say. And maybe Lucifer, the self-proclaimed king of the underworld.</p><p>\u201cBad day?\u201d Never had William heard the gentle beauty utter such filthy, vile things. And really, she\u2019d never looked prettier to him. Rock on.</p><p>\u201cDanika told us she needed to have the babies wherever you were shacking up,\u201d the keeper of Death said without preamble. Lines of tension branched from his eyes like little rivers of poison. \u201cFollowing your spirit trail was not easy or fun, especially since my warriors have need of me. Show me to a bed now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure she said where I am?\u201d William thumped his chest just to be sure.</p><p>\u201cBed. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Ashlyn yelled. \u201cThey\u2019re coming now. Please, please. Or I\u2019m going to tell Maddox you tried to feel me up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo cruel. He vowed to remove the best part of my anatomy if I so much as breathed in your direction.\u201d Despite his cavalier tone, William moved quickly as he led the pair up the stairs, down the hall and into the bedroom he\u2019d cleaned for himself, intending to free the trapped female immortal and spend a few days getting to know her body in every twisted position he favored. So far, no luck.</p><p>Lucien laid Ashlyn down, careful, so careful. \u201cI\u2019ll get Maddox now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Ohhhhhhh, Gooooood.\u201d She squeezed Lucien\u2019s hand, and William heard the bones crack. When she came down from the pain an eternity later, she released the now-pale warrior. \u201cMaddox. Now. Or I\u2019m going to rip your face off and...and... Ohhhhhh!\u201d The last was an evil screech better suited to a banshee from hell\u2019s darkest corridors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd tell Maddox he felt you up with it?\u201d William said, always willing to help out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in just a few. Take care of her.\u201d Lucien disappeared, his \u201cor else\u201d unsaid but no less evident.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell,\u201d William breathed, scrubbing a hand down his face. Alone with the pregnant Bride of Chucky, as well as the Seed of Chucky. And he was supposed to do some good? Yeah. That was so not happening. Best he could do was stay right where he was and not vomit blood.</p> <p>One by one, Lucien flashed the other warriors inside. Maddox first, then the others, then the women, then the two godly artifacts they had in their possession. Was the Budapest fortress under attack or something? Because damn.</p><p>Since no one touched the drawbridge, the gargoyles never came for them, so they were free to mill about\u2014aka run like hell away from DEFCON Five.</p><p>And still, hours later, Ashlyn was in labor. The worst kind, at that. The babies wanted out, needed out, but they were stuck, and no one here was a stupid doctor, so no one knew what the hell to do to help her.</p><p>Maddox was barely holding himself together as he paced, shouting, punching walls. The others had stopped exploring and now congregated in the hall outside Ashlyn\u2019s room, pacing alongside him. Except for Danika, the brave soul who\u2019d taken over as labor coach. She was inside the belly of the beast. Wait. She was peeking out the door.</p><p>\u201cGet over here,\u201d the blonde screeched at William.</p> <p>He was surprised he heard her. After Ashlyn\u2019s last round of curses, his ears were still leaking blood and brain matter. He\u2019d taken up residence against the far wall, arms crossed over his chest, and was all about warding away intruders into his personal space. \u201cWho, me?\u201d Again he found himself thumping his chest.</p><p>\u201cYes. You. Standing around wasn\u2019t part of your job description when I told the guys Ashlyn would need you for this.\u201d</p><p>Smart-ass. \u201cNews flash, little Dani. I know nothing about human births.\u201d Still, he entered the room and approached the bed. Sweat soaked both women from head to toe, and both were pale, trembling. Scared, too, judging from the size of their pupils.</p><p>\u201cBut you do know about demon births, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Sometimes he forgot that Danika was the current All-Seeing Eye, that she could peer into heaven and hell, past and present. And he\u2019d also forgotten Maddox was half human, half demon, and one quarter asshole, capable of spawning demonic offspring with special needs.</p><p>\u201cOkay, yeah. I\u2019ll take over.\u201d And he knew what to do now, which was a relief. For him. Ashlyn was about to experience the worst pain of her life. Pain she would beg to escape\u2014even at the hilt of a sword.</p> <p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t touching her,\u201d Maddox growled, stomping over to get in William\u2019s face. Bastard must have entered the room behind him.</p><p>William merely cocked a brow. \u201cYou want your woman to survive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d A hiss.</p><p>\u201cThen get the hell out of the room! You, too, Dani, and tell your man to stand guard and keep everyone else out, too. And I do mean everyone. No matter what they hear.\u201d If they got a whiff of what he planned, they\u2019d remove his hands with a rusty butter knife.</p><p>On the bed, Ashlyn was no longer writhing, no longer screaming. She was just a lump of flesh and covers. Getting weaker by the second...almost too late...</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d William shouted. \u201cI\u2019m the only chance the three of them have of surviving.\u201d</p><p>The petite Danika put her arm around the hulking Maddox and somehow managed to drag him into the hall. William strode over and shut the door, closing himself inside with Ashlyn. Then he moved the dresser in front of it, knowing he\u2019d need a few minutes\u2019 head start if anyone busted past Reyes.</p><p>Deep breath in, deep breath out. He was trembling as he unsheathed a dagger. \u201cSorry about this,\u201d he said, and got to work.</p> <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</p><p>AFTER A SHORT STINT in the dungeon below the castle, Paris freed himself from the tunnel-visioned gargoyles\u2019 newest restraints and found his friends. As glad as he was to see them, he was also upset by what had gone down while he was away. Ashlyn kidnapped by Galen. Legion trading herself to save the pregnant female. Kane, still missing. No contact. A dead-end trail even Amun now had trouble picking up.</p><p>He plopped on a bench someone had dragged into the hallway outside Ashlyn\u2019s room. He was trying to keep himself distracted and calm. Zacharel had Sienna. Had probably shown her to the realm\u2019s exit. She was probably on her way...wherever, her bond to this place at last broken, her will her own.</p><p>This was for the best.</p><p>The best sucked.</p><p>I want her, Sex said with a pout.</p><p>Me, too.</p><p>\u201cThis castle is lacking something,\u201d Viola said as she eased next to him.</p><p>She was the first to speak to him in a conversational tone. His friends had been too preoccupied with Ashlyn to do more than bark orders for water, towels and a muzzle for...someone. William probably.</p><p>The goddess had given up her I\u2019m-on-the-prowl dress and had changed into a glittery T-shirt and some kind of gray silk pants, the material so sheer he could see her underwear. Okay, so maybe she hadn\u2019t given up the gotta-get-me-some attitude altogether. She\u2019d pulled her pale, silvery hair into a high ponytail, the length swinging with her every movement.</p><p>\u201cHello? Are you listening to me? Of course you\u2019re listening to me! I need permission to redecorate or I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to leave.\u201d</p><p>I want her! In just a few seconds, Sex was foaming at the mouth, bouncing around in Paris\u2019s head, desperate for the goddess rather than Sienna. Far more desperate than the demon had ever been, in fact. I need her. I have to have her. Now, now, now.</p><p>What was that about? They\u2019d had Sienna earlier this very day. Sex should be shiny new until tomorrow.</p><p>Want, I want! Want, want, want!</p><p>Paris frowned. When Kaia strode past him a heartbeat later, her hips swaying with her every step, his cock following her like a heat-seeking missile, he really frowned.</p><p>Usually when he thought about taking a woman he\u2019d already been with, his erection deflated like a balloon. Or, if he didn\u2019t remember being with a particular woman, he simply couldn\u2019t get hard while he was around her. Surely this didn\u2019t mean...surely he couldn\u2019t...</p><p>Want her, need her! Want all of them!</p><p>Yeah. He could. He could take Viola (who he hadn\u2019t already had) and Kaia (who he had), Paris realized, his cock twitching with need for both of them. Rather than exciting him, the knowledge filled him with dread.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Your commitment to Sienna...I don\u2019t know...but I can have them all and I want them all.</p><p>But...but...Paris had dreamed of this, of finding a woman and being with her multiple times. Any woman. All women. Sienna, as well as all the others. After his first encounter with Sienna, he\u2019d thought she was his only hope for getting it. He hadn\u2019t understood, but then, he hadn\u2019t cared to understand. He\u2019d accepted and he\u2019d rolled. Yet now that he could have the same with someone else\u2014anyone else, apparently\u2014he still...wanted only Sienna, he realized.</p><p>He\u2019d never been with a woman like her. Someone who knew about him, but accepted him anyway. Someone who gave more than she took, even when he wanted her to take more than she gave. Someone with grit and fire who wasn\u2019t afraid to tell him off or apologize when she made a mistake. Someone who fought for what she believed in, did what it took to win, whatever it took. A hated quality once. Admired now.</p><p>Suddenly Strider was in his face, navy eyes glittering as he pressed the back of Paris\u2019s head into the wall. \u201cThat baton in your pants better be for the goddess next to you and not for the redhead who just walked past you.\u201d</p><p>Liked him better when he was preoccupied. Rather than engage the guy further and risk a fight Strider would have to win to stay upright, Paris nodded. \u201cRight. The goddess.\u201d Finally he understood Strider\u2019s annoying possessive streak. How the warrior would kill another man for even looking at what was his. Paris would kill male or female, god or goddess, good or evil, for making a play for Sienna.</p><p>There\u2019d been enough truth in his tone to mollify the warrior. \u201cOkay.\u201d As Strider straightened, he cracked the bones in his neck. \u201cOkay, then. We\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Paris watched him walk away, and caught Gideon\u2019s amused gaze. The keeper of Lies must have sensed the layer of deception. No one smelled a steaming pile faster than Gideon. No matter how small that pile was.</p><p>Guilty, Paris looked away. This shouldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>His demon cackled with glee, still wanting, still needing.</p><p>He felt dirty and disgusting and ashamed, was suddenly glad Sienna had chosen not to chase after him. If she saw him like this, he would lose it. He needed a shower. Needed to scrub his skin off, layer by layer, until the last drop of blood drained from him.</p><p>When the scent of chocolate and champagne began to waft from him, he cursed under his breath. I\u2019m not sleeping with Kaia or Viola or any other woman here. He didn\u2019t give a shit what his body or his demon demanded from him. He wasn\u2019t allowing it. Wasn\u2019t putting up with it. And you can\u2019t make me, can\u2019t lure them. Do you understand? You stop that right now, or I\u2019ll cut off my cock and laugh as we wither away.</p><p>But...but...</p><p>No! No excuses, no pleading. He wasn\u2019t sleeping with anyone today, tomorrow or the next day. Or even the next. No way. No one but Sienna, he thought with a determination that shocked him. And he didn\u2019t care how weak it made him. His hands still tingled from touching all that soft, warm skin. He still had her sweet, tropical scent in his nose. He wasn\u2019t giving that up, wasn\u2019t welcoming someone else.</p><p>\u201cHello. I\u2019m still here,\u201d Viola said, pouting like a child. \u201cDon\u2019t you care that I might leave if you don\u2019t give me what I want?\u201d</p><p>He so didn\u2019t have the patience to deal with her right now. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave the castle, okay? This is the safest place for all of you, safer than the Budapest fortress. Galen and his Hunters can\u2019t enter without serious injury, and if they try, we\u2019ll all be alerted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Plus, he\u2019d seen the crimson streaks over each of the windows and doors, and knew William had smeared his blood there. That meant the shadow monsters couldn\u2019t come inside again.</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about caring for our safety? We need portraits of me there, there and there.\u201d As she spoke, she pointed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure and alert the decorator,\u201d he said darkly.</p> <p>\u201cAnd there.\u201d</p><p>Sex hadn\u2019t yet given up the quest to get inside her, and Paris\u2019s cock did that twitching thing. He gnashed his molars. The goddess was gorgeous, no question about that. Naturally feminine and sensual in a way most could never be, even with centuries of training. And once upon a time, Paris would have been all over her. Cancel out her personality, and she was just the type he used to go for. Lushly curved.</p><p>Now, having basked in a satisfaction so complete he would never be the same, settling for anything less held no appeal. Sienna\u2019s lean body did it for him. Made him hunger. Blinded him to others. Her scent, her taste, both had been specifically designed to ramp him so high up no one else could ever hope to reach him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beyond maddening,\u201d Viola said.</p><p>He was maddening? Right. \u201cYou can decorate all you want. Happy?\u201d If he didn\u2019t change the subject, she\u2019d keep that shit up all day and he\u2019d end up introing her tongue to his blade. \u201cSo where\u2019s your dog?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy little princess is resting in my new room. Travel is so hard on his delicate constitution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Because all vampire Tasmanian devils possessed delicate constitutions. And what was up with calling a male \u201cprincess?\u201d Paris scrubbed a hand down his face, tired, hungry and torn up inside. Screw this. As soon as he knew Ashlyn and the babies were okay, he was taking off, finding Sienna and making sure she was okay. Then he\u2019d let her go once and for all so that, when he slept with someone else, he wouldn\u2019t be cheating, wouldn\u2019t destroy her sense of trust.</p><p>But maybe...maybe he\u2019d be with her one more time first. Sex with her was a revelation, not just because she\u2019d strengthened him, healed him and made him come harder than he ever had in his life, but also because sex with her wasn\u2019t about him. It was about them. Their needs. Their desires.</p><p>There was nothing dirty about it. Nothing tainted, one-sided or detached. They touched each other, kissed each other and pleasured each other because it felt good, because passion burned bright and inexorable.</p><p>\u201c\u2014listening to me?\u201d Viola threw up her arms in exasperation.</p><p>He shook his head, almost told her the truth, and then stopped himself. He did, and her demon would give her fits. She\u2019d probably follow him around like a lost little puppy. \u201cYeah, uh. I\u2019m fascinated. Interesting stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Maddox paced back and forth, back and forth in front of him. Reyes tried to stop him with a pat on the shoulder, but the warrior shrugged him off and kept going. Lucien tried next, but Maddox shrugged him aside, too. A mistake. In punishment, Anya tripped him as he passed her.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I always try to befriend the hopeless causes?\u201d Viola said. \u201cCould you be any more selfish, tuning me out when I have such riveting things to say? Then again, I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. I mean, you\u2019re married because of me, and you haven\u2019t ever even thanked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Like I said, fascinating,\u201d Paris said absently. And then her words penetrated. \u201cWhat\u2019s that now?\u201d He twisted on the bench, pinning her in place with his narrowed stare. \u201cDid you just say the word married in reference to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. And I never repeat myself. Except for those times that I do, in fact, repeat myself. But that\u2019s usually only when I\u2019m mentioning how silky my hair is, how sparkly my eyes are and how sexy my body is. Hey, do you think someone has a bag of peanuts? The spicy kind?\u201d</p><p>I will not choke the life out of her. \u201cExactly who am I married to, and when did the supposed ceremony happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did I forget to tell you again? You\u2019re married to your ghostly girlfriend, the one you tattooed yourself for. That\u2019s how undead marriages are forged. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, and all that. Well, that\u2019s how one-sided marriages are forged, anyway. She\u2019s not married to you, so she can tap whoever else she wants without violating any ancient laws and having to endure horrible punishment.\u201d</p><p>His jaw creaked open and closed as Viola continued to talk. And talk. \u201cShut up for a minute. How am I married to Sienna?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p> <p>But then, Viola\u2019s glare said enough.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m just in shock. I can\u2019t be... What you\u2019re saying isn\u2019t... There\u2019s just no way...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, it is and there is. That\u2019s part of the reason you\u2019re able to interact with her now. You bonded yourself to her.\u201d</p><p>Bonded. His mind had short-circuited. He was bonded. He was married to Sienna. She was his. His woman. For real. His wife. Forever.</p><p>His.</p><p>Wife.</p><p>And apparently, despite the fact that his body could now breach any feminine core of his choosing, he couldn\u2019t do so without violating a law he\u2019d never heard of, thereby sentencing himself to some kind of punishment. A punishment he wasn\u2019t sure who would mete out.</p><p>His demon\u2019s reaction to the other women now made sense. Sex had been on the right track. With Paris\u2019s commitment to Sienna, his infidelity would now feed the demon. Making love with Sienna would, too, though. He\u2019d married her before finding her, and they\u2019d since made love three times.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he croaked when there was a lag in Viola\u2019s monologue. He wanted this, he realized. He wanted this to be true so badly he could taste his own anticipation. Could feel the hum in his blood, the song in his ears. He wanted to be bound to Sienna in the most irrevocable of ways.</p><p>Viola patted him on top of his head. \u201cAs if I\u2019m ever wrong. But Paris, listen to me. We\u2019ve got to get serious for a minute.\u201d</p><p>They weren\u2019t serious already? \u201cSo you weren\u2019t serious about the marriage thing?\u201d He would kill her. Just press on her carotid and snuff her out.</p><p>\u201cOf course I was serious.\u201d She cupped his cheeks, her expression sad. Then she sniffed, and licked her lips. \u201cHmm, you smell good.\u201d Closer...closer...she leaned in. Sniffed at his neck. \u201cReally, really good.\u201d</p><p>Stupid demon.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me the truth,\u201d she said, her voice lowering, going husky. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m the most beautiful woman you\u2019ve ever met? And more important, do I look fat in this outfit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so going to give you to the fallen angel,\u201d he muttered, putting a little distance between them. Her hold on him tightened, her eyes already glazed with want. \u201cThat\u2019ll be his punishment for chasing me.\u201d</p><p>A slow, confused blink. \u201cThe fallen who?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t remember her own ardent suitor. Nice.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me? Why do I feel this way?\u201d she asked, just before a low moan left her. \u201cI don\u2019t find you attractive, don\u2019t want to rock your world, and yet, I\u2019m ready to climb on board.\u201d</p><p>A scream ripped through the entire enclosure, saving Paris from having to form a response. Everyone in the hall stilled, not even daring to breathe.</p><p>\u201cAshlyn.\u201d Maddox rushed toward the bedroom door, but Reyes tackled him.</p><p>The keeper of Violence fought for all he was worth, and several other warriors had to dive into the pile to shut him down. Paris was about to join the fray when he caught sight of familiar black wings at the entrance of the hallway.</p><p>His gaze shot up, and he met gorgeous hazels that were wider than usual. Sienna\u2019s face was flushed, her eyes red and puffed as if she\u2019d been crying, and her mouth swollen. He was running at her a second later, leaping over the pile of his friends, tripping, getting up, and running some more.</p><p>SIENNA WASN\u2019T MAD. What she felt was so beyond mad no single word could describe it. A mix of rage, guilt, sorrow and more rage, maybe. And then some more rage with a splash of heartbreak. And a lot more rage. Her sister was dead, and the queen of the Titans had killed her. Just slit her throat and left her on the floor as if she were garbage.</p><p>When Cronus had dropped Sienna here, all she\u2019d wanted was to find Paris and throw herself in his arms. Not to cry, she doubted she\u2019d ever cry again, but to forget, if only for a little while. Instead, she discovered some strange beauty had beaten her to the finish line.</p><p>A beauty his friends probably liked. The group had apparently taken over Sienna\u2019s castle, and they were likely to tackle Sienna as they\u2019d just tackled each other if she took a single step in Paris\u2019s direction.</p><p>The big, hulking giants were heavily armed, an army of menace, each soldier possessing a feral red gaze that spoke volumes. The main chorus being I\u2019ll smile when I kill you, but they never went for kill strikes. They were simply trying to subdue the one on the bottom of the pile.</p><p>What seemed an eternity ago, she had studied these men for nefarious purposes. Seeing them live and in person should have freaked her out. And maybe it would have, if Wrath hadn\u2019t just whipped up a party in her brain, tossing out image after image, all of them involving the handsy blonde.</p><p>With her smile, her laugh, her everything, she enticed men to fall in love with her. Their adulation was her nourishment. And then, when she had them at her feet, she left them, just moved on to the next one, and forgot all about them.</p><p>That\u2019s what she would do to Paris. And why wouldn\u2019t he fall for her? Sienna wondered. She was the most beautiful woman Sienna had ever seen. Hell, even she was tempted.</p><p>Paris appeared in front of her, gathering her in his arms, rubbing his cheek against hers. He smelled of desire she recognized, such heady desire. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby? What happened?\u201d</p><p>Glaring up at him, she tugged from his hold. \u201cI\u2019m gone a few hours\u2014\u201d and in that time had decided to be with Galen to save Paris\u2019s life, she thought but didn\u2019t add \u201c\u2014and already you\u2019ve moved on.\u201d She gave a bitter laugh. Even knowing this would happen couldn\u2019t have prepared her for the flood of pain actually seeing it wrought. \u201cYou tried to warn me, didn\u2019t you, and I told you I understood.\u201d Well, I don\u2019t! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMoved on? With Viola?\u201d He grimaced. \u201cHell, no. We were just talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Your body language said plenty.\u201d Before, she\u2019d only seen his hard-on\u2014and it had been pointed at the blonde. Now she felt it, hard and long and thick, and sweet heaven, she still wanted it. Still wanted him.</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are. You\u2019re jealous.\u201d He laughed, awe and delight bubbling in the undertones. \u201cCan I just tell you how much that turns me on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything turns you on,\u201d she snarled, struggling to dampen her anger. He was just so damned pleased with himself. And her! \u201cAnd I\u2019m not jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, and I love it. Anyway, something\u2019s going on with my demon, that\u2019s all. I swear to you, I haven\u2019t been with the goddess and I won\u2019t be. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a goddess?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho holds no appeal for me.\u201d</p><p>He could be lying. He could be telling the truth. Actually, he was telling the truth, she decided in an instant, not needing Wrath\u2019s help. Paris wasn\u2019t the type to lie. Consequences weren\u2019t something he feared.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Her shoulders sagged with defeat. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter? Are you giving up on me? On us?\u201d He gripped her forearms and shook her. \u201cI know we said we\u2019d part when you could leave the realm, but I want to revisit that decision. It\u2019s no longer an option for me. And I know you\u2019re going to have a difficult time believing this, but no matter how my body reacts to others, no matter what my demon wants, you are it for me. Do you understand?\u201d Another shake, harder than before.</p><p>\u201cUh, Paris,\u201d Strider called. \u201cWho you talking to, buddy?\u201d</p><p>He twisted, and she peeked around him. The warriors had stopped fighting each other, and everyone but the scarred one and the blonde goddess were eyeing Paris as if he\u2019d just flipped his ever-loving lid.</p> <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t see me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He was saved from having to reply to her or his friends when the door in the center of the hall swung open and the dark-haired William stepped into the hall. He was pale, clearly shaken to his soul and bathed in blood.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><p>William clapped to gain everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cAll right, listen up. I\u2019ve got good news and bad news. Because I\u2019m such a positive person, we\u2019ll start with the good. Ashlyn survived the birthing, and so did her personal horde.\u201d</p><p>The hallway echoed with breathy sighs of relief...none louder than Maddox\u2019s own.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the bad?\u201d someone demanded.</p><p>After a dramatic pause, the warrior said, \u201cI\u2019m out of conditioner. I need someone to flash out of here and get me some. Hint, I\u2019m looking at you, Lucien. And, yeah, you\u2019re welcome for my amazing contrib to your happy family. Little terrors clawed me up but good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam!\u201d someone else snapped. \u201cStay on track, and keep the unnecessary details to a minimum. We\u2019re dying here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s gratitude for you. So anyway, come on, come in, and meet your nephew and niece, Murder and Mayhem. Or, if you want to call them by their nicknames, and I\u2019m sure you will the moment they get their mitts on you, Pistol and Shank.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</p><p>AS HAPPY AS PARIS WAS with the births, as much as he wanted to meet the babies, he had to take care of his woman first. He tossed Sienna over his shoulder with the finesse of a bulldozer, shouted, \u201cNo one enter my bedroom, no matter what you hear,\u201d and stalked to the room he\u2019d used before, passing through the hall of statues. Each of his friends cast him weird looks before he rounded the corner. Mainly because they were all laid out flat and hadn\u2019t recovered from Maddox kicking and shoving them out of his way, so they were dazed, but also because they assumed Paris had just spent a good five minutes talking to himself.</p><p>I want her still, Sex said with no small measure of surprise.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll get her.</p><p>Sienna had been stunned silent and remained still at first, but with his every step she worked herself into more of a lather. Soon she was slapping at his back, jerking at his hair and attempting to knee him in the face and balls. Up the stairs he went, down another hall, barely able to prevent his emasculation. He shouldered his way inside the chamber and slammed the door with a backward kick.</p><p>He\u2019d been torpedoing his way into a black rage, but seeing Sienna had calmed him. Just like that. Zacharel could blow him, because clearly he would never hurt this woman.</p><p>She\u2019d come back for him. That deserved a reward.</p><p>He set her on her feet, and she immediately launched herself into full-blown attack. To be honest, he was glad as hell. Anything was better than that moment of defeat. Her little fists pummeled at him, and he accepted the abuse. Until he realized she\u2019d made an improper fist and was actually hurting herself. He wound an arm around her waist, spun her and slammed her into the hard line of his body to still her.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d As she struggled, he pulled her thumb out from beneath her fingers and rearranged her fist. \u201cHit like this.\u201d Done, he released her.</p><p>She swung back around to beat at him some more, and this time the blows stung. \u201cYou aren\u2019t walking out of this room until I\u2019ve killed you!\u201d</p><p>That\u2019d be a nice little trick, and maybe something to try later. \u201cI\u2019ll let you do anything you want to me, but I\u2019d like an explanation first. What\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d She leapt away from him, paced like a caged lion. Energy radiated from her, practically lifting her hair off her head. \u201cIt\u2019s about the fact that all men suck! And in case you didn\u2019t realize, you\u2019re included in their numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would hope so. Otherwise our romance would be missing something.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glittered with jade fire, the gold lost. \u201cWas that a crack about your penis? Because if so, you can do better.\u201d She stalked to the dresser and shoved with all her might, knocking the thing to the ground. Wood splintered. The granite surface shattered. The drawers spilled from their holders. Scowling, panting, she grabbed one and lobbed it at him.</p><p>He ducked, and the empty container smacked into the door. Both fractured. Another quickly followed, and he barely managed to dodge it.</p><p>\u201cWhy are your friends here? Aren\u2019t you afraid I\u2019ll spy on them and learn their secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t. Not anymore. He\u2019d judged her harshly before, but he wasn\u2019t going to make that mistake again. \u201cJust like you aren\u2019t afraid I\u2019ll sleep with anyone else while we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>Another drawer. \u201cThat\u2019s what you told Susan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019ve lived with the guilt ever since. I will never do that to you. Tell me you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know that, but we weren\u2019t together a few minutes ago. Which means you went after the first tail to twitch in your direction the second we were separated. But I\u2019m not your girlfriend, and I will never be your girlfriend, so I can\u2019t complain, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou won\u2019t ever be my girlfriend.\u201d Because you\u2019re already my wife. Those words. He\u2019d never thought to use them in regard to himself. But now that he had, yeah, his possessive instincts flared, insisting on their due. Didn\u2019t help that Sienna was the sexiest female he\u2019d ever seen. A live wire, sizzling, crackling, the essence of passion. Yeah, he was hard as a steel pipe.</p><p>Another drawer was flung his way. Only four more were left. He\u2019d let her have them, and then he was going in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sick of this world, the lying and the tricking and the killing.\u201d One. \u201cThat woman is going to pay. Oh, she\u2019s going to pay so bad.\u201d Two. \u201cI\u2019m going to join in and do a little killing of my own. Not through Wrath, but with my own hands.\u201d Three. \u201cThat bastard Cronus thinks he can manipulate me, but he can\u2019t. I\u2019m done with all of you!\u201d Four. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to save you, so there! You can go to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Paris barreled forward, snagging her around the waist and tossing her on the bed. As she bounced on the mattress, her wings shot out to slow her momentum. He dove for her before she could catch herself and hover in the air, and for once he didn\u2019t try to be careful. He pinned her, trapping her legs beneath the muscled weight of his own and her arms over her head. She tried to buck him off, but all she succeeded in doing was rubbing his hard-on against her clit.</p><p>A cry of need parted those pretty lips.</p><p>More!</p><p>\u201cYou wet for me, baby?\u201d He didn\u2019t ask for permission, but transferred the shackling of her wrists to one hand and shoved up her shirt and bra with the other, baring her breasts. Her nipples were red and swollen, begging for him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and he knew she lied. \u201cNot wet, not wet, soooo not wet.\u201d Yeah, she knew it, too.</p><p>He dipped down and sucked. She released another of those beautiful cries, her hips undulating against him. He kept sucking and she kept bucking against him, until he couldn\u2019t stand the pressure anymore and shoved his hand down her pants, past those panties and straight into the heat of her. She practically bowed off the mattress.</p><p>Yes, please, yes.</p><p>One finger, two, three. He thrust them home, as deep as he could get them.</p><p>\u201cParis... I... Oh, yes, yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my girl.\u201d She drenched his hand, just the way he liked, so hot and silky, fitting him so damn perfectly, even this way. \u201cWhen you used your mouth on me, I wanted to have my face buried between your legs. I still do. And next time, I will. I\u2019m going to have all this honey down my throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis...I\u2019m going to... I\u2019m so close already.\u201d Her eyes were squeezed shut, those long lashes fused together. \u201cLet go of my hands. I want to touch you, too. Need to touch you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou think those little taps you gave me weren\u2019t foreplay? And hell, baby, I was hard for you long before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. You still mad at me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot to. Gotta give you something more.\u201d He removed his fingers just before she climaxed, and she screeched in frustration. \u201cGotta give you something better.\u201d</p><p>Her inhalations rasped in, her exhalations stormed out, both quick and heavy. Need truly was riding her hard\u2014but not as hard as he was going to. He was drunk with his passion for her, his head swimming with it, his veins burning with it.</p><p>He jerked her zipper down, but didn\u2019t bother with shoving her pants away. Couldn\u2019t. He was too busy undoing his own. He didn\u2019t shove those down, either, and once his cock was free, he poised himself at her entrance. She couldn\u2019t open her legs very wide, the material wouldn\u2019t let her, so when he pushed in, he had to bear down some of his weight. But when he was in, he was really in, her inner walls locked around him, tighter than any fist he\u2019d ever made.</p><p>She screamed at the contact, and he loved the sound.</p> <p>Every thrust was a slow grind against her, and yeah, his body rubbed her clit with every downward glide. No longer did her words make any sense. She was panting and incoherent and lost to an all-consuming fervor. Sex, too. Hell, Paris, too. His balls were drawing up tighter and tighter, yet still sliding against the tops of her thighs.</p><p>Her arms fought his hold\u2014oh, baby, he hadn\u2019t let her go, had he?\u2014but he kept a steady grip, her breasts thrust up, her nipples rubbing his chest, the friction sparking all different kinds of flames. Satisfaction, lust, clawing need, contentment. With his free hand, he cupped her chin.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He slowed his thrusts.</p><p>Took a moment, but ultimately she obeyed. Those hazel eyes were fever-bright, glazed, her pupils utterly blown.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not done with me. Do you hear me? You are not done. You are mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...\u201d Another scream, her inner walls milking him, her hips lifting...lifting...even lifting his weight, sinking him deeper than should have been possible.</p> <p>Sex shouted at the amazing pleasure.</p><p>And like that, Paris erupted, the orgasm churning in his spine, shooting through his sac, up his erection and into her, pumping his seed straight into her body. A white-hot jet, again and again. He came so hard he saw stars.</p><p>When he was at last emptied out, he opened his eyes to find Sienna had collapsed on the mattress and he had collapsed on top of her, was probably smashing her. He rolled to his side, but they were still connected so he took her with him. Her head just kind of lolled into the hollow of his neck.</p><p>There was a long period of silence as they caught their breath and their heartbeats slowed, but all the while he knew one fact to be true: he\u2019d never experienced sex like that with anyone else and he never would again. Hell, he didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cI never had a temper before,\u201d she murmured groggily.</p><p>He ran a hand up and down the ridges of her spine. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve got one now, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>She bit his collarbone, a playful nip. He expected Sex to respond, but the demon had gone to sleep. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to calm you down, and I did. Missionary accomplished.\u201d</p> <p>Another nip. \u201cI meant, we shouldn\u2019t have had angry sex.\u201d</p><p>He said, \u201cCouldn\u2019t help myself. I liked your temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tell. Is there a position you don\u2019t excel at, though? You\u2019re giving me a complex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there is, will you help me practice until I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many times you\u2019ll lose respect for yourself.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. He just couldn\u2019t help himself. He was...happy. She was teasing him, as if they were friends. They were friends. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to sleep with the goddess,\u201d he said. \u201cI swear to you. Never will I sleep with that female.\u201d</p><p>She placed a kiss just above his heart. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t promise things like that. Because even as jealous as I was, and yes, I\u2019m freely admitting to a stalkerlike rage, I would rather you slept with a thousand like her than weaken and die.\u201d</p><p>His chest got tight. Gently he pulled out of her sweet, sweet body, and they both moaned at the loss. He stripped her, stripped himself, then placed his gun on the nightstand beside the bed, and his blade under his pillow. Safety taken care of, he went right back to cuddling Sienna into his side. First, though, he gave her nipples a Daddy\u2019s back kiss.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about that, and about what you were so upset about, because I know there\u2019s more to it than the goddess,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a few minutes. Right now, I want to say a few things, and then I want you to tell me something about you. I want to know you better.\u201d In all ways.</p><p>They weren\u2019t leaving this bed until he\u2019d seen her brain naked, too, and that was that.</p><p>\u201cO-kay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusan Dille,\u201d he said. \u201cI cared for her. I wanted something to work with her, but I was growing weak. Finally I caved and slept with someone else. I was miserable, she found out, and things only got worse from there. I don\u2019t want that with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes me so different?\u201d she whispered. \u201cI mean, how can you be with me more than once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wondered about that myself, and I think it\u2019s because my desire for you is more powerful than my demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s... Oh, Paris. That\u2019s the sweetest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now it\u2019s your turn for a confession. Start talking.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</p><p>\u201cI, WELL... HMM,\u201d Sienna said.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby.\u201d Paris combed his fingers through her hair. \u201cLook past my terrible personality and hideous looks and throw me a bone. Teach me how to woo you properly.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI\u2019d argue the hideous looks part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not the terrible personality? Ouch. That hurts, baby.\u201d</p><p>Her next snort was half-bathed in laughter. \u201cWell, this won\u2019t teach you anything but my stupidity. Once I tried to spray tan my freckles away and ended up looking like a diseased carrot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore your freckles, and my favorite fantasy involves licking every single one of them. More secrets, though. I want more.\u201d Was so hungry for them.</p><p>A heavy pause, and when she next spoke, she\u2019d lost her air of playfulness. \u201cThe guy I was going to marry, well, I was going to have his baby, but halfway through\u2014\u201d a shudder rocked her \u201c\u2014well, I lost her. My baby girl. Afterward I just sort of broke down and my fianc\u00e9e left. I was moved to a different division of the Hunters\u2019 enterprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Sienna, oh, baby, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes, quickly masked. \u201cI recovered.\u201d</p><p>No one ever recovered fully from that kind of loss.</p><p>\u201cI never allow myself to think of her. That\u2019s probably unhealthy, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s how you survive. What did you name her?\u201d He knew she\u2019d given the little girl a name.</p><p>Another pause, then a hesitant, \u201cRebecca Skye.\u201d</p><p>He remembered when she asked him if he even wanted to have kids. Had she ever wanted to have another? Probably. The loss would have left a wound inside her, one that would never fully heal. He knew that kind of loss well. But pregnancy wasn\u2019t a possibility for the undead. Still, he wondered if adoption was. Perhaps she could take in one of the kids with unexplained abilities Anya had hidden around the world to save them from Hunters. Sienna would make an amazing mother, protective, loving, fierce.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in heaven, I think. Not Cronus\u2019s heaven, or this heaven, or wherever we are, and not Zacharel\u2019s heaven, either. I\u2019ve never told anyone this, but when I died, I knew there was someplace wonderful to spend eternity, as well as someplace terrible. Maybe Cronus is my personal hell, my something terrible, but Rebecca is in that other place, that far better place, where someone far better than Cronus or Zacharel\u2019s Deity rules. And now I want to talk about something else. Something light.\u201d</p><p>Light. He could give her light, even though he had a thousand questions about this \u201cbetter place\u201d and this \u201cbetter\u201d ruler, and her suffering and her dreams. \u201cI enjoy watching romantic comedies, action adventures, horror, whatever. Anything but subtitles. That artsy crap is lame.\u201d He cupped the sweetest ass on the planet and found himself hard all over again.</p><p>\u201cTell me more.\u201d With a voice full of rasp, she said, \u201cI want to know about you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you anything you want to know.\u201d And he meant that.</p><p>\u201cYou and your friends...you\u2019re really close.\u201d</p><p>Those same friends would have told him she had a hankering for information so that she could use it against him. Paris knew better. \u201cWe were created together. We\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Zeus made us from the blood of his best warriors, steel, baser instincts, things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have no mother or father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Blood family isn\u2019t always hearts and flowers, but there\u2019s comfort there. I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t have that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust made me that much closer to my boys, but I did sometimes wonder what it would have been like. Then I\u2019d think about what I did have, men who would die for me, and I would realize I\u2019ve got everything I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving someone who is willing to die for you is rare. And several someones? Awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you have that. It\u2019s better than family.\u201d</p><p>How wistful she sounded. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Never.\u201d</p><p>And didn\u2019t that just break his heart. I might die for her, he thought. Might throw myself in front of a sword for her. \u201cNow I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry. I mean, you died for me, but I haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d Oh, damn. Wrong words. He expected her to tense, waited for the mood to shatter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t, it didn\u2019t. \u201cYeah, I did, didn\u2019t I? You are lucky.\u201d</p><p>No animosity, just a kind amusement, a contemplative dreaming. There went his heart again, breaking into a few more pieces.</p><p>\u201cWhen we met,\u201d he said, \u201cyou claimed to be writing a romance novel. You even had pages. I remember how they scattered at your feet when I slammed into you. Was that true? Were they yours? Since waking up in that cell, I figured they were a lie, but now that I know you better, I\u2019m thinking differently.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were mine, yes. I love romance novels, and I did want to write one. Maybe I will one day. Not that there\u2019s a publisher for the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve already got a built-in audience of one. I want to read what you wrote, and what you will one day write. Promise?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, her tongue caressing his skin, too, and oh, did he like that. \u201cHave you, uh, ever fallen in love?\u201d she asked, ignoring his demand.</p><p>Okay, all right. He\u2019d let her lack of an answer about the novel slide. For now. \u201cOnce I thought I was, but it didn\u2019t work out. And there were a few times, after I was with a woman, that I would wish for more and hang around. A few times I even dated a woman without sleeping with her, hoping for some type of relationship, but all along I\u2019d have to sleep with others, so I\u2019d feel guilty and then I\u2019d just stop seeing her so that the guilt would fade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. Not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t help that Hunters threaten everyone you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you deal, having a group of people hunting you, hating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy, I won\u2019t lie. Sometimes we push ourselves over the edge. Drugs, alcohol, sex, whatever our particular vice is, but we go on and we look out for each other.\u201d The warmth of her breath stroked over him, tantalizing him. \u201cAnd lately we are Addams Family normal\u2014you know, doing the hearts and flowers thing while navigating everything our enemies throw at us.\u201d</p><p>Her nails dug into his chest. \u201cThe Hunters...more than half of the organization is brainwashed. We\u2019re told over and over how evil you are, how you are responsible for everything bad that has ever happened to us, to everyone. How perfect our lives could be if you were gone. They show us pictures, horrible pictures of torture, disease and death, and they prey on our weaknesses. Like with my sister, telling me that little girls wouldn\u2019t be kidnapped if there were no demons in the world.\u201d</p> <p>First she\u2019d lost her sister, then her baby. He squeezed her tight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for her loss.\u201d For all the crap she\u2019d endured throughout her too-short life. Crap he\u2019d only added to. \u201cI should have told you that when you first mentioned her, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we had only just reconnected and didn\u2019t trust each other.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her temple. \u201cWe\u2019ve always known the Hunters were studying us. Is that how you knew I was in Rome that day? How you knew the romance novel would distract me, and what drug to use on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew through Dean Stefano, my boss, and he knew through Galen. Galen, I\u2019m sure, knew through Rhea, Cronus\u2019s wife. Funny, but I never understood the chain of command until after my death.\u201d</p><p>Paris couldn\u2019t help himself and gave her temple another kiss. They were getting heavy again, and he didn\u2019t mind that, wanted to travel that road with her, all roads with her, but she didn\u2019t and he would honor her wishes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to switch gears for a minute, okay?\u201d</p><p>Her relief was palpable as she said, \u201cPlease do.\u201d One at a time, she plucked her nails from his skin.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve never been married, but other than the douche who left you have you ever...wanted to be?\u201d He tried to ask it casually, as if the answer was no biggie, but he couldn\u2019t keep the yearning from his tone.</p> <p>Her reaction, when it came, was one of shock, and he wasn\u2019t sure whether that was surprise-party good or you-just-hit-my-car bad. She jerked upright, that dark flood of hair draping one bare shoulder. Her eyes were still more green than brown and they dominated her pixie face. The lips he\u2019d kissed until they were puffed and red were parted.</p><p>\u201cI...I...\u201d</p><p>Balls to the wall. He would finish this. \u201cI want you to marry me,\u201d he said. He wanted her tethered to him the same way he was tethered to her. Mentally, emotionally and physically.</p><p>\u201cParis...\u201d</p><p>He threaded his fingers through her hair. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything right now. Just think about it.\u201d Because, bottom line? No more talk of separating. They were staying together, and that was that. He wasn\u2019t letting her go, and he sure as hell wasn\u2019t cheating on her. No matter the cost to himself.</p><p>From now on, there was only one sheath for his sword. Would there be problems? Complications? Oh, yeah. Probably more than he was aware of, and he was aware of plenty. But he\u2019d rather deal with those problems with her than be without her and have smooth sailing.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you something,\u201d she whispered, the defeat returning in an instant. \u201cI lied. I won\u2019t kill her, and he can manipulate me. Otherwise, the rest of you are dead, too, and I can\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t kill who? Who can\u2019t manipulate you? Tell me, and I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d I will slay her dragons.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. Rhea, she...she... When my sister Skye was taken, we were swimming in the neighborhood pool. Mom told us never to go there alone, but I was fourteen and thought I could handle things, and Skye wanted to swim so badly. We were just supposed to walk to the park, but we went to the pool instead. It was so crowded that day, and I had to go to the bathroom, and when I came back out, she was being dragged away by a stranger. Everyone must have thought she was throwing a fit, because no one stopped them, and I couldn\u2019t get to them.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to offer comfort, to tell her it wasn\u2019t her fault, that even though she\u2019d gone against her mother\u2019s orders, she wasn\u2019t the one who had abducted the little girl, but she wasn\u2019t finished.</p><p>\u201cToday I learned that all these years Skye has been alive. Until recently. She was murdered. Rhea murdered her. If I\u2019d only found her earlier, but I didn\u2019t, and now I have to live with the knowledge that she...that I...\u201d She was rambling, the words spewing out as if they\u2019d been trapped for a long time and were now tangling on her tongue as they fought for freedom.</p><p>He ached for her. As he\u2019d never ached for anything, he ached for her, and he didn\u2019t take the decision to slay her dragons lightly. He\u2019d do what needed doing. \u201cGo on, baby. Tell me the rest.\u201d</p><p>A shudder moved through her. She inhaled forcefully. \u201cCronus told me that Skye was Galen\u2019s prisoner, then he told me that he didn\u2019t actually know where she was, then he showed me her lifeless, bloody body.\u201d</p><p>Paris had known the bastard was low, but this...he had no words. His reckoning with Cronus needed to happen soon\u2014with knives. No wonder Sienna had been so upset when she\u2019d returned to the castle. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby. If I could take away your pain, I would.\u201d Finally he told her what he\u2019d wanted to tell her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. It was never your fault. You aren\u2019t responsible for the things other people do. Never have been, never will be. This is their shame, not yours. But I know it hurts, I do, and however you want to handle it, I will help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe showed me because he expects me to spy on Galen and to...to be with him.\u201d</p><p>Spots of black flashed over his eyes. \u201cWhen you say be with Galen, do you mean be with him sexually?\u201d</p><p>A shameful nod, and maybe even a bit resolved, as if she deserved nothing better.</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019d even consider it tells me that you want to punish yourself,\u201d he said, comprehension a slap in the face. \u201cFor what you did to me, and what you think you allowed to happen to your sister.\u201d</p><p>Her chin jutted stubbornly. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what else is it you did exactly, that some part of you thinks you need to be punished? Fought for a cause you believed in? Check. Slept with a man you were attracted to, despite everything else? Check. Saved him when you could have left him to a slow, torturous death? Check.\u201d</p><p>Her hand balled into a (proper) fist. \u201cI told you that I hated you as I lay dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery couple says things they don\u2019t mean when they\u2019re fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I meant it at the time! And before that, I drugged you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I planned to screw you and leave you like I\u2019d done to a thousand others.\u201d She flinched at his crudeness, but he kept going. \u201cAnd guess what? At the time I was blithe about it. I loved women, and I protected them, but I still used them. In my mind, it was my right. I needed a wake-up call, and you gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses for me. You\u2019ve seen my past, and you know I\u2019ve spoken true.\u201d</p><p>She snapped her teeth at him. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying you bear me no ill will? None at all?\u201d A snort lacking any hint of amusement.</p><p>He fisted her hair a lot harder than he\u2019d intended, but he didn\u2019t loosen his grip. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m saying I adore you.\u201d</p><p>Once again, she floundered for a response. The anger drained from her, and utter longing peered down at him. \u201cAdore?\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>\u201cYour ears are working just fine.\u201d</p><p>The harshness of his reply had her sighing dreamily, something that puzzled and aroused him. \u201cI was wrong earlier. This is the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me.\u201d</p><p>And so I\u2019ll be stepping up my game now. If that made her happy, his A-Game was gonna make her blissful. \u201cNothing to say in return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Cronus says that my being with Galen is the only way to keep you and your friends safe.\u201d</p><p>Hell, no. When they\u2019d lived in the heavens, Galen had been one of Paris\u2019s go-to guys. They\u2019d hung together, fought together. Paris had admired the guy\u2019s emotional distance, his ability to do whatever was necessary to finish a job successfully. And okay, fine, they\u2019d shared women, sometimes even at the same time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hadn\u2019t cared then. He cared now. Not just because Galen was Enemy One, but because Sienna was his and his alone. She was staying with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going back to Galen.\u201d No way, not ever. Actually, Paris would die first. \u201cAnd just a quick FYI. Apparently my friends plugged the keeper of Hope full of bullets earlier today. He\u2019s no good to anyone right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019ll recover, I know he will, and then...then...\u201d The rest of the story flooded from her. The Chamber of Futures, the portraits, the three possible outcomes for the world. For Cronus. For him.</p> <p>Too much to digest at once, but still, nothing changed his mind about Sienna staying put.</p><p>\u201cWe have time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have time to figure this out, and we will. But you\u2019re not going to him. You\u2019re mine. Only mine. And I\u2019m yours. I will never sleep with anyone else. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying? Never. When I said you were it for me, I meant it. No one else, whether you\u2019re with me or not. And Sienna, you will be with me.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, her mouth fell open, snapped closed. \u201cDo not say things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I will do more than say it. I will blood oath it.\u201d He reached for the daggers under the pillow, but she threw herself over his body and batted the weapon to the floor. Then, clearly suspecting he\u2019d just reach for another weapon, she swiped her arm over the nightstand and sent the gun flying.</p><p>Now, there was the shocker of a lifetime. He wasn\u2019t offended by her resistance, though. She wanted him safe, alive, thriving. Was even willing to sacrifice her happiness for his.</p> <p>\u201cDid you just challenge me?\u201d he asked. They were flesh to flesh, male to female. Her wings spread, blocking out the rest of the room. She was all that he saw, all that he felt. Her breasts pressed into his chest, her nipples already beaded for him. Her core rubbed against his swollen length, and her legs splayed over his. \u201cI think you just challenged me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. Quick fact\u2014you mess with a man\u2019s weapons, and you might as well knee him in the balls. You\u2019ll get the same results. So I accept.\u201d Moving so quickly she couldn\u2019t possibly resist, he flipped her over, onto her back, spread her legs and shoved inside.</p><p>No preliminaries. Just straight-up, hard-core sex in the most basic fashion. She was wet, so very wet, so they had no problems.</p><p>\u201cParis!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, that\u2019s it. Take me all the way in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs this how you reward all challengers?\u201d she asked between panting breaths.</p><p>\u201cOnly you.\u201d</p><p>Her moan of pleasure filled the room, blending with his hiss of inexorable bliss. By the time he finished with her, she would know the man she belonged with\u2014because there would be no part of her that he left untouched.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</p><p>GALEN APPEARED IN THE CENTER of the bedroom, and Legion shrank deeper into her shadowed corner. She\u2019d been here for over an hour, having whisked herself to the coordinates he\u2019d given her. She had no idea what the rest of the place looked like. Coward that she was, she hadn\u2019t left the relative safety of the room. To her immense relief, no one had entered, either.</p><p>Though she\u2019d been tempted, she hadn\u2019t even explored the rest of the chamber. Gorgeous pile after gorgeous pile of shiny gold coins, glittering jewels and odd, ancient weapons abounded. Weapons she couldn\u2019t use against her captor, so what was the point of studying them?</p><p>While Galen had worn white at the temple, he\u2019d since donned a red robe. A drip, drip, dripping red robe. She frowned. A copper tang coated the air. That\u2019s when she realized. Not a red robe, but a blood-soaked one.</p><p>His knees gave out and he fell, barely catching himself before a face-plant. His wings were tattered, and there were blade hilts and arrows protruding from his chest.</p> <p>All that blood...</p><p>\u2014hands grasping at her breasts, her thighs\u2014</p><p>\u2014teeth scraping over her skin\u2014</p><p>\u2014claws in her eyes, plucking them out\u2014</p><p>\u2014something hard between her legs\u2014</p><p>\u2014laughter, so much laughter\u2014</p><p>\u2014shackles on her wrists, her ankles\u2014</p><p>Bile burned holes in her stomach and escaped, quickly spreading through the rest of her. She covered her mouth with a trembling hand, fighting tears. The memories of her time in hell never left her, but sometimes they completely overtook her, dragging her into a different sort of hell. One of humiliation, degradation, helplessness and horror.</p><p>\u201cFox!\u201d Galen\u2019s ragged shout rang out. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Legion must have whimpered at the sound of that shout, because Galen\u2019s head whipped in her direction. His sky-blue eyes were rimmed with red, his cheeks streaked with dirt. Was he going to watch as \u201cFox\u201d did things to her?</p><p>His expression softened. Only a little, but enough to stave off the encroaching hysteria. \u201cYou think I\u2019m in bad condition, you should see the other guy.\u201d</p><p>Tendrils of hope reached out, tried to wrap around her. Hope for something better. Hope for a future with the man in front of her. Panic infused her, after all, and she fought them with all of her mental strength. Finally the tendrils thinned, vanished.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she croaked.</p><p>He frowned at her.</p><p>Rushed footsteps beyond, and the door swung open. A tall, slender woman with jet-black hair and angular features flowed inside. She was attractive, in a regal way, with eyes like the differing temperatures of flames, an odd mix of blue and gold.</p><p>But there was a gray cast to her skin, bruises under her eyes, and though she gripped a gun in both hands, she was trembling. A quick scan, and she found Legion. Lifted one of the guns.</p><p>Yes, Legion thought, strangely comforted all of a sudden. Yes. An end. Finally.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Despite his injuries, Galen dove in front of her.</p><p>The girl\u2014Fox?\u2014had her finger off the trigger in a heartbeat, the weapon lowered.</p><p>Disappointment settled on Legion\u2019s shoulders. Perhaps she should have ended herself long before now. Why hadn\u2019t she? Suddenly she didn\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hurt her,\u201d Galen said, menace a strong undercurrent. \u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>Confusion joined the disappointment. He\u2019d just...defended her.</p><p>Fox ran her tongue over her teeth. \u201cShe do this to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Now help me to the bed.\u201d</p><p>As Fox sheathed her weapons, her gaze remained locked on Legion, narrowed and hate-filled. Even as she approached Galen, wound her arm around the warrior and eased him to his feet, she kept Legion in her sights. He leaned his weight into her, and they inched their way to the bed. Slowly, carefully, he sat at the edge of the mattress.</p><p>Were they lovers? Legion wondered.</p><p>Visibly weakening, now wheezing, Galen said, \u201cGet your tools and get this shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>With one last warning glare in Legion\u2019s direction, Fox flew out the door.</p><p>\u201cWill she obey you?\u201d Legion asked softly. \u201cAbout me?\u201d</p><p>Sky-blue eyes found her, the lids heavy, casting his face into the come-to-bed sexy realm, and she hated herself for noticing. \u201cYes. The only person you need to worry about is me.\u201d</p><p>So. He planned to save her torturing all for himself. And he would torture her. She had no doubt about that.</p><p>\u2014something slicing between each of her ribs\u2014</p><p>\u2014rotted breath fanning her ear, trailing down her chest\u2014</p><p>She wrapped her arms around her middle. Distract yourself. \u201cDid the Lords do that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he repeated. \u201cAs promised, I let them go without hurting them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTh-thank you.\u201d Worry for them was another constant in her life.</p><p>A long moment passed in silence, allowing her thoughts to once again careen out of control. Soon she was imagining what would happen to her once Galen healed. \u201cWhy do you hate them so much?\u201d she asked, just to fill the void.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate them.\u201d He balanced his elbows on his knees and his weight on his elbows. \u201cI\u2019m simply looking out for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else will?\u201d Then, \u201cEnough about me. What happened to you in hell?\u201d</p><p>The blood drained from her face, then the rest of her, leaving her cold and empty. \u201cI can\u2019t...talk about it, please don\u2019t make me talk about it.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, different emotions washing over his face. Fury, regret, hope, jealousy, fury again.</p><p>Fox rushed back in, the black bag she held slamming into her thigh with a loud thump. Legion curled her knees into her chest, doing her best to become a smaller target, but Fox was through intimidating, her focus on Galen.</p><p>She crouched in front of him, set down the bag, and dug inside. After cutting away his robe, she whistled as she looked him over. \u201cThis is going to hurt like a son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care. Do what\u2019s needed.\u201d</p><p>As she worked, Legion kept her attention on the back of her head. Maybe because Galen kept his on her, still staring at her, trying to see past her skin and into her soul.</p><p>Fox was demon-possessed, she realized. Having grown up among the dark lords of hell, Legion sensed the evil inside her, could feel the ooze of her...distrust. Yes. That\u2019s what she felt rubbing her nerve endings raw.</p><p>Distrust. A High Lord. The strongest of the strong, a leader of many minions. Legion was a minion of Strife, and the two demons had warred constantly, pitting their armies against each other. Distrust was no longer...right, though. The malice seeping from the girl\u2019s pores was warped, almost frantic. No wonder her skin was grayish and her face bruised. She must have to fight the demon every hour of every day to remain sane herself.</p><p>\u201cSo, you want to tell me what happened?\u201d Fox asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Galen replied tartly. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it anyway. You take off for Rome to deal with the Unspoken Ones and get the Cloak, and I don\u2019t hear from you for weeks. I thought you were dead.

A butterfly over his left pectoral, and one over his right.</p><p>Two butterflies?</p><p>Legion\u2019s gaze jolted up and clashed with his. He was still eyeing her through those narrowed lids, daring her to say something. She gulped, kept quiet.</p> <p>\u201cI got the Cloak, stole Maddox\u2019s woman and traded her for this one.\u201d He motioned to Legion with a tilt of his chin. \u201cHey! Can you at least pretend to be a woman and try for gentle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWuss. Why her?\u201d Fox demanded, spreading some kind of paste over each of the wounds.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about her. She\u2019s mine, and she\u2019s not going to hurt me. Are you, Legion?\u201d</p><p>If only. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSay it. Say the words.\u201d</p> <p>A tremor moved through her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d She couldn\u2019t. Even if he chained her up and did...and did... Bile, spreading faster and faster...</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m commanding you to take care of me, and you have to obey me, don\u2019t you.\u201d Not a question.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Gay Man,\u201d Fox told him. \u201cYour heartbeat is jacked up, and it\u2019s causing you to bleed more heavily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I hate when you call me that.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d grumbled the admonishment, but he hadn\u2019t struck at her, and that shocked Legion to the bone. He must really like the woman, she thought. And was that...could that be...jealousy swimming through her?</p> <p>No way. Legion wanted nothing to do with Galen. Nothing! Hate him. For what he\u2019d done to Aeron, to Ashlyn.</p><p>A short while later, Fox had him bandaged up and lying flat on the mattress. She tucked the covers around him and stood there, brushing his hair from his face until he fell asleep with a last shuddering command. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Fox turned and leveled Legion with the evilest stare she\u2019d ever seen\u2014and she\u2019d been chained to the devil himself a few times.</p><p>\u201cGalen might think of you as his, little girl, but he is mine. And I protect, and avenge, what\u2019s mine. You harm him in any way, and not even he will be able to stop me from harming you in kind.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY</p><p>CRONUS SEETHED WHEN he discovered his Lords had found his hiding place, the Realm of Blood and Shadows, where he kept Sienna and the three demon-possessed warriors he\u2019d locked there. They\u2019d invaded his private castle. All except for Torin, the keeper of Disease, who was back at the fortress in Budapest, having refused to let Lucien flash him. Too much risk, he\u2019d said, even if he was draped from head to toe with protective gear.</p><p>One touch of Torin\u2019s skin against his, and Lucien would be infected with the very disease running rampant in the other warrior\u2019s veins. Torin put his friends before himself, always, an attitude Cronus did not understand or respect. But the thought reminded Cronus there was a way to work this situation to his favor.</p><p>Torin would do anything to touch a female human without hurting her. Even accept a gift that wasn\u2019t a gift. A gift that was a curse. A gift that was a death sentence. A gift that would ruin Rhea\u2019s own plans. Not that he would know it. Cronus grinned.</p> <p>Unlike Lucien, Cronus did not have to touch an individual to move him. Cronus simply spoke, and Torin appeared in front of him.</p><p>The warrior palmed two blades in his gloved hands and spun, searching for the culprit, even as he oriented himself to his new surroundings. He stilled when he noticed Cronus, though his gaze continued to rove, memorizing the details, the exits.</p><p>A field of ambrosia stretched for miles, scenting the air oh, so sweetly, the violet petals glistening under the gleam of a sun that offered the perfect amount of light and heat.</p><p>\u201cCronus,\u201d Torin said with a nod of his head. If he was upset or even thrilled about being pulled from his Budapest fortress for the first time in centuries, he didn\u2019t show it. No bowing, either, so of course, no scraping.</p><p>All of his current problems stemmed from his leniency with the Lords, Cronus mused. They issued commands and expected him to obey. Then, when he issued commands, they refused him, sometimes openly, sometimes by more stealthy means. His mistake was trying to connect with them, to become one of them. He should have proven his strength and demonstrated the consequences of defying him from the beginning. He wasn\u2019t their friend, would never be their friend. He was their king, their master.</p><p>And now he would prove it.</p><p>\u201cYou rang?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. He would prove it. Cronus studied him, this warrior he was about to use. Torin had white hair that shagged around a wicked face humans craved for the rest of their lives if they were unlucky enough to catch a single glimpse of it. Emerald eyes, more sinful than anything. Lips that had never known a female\u2019s taste.</p><p>\u201cWalk with me,\u201d he commanded, expecting absolute compliance.</p><p>And getting it. When the warrior reached his side, he pivoted and strode through the field, the lush leaves caressing his suit-clad legs. He ran scenarios through his mind, gauging the pros and cons of his decision.</p><p>\u201cSo...what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>The impudent tone irritated him, but he made no comment. For now. \u201cI have a new task for you.\u201d</p><p>A groan. \u201cYou and your tasks. Torture so-and-so. Kill so-and-so. Rally my boys and send them into the danger zone. So, fine. Let\u2019s hear this new one. I\u2019m sure it will delight me as much as the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTone,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cYes. I have one.\u201d</p><p>Calm. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll lose your tongue if you use it again.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Excellent. \u201cToday, Disease, I give you a gift. The greatest treasure in my possession. Despite your disappointing, offensive attitude.\u201d</p><p>Those green eyes rolled. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll bite. What\u2019s this gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy...All-Key.\u201d He needed to give it away, but doing so irked considering the lengths he\u2019d gone through to get it.</p><p>\u201cGreat, but I have no flippin\u2019 idea what that is.\u201d</p><p>Of course not. Save for four others, Cronus had murdered everyone who knew about it. The four? Anya, the minor goddess of Anarchy and its former possessor; her father, Tartarus, who had given it to her; Lucien, who knew every one of Anya\u2019s secrets; and Reyes, who had once dared to shackle Cronus and barter for his woman\u2019s freedom. And the quartet lived only because Cronus had a use for them. Had they ever spoken of the key, he would have stopped caring about their usefulness, and they knew it.</p><p>\u201cThis key unlocks any door, any prison, any curse. Anything. Nothing can bind you. And if anyone tries to take it from you, they will die.\u201d That did not mean Torin would be free of his demon. The two were bonded, two halves of a whole. One could not live successfully without the other.</p><p>\u201cSounds cool, but why me?\u201d</p><p>Because Torin was solitary, spending more time alone than with his friends. Because he would never fall in love, nor betray his secrets to a female while they whiled away too much time in bed. Something that happened far too much for Cronus\u2019s liking. Something he himself had once been guilty of doing.</p><p>\u201cShould you tell anyone about this gift,\u201d he continued, not deigning to reply aloud, \u201cI will kill you as well as the one you told. Should you try and give it away, I will kill you and all those you love. And, when I ask you to return it to me, you will do so without hesitation. One moment of resistance, just one, and I will do more than kill your loved ones. I will hurt them in ways you cannot imagine.\u201d</p><p>Torin\u2019s purposeful stride never faltered. \u201cYeah, well, thanks for thinking of me, but I\u2019d rather eat dirt.\u201d</p><p>Cronus sent a wave of power slamming into the man\u2019s temples, knocking him off his feet. He hit the ground, writhing from the pain of it, blood soon spurting from his ears.</p><p>Looming over him, Cronus said, \u201cYou were saying?\u201d A wave of his hand, and the pain eased.</p><p>Torin lay there, panting, dripping with sweat. \u201cI was saying dirt is delicious, thanks for the mouthful.\u201d</p><p>His lips pursed. Breaking the Lords would clearly take more than his usual strong-arm tactics. They smiled when he hurt them, laughed when he threatened. As much as that frustrated and angered him, it also fascinated him. Despite everything, they were honorable. When they gave their word, they stood by it. A foolish practice, really, but one he\u2019d come to rely on where they were concerned.</p><p>Only when he threatened those they loved did they fall in line with him. But Torin could not simply cooperate because of fear. Not this time. Not with something as important as the All-Key.</p><p>\u201cDo this, keep the key safe for me, and I will grant you a boon,\u201d Cronus said. \u201cAnything you wish. Anything that is in my power to give, of course.\u201d</p><p>Suspicion danced in the warrior\u2019s eyes, and Cronus knew he was weighing his options. Refuse the king, and face punishment. Accept, and face potential trickery. Betrayal. But for the prospect of such a reward, he would not say no.</p><p>\u201cI think we both know what you want,\u201d Cronus pressed. \u201cA chance to touch a woman without sickening her and starting a plague.\u201d</p><p>Breath caught in Torin\u2019s throat, and Cronus knew that he had him. \u201cCan you give me that chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way. What happened to the vial of water the angel Lysander gave you?\u201d If there was but a single drop left, Torin could touch a woman, then feed her the droplet and save her, for the water healed any wound on any creature. Would he be able to touch her after that? No, but his condition would have been met.</p><p>\u201cGone. And the angels won\u2019t give us any more.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunate, but understandable. The angels had to endure terrible, terrible things to even approach the River of Life from whence the water came. Cronus himself had never dared go near it. \u201cThere is a woman...I will force her to meet with you. You can touch her all you desire, and she will never sicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, uh, no thanks. I want to pick my own woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat, I cannot give you, and that was not the bargain. You wanted a woman to touch. I can give you one.\u201d</p><p>A long while passed in silence while Torin considered the offer. \u201cIs she dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She lives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOld? A child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She is neither too old nor too young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will I be able to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswers were not part of the bargain, either. Decide!\u201d</p><p>Finally Torin nodded, as Cronus had known he would. \u201cVery well. You have a deal.\u201d</p> <p>He did not allow himself to smile. When the All-Key left him, its powers would leave Rhea. He could imprison her. Have her at his mercy\u2014or lack thereof.</p><p>What he did not mention to Torin: the All-Key wiped the memory of the one who gave it away. Except Cronus\u2019s, and probably, because of their connection, Rhea\u2019s. Cronus had created the key, and so had ensured it would never adversely affect him. However, no one else, Torin included, was extended the same courtesy.</p><p>When Torin bent his knees, as if to push himself into a stand, Cronus shook his head and reached down. \u201cStay there. This might hurt a bit.\u201d</p><p>ON THE OTHER SIDE of the heavens, Lysander stepped from the cloud he shared with his Harpy mate, Bianka, his wings spread and gliding just enough to leave him hovering in place.</p><p>\u201cI am failing you,\u201d Zacharel said, the words gritted. The snowstorm that followed him constantly increased in ferocity, the flakes catching in his eyelashes, between the feathers of his wings, weighing them down.</p><p>\u201cYou have not failed me, and you will not fail me. I have complete faith in you. Now, what report do you have of the girl?\u201d</p> <p>He rallied and said, \u201cWhile she thinks she will be able to walk away from Paris in a few days, the pair has grown closer. Worse, she now carries his darkness.\u201d He\u2019d seen the shadows swirling in her eyes after he\u2019d carted Paris away from her.</p><p>\u201cThe war grows ever closer,\u201d Lysander replied. \u201cShe will still be of great use to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Cronus has tricked her, convinced her to aid him. I expected him to lie to her, but I also expected her demon to catch on. He hasn\u2019t. And now that Paris has learned of his marriage to her, he will fight for her to the death.\u201d He\u2019d thought Paris would never learn of the connection, which was the only reason Zacharel had helped tattoo him. Had he refused, Paris would have done it anyway and begun resisting him ahead of schedule.</p><p>\u201cCronus is a greedy fool, but Paris has surprised me. He might have shared his darkness with her, but she has shared some of her light with him.\u201d Lysander thought for a moment. \u201cIf he wants her as I want my Bianka, he will not part from her easily.\u201d</p><p>Too true. Passion, desire, lust, whatever you wanted to call that wild craze to mate, still remained completely out of Zacharel\u2019s realm of understanding, yet he could not deny something took hold of the pair whenever they so much as looked at each other.</p><p>Like magnets, Paris and Sienna were drawn to each other. They fought for each other, and parting would destroy them on some fundamental level. That he\u2019d once thought to convince Paris to willingly walk away from her had been foolish. Force would be needed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you wish me to do,\u201d he said, bowing his head, \u201cI will do.\u201d</p><p>Lysander expelled a weary sigh. \u201cWe need her. No matter what, we need her. Do whatever you must to convince her to side with us. If that\u2019s not enough, simply take her.\u201d</p> <p>IN THE DEPTHS OF HELL, Kane sank in and out of consciousness. As vulnerable as he was when he slept, he much preferred it to the crippling pain of having his guts tucked back inside his body and his flesh stapled back together. Then, when the staples failed, having that battered flesh cauterized with liquid fire. He felt like someone had parked a bus on his chest, done some donuts, then let the passengers stampede off.</p><p>And the laughter...oh, the laughter from his demon. Disaster loved this. Loved the pain, and the degradation, and the helplessness. Kane imagined this was exactly how Legion had felt when she\u2019d been stuck down here.</p><p>He should have supported her better. Should have tried to help her. Not that Kane wanted help himself. Part of him still wanted to die.</p><p>The horsemen\u2014Black and Red\u2014were saviors as well as tyrants. When he\u2019d screamed as they \u201cdoctored\u201d him, they\u2019d next taped a ball gag in his mouth. When he\u2019d thrashed, they had chained him down. They weren\u2019t cruel about it, though; they were matter-of-fact, as if they were doing him a favor. A reason he wouldn\u2019t take them with him when he kicked it.</p><p>Red stood over him now, blowing cigar smoke in his direction. \u201cYou up for a little poker yet?\u201d</p><p>Whenever the pair realized he was awake, they always asked the same question. That one. He shook his head, unsure why a game of cards was so important to them.</p><p>\u201cBummer.\u201d Genuine disappointment shone in his features. \u201cSoon, though.\u201d</p><p>Kane nodded in agreement because he didn\u2019t know what else to do, and closed his eyes. Without any resistance on his part, he drifted back to his favorite place, a black void of nothingness.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING, AFTER spending the entire night making love to Sienna, Paris showered, threw on clothes someone had brought him from home, weaponed up and ensured Sienna\u2019s crystal dagger rested on the nightstand, ready for her use if it proved necessary. Though he hated leaving her, he exited the bedroom and entered a whole new world.</p><p>Apparently Danika, the current All-Seeing Eye, had foreseen that terrible things would take place at the fortress in Budapest, and she\u2019d sensed staying close to William was the only way to survive. So here they all were, one happy family\u2014though how his friends had so quickly installed a weight room, a wet bar and a media room in the castle, Paris might never know.</p><p>He concentrated on the changes as he stalked the halls, so he wouldn\u2019t think about his woman sleeping peacefully in his bed. Naked, sated, rosy from his mouth and his hands and his body. Wouldn\u2019t think about the breathy sounds she\u2019d made, the way she\u2019d cried his name and begged for more. Wouldn\u2019t think about the way she\u2019d made him beg for more. The way they fit, so damn perfectly.</p><p>Maybe at first he\u2019d been obsessed with her without really knowing her. But he was learning her. Underneath her prim and proper exterior, and even underneath that iron spine of stubbornness, she was soft and gentle. Delicate. She loved with her whole heart, and she fought to protect what she considered hers. Hell, she sacrificed her body, her time and her life for what she considered hers.</p><p>She was dedicated. That temper of hers was a huge turn-on. Every time she\u2019d tossed a drawer at him, he\u2019d gotten harder. How many females were brave enough to challenge him in a contest of strength? Not many. But she had, because when she looked at him, she saw past the face and the hair and the stained, corrupt past. She saw a man. Just a man.</p><p>He almost turned around and strode back to his room. He wanted her arousal on his face, and her nails going down his back. He wanted to be branded by her in every way. Then, anyone who looked at him would know. He belonged to her. And\u2014</p><p>What the hell was that hanging on the wall? He skidded to a stop. Just like at the fortress in Buda, there were portraits lining the corridor walls. Only, every single portrait was of Viola.</p><p>Viola in a gown. Viola in leather. Viola lying down. Viola standing up. Viola looking over her shoulder. An endless stream of poses.</p><p>\u201cBreathtaking, aren\u2019t I.\u201d A statement, not a question, coming from directly behind him. Viola moved to his side, a vision of loveliness in a pink tank and hip-huggers. \u201cI fetched them from one of my homes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. Sure. Breathtaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one is your fave?\u201d She tapped a fingertip against her chin, studying them. \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time picking between that one and\u2014all the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...let me think about it.\u201d</p><p>While he pretended to look them over, Sex purred, wanting to be closer to her. A second later, Paris was sporting massive wood. Shit. He raked a hand through his hair, shamed. Even this was like a betrayal to Sienna.</p><p>Why are you doing this to me? he demanded of his demon. I thought we talked about this.</p><p>Cheating feels good. I want to feel good.</p><p>Well, cheating\u2019s not gonna happen. And I want you to think about this for a moment. Every time we\u2019re with Sienna, it\u2019s a two-for-one deal. Or hell, maybe more than that. She\u2019s a human, a ghost, an ambrosia supply, a former Hunter and a demon, all wrapped into one tasty package. And if we are untrue to her, we lose her. And you will never get a quintupping again.</p><p>Why, she\u2019s an orgy waiting to happen.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>A layered pause. Oh...well...hmm.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Viola insisted.</p><p>Right. What would pacify her? \u201cI can\u2019t actually pick. They\u2019re all equally amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right. I\u2019ll have one delivered to your room. You and your hand can spend countless hours studying the details. I had a few surprises painted throughout. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d She whistled as she skipped away.</p><p>He stood there a moment, thinking about the fallen angel who desired her. He really should help throw the two together. Because really, was there a worse punishment for the guy than ending up with that for eternity? Food for thought.</p><p>He beat feet to the next hallway, and wasn\u2019t surprised to find Anya taking down the pictures of Viola and replacing them with pictures of herself. The decorator wars were on, he supposed.</p><p>\u201cGwen, Kaia, seriously,\u201d the (minor) goddess snapped, having trouble hanging on to a frame and a hammer at the same time as she balanced on a ladder. \u201cThis is the most important mission of your lives and you\u2019re riding pine on the sidelines? Get in here, you lazy bitches!\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to be recruited, Paris ducked his head and kept walking, hands shoved in his pockets. From the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of the Harpy sisters in one of the bedrooms, studying a life-size\u2014and warped\u2014drawing of Galen. Guy had horns, crooked teeth and three fingers on each hand. His clown feet were too big for his body, and rather then genitals, he had an X. A really small X. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gwen was pretending to pull back a crossbow, aiming for his heart, and Kaia was shaking her head no and pointing to the man\u2019s groin.</p><p>Sex started in with his purring. Out of habit, maybe, because a few seconds later, those purrs faded. Best part? Paris never got hard.</p><p>A wary sigh echoed inside his head. If we do this relationship thing, I\u2019ll need her often.</p> <p>The demon was willing to try. Paris couldn\u2019t help himself. He gave a fist pump toward the ceiling. Believe me, I know. And we\u2019ll have her a lot more than just \u201coften.\u201d</p><p>What an amazing damn day this was turning out to be. A megawatt smile bloomed. Yeah, he had a whole lot of shit to do. Talk to Cronus, spank the guy\u2019s wife, kill Galen while he was at his weakest and find Kane, but first, he wanted to catch up with his friends and visit the newest additions to the family.</p><p>Down on the next floor, there was a table piled high with snacks. Without slowing, he snagged an apple and a box of Strider\u2019s Red Hots. A bite of apple followed by a few of the cinnamon candies, and you had a mouthful of delicious.</p><p>A lot of his boys were congregated in the hallway outside of Ashlyn\u2019s room, eating, talking, laughing and more relaxed than he\u2019d seen them in a long time. This was what their lives should always be like, he mused.</p><p>William was in the corner, a dark-haired girl tucked into his side, the pair of them locked in earnest conversation. Gilly was a teenager on the cusp of womanhood who\u2019d suffered unimaginable abuse as a child. Danika had taken her in, and the girl had been leery around everyone but William. For some reason she\u2019d adored the bastard from day one.</p> <p>Maybe because she didn\u2019t yet know that William had recently slaughtered her entire family. Paris wondered how she\u2019d react when the truth came out. And it would; it always did.</p><p>Gilly had hated her mother, stepfather and brothers, but deep down she\u2019d probably loved them, too, and it was hard to forget that kind of feeling. Most likely scenario: she would leave, and William would follow her, protect her. He wouldn\u2019t be able to help himself. The need to protect ingrained itself in a man\u2019s very soul, and once he felt it, it was hard to forget, too.</p><p>Now that William had shed blood for her, that need would be even stronger, as Paris well knew. Every time he\u2019d taken a life, his desperation to reach Sienna had increased. But he had her now. They were together, and he wasn\u2019t letting her go.</p><p>When Paris reached the pair, he tapped the girl on the shoulder to gain her attention. She yelped in surprise, slapped him out of reflex and sank deeper into William\u2019s side. Not wanting her to assume he was angry or that he would retaliate, he kept his gaze on the warrior. \u201cWhat\u2019s the word on the three immortals?\u201d</p><p>He could have stopped by their rooms, they were just down the hall, but he\u2019d rather find out through the gossip train that was William\u2019s mouth and save time.</p><p>Willy frowned at him. \u201cFor frick\u2019s sake. Apologize.\u201d</p> <p>Frick? \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to apologize to me.\u201d He gave her a reassuring grin. \u201cI was recently informed that I have a very slappable face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to her, I was talking to you. Apologize for startling her.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cSorry, Gilly.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a soft smile in return. She was a pretty little thing, with dark hair and dark eyes, a sun-kissed complexion and the kind of curves no father ever wanted his daughter to have. \u201cNo worries. My bad. I lost track of my surroundings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can see why you\u2019d want to tune things out rather than pay attention to Willy\u2019s ugly mug.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled and Paris faced William, saying, \u201cSo, the immortals?\u201d</p><p>William shrugged. \u201cNo change. I\u2019ve tried everything I can think of, and believe me, it was very impressive sh\u2014uh, crap, but a no-go all the same. They\u2019re locked tight in those bedrooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny word on Kane?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, yeah, about that.\u201d With his free hand, William massaged the back of his neck. \u201cHe\u2019s alive and he\u2019s in hell, but he\u2019s out of enemy hands. You guys want him back, though, you\u2019ll have to go down there and get him.\u201d</p><p>Something was off in the guy\u2019s tone. \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d Not even Amun had been able to get to the truth.</p><p>\u201cJust do. Group\u2019s leaving tomorrow, and by the way, you weren\u2019t invited. My guess is they think you\u2019re a crazy psycho who makes out with himself, but that\u2019s just a guess.\u201d</p><p>Whatever. \u201cWho\u2019s going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmun, Haidee, Cameo, Strider and Kaia.\u201d</p><p>Mostly girls. Were their taskforces changing or what? \u201cYou\u2019re not going down there with \u2019em?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if. I mean, sure, the captors kind of made it a condition to Kane\u2019s release, but...nah. I don\u2019t think I will. Got stuff to do, you know. Me and my Aussie have an intimate evening planned.\u201d</p><p>Intimate with his conditioner. Figured. \u201cWho are the captors? And why are they insisting you go?\u201d He didn\u2019t bother touching on William\u2019s refusal, because honestly? That didn\u2019t mean shit. If his appearance was a condition for obtaining Kane\u2019s freedom, he\u2019d make an appearance. End of story.</p><p>William looked down at Gilly, his expression all gentleness and reverence, and gave her a little push. \u201cBe a darling and find me some gummy bears.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids, usually at half-mast and always halfway to the bedroom when she gazed at the warrior, narrowed. \u201cSo patronizing.\u201d Still, she stomped away, just as he\u2019d wanted, affording them a bit of privacy.</p><p>\u201cBe sure to watch your mouth while you\u2019re searching for my sweets,\u201d William called after her. That\u2019s when Paris caught sight of his T-shirt. It read, Save a Virgin, Do Me Instead. \u201cTalking back isn\u2019t attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I should respect my elders.\u201d She didn\u2019t turn back, but she did extend a hand and flip him off.</p><p>Paris chuckled. \u201cWhat are you teaching that girl?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly serious, William gritted, \u201cHow to survive. Now, returning to our convo. Kane\u2019s captors happen to be some serious badasses I used to know down there.\u201d</p><p>Badasses tripped a memory. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, right? Because yeah, Amun might have mentioned you\u2019re their baby daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat damned Amun.\u201d Electric eyes gleamed with the promise of retribution. \u201cWhat a sissy gossip!\u201d</p><p>Back to cussing were they, all the darns and fricks out of the equation?</p><p>\u201cOh, and speaking of gossip,\u201d William continued, his expression now anticipatory. \u201cHave you seen Blood and Gore yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPistol and Shank. I rename them every hour or so. Keeps things fresh.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, but what were their real names? \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I want to meet them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you say so?\u201d William threw an arm around his shoulders and ushered him through the sea of familiar bodies. \u201cOut of the way, mutants. My boy P is going in next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s my turn,\u201d Cameo said, and damn if that wasn\u2019t a whine in her voice, mixing with all the world\u2019s misery. She stepped in front of them to block their path to the door, her arms crossed over her chest. \u201cDid you know that seven thousand babies die every year of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re getting skipped.\u201d William offered her a sugar-sweet smile. \u201cBesides, I delivered those hellions and almost had to take an eternal dirt nap because of it. I pick the order, and I say Paris is next.\u201d</p><p>Cameo frowned. She was one of the most beautiful women Paris had ever seen. More beautiful, even, than Viola, with long black hair and liquid silver eyes. Lips as plump and dewy as a rose.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that about one percent of all births are stillborn?\u201d she asked. The whine was gone, leaving only the misery.</p><p>She was also a major downer.</p><p>Stab me in the heart already, Paris thought. Because she played hostess to the demon of Misery, the sound of her voice was always enough to tear a guy up. Throw in her death statistics, which she\u2019d been offering unsolicited more and more, and watch a party deflate like a balloon.</p><p>\u201cSomeone get this girl a lollipop and shove it deep in her mouth, stat,\u201d William shouted, urging Paris past her to the door. He didn\u2019t knock, but barreled inside. \u201cAll right, ladies. Our turn.\u201d</p><p>Reyes was sitting beside the bed, dark and menacing, with Strider the blond giant at his left. Both warriors were cooing at the thickly blanketed bundle of joy Reyes held.</p><p>Ashlyn was propped up on the bed, pale, shaky and clearly weak. Maddox sat beside her, holding the other bundle.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d William added. \u201cParis wants to see Smith and Wesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call them that,\u201d Maddox said. Paris had never heard the keeper of Violence use such a gentle tone. It was more startling than being punched in the face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to call them? Shits and Giggles? Fists and Kneecap? Nah, I don\u2019t like that one. Hammer and Nails? Dude, these kids are hard-core gangster. They need kick-A names, not that blah, blah sh\u2014crap you gave them.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Reyes stood, waited for William to close the distance and gently placed the bundle in his arms. The dark warrior patted Paris on the shoulder as he left, and Strider did the same. Only, he stopped and said, \u201cMeet me in the gym when you\u2019re done,\u201d before leaving.</p><p>Battling a wave of foreboding, Paris nodded. Then the two were gone, the door closed behind them, and he pushed the upcoming chat from his mind. He made his way to William, who seemed perfectly at ease holding such a fragile being. Only in secret had Paris ever allowed himself to contemplate having a family, because no way had he wanted to father a kid with a one-night stand. Now, with Sienna, who had been denied the chance to be a mother...</p><p>He wanted to give her this.</p><p>At William\u2019s side, he peered down at the first demon-human hybrid infant to join their crew\u2014and what he saw nearly shocked the piss out of him.</p><p>\u201cGorgeous little fiend, isn\u2019t she?\u201d William said, beaming down. He tickled her belly. \u201cOh, yes, she is. Yes, she really is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gurgling happily, the baby waved her little fists. Her eyes were open and clear, a vibrant, crackling orange-gold, and so freaking intelligent, despite the fact that she peered up at William with total, absolute adoration. And yeah, she was gorgeous. Already had a cap of honey-colored hair, the corkscrew curls spiking up from her head. But the real shocker? She had a mouthful of teeth. Really, really sharp teeth. And those cute little fists? Topped off by curling claws.</p><p>\u201cWill she ever be able to pass as human?\u201d he asked quietly, not wanting the probably sensitive mother to hear.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, maybe not,\u201d Ashlyn answered anyway. \u201cTime will tell. Either way, they are both beautiful beyond imagining.\u201d</p> <p>Figured that she\u2019d heard him. She herself might be human, but she could hear any conversation anywhere, no matter how many years had passed. That was her curse. And weren\u2019t the twins in for a real treat, never able to hide anything from mom.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cEver,\u201d William said with no small amount of disgust.</p><p>Ever did a fist pump in the air. With pride? Or anger?</p><p>\u201cThe name is perfect, just like her,\u201d Ashlyn said. Her eyelids were fluttering closed, as if she were having trouble staying awake.</p> <p>\u201cGo on to sleep, sweetheart,\u201d Maddox told her. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said as she sighed, head already lolling to the side.</p><p>\u201cWant to hold her?\u201d William asked Paris.</p><p>\u201cAshlyn? No, thanks.\u201d Maddox would brain him, same as Paris would brain any warrior who tried to hold Sienna. Not that any besides William and maybe Lucien could even see her at the moment.</p><p>William rolled his eyes. \u201cYou know what I meant. The baby. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, yeah. I totally knew what you meant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have to be so loud?\u201d Maddox snapped in that quiet, gentle voice so at odds with the roughness of his features.</p><p>Paris held up his hands, palms out, whispering, \u201cNo way on the holding of the kidlet.\u201d He was too big, and too hard to do anything but bruise the little girl. Besides, Ever growled in his direction, her lips peeling back from her fangs, and it was very clear she was happy where she was.</p><p>He moved around to the other side of the bed, where Maddox held the boy. Of course, the warrior beamed with pride as he smoothed the blanket from the kid\u2019s face. Like Ever, the baby looked months old. He had a cap of black hair and his eyes were the same shade of violet as his daddy\u2019s and diamond-hard. Two little horns peeked from his skull, and there were patches of scales on his hands. Those scales were black and as smooth as glass.</p><p>With focused intensity, the boy studied Paris. And Paris had no doubt the kid had sized him up in a single heartbeat, learning his weaknesses, his flaws, and his bad habits, and was preparing for attack.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUrban,\u201d William answered before Maddox could, and again he was all about the disgust.</p><p>Ever and Urban. Cute, in a Hollyweird sort of way. \u201cWhat made you pick those particular names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cThey did.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes widened. \u201cThey can speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but they are very good at communicating.\u201d</p><p>And that would be...how? \u201cSo, I hear the birth was troublesome. How\u2019d William save the day?\u201d</p><p>Maddox stiffened, even as William shook his head and placed Ever in the bassinet beside the bed. When he straightened, William rocked his hand over his neck in a slicing motion. A kill-that-line-of-convo-now gesture.</p><p>\u201cThat goshdarn mothertrucking a-hole cut my woman up, ripped the babies out and sewed her back together.\u201d Maddox\u2019s nostrils flared, so heavily did he breathe. \u201cWithout anesthesia.\u201d</p><p>William popped his jaw. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t time. They were clawing their way out, and waiting any longer would have killed your Ashlyn for sure. And better a dagger slice, which is smooth, than the savage tearing that comes with claws. And by the way, you\u2019re welcome. They\u2019re all alive.\u201d</p><p>Well, all right, then. Like a coward, Paris abandoned ship, leaving William to endure Maddox\u2019s wrath on his own. He made his way to the gym on the bottom floor. Strider was there, as promised, running the treadmill like a man possessed. Which he was.</p><p>Blond hair was plastered to his scalp, and rivers of sweat ran down his deeply tanned skin.</p><p>The white-haired Torin was at the far side of the room, bench-pressing enough weight to have fractured the marble floor. Shock rooted him in place for a moment. Torin never approached the masses, too afraid of someone accidentally touching him.</p><p>How\u2019d he get here, anyway? Last Paris had heard, Disease had turned down Lucien\u2019s offer for air travel. And when the hell had Torin gotten so ripped? He usually holed up in his room, covered from neck to foot in black. Now, without a shirt, Paris saw the guy had the chiseled body of someone who could kick his ass.</p><p>Both men stopped what they were doing when they realized he\u2019d entered. Paris whipped off his shirt, his gun holster and his blades, stored them on a bench and moved to the treadmill beside Strider.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you want to talk to me about?\u201d He hit a few buttons, and then the thing was lifting and moving, giving him a grueling incline and a sprinting pace that felt unbelievably good. He hadn\u2019t exercised like this in a long time.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this I hear about you having an invisible Hunter on the premises?\u201d Strider asked, catching a towel Torin had thrown at him. He wiped his face, his gaze remaining on Paris. \u201cThe Hunter possessed by Wrath, I might add.\u201d</p><p>Shoulda known. \u201cShe\u2019s not a Hunter, not anymore, and she\u2019s not up for discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell she isn\u2019t. My woman is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and your woman can take care of herself.\u201d</p><p>Pride flickered in Strider\u2019s navy eyes. \u201cTrue enough. Fact remains, though, that an unseen enemy is the most dangerous. Your girl can do all kinds of damage to everyone here.\u201d</p><p>He cranked the speed up another thousand notches, until his boots were hammering into the base and rattling the entire machine. \u201cShe\u2019s not out to hurt us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so, I\u2019ve got some wiring to do,\u201d Torin said from behind them. \u201cYou boys have at each other.\u201d Footsteps, and then it was just the two of them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me the girl who drugged you, who watched your torture, is no longer a threat to you or anyone?\u201d Strider asked skeptically. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe worked it out.\u201d Sweat beaded on his skin, too, dripping, dripping. His muscles burned just right, soaking up the strain, loving it.</p><p>\u201cIn the sheets, no doubt, but all that means is that you\u2019re thinking with something other than your brain. You gotta know that.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t challenge him, don\u2019t challenge him, don\u2019t you dare challenge him. You had to be careful around Strider. His demon took exception to any hint of confrontation, and then Strider had to battle it out, doing everything in his power to knock you senseless, or he\u2019d suffer for days as punishment.</p><p>\u201cEveryone accepted Haidee,\u201d Paris reminded him, \u201cand she was a Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow she\u2019s the living embodiment of Love. It\u2019s kinda hard not to like and trust her. Your girl, we can\u2019t see or hear her. Can\u2019t judge her actions and her words for ourselves. Can\u2019t see how she is with you. And do you really need another you\u2019re thinking with your man junk speech?\u201d</p><p>Darkness...rising... \u201cI\u2019m asking you to step off,\u201d Paris said, \u201cbefore things get nasty and we have to work this out the hard way.\u201d If he had to go the challenge route to stop his friend from verbally slamming his woman, he would.</p><p>Silence. Then, a grisly, \u201cI feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA burning sensation when you pee?\u201d Now you\u2019re just being mean.</p><p>\u201cReal mature,\u201d Strider said, but he calmed down a notch. \u201cMe and you, we got history. More than the others know, more than the two of us ever want to acknowledge. But we both know it\u2019s one of the reasons we went our separate ways when the two groups split for while, me with Sabin and you with Lucien.\u201d</p><p>Heat seared Paris\u2019s cheeks, and it had nothing to do with physical strain. \u201cWe said we\u2019d never talk or think about it.\u201d And he\u2019d always kept up his end of that agreement.</p><p>\u201cApparently, times change. You were weak, dying. There were no humans around, and you refused to let any of us help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d His happy day was going down the drain fast. \u201cJust shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, my demon took up the challenge, and I took care of you. Now I\u2019m asking you to take care of your friends in turn. Get rid of the girl,\u201d Strider went on, ignoring the demand. \u201cWe lack one artifact, just one, and once we get it back we can start searching for Pandora\u2019s box. We can finally save ourselves. Not only can she spy on us, steal from us and hurt our more vulnerable members, she could ruin our future. Just think about it. For me.\u201d</p><p>Strider threw his towel in the hamper and stomped from the room.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</p><p>FOR SIENNA, THE NEXT few days passed in a blissful haze punctuated by moments of mourning. Except for two things, all was right in her world. But she wasn\u2019t going to think about those two things. She would erupt into one of her rare and shocking rages, and rip the entire castle apart.</p><p>Instead, she would think about the fact that Paris adored her. She would think about all the times she and Paris had made love, and how each time he had been more frantic to get inside her than the last. He\u2019d taken her in ways that scandalized, delighted and thrilled, and in the quiet afterglow, they had talked.</p><p>No subject had been off-limits. They discussed the Hunters\u2014where certain facilities were, the names of some of the higher officers, the location of the cavern where Galen supposedly met with Rhea and the pair performed rituals for \u201cthe greater good.\u201d Then they\u2019d talked about themselves, about where they would travel and what they\u2019d do if there hadn\u2019t been a war to fight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paris picked the mountains, with the cold and the snow and a soft rug in front of a fireplace. She picked the beach, wanting to watch him rise from the water, glittering droplets sliding along the ropes of his stomach and catching in her new favorite place on his body\u2014because the waves would have stolen his swimsuit.</p><p>Of course, earlier this morning he\u2019d strode out of the shower, dripping wet, no towel in sight, with a wicked smile on his face, and she\u2019d laughed at his antics (after she caught her breath). She was desperately trying to guard her heart against him despite his demand that they stay together, because she knew she still had to leave him for Galen, that she had to stop Rhea from taking the Titan throne, that she couldn\u2019t kill her greatest enemy because doing so would kill Cronus, and as he\u2019d said, if he died, chaos would reign and Paris would die.</p><p>The only way to save him was to control Galen, and thereby Rhea. Not the best revenge, but it was all she could allow herself.</p> <p>She wished Skye could have met Paris, wished the girl could have seen the good in him, that man and demon were not truly one and the same, that the demon was dark and dangerous, destructive, but the man was fun and caring, worthy of respect. Just like Sienna was not the sum total of Wrath\u2019s deeds, but a woman who fought for what was right.</p><p>Once upon a time, Sienna had considered giving the demon back to Aeron. But if she did, she would die\u2014for real and forever\u2014and she would be unable to avenge her sister, even in the smallest way. Plus, she needed him. He still hadn\u2019t figured out what was \u201cwrong\u201d with Skye\u2019s death.</p><p>Don\u2019t cry, Enna. Boys are stupid, Mama said so, and if that fathead Todd doesn\u2019t want to go to the dance with you, he\u2019s the stupidest ever!</p><p>I miss you so much, Skye. Sienna turned the corner\u2014and barreled into a speeding golf cart. After crash-landing on her butt, she saw the cart was blue with orange flames painted on the sides, and the minor goddess of the Afterlife/keeper of Narcissism was at the wheel.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Most times Sienna didn\u2019t bother watching where she was going, because only Paris, Viola and Lucien could see and touch her. Everyone and everything else she ghosted through and no one ever even knew. But because the cart belonged to Viola, Sienna could feel the metal that had just flattened her lungs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m late,\u201d Viola said, waving a piece of paper in the air. \u201cYou, too? Do you need a ride?\u201d</p><p>As always, Wrath shot Sienna\u2019s mind full of images. Viola, breaking hearts. Viola, double-crossing others to save herself. Viola, unconcerned by the pain she left in her wake.</p><p>Punish...</p><p>A whisper rather than an urge. For some reason, Wrath had been on his best behavior lately, never trying to overtake her, his hunger under control though she\u2019d done nothing to feed him.</p><p>\u201cSienna. Female...ghost person. Do you need a ride? Time is a serious issue right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love a ride.\u201d She needed a few minutes alone with the woman, so this was actually perfect. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d No longer did she bear any ill will toward the woman. After all, Sienna had watched Paris interact with her, and the guy could barely mask his impatience to escape.</p> <p>But having done all of that watching, Sienna now knew how to deal with the goddess. She also knew Viola was one of the few people who wouldn\u2019t curse her outright, who would hear her out.</p><p>\u201cWell, hop on and stop standing there all lost in your thoughts. I don\u2019t want to miss the good part.\u201d</p><p>Sienna didn\u2019t ask what \u201cthe good part\u201d was, because the woman would have explained in minute detail about how everything pertained to her. She simply unfolded from the floor and slid into the plush leather seat, careful of her wings.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d the goddess prompted, stomping on the pedal. They jolted into motion, cutting corners, honking at nothing, flashing their lights. \u201cWhat did you want to talk to me about?\u201d</p><p>To begin: flattery. \u201cAs intelligent and powerful as you are, you\u2019re the only one capable of helping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I am. Here\u2019s a well-known fact. I\u2019m more than made of awesome. I am the original awesome.\u201d From behind the wheel, Viola flicked her pale hair over her shoulder. She wore a gown of shimmery gold, the material cinched just under her breasts and flaring at her hips. Red-carpet worthy, for sure. \u201cSoooo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out how best to ask for what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry opening your mouth and forming words. That\u2019s what I do, and I can assure you my methods are always stellar.\u201d</p> <p>Sienna ran her tongue over her teeth, not allowing herself to issue a snappy retort. She didn\u2019t think Viola meant to be so haughty, but hello, a girl could only take so much. \u201cWell, I\u2019m running out of time.\u201d</p><p>And there was the main reason for her recent string of temper tantrums. Her time here was ticking, ticking away. Soon she would have to leave. Not just because she had heard some of Paris\u2019s friends plotting her downfall, and not just because those same friends hated her guts and would never trust or forgive her, but because she really was going to Galen, keeping him away from Cronus, so that Cronus could keep Rhea away from his throne, no matter how sickening the tasks she had to perform.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to buy you more time?\u201d Viola asked, as if such a thing were possible. They reached the stairs. Without pause, she took them. Bounce, bounce, bounce. \u201cYou\u2019d have to pay me back. I mean, with two-hundred-percent interest, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I...well, when I leave, Paris will weaken.\u201d Her head slammed into the roof of the vehicle. Oh, please, please don\u2019t let my next death be in a tragic golf cart accident. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know this, but he has to have sex every day or his body shuts down. His demon is...needy, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYada, yada, boring.\u201d Landing smoothly, the cart erupted into full speed. (Twenty-five miles per hour.)</p><p>She bit her tongue to hold in her retort. \u201cWhen I leave I want you to make sure Paris sleeps with the women Lucien brings him, and that he keeps sleeping with them.\u201d</p><p>And there was the second reason for her temper tantrums. Due to pressure from Sienna\u2019s staunchest haters, Lucien kept disappearing and reappearing with a new woman in the hope that one would entice Paris away from her.</p><p>While Paris could easily ignore his friends, the persistent and determined Viola would find a way to get her way. Otherwise, she would be a failure, and the goddess would never allow herself to be a failure.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing is, I\u2019m the only thing standing between your man and his certain death,\u201d Viola said. \u201cSo what\u2019s in it for me if I save him?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Sienna couldn\u2019t reply; there was a giant lump in her throat. This was killing her. She wanted Paris all to herself, now and always, and oh, she really did love the man, didn\u2019t she? Body, heart and soul, she loved him. She\u2019d been falling slow and steady, but now she was flat on her face, nothing but a puddle of love.</p><p>He was everything to her. Her light when things became too dark. When she cried, he comforted her. When she laughed, he laughed with her. He treated her as if she were a special treasure. He protected her, cared about every ache and pain she might experience.</p><p>She would tear the world apart to keep him safe. She would willingly suffer without him, as long as she knew he was out there, alive.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like from me?\u201d Sienna wasn\u2019t going to quibble. What the goddess wanted, she would give. It was as simple as that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Wrath, right? Well, when I call on you to slay one of my enemies, you have to slay him. No questions, no hesitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as the enemy in question isn\u2019t someone Paris or his friends know and like. Or want alive.\u201d</p><p>The goddess thought for a moment, nodded. \u201cWe have ourselves a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, I have one other request for you.\u201d She outlined what she wanted.</p><p>Viola shot her a sly smile. \u201cWicked, and quite shocking coming from you. I had no idea you were into that. You look so mousy. But it\u2019s always the quiet ones, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll owe me two slayings, same conditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d It was done.</p><p>\u201cNow, hold on tight because I\u2019m cranking this baby up. I\u2019m just certain they won\u2019t start without me, but these Lords sometimes defy logic, so you never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d A woman with curly dark hair, a face as innocent as a cherub\u2019s and wings of the purest white appeared just in front of them. \u201cI found you.\u201d</p><p>Viola slammed on the breaks, and the cart skidded to a stop mere inches from crushing the newcomer under the tires. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the ladies jumping in front of me and keeping me from where I want to go? Jealous much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seek Sienna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Sienna\u2019s heart suddenly felt as if it had been injected with adrenaline. That had been a close call, sure, but that wasn\u2019t why she was palpitating. \u201cHeaven,\u201d she whispered, the reverent yearning in her voice flowing straight from her demon.</p><p>\u201cYes, you. I\u2019m Olivia,\u201d the angel said with a sweet smile. A white robe draped her from shoulders to ankles, making her look as if she\u2019d just stepped from a dream.</p><p>Viola jumped out of the cart and hurried past Olivia. \u201cHave fun girls, I\u2019m needed elsewhere.\u201d Pale hair streaming behind her, she disappeared into the ballroom about a yard ahead.</p><p>\u201cI recognize you,\u201d Sienna said, even though the two of them had never met. She stood on shaky legs, closed the distance\u2014heaven, my heaven\u2014and reached out, pinching a strand of those curls between her fingers. Soft, silky. \u201cWrath loves you, I think.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s smile went full-on sunshine as she scratched Sienna behind her ear. \u201cHow\u2019s my darling boy doing?\u201d</p><p>Wrath purred like a kitten.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s, uh, good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. He really is a sweetheart, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Wrath? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The demon rolled to his back, kicked up his legs and shook as great tides of rapture swept over him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s you and me chat later, all right?\u201d Olivia said, arm dropping to her side. While Wrath pouted like a toddler, the angel added, \u201cAeron sent me to find you. He wanted to speak to you himself, but he can\u2019t see you and conversing with the woman who has his Wrath through a third party would be a little too painful. Maybe one day. But I digress. He\u2019s ready to leave this castle and hunt for Legion, but won\u2019t because Paris is about to have an aneurism. At least, that\u2019s what Aeron said, and he thinks you\u2019re the only one who can calm his boy down.\u201d</p><p>Paris. Worry instantly flooded her, her demon\u2019s preoccupation with the angel overshadowed. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust follow the trail Viola blazed.\u201d Stepping to the side, Olivia motioned toward the ballroom.</p><p>Sienna darted into motion, flying through the open doorway and once again stopping dead in her tracks. A group of the warriors and their mates stood under a banner that said only INTERVENTION in big block letters. They each held a piece of paper. Viola had taken her place in the center, shifting eagerly, ready to say her piece.</p><p>Sienna\u2019s gaze locked on the warrior named Aeron, the man who\u2019d once hosted Wrath. He had closely cropped dark hair, beautiful violet eyes, and his body, which had once been covered in the tattooed images of the victims of his blood rages, was now slowly being covered with tattoos of his angel.</p><p>Seeing him, Wrath went crazy inside Sienna\u2019s head, wanting to reach out, to touch the warrior. Friend. My friend.</p><p>I know, but now\u2019s not the time to catch up with him. Honestly? She wasn\u2019t sure any time would be right. The guy scared her. He looked like he ate kittens for breakfast and thumb tacks for lunch. His dinner wasn\u2019t something she dared contemplate. Organs might be involved.</p> <p>Wrath pouted. The demon had wanted back inside of Aeron as much as Sienna had wanted to get rid of him. But she had changed her mind, and she hoped Wrath had, too. He wasn\u2019t begging to escape her. For all she knew, he was as addicted to Paris as she was.</p><p>Friend. Talk to friend.</p><p>Soon, she promised. Wrath whimpered, and she had to force herself to look away. Paris stood in front of the group, his back to Sienna. His sun-bronzed skin was bare from the waist up, and his muscles were knotted. At his sides, his hands were fisted.</p><p>Anya was reading her letter out loud. \u201c\u2014you\u2019re okay, I guess. I mean, if Lucien says you\u2019re good people, you\u2019re good people. I think you\u2019ve got a really hot body with a lot of delicious brawn and sinew, and even though I wouldn\u2019t do you without having an emergency medical exam afterward, a lot of women with low self-esteem would totally hit that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnya,\u201d Lucien said with a truckload of exasperation.</p><p>She glanced up at him, all innocence. \u201cWhat? You said start the letter with praise before going into the root of the problem. Now zip it so I can finish. You already got to read yours.\u201d She cleared her throat, glanced back down at the paper. \u201cMaking out with an invisible woman is a disease. And really creepy. If I see you with your hands squeezing air one more time, I\u2019m going to sandpaper my corneas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Paris said with quiet menace.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Viola said.</p><p>Ignoring both of them, the lithe goddess of Anarchy continued. \u201cAdd in the fact that Inviso-babe is a Hunter, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for oh, shit. Which isn\u2019t good for your health. Or ours. Mainly ours. That is why we humbly request that you enter some sort of treatment program before that woman enters you in a death program with guns, knives and a rack. And by rack I don\u2019t mean boobs.\u201d</p><p>Wow, that hurt. It shouldn\u2019t. Sienna had brought this on herself, deserved it one hundred percent, and had done nothing to earn their trust. Still. Ouch. Her lover\u2019s friends had hosted an intervention to get Sienna out of his life.</p><p>One of Paris\u2019s hands slid back, around his waist, his fingers curling around the hilt of a knife.</p><p>He was going to blow a fuse, she thought, and she didn\u2019t want him at war with his friends because of her. Not now, not ever. So, yeah, she was leaving. Sooner rather than later.</p><p>Her chest constricted, heralding the sharp lances of pain from a breaking heart. Didn\u2019t matter, though. She would take one more day with him. Just one. Then, bye-bye forever. \u201cParis,\u201d she said, doing her best to mask her hurt.</p><p>He spun, those electric-blues she loved so much crackling with fury, the malicious shadows dancing through their depths.</p> <p>Gently she said, \u201cCome up to the roof with me,\u201d and waved him over. \u201cI need to practice my flying.\u201d Truth, and the reason she wasn\u2019t leaving the fortress right this second, was instead allowing herself this extra day with him. She had to be prepared for anything. And, yeah, she wanted to say goodbye properly\u2014in bed. \u201cNo need to worry about the vines there. The gargoyles eat the walls clean, and William\u2019s blood is on the outer rail, I checked, so the shadows won\u2019t bother us, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friends are... They need...\u201d He was dragging oxygen through his nose so intensely his nostrils were flaring.</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t. You are not going to be mad at them over this.\u201d A command she had no power to enforce, but one she would see through.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, Viola relayed the conversation only she and Lucien could hear, clearly thrilled to be the center of attention. Sienna tuned her out. Only Paris mattered right now.</p><p>More forcefully, she said, \u201cParis, I\u2019m not offended by this.\u201d She was destroyed. \u201cNow come here. I need a cheerleader, and I\u2019m thinking you\u2019ll look great in a skirt, holding poms.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t crack a smile. That unholy, malevolent rage still held him in a tight grip. So, really, there was only one other thing do to.</p><p>\u201cCatch me,\u201d she said, sprinting to him. He would never forgive himself if he fought his loved ones.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t come near me while I\u2019m like...this. Humph.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d launched herself at him. Those strong arms did indeed catch her, winding around her and clamping on like shackles. Tremors vibrated from him and into her.</p><p>Acting fast, she nipped at his ear. \u201cIf you hurt them, you\u2019ll get blood on my castle walls\u2014well, more blood, and I\u2019ll be very upset.\u201d Only once before had she ever tried to use feminine wiles, and that had been the first time they met. Now she lifted her head just enough for him to see her face, and batted her lashes. \u201cPlease come to the roof with me. Please.\u201d</p><p>He peered at her for a long while, silent, before finally relaxing. He pressed a kiss straight into her mouth, daring the quickest of tastes, the tease, before striding out with her still clutched in his arms.</p><p>\u201cMy eyes,\u201d Anya whined. \u201cOh, my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we just made a huge mistake,\u201d Lucien said gravely.</p><p>Paris never looked back and neither did Sienna.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</p><p>THE MOMENT PARIS STEPPED onto the roof, he sensed the evil waiting to attack. Thanks to William\u2019s blood, the shadows couldn\u2019t get inside the castle or pass the rail, just as Sienna had said, but what waited for him wasn\u2019t exactly a shadow.</p><p>Wanting no part of the coming action, Sex retreated faster than ever.</p><p>Palming his crystal blades\u2014nope, make that blade, he had just the one now\u2014Paris maneuvered Sienna to her feet and behind him. The sky was a strip of black velvet with no pinprick of stars, the moon a crimson hook in the corner, just as before. Moisture clung to the air, hot in spots, cold in others.</p><p>Either Sienna sensed the menace, too, or she knew not to distract him. She remained quiet. His gaze arrowed over, lit on a darker patch of onyx, and shit, another dark patch, then another, gliding together, coalescing, elongating...until a man stood before him, shrouded by the black, the mist like a veil in front of him.</p><p>Sienna gasped. In fascination or horror, he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Guy was handsome, if you liked serial killers, with cold black eyes, more muscles than even Paris sported, and shoulders wide enough to take down the entire first line of defense in a game of touch football.</p><p>Paris crouched, a coiled snake ready to dart and bite. Dude had made a mistake, approaching now. Since Paris had walked into that intervention and realized his friends were still gunning for him to ditch Sienna, fury had been a seething tide inside him.</p><p>He understood their reasons. He did. And he couldn\u2019t blame them. But doing what they\u2019d done out in the open, just to hurt her, was taking things too far.</p><p>He commanded his crystal to become a weapon capable of killing such a creature, and the thing instantly morphed into\u2014a klieg? Someone play whaa whaa whaa for Debbie Downer, because seriously. Kinda felt like he was going to a shootout with, well, a freaking klieg.</p><p>Shadow Man laughed, the sound all creepiness and no joy. \u201cI know what you wonder. I can bypass the blood, yes. And I will if I must. My phantoms feed from the immortals, and that is payment rendered for their stay. Yet now you house the Lord of the Dark, their enemy, and keep my boys from their due. That is unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour phantoms aren\u2019t feeding on my friends.\u201d He recalled the warrior lying in a pool of his own blood, what was left of his insides spilled on the floor. The prisoner\u2019s pain had been unbearable to witness, so Paris could just imagine what the guy had felt.</p><p>\u201cOther arrangements must be made, or I will force you out of my realm. You will not like my methods, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>There was a time for physical confrontation, and a time for bargaining. \u201cWhat else would they like to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmortals.\u201d Clipped, angry. \u201cOnly immortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d He inched backward, edging Sienna to the door.</p><p>Shadow Man lurched forward, that dark mist stretching and gliding like wings. Paris swung the flashlight, his thumb flipping the on switch. White light cut through the darkness, but just before reaching his opponent, the man rolled through the air and out of the way.</p><p>When he stilled, they faced off. Paris twirled the thin flashlight in his palm. \u201cThat all you got? Huh?\u201d A taunt meant to buy Sienna enough time to blast inside. He hoped she understood that, but he couldn\u2019t hear footsteps, couldn\u2019t hear the door slam. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I showed you what I\u2019ve got, it would be the last thing you ever saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>Like that, they were on each other, a choreographed dance straight from Star Wars. Funny that they both knew the moves. Paris used the klieg like a light saber, twirling the golden stream as he contorted his body left and right to dodge the sashay of those misty wings.</p> <p>Finally, contact. When the light sliced through one of Shadow Man\u2019s legs, there was a sizzle, a rise of steam, and the big guy released a firing-squad shout, his anger like little bullets that pelted against Paris\u2019s mind, causing him to stumble.</p><p>That stumble cost him.</p><p>One of those dark wings whipped out and hit his arm with so much force the flashlight flew from his grip. Not mist, after all. Then that big body engulfed him, closing around him. Screams, thousands upon thousands of screams, echoed around him. So loud his eardrums burst and warm blood poured down his lobes.</p><p>Releasing a scream of his own, he covered his ears and fell to his knees. Ants were crawling all over him, surely eating at his flesh, ripping it away, consuming him bite by tasty bite.</p><p>Another firing-squad shout sounded, and the darkness instantly lifted from him. Took him a moment to orient himself, and what he saw made him want to vomit. Shadow Man was a few feet away, and Sienna was holding him off with the flashlight. Their mouths were moving, but Paris couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying.</p> <p>Until...boom, his eardrums healed and the volume came back on in an explosion of noise.</p><p>\u201c\u2014how many would you be willing to settle for...consuming?\u201d Sienna was saying, trying not to reveal her disgust.</p><p>\u201cFive. A day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey never got five before! One,\u201d she snapped. \u201cA week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree. A day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree. A week.\u201d</p> <p>A moment of silence before Shadow Man nodded. \u201cAgreed. First payment must be given today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but only if all of us\u2014the Lords, their loved ones, the babies, the immortals, me\u2014are safe, no matter where we go in this realm or what we do.\u201d</p><p>Another moment of silence, another nod. \u201cAnd so the deal is made. But best you hurry, female. I might change my mind before the first payment is delivered.\u201d With that, the black mist thinned, broke apart and disappeared altogether.</p><p>Sienna rushed to Paris\u2019s side and sank to her knees, patting him down, checking for injuries.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He hung his head. He hadn\u2019t saved her, hadn\u2019t helped her. She\u2019d had to save him. She\u2019d had to help him. He\u2019d let her down in so many ways. What kind of warrior was he?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d She handed him the flashlight.</p> <p>A quick mental command, and the crystal blade returned. He stashed the thing at his waist. \u201cI let you down. You could have been hurt.\u201d And Zacharel had warned him about that, hadn\u2019t he? That Paris\u2019s temper would get the better of him and he would hurt his woman. He\u2019d thought that meant he would strike at her, which he knew would never happen. But, no. The angel had known better. His temper would cause him to lose focus, to allow others to hurt her.</p><p>Yeah. Well. That was so not happening again. He\u2019d keep himself level no matter what the hell he had to do.</p><p>\u201cParis, you\u2019ve never let me down,\u201d she said with feeling.</p><p>Yeah, he had, but that stopped now. His thigh muscles burned like a son of a bitch as he stood. He helped her do the same. Inside the castle, he tucked her into a corner, checked the only window in the small alcove to make sure William\u2019s blood was still smeared over the top\u2014it was\u2014then cupped her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cStay here for me, okay? I\u2019ve got to tell Lucien to find us three acceptable, uh, meals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have to be immortal,\u201d she said. \u201cHe finally admitted that immortals taste better, but anyone will do.\u201d</p><p>Then Paris knew exactly who to use. Last he\u2019d looked, there were Hunters stashed in their Budapest dungeon.</p><p>\u201cWho are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that.\u201d If she knew the men, well, he wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d react. \u201cIn fact, why don\u2019t you go to our room instead of staying here? I\u2019ll join you in a bit. Okay?\u201d He kissed her before she could reply, and left her there.</p><p>Didn\u2019t take him long to locate Lucien. The warrior was still in the ballroom, and when he caught sight of Paris he apologized all over himself, his mismatched eyes filled with regret.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about the intervention later. Right now I need you to do something.\u201d</p><p>He explained what he needed, and the warrior was Johnny-on-the-spot, disappearing and returning a few minutes later with a Hunter clutched in each hand. Humans were easier to transport than immortals.</p><p>The men, both in their late thirties by the looks of them, were grimy, weak and had no fight left. Paris claimed them, and Lucien went back for a third.</p><p>Maybe this should have settled heavily on his shoulders, but these men had been captured while trying to slaughter his friends and their lovers. They would have cut the throats of the females without a moment\u2019s hesitation.</p><p>They deserved what they got.</p><p>When Lucien returned, they muscled their loads up the stairs and back into that small alcove. Sienna hadn\u2019t moved an inch, and Paris cursed under his breath. But she didn\u2019t say anything when she spotted his burdens, even though her mouth opened as if she had plenty to unleash. She just watched with wide eyes as he and Lucien stepped onto the roof.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he commanded, shutting the door in her face. He didn\u2019t want her to see what happened next.</p><p>He and Lucien approached the edge and looked down. A whole lot of airtime before reaching the rocky, blood-soaked ground. Whatever. He still wasn\u2019t gonna feel bad. But he did wonder, again, if Sienna knew these guys. If she\u2019d understand why he\u2019d picked them. If she\u2019d understand that he would use the information she\u2019d given him to find more Hunters, to bring them here and use them in the same way, for as long as necessary.</p><p>Drop them, a disembodied voice he now recognized said on a sudden wind.</p><p>Only then did the Hunters begin to struggle. Paris and Lucien shared a moment of oh, shit before shoving them over. Shadows immediately darted from the sky, surrounding the men, catching them, and then devouring them. Screams, more pain-filled than the ones he\u2019d heard while inside Shadow Man, rent the night. Then, silence.</p><p>And so the deal is sealed, another wind proclaimed. You are safe. For now.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he could trust the Shadow Man, but Sienna would have caught a lie, so there you go. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said to Lucien.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d A pause, a sigh. \u201cListen. I am sorry about what happened, and I will talk to the others. I\u2019ve never liked what we were doing to you, how we were pushing you, and I\u2019ll make sure your woman is respected. She\u2019s who you want, she\u2019s who you\u2019ll get.\u201d</p><p>His throat tightened up. \u201cThanks,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Lucien drilled a hand on his shoulder, a love pat with more strength than he probably realized, before taking off. As he exited, Sienna entered.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, expression blank.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he replied. Trepidation, foreboding, yeah, he felt them.</p><p>\u201cSo the toll\u2019s been paid?\u201d</p><p>He nodded mutely.</p><p>\u201cGood. I saw their sins. Those men were awful, had done terrible things. Wrath wanted a go at them.\u201d</p><p>That was it? That was her response? She wasn\u2019t going to question him, castigate him? Was just going to accept? \u201cI love you,\u201d he said. He couldn\u2019t hold the words back. There was no hiding the truth any longer, not even from himself.</p><p>Her jaw dropped. Those beautiful hazels were once again all about the emerald, the chocolate completely overshadowed. He was more into this woman than he\u2019d ever been into another. So into her that he would die for her. Willingly, happily.</p><p>She just fit him. Made him happy. Relaxed him, excited him, challenged him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I...\u201d Twin pink circles appeared on her cheeks. Arousal, maybe. At least, he hoped.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t say anything.\u201d He motioned her over, said huskily, \u201cJust come here.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled over to him, and he drew her close for a hug. Breathing deeply, he drank in her tropical scent, letting it brand him, remake him. There wasn\u2019t anyone or anything that could keep him from this woman. She was his. Now and always.</p><p>He placed the sweetest of kisses against the wildly hammering pulse at the base of her neck. \u201cLet\u2019s practice your flying, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-okay.\u201d</p><p>She loved him back; she had to love him back. If she didn\u2019t, he would seduce her, romance her and woo her until she did. Most important battle of my life.</p><p>He set her away from him, and they spent the next few hours working on extending her wings properly and quickly enough, as well as getting her feet off the ground. Having never flown himself, he repeated the things Aeron had told him, the things he\u2019d learned simply from watching the warrior, and he was happy to note Sienna made progress. But shit, he knew there was a lot he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Eventually Sex came out of hiding, enjoying the contact, pushing Paris to take things to the next level.</p><p>Not yet. This is too important.</p><p>You told me \u201coften.\u201d</p><p>And you\u2019ve been getting often, you stupid shit.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll never learn to sustain flight like that.\u201d Familiar male voice. Behind him.</p><p>Paris didn\u2019t bother turning around. \u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d He was willing to take suggestions in this, and only this.</p><p>Zacharel sidled up to him, his fingers stroking his stubble-free chin. \u201cI can only teach her the way I was taught. She must stand at the edge of the roof and spread her wings as far as she can get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I fall?\u201d she gasped. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to catch myself in the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not fall,\u201d the angel said, and the layer of truth in his voice was as convincing as ever.</p><p>Sienna met Paris\u2019s eyes, and he nodded. Flying was important. Flying could one day save her soul. Because yes, as the shadows had proven, even souls could be ravaged. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gulping, she brushed past him. The moment her fingers trailed over his, he grabbed on to them, linked their hands and decided to walk with her. Her trembling increased with every step.</p><p>\u201cAfraid of heights, baby?\u201d he asked, when they reached the flat edge.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be, but that\u2019s a long way down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cS\u2019all good. We won\u2019t let anything happen to you. Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep back,\u201d Zacharel commanded, and though reluctant to sever contact, Paris obeyed. \u201cNow stretch your wings,\u201d the angel said to Sienna.</p><p>Those black gossamer wings extended to their full length, lovely in a way he\u2019d never before noticed. A deep, rich purple veined the black, swirled in the center and stretched to the tips.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Now, try not to let this next part frighten you.\u201d Without any further warning, Zacharel pushed her off the ledge.</p><p>She gave a horrified gasp as she tumbled from the roof, heading down...down...</p> <p>\u201cNoooo!\u201d Paris\u2019s stomach bottomed out as he launched forward, meaning to dive off after her.</p><p>The angel stopped him with a right uppercut to the jaw, sending him propelling backward. Sex whimpered at the pain exploding through his head, but refused to retreat, refused to hide.</p><p>\u201cYou said she wouldn\u2019t fall!\u201d Paris shouted as he stood, intending to try again. He was going after her, and that was that.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t fall. I pushed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zacharel vanished, reappearing a second later with Sienna at his side. There was a green tint to her skin, and when she realized solid ground held her up, she hunched over, gagging, trembling uncontrollably.</p> <p>\u201cYou...bastard...\u201d she got out.</p><p>\u201cThis is the only way to learn.\u201d No emotion layered Zacharel\u2019s voice. Just a whole lot of what\u2019d-I-do-wrong. \u201cThis is how we are taught. Besides, you are a soul. Had you made contact with the ground, I doubt you would have burst open like a melon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou doubt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind your brave core, demon girl. Step back up and we will try again.\u201d</p><p>Paris delivered an uppercut of his own. The angel\u2019s head whipped to the side, blood leaking from the gash in his bottom lip, but he merely straightened and blinked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou do anything like that again, and I will end you.\u201d Paris didn\u2019t wait for a reply, but gathered Sienna in his arms and carried her to their room.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</p><p>\u201cWHY DON\u2019T you take a shower and relax, baby?\u201d Paris said as he set Sienna down on their bed. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few.\u201d</p> <p>She had no idea what he was planning or where he was going, but she nodded. She could use a little alone time. Her heartbeat was currently engaged in a world-record race.</p><p>He kissed her forehead and was off, shutting her inside. Shower, yes, that\u2019s what she needed. After all, she had just plunged toward certain death, unable to force her wings to work, and the only reason she had survived was that the angel who\u2019d tried to off her had caught her seconds before the splat.</p><p>Punish, Wrath said.</p><p>The first time he\u2019d ever wanted to hurt an angel. Either he\u2019d taken the shove personally or his hunger had returned.</p><p>On her stumble into the bathroom, she noticed that Viola had come through for her. A ring rested on the nightstand, its only stone a huge amethyst in the center. Good. Yeah. Good. Not heartbreaking.</p><p>The warm water relaxed her somewhat, but she had no desire to linger. Just shampooed, soaped up, rinsed off and towel-dried. About five minutes had elapsed. What a day. And yet, despite the near-death experience, she had a feeling that, when she looked back, this would be her favorite day of all time. Paris had said he loved her.</p><p>Not saying it back had nearly destroyed her, especially as he\u2019d worked her over, his hands sliding along her wings, caressing yet firm, as he taught her what he knew about flying. But she was leaving him tomorrow, never to return, never to see him again, and well, yeah. Not going there.</p><p>When she emerged from the bathroom, she saw him sitting on the edge of the bed, facing her, his elbows resting on his knees. He wore an expression she\u2019d never seen on him before, one of such glowing tenderness her knees almost buckled.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dropping the towel, naked and glistening, she obeyed without hesitation, stopping between his spread legs. His big hands settled on her hips, his thumbs lightly rasping over the flare of her waist. She shivered.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d She tunneled her fingers through his hair, adoring the soft strands as they lifted and fell.</p><p>\u201cJust out in the hall. I was going to lose it, and I didn\u2019t want you to see. Punched a few holes in the wall. Now I just want to hold you for a minute. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Always. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her closer, his arms tightening around her, and then he laid his head just over her breast, his warm breath trekking over her skin, his ear pressed into her heartbeat. They stayed like that for a long while, until she was shaking with the need to touch him, to be with him fully.</p><p>He must have sensed her desire because he urged her forward, taking more of her weight, more, until he lay flat and she was on top of him. Then he turned both their bodies sideways, rolled her and settled her in front of him, so that he cradled her. His chest to her spine, his erection pressing between her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cLet me love you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want to fill you and move in you and come in you. I want to be so deep in you, baby. So damn deep.\u201d His hand moved between her breasts, angled, and kneaded the upper, rubbing against her nipple, creating the most delicious friction.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she repeated. Her brain was fogging, her every thought belonging to him, to what he was doing.</p><p>His other hand moved between her legs and found the center of her desire. \u201cAll this honey. All mine.\u201d One finger burrowed into the gap her legs created and penetrated her, then another.</p><p>She rocked with his inward strokes, arching into him. \u201cI love the way you work me.\u201d</p><p>He nibbled on her ear. Slid a third finger home. Moan after moan cut through her throat, booming through the room.</p><p>\u201cGet me all wet, baby. I want you all over me, coating me, drenching me.\u201d</p><p>She continued to rock...rock against him, losing herself, happy to lose herself, never wanting to be found, desperate to remain here, with him, always, lost, so lost.</p><p>\u201cSo perfect. More.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyelids shut, her ears picking up sounds she\u2019d previously missed. The hard rasp of his breath, coming faster and faster. The shift of his hips against the sheets, the slow grind of flesh against flesh. \u201cParis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do you so good.\u201d His voice was guttural, almost totally animal. \u201cI\u2019m going to be in you, and I\u2019m going to have you down my throat, your taste in my mouth. You\u2019re going to welcome me inside, aren\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Please, yes.\u201d</p><p>He removed his fingers, and she cried out, her desperation for him cranking out of control. How he\u2019d get everything he wanted, she didn\u2019t know, but at least she wasn\u2019t empty for long. He clutched her upper knee and parted her legs, and without a pause in the glide of his hips, he slid as deep as he\u2019d promised. She cried out again, this time in relief, stretched and filled and nearly insane with her need for more.</p><p>He moved in her, even as he traced her lips with his wet fingers\u2014wet with her\u2014and slid two digits inside her mouth. \u201cSuck them.\u201d</p><p>She did, oh, she did, tasting herself, the erotic act new for her, but so damn arousing. She rolled those fingers around, sucked on them as commanded, bit down on them. Then his fingers were gone and he was angling her face, and his mouth was pressing against hers, his tongue darting inside, taking the taste of her into himself. All the while he moved in her, so, so deep, then almost all the way out, then so, sooooo deep.</p><p>This was more than sex, some distant instinct told her; this was a bonding, a mating. He was all over her, in her, and she was all over him, in him. This man...oh, this man. She couldn\u2019t get enough, would never get enough.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d he suddenly demanded. His thrusts were becoming jerkier, slamming inside harder, harsher.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d A moan of passion. \u201cWith me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll over me. In me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s right. All over you. In you. I\u2019m yours, and you are mine.\u201d He dove back in for another soul-stealing kiss, shattering her, claiming her. \u201cYou like this.\u201d</p><p>Not a question, but she answered anyway. \u201cLove. This.\u201d As many times as they\u2019d been together, he\u2019d never been this intense, this focused on ownership. And hell, she wanted to own him, too. She reached up and back and fisted his hair, holding on tight, not caring when the strands pulled.</p><p>He hissed in a breath.</p><p>Her hips arched back, with force this time, slamming into him. Both of them groaned at the bliss. She edged ever closer to release, and he was right there with her.</p><p>\u201cTake me, baby. Take all of me. Yeah. That\u2019s it. You know the way.\u201d</p><p>Pressure, building and building, consuming. Just a little more... \u201cParis!\u201d One more hard slam and she was shooting into the stars, pleasure flooding her in a rush, a storm. Her inner walls clutched at him, grabbing on to him, letting him know he was where he belonged, that this was right, that they were right.</p><p>He rolled her all the way to her stomach, pressing her face into the pillows, and hammered harder, faster. A roar ripped out of him, as rough as his thrusts, and he filled her up, coming and coming and coming some more. She was right there with him, launching into a second orgasm, one that snuck up on her, but took her ever higher.</p><p>When she came back to earth, she blinked open her eyes. Had she passed out? She must have, because Paris was on his side, and she was on her side, and they were facing each other, but she didn\u2019t recall moving. His breathing was a little off, so she didn\u2019t think very much time had passed. He\u2019d drawn the sheet over their bodies and was peering over at her, as if memorizing her features. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to leave with you,\u201d he said. \u201cGo somewhere Cronus can\u2019t find you. Where no one can hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart lurched. No one\u2014meaning his friends. \u201cI told you. I don\u2019t want you to be mad at anyone on my behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey disrespected you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He threw a punch, his fist going through the headboard, wood shards raining. \u201cI told you not to talk like that. And the next time you do, I\u2019m putting you over my knee. They aren\u2019t perfect, not a single one of them. We\u2019ve all done things. Things that would shame hardened criminals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re reformed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you. I\u2019m not saying I want to leave them forever. I love them. Need them. I just want to give them time to accept you. And just so you know, if I ever treated their women the way they\u2019ve treated you, they would retaliate.\u201d</p><p>She had to change the subject. Had. To. He was melting her resolve. Being what she needed, saying such wonderful things. And he meant them. His tone was all about the serious.</p> <p>\u201cHiding from Cronus,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>Gradually he relaxed. \u201cThere are medallions. Whoever wears them is hidden from him and all his followers. He gave them to us once, then took them away. I can steal one.\u201d</p><p>And enrage the beast, placing himself in eternal danger? \u201cNo. I have to do this, Paris. I have to go to Galen, and Cronus is going to take me. I just have to,\u201d she finished lamely. For you, for me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Anger returned to those electric eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not even going to think about it? When the very idea of my enemy breathing the same air as you drives me to commit murder?\u201d</p><p>Her own anger sparked. \u201cWhen it comes to putting you in danger? When it comes to making sure you survive? There isn\u2019t anything to think about.\u201d</p><p>He softened, but only slightly. \u201cSame with me. I don\u2019t want you in danger. Ever. And you think about this. I will waste away without you. Yeah, I know I\u2019m the king of manipulation, playing on your emotions, but I will do anything to keep you. I will kill. I will lie. I will betray and cheat and steal. I will topple mountains.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cParis, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t done. \u201cAll my life I have fought and I have fucked, and I thought I was happy until you pissed me off and woke me up and I realized I\u2019d simply existed and accepted. And you might have gotten my attention through my demon, but you kept it because of you. I could have anyone right now, and no, that isn\u2019t ego or a front, it\u2019s just me telling you that now that Sex knows I\u2019m committed, he\u2019s making me hard for every damn female in the place, or he was, and he can again, but I don\u2019t want them and I won\u2019t take them.\u201d</p><p>Careful, girl. This man, this man she loved, could talk her into anything. There could be no spending the rest of the night with him. She had to leave. And she had to leave now.</p><p>The knowledge shattered her.</p><p>\u201cSienna, baby. I know I\u2019m coming on strong. I know I\u2019m pushing for a lot. Just...give me some time, okay? We\u2019ll figure this out. There\u2019s a solution, there has to be. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>So many pieces of her, scattered and broken, never to be fitted back together. \u201cI do,\u201d she croaked. \u201cI trust you.\u201d The truth, but it wouldn\u2019t stop her.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He must have assumed she\u2019d agreed to give him time.</p><p>She didn\u2019t correct the mistake.</p> <p>\u201cNow, I want you to listen to me. Do you remember when I told you not to let anyone smell your blood, to always clean yourself up if you are injured?\u201d He waited for her nod before he went on. \u201cThat\u2019s because Cronus has made you into an ambrosia spout. Your blood is a drug for immortals and highly addictive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d Yeah, no reason to finish that sentence. Anything was possible. She was living\u2014er, undead\u2014proof of that. Bitterness rose, joining the anger and the hopelessness. \u201cHow did he do it? Why would he?\u201d Even as she spoke, she knew the answer to the latter.</p><p>Why\u2014so that she could more easily \u201cseduce\u201d and control Galen. That\u2019s how she would keep his interest. How dare he do this! she seethed. How dare he turn her into a...a...walking narcotic!</p><p>Punish...PUNISH.</p><p>Yes. She would punish. Would that stop her from doing what needed doing? No. Not when Paris\u2019s life was at stake. But, oh, she and Cronus would have a reckoning one day.</p><p>Wrath grunted his approval.</p><p>Gruff, Paris said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened, baby. I wish I could go back, stop him.\u201d</p><p>Melting... \u201cIs there a way to fix me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to my knowledge.\u201d</p><p>She leaned into Paris, pressing her lips into his. He wanted to continue the conversation, she could tell, but he was into the kiss and accepted her tongue, taking it as his right\u2014and it was. While he was distracted, she reached for the ring Viola had left her. Slid the metal onto her middle finger.</p><p>Tears burned the backs of her eyes. Do it.</p><p>\u201cSienna,\u201d Paris said. He cupped her jaw as he liked to do, as gentle as if she were a precious treasure he couldn\u2019t bear to bruise. \u201cTalk to me. Tell me what you\u2019re thinking. Please.\u201d</p><p>Do it. Do it! First, one more kiss, just one more. She dove back in, filling her mouth with his special taste. All that heat and chocolate. What lay ahead of her was an eternity of misery, but then, that was her punishment, wasn\u2019t it. For what she\u2019d done to him before. Part of her even thought Wrath approved, for the demon was now purring in the back of her mind, as he\u2019d done for Olivia, feeding off Sienna\u2019s sorrow.</p><p>Do. It. Still she hesitated. Was she going to talk herself out of this? No, oh, no. She was talking herself into it, she realized when her next thought hit. Paris had to fall out of love with her. He just had to. He had to forget the vow he\u2019d made her, and live. Live happily.</p><p>And so she did it. She did the one thing guaranteed to make him hate her.</p><p>She positioned her ringed finger at his throat, just as she\u2019d done once before, that day they\u2019d first met. His pulse was erratic, a drunken drumbeat.</p><p>DO IT. A tragic \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d left her as she struck. She shouldn\u2019t have said that. Should have been cold, heartless.</p><p>His eyes flared wide. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Comprehension bled into his irises, even as they glazed. The liquid had broken the blood/brain barrier instantly. Rather than shout at her, curse at her, he slurred out, \u201cDon\u2019t leave me. Don\u2019t...leave... Stay...mine...please...\u201d</p><p>Though he fought the effects, he couldn\u2019t stop them, and his eyelids drifted shut. His arms plopped to his sides. He was very still, his chest rising and falling evenly. Took everything she had to climb out of the bed. To dress in clothing Cronus had provided for her, choosing a long-sleeved T-shirt that fit around her wings, black leather pants and combat boots. She quaked the entire time, tears pouring down her cheeks.</p><p>She claimed two daggers, and neither of them were crystal. Those she left on the nightstand, resting next to each other. They were his. He would need them. She strapped the weapons on her wrists, hilts down. A shake of her arms, and those blades would slide right into her palms.</p><p>For a moment, she closed her eyes. Had to be done, had to be done, she chanted. Didn\u2019t make her ache any less, or feel any better. Or any less guilty. Why couldn\u2019t Paris have looked at her with anger there at the end? Why\u2019d he have to be so understanding?</p><p>She refused to delude herself. He would come after her.</p><p>She had to stop him.</p><p>Though she almost broke down and sobbed when she exited the bedroom, she somehow managed to pick herself up and scour the castle. She found Lucien down the hall, in the room he\u2019d claimed for his own. He sat in a velvet-lined chair, a glass of something amber in one hand, the other wrapped around Anya, who perched in his lap.</p><p>He sensed the intrusion immediately, his gaze arrowing straight for Sienna. He set his glass on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Anya demanded. \u201cYou tensed.\u201d</p><p>When he registered Sienna\u2019s identity, he relaxed, his scarred face easing off the someone\u2019s-gonna-die throttle. \u201cAnya, sweetheart, will do you something for me?\u201d he asked, tenderly running his fingers through her fall of pale hair.</p><p>\u201cAnything, Flowers.\u201d She licked up his neck, humming ecstatically. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>He fisted a thick lock and lifted her head, forcing the pleasuring to end. \u201cWill you go to the kitchen and make me some hot chocolate? With whipped cream and marshmallows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. What?\u201d Her red lips pulled into a frown. \u201cI thought you wanted me to do something totally, absolutely freaky to your body, and I was one-hundred-percent racer ready for that. Hot chocolate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnya. Please. I have a craving.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s a legit question right now, considering what you\u2019re willing to give up, but fine. My man has a craving.\u201d Off Anya went, grumbling, leaving Lucien alone with Sienna and not realizing it.</p><p>\u201cI drugged Paris,\u201d she admitted. And wow, what a way to kick things off poorly.</p><p>Scowling, Lucien jumped to his feet. \u201cDid you hurt him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Of course not.\u201d She leaned against the door, no longer able to hold herself up. \u201cCronus wants me to go...to Galen...to spy for him, to control him.\u201d Why was this so difficult? She\u2019d drugged the man she loved; this should be as easy as breathing. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to save Paris, and you guys, from certain death. The longer I stay here, the more likely the chance Galen will get to Cronus, and Rhea will take the throne.\u201d And the harder it would be to leave Paris.</p><p>His blue eye swirled, hypnotizing her, while his brown one seemed to lock her in place. \u201cI could accuse you of lying, of saying this so that we won\u2019t suspect you of rejoining your flock and sharing our secrets.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her tongue thickened with the need to curse, but she plowed ahead anyway. \u201cYeah. You could. And that\u2019s fine, more of the same, but Paris, he trusts me and he wants me to stay. He wouldn\u2019t let me go.\u201d</p><p>In the ensuing silence, she noticed something. Wrath was quiet now; he\u2019d truly fed from her pain and her actions, and wasn\u2019t concerned by Lucien in any way. And also, maybe she\u2019d gotten it right before and Aeron had already won this battle. Maybe the Lords were exempt from the demon\u2019s brand of justice. Whatever. Didn\u2019t matter. She wasn\u2019t going to be around them anymore, was she? Wrath could feed off her sorrow for eternity.</p><p>\u201cParis will want to come after me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know he will.\u201d</p> <p>A dark brow knitted into Lucien\u2019s hairline. \u201cSo he can retaliate for being drugged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. To save me from Galen.\u201d</p><p>His lips pursed as he considered her words. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop him.\u201d The words were shards of glass in her throat. \u201cI have to stay with Galen, have to somehow find a way to control him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a tip. Kill him,\u201d Lucien suggested.</p> <p>If only. \u201cCronus says I can\u2019t, that if Galen dies you guys die, too. This is the way. The only way.\u201d As she spoke, she straightened her shoulders. Her determination grew, turned her into a rock.</p><p>Sienna wasn\u2019t weak, and she wasn\u2019t a coward. Not any longer. She was doing this, even at the expense of her own happiness. \u201cDon\u2019t let him come for me. Keep him here, and keep him strong. So. Yeah. That\u2019s all I came to say.\u201d</p><p>A long, torturous pause as he considered his reply. \u201cYou know what you\u2019re asking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d To mask the newest flood of tears, she looked down at her booted feet. \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend to him, and I\u2019m glad.\u201d Getting choked up again. \u201cI\u2019m glad he has you. Take care of him, Lucien. If ever there\u2019s information I obtain that can help you, I will somehow send it on. Trust it or not, but it will be there if you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSienna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...take care of him, like I said.\u201d No need to open the door. She simply stepped through it and pounded her way to the roof.</p> <p>There was only one thing left to do.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</p><p>SIENNA\u2019S WINGS LIFTED properly and were no longer dragging against the floor. Her shoulders ached, but the shooting pains were nothing she couldn\u2019t handle. She was determined. Still rock-solid. Unbendable.</p><p>She would do this. Wouldn\u2019t waver.</p><p>She pushed her way onto the roof, the cloying darkness of the realm once more enveloping her. No sign of that shadow guy...thing, but of course, his blood toll had been paid and he\u2019d vowed to leave everyone alone. Whether or not he\u2019d keep his word, she couldn\u2019t be sure. Wrath had sensed the menace in him, yet the images the demon had shot through her head had been grainy and, well, shadowed, confusing them both.</p><p>Nothing had been clear, so she had no idea what the shadow guy was capable of doing. She trusted him because she had no other choice.</p><p>In the center of the parapet, she stopped and spread her arms. There was no hesitating to take a breath. No reflecting on what could have, should have, been. \u201cCronus! Cronus! I summon you!\u201d</p><p>A flash of white at her left. Heart thumping, she spun. The angel Zacharel had taken shape, lovely in his heavenly glory, glowing with an aura that pulsed with energy, yet seeing him caused a tremor of fear to crawl down her spine. His expression was devoid of emotion, those white-and-gold wings spread regally, his robe pristine.</p> <p>Wrath reacted as if he\u2019d just spotted Olivia. Heaven!</p><p>\u201cMy people need you, Sienna,\u201d Zacharel said. \u201cI told you this.\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin. \u201cAnd I told you to get in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do that when I can simply take what I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could settle for my unwillingness, you would have taken me already.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head at her logic. \u201cThen come with me of your own accord. You are the key to our victory.\u201d</p><p>So sick of those words. \u201cWhy am I the key? How am I the key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know.\u201d</p><p>So sick of nonanswers. \u201cWell, then, you don\u2019t get the key. Besides, I didn\u2019t think angels and demons ever worked together.\u201d</p><p>The slightest softening around his emerald eyes. \u201cHigh Lord demons, like the one inside you, were angels once. I know\u2014knew\u2014your Wrath. Once upon a time, his justice was not perverted or warped, but fair and right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change my mind.\u201d Where the hell was Cronus? \u201cParis comes first, and this is my way to save him.\u201d And if Paris himself hadn\u2019t changed her mind about her current path, Zacharel had no chance.</p><p>His brow furrowed as he tossed her words through his mind. \u201cWhy do you love him?\u201d He sounded genuinely baffled. \u201cWhy do you sacrifice yourself and your happiness for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is strong.\u201d</p><p>A snort. \u201cOthers are strong.\u201d</p><p>She remembered doing the same thing to Paris, contradicting everything he said. Had she been this annoying? \u201cHe\u2019s smart, and giving, and caring, and kind, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a killer.\u201d</p><p>Though her eyes narrowed, she continued as if he hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cHe is protective of me, and he makes me feel special. He takes care of me. And he sacrifices for me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish a sacrifice to be made? Done. Name your price and I will see to it immediately.\u201d</p><p>Hope ignited. \u201cCan you save Paris from the fate Cronus showed me? In two of the potential futures, he dies. Can you save him and his friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zacharel replied honestly, and that shouldn\u2019t have surprised her but it did. \u201cThe roadways have already been paved, the vehicles placed upon them and in motion. There are no breaks.\u201d</p><p>As vivid as the metaphor was, the reality was inescapable. Hope burned to ash and floated away. \u201cVery well, then. Cronus!\u201d she shouted. \u201cCronus!\u201d</p><p>Zacharel skimmed a fingertip along his brow. \u201cThe Titan king has lied to you, you know. Lied about so many things.\u201d</p><p>Breath caught, froze in her lungs. \u201cAbout Paris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Then nothing else mattered. \u201cCronus!\u201d</p><p>He heaved a ragged sigh of frustration. \u201cHelp us, Sienna. A war brews in the heavens. Good versus evil. You want to be on the side of good.\u201d</p><p>Been there, ruined lives because of that, she thought. \u201cCronus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will never lie to you,\u201d he said, floating closer, \u201cand you will have a chance to avenge the wrongs committed against you and those you love.\u201d</p><p>Wrath really liked that idea, and slammed against her temples to gain her undivided attention.</p><p>Don\u2019t need to sell that any harder. The thought of working on the side of the angels\u2014for real this time\u2014was hard-core awesome, and yeah, part of her wanted to be all over it. But. Yeah, always a but. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I really am, but I drugged a good man to do this, and you can\u2019t guarantee his safety, so I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel studied her for a long while, silent. Then, \u201cVery well. I will allow you to leave with the Titan. When you need me, and you will, simply speak my name and I will come for you.\u201d</p><p>And take her straight into the heavens. \u201cFind a way to save Paris and his friends, and I\u2019m yours. See, I\u2019ve learned something in this new, immortal world. Everything has a price, a toll. The Lords are mine. Their lives for mine, or no deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he repeated just before he disappeared.</p><p>A split second later, Cronus materialized in front of her, and oh, was he pissed. His scowl broke up the clean lines of his face, turning regal features sinister. At least he\u2019d given up the goth mesh and tailored suits in favor of his white robe.</p><p>\u201cYou summoned me, and then you blocked me?\u201d Eyes a shimmering mix of ebony and scarlet, he snarled, \u201cHow did you block me?\u201d</p><p>Just as before, Wrath went silent, unable to see into Cronus\u2019s past. Frustrated them both. Much as she raged about the sick things the demon had made her do, she\u2019d come to rely on his keen insight into the people around her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t block you,\u201d she replied honestly, the words laced with venom. I hate this man, she realized. For everything he\u2019d done to her, and everything he was doing to Paris. \u201cI summoned you to tell you I\u2019m ready. I want to go to Galen. But first...\u201d</p><p>Steps unhurried, she approached him. Her arms were lowered at her sides, and she gave a little shake. The blades slid into her hands, as planned, and the moment she reached Cronus, she whipped into a frenzy of motion, shoving him back, into the castle wall, the tip of her weapon poised at his jugular.</p><p>He could have thrown her off, but the threat happened so quickly, he could only widen his eyes in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cYou fed me ambrosia, made me ambrosia.\u201d</p><p>Finally he shoved, propelling her backward. Only by frantically flapping her wings did she prevent herself from flying over the rail.</p><p>\u201cAnd the problem?\u201d He brushed a piece of lint from his shoulder. \u201cI did what was required to make this work. You were right, you aren\u2019t pretty enough to capture Galen\u2019s attention, and we need his attention.\u201d</p><p>No apologies, the bastard.</p><p>One day...</p><p>He went on silkily, \u201cNow, allow me to capture yours.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and her surroundings changed, from dark to light, bleak to ostentatious. Befuddled, she sheathed her weapons.</p><p>Above, a teardrop chandelier hung from the center of intricately carved woodwork. At her sides, thick red-velvet curtains spilled over the windows, with chairs and lounges made of the same material scattered throughout. A rosewood desk, candelabra, tables with swirling bars of gold at their bases. Below, a plush wool carpet with the loveliest blooms woven in jewel tones. The scent of jasmine and honeysuckle saturated the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he replied, \u201cis your new home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wouldn\u2019t cry. She wouldn\u2019t. \u201cGalen lives here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Rhea\u2019s realm of the heavens? Yes. Usually his men occupy every room, but many of them are currently missing.\u201d Steps light, Cronus closed the distance between them. He gripped her forearms, forcing her to peer up at him. \u201cIn exactly sixty seconds, you are going to enter that room.\u201d His gaze shifted to a closed doorway behind her.</p><p>Why the wait? Then again, who cared? \u201cAll right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGalen will not accept you as you are, not any longer. You stink of Paris, his enemy.\u201d</p><p>And she was supposed to convince the horrible man otherwise? Fabulous.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one way to avoid that,\u201d Cronus added.</p><p>Sickness in her stomach, ice in her veins. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d</p> <p>She never saw him move. One moment Cronus was holding her, the next he was stabbing her in the stomach. Sharp pains tore through her, and she glanced down through widening eyes. His hand was wrapped around a blade hilt he had slammed into her belly.</p><p>Wrath roared at the injustice, and in that moment, the demon had no need to see into Cronus\u2019s past to experience a desire to strike. Punish!</p><p>\u201cWhy would you... Why...?\u201d Blood trickled from her mouth. One day, I really will kill him.</p><p>PUNISH. PUNISH. PUNISH.</p><p>\u201cI told you. Galen would not have wanted you otherwise.\u201d Cronus stepped back, taking the weapon with him. Again he offered no apologies for his actions.</p><p>Hate him. Blood wet her shirt, poured down her skin. Her knees shook, collapsed.</p> <p>PUNISHPUNISHPUNISH.</p><p>Eyes narrowing, she inched toward him, once again palming her blades.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cUnwise to waste your remaining energy on me. I suggest you crawl to the doorway I showed you and find Galen. Otherwise, I\u2019ll return to Paris and kill him myself.\u201d</p><p>With that, he abandoned her, leaving her alone and slowly bleeding to death.</p><p>Spiderwebs wove around her vision. Zacharel had been right, she thought dazedly. Cronus had lied and betrayed her time and time again, and like a fool she\u2019d let him. Had come to regret her decisions. But she couldn\u2019t cry out for the angel.</p><p>Her desire merged with Wrath\u2019s. Somehow, some way, she would finish Cronus, Rhea and Galen, and save Paris, and tell the rest of the world to screw itself.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-SIX</p><p>PARIS JOLTED UPRIGHT. Fog enveloped his mind, and a great sense of doom had taken up residence in his chest. He patted the spot beside him. Cold, empty.</p> <p>\u201cSienna,\u201d he called, thinking she might be in the bathroom. He needed to hold her, to know she was okay. A sense of foreboding was overtaking him.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d He shouted her name this time, and with the reverberation of his voice, the fog thinned and memories flooded him.</p><p>Sienna had left him. Left him to go to Galen. He threw his legs over the side of the bed, ignoring a wave of dizziness.</p><p>Need her, Sex said.</p><p>I know. I\u2019ll find her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get up,\u201d a familiar voice intoned. Lucien had just flashed inside the room.</p><p>Paris tensed, did his best to focus. His friend had pulled a chair beside the bed, stretched out his long legs and locked his fingers over his stomach. Though the position was relaxed, his dark hair shagged and tangled around strained features and grave eyes.</p><p>\u201cHave to.\u201d Paris performed a quick scan of the room, checking off things he\u2019d need. Clothes. Boots. Weapons. His gaze landed on the nightstand where both of his crystal blades rested. He gritted his teeth. She was out there, unprotected.</p><p>Fear momentarily overwhelmed him, and he dropped his head in his hands.</p><p>Need her!</p><p>I know, damn it! You think I don\u2019t know?</p><p>\u201cShe came to me, you know,\u201d Lucien said. \u201cAsked me to keep you here.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and met his friend\u2019s multihued stare, his fury rising on a swift tide. \u201cDid you hurt her?\u201d</p><p>Lucien blanched, the scars on the side of his face seeming to rise up. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Okay, then. Okay. \u201cWhat did you say to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get to that. Apparently she also went to Viola and asked the goddess to make sure your demon was properly fed.\u201d</p><p>He popped his jaw. Sienna wanted him to have sex with another woman. The knowledge might have undone a lesser man, and yeah, it angered and upset him, but he understood her motive. His well-being above hers. It was the same for him, which was exactly why he was going after her. Then he would find a way to bind her to him permanently, through fair means or foul.</p><p>She\u2019s ours. Sex might have been reluctant at first, but he was totally on board now.</p><p>No argument from me.</p><p>Once Paris had thought he would be able to let her go. He\u2019d thought he could never ask anyone to spend 24/7 with him. Had thought the complications would be too great to overcome. Well, he\u2019d thought wrong. When it came to Sienna, there was nothing he wouldn\u2019t do, nothing he wouldn\u2019t endure\u2014or demand she endure.</p><p>Paris stood, swayed.</p><p>Lucien followed him up.</p><p>He rolled his shoulders, gearing for battle. \u201cYou gonna try to keep me from her?\u201d Nothing and no one keeps me from her.</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d The warrior whipped out his Glock and checked the clip. \u201cI\u2019m going with you to get your girl.\u201d</p><p>SIENNA CRAWLED toward the doorway. She left a trail of blood behind her, but finally reached her destination. She expected to ghost through. Instead, she met resistance. A solid wall. Damn it! Lifting up to curl her fingers around the knob was a production. Already she was light-headed and weak, but with every second that passed she grew more so.</p><p>Two things drove her. Hatred for Cronus, Rhea and Galen, and love for Paris. She could do this. She would do this. She\u2019d come so far, wouldn\u2019t stop now. Fat white stars winked through the spiderwebs. Breathing proved difficult, the air seeming to thicken each time she inhaled.</p><p>Knob, twisted. Door, butted with her shoulder. Hinges squeaked. Yes! Success.</p><p>One hand in front of the other, knees dragging in behind her. Past the threshold. One hand in front of the other, knees still dragging. Stars, stars, so many stars, outshining the webs completely.</p><p>Rustling a few feet away. A female\u2019s whimper.</p><p>A male\u2019s curse.</p><p>Galen? \u201cHelp...me...\u201d Sienna managed.</p><p>Feet hit the floor. Footsteps echoed. The slide of feathers over wood planks. Then a handsome blond male was crouching in front of her. Hello, Galen, the man from the portrait. He was bare-chested and covered in bloodstained bandages. He had a blade poised overhead, as if he meant to strike at her, but then he hesitated, his nostrils flaring, his eyes instantly glazing over.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he croaked.</p><p>Her heartbeat sped up, which in turn caused her to bleed out faster. Her thoughts were like mist, impossible to grasp. \u201cI\u2019m...Wrath. Hunter.\u201d And why wasn\u2019t her demon flashing images of Galen\u2019s crimes through her head? Was he as weak as she was? His strength reliant on hers, as hers was sometimes reliant on his?</p><p>Across the way, she saw a pale-haired female peek from the shadows of a corner. Her features were tight with strain, her skin colorless. Was this Legion, the girl the Lords were searching for? The girl who had traded herself to save Ashlyn?</p><p>The girl Galen had risked his life to obtain?</p><p>Hell, Wrath said with a whimper.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Galen demanded. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d</p><p>Sienna wished she\u2019d come up with a story beforehand, wished Cronus had given her one. Now she had nothing. No words to soothe him and convince Galen of her trustworthiness. At least until she could defend herself.</p><p>\u201cHelp,\u201d was all she said.</p><p>Legion crawled forward. \u201cWr-Wrath? I can\u2019t see you, but I feel you.\u201d</p><p>My hell.</p><p>\u201cStay back, Legion,\u201d Galen barked, and the girl instantly scampered back to her post. He never removed his attention from Sienna.</p><p>What had he done to Legion to create so much fear in her? What did he plan to do to her? No matter what, Sienna couldn\u2019t let him hurt the girl. Had to find a way to get her to safety.</p><p>As if he read her mind, he said savagely, \u201cShe\u2019s mine. You touch her, and you die\u2014after I play with you a bit.\u201d</p><p>Sienna glared at him. So many threats had been tossed her way lately, his was just white noise.</p><p>He licked his lips, bent down and sniffed. \u201cYou smell so good.\u201d His words were beginning to slur. \u201cSo good.\u201d</p><p>She remained motionless, part of her wanting him to taste her blood, the rest of her repulsed by the idea. But this was it, the way she would control him, and as much as she despised Cronus for it, she was suddenly a little grateful. When Galen was under the ambrosia\u2019s spell, Paris would be safe.</p><p>And then she would rewrite the predicted future, creating a fourth road. As she\u2019d promised herself, she would kill both the king and queen of the Titans. There would be no locking them up, no mercy.</p><p>Another sniff, a shudder of pleasure and then Galen jolted back, stumbling to his ass. \u201cFox,\u201d he shouted, crab-walking the rest of the way from her. \u201cFox!\u201d</p><p>Damn him. Sienna drew on what modest strength she had left and edged toward him. Had to get him to taste. Had to... She reached out a bloody hand.</p><p>\u201cFox!\u201d His eyes widened with horror when he hit the wall, unable to move as she inched...inched...</p><p>Footsteps behind her, a hard hand fisting in her hair, jerking her backward. So she was visible to more than just the master of the house, she thought dimly as her strength ebbed. Evidently Cronus had worked his magic on Galen\u2019s henchmen, as well.</p><p>\u201cKill her,\u201d Galen croaked. \u201cKill her.\u201d</p><p>KANE KNEW HE WAS DREAMING. Why else would he see Amun and Haidee facing off with the two horsemen, daggers clanging together, grunts and groans filling the air? Why else would Haidee\u2019s skin be changing to straight-up blue ice, her hair into icicles? Why else would William be buffing his nails as he leaned against a wall?</p><p>Why else would a beautiful female with long silver-blond hair cascading over one shoulder and eyes of the purest lavender be looking down at him, frowning, tugging at the shackles on his wrists and ankles? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hell.

Maybe he was free of his demon. Maybe he was being sent to that secret realm in the heavens where the deceased Baden and Pandora lived. A realm where the demon-possessed were to spend the entirety of their afterlife.</p><p>Baden, once his best friend. Once the keeper of Distrust. Aeron had spent a little time in that secret realm, had spoken to Baden, and even to Pandora, who hated them all with a passion that hadn\u2019t dimmed through the centuries.</p><p>Aeron had escaped with his Olivia. Kane, however, did not want to escape.</p> <p>\u201cDead?\u201d he asked again. Even as he spoke, his brain flashed a neon sign into his awareness. Mine.</p><p>The female, surely the loveliest creature he\u2019d ever beheld, said only one word. \u201cNo.\u201d But he felt the force of her voice in every single one of his cells. Pure, enchanting, intoxicating.</p><p>Mine. A roar now.</p><p>Angels couldn\u2019t lie, so he knew she had told the truth. Even though there was no actual layer of truth in her voice. So, if he wasn\u2019t dead, he was alive. The thought didn\u2019t please him. He hated that such a beauty was seeing him like this. At his worst, violated, injured, weak.</p><p>\u201cKill me, then,\u201d he commanded.</p> <p>Mine. Louder than before. He didn\u2019t understand the possessive instinct, and didn\u2019t want to understand it. He might veer from his current path.</p><p>Silence, such heavy silence. The calm before the storm. Because, in the next heartbeat, Disaster protested. Loudly. Screaming and screaming and screaming inside of Kane\u2019s head.</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t dead.</p><p>Kane reached up to cover his ears, and succeeded. His arms had been freed from the chains, he realized distantly. That\u2019s what the woman had done. Unchained him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI won\u2019t be killing you.\u201d</p><p>Mine.</p> <p>Shut up. He returned to his dream theory. This was a dream, only a dream, which meant she had to do whatever he wanted her to do. Right? \u201cKill. Me.\u201d</p><p>Her hands slid underneath his shoulders and pushed him up, up. He felt her heat, the smoothness of her palms. Smelled the fragrance of patchouli, deep, rich and musky, erotic and earthy. Deep in his nose, clinging to his sinuses, spreading into his stomach, his bloodstream.</p><p>MINE.</p><p>A growl was rising up his throat, threatening to spill out of his mouth. His arms went limp and fell uselessly to his sides, and yet he still had to fight the urge to reach up and grab on to her. He wanted his mouth on her, wanted his body in hers.</p><p>He wanted...and so he would have.</p><p>MINE, SHE IS MINE.</p><p>The blonde\u2014who was suddenly no longer a blonde, but a lovely black woman\u2014no, a sultry Latina\u2014got all up in his face, dark eyes piercing him. \u201cI am not here to end your life, but to save it,\u201d she said. \u201cI will take you to the human world\u2014and in return, you will kill me. I\u2019ll have your vow first.\u201d</p><p>Disaster stopped screaming and started laughing again.</p> <p>CRONUS WALKED THE CHAMBER of Futures alone, his emotions balanced on the razor\u2019s edge of destruction. He\u2019d searched everywhere, yet he hadn\u2019t found Rhea. The Hunters he\u2019d captured and locked away were now missing. Rhea had somehow freed them, he knew. And Sienna had not yet done her job with Galen.</p><p>If he had to raze the entire world to save himself, he would.</p><p>One way or another, he would obtain what he wanted. Dominion over the human world. Control of his wife. And life. Eternal life. He was an immortal, a king, the most powerful of his people\u2014even if a few out there left him trembling.</p><p>He stopped in front of a vase one of his Eyes had sculpted and painted so long ago. In it, Rhea\u2019s hated daughter Scarlet, the keeper of Nightmares, was in the process of removing his head. So, yes, there were two predictions about his death. Two supposed murderers. Two different places, in two different times.</p><p>Why?</p><p>He had never been able to figure out this particular mystery. Only one person could kill him, true? Unless Galen and Scarlet worked together? But the pair despised each other, fought for opposite sides. Proof: Scarlet had recently invaded Galen\u2019s dreams and convinced the man of his own impending downfall. Those dreams had driven the keeper of Hope to attack her man, Gideon, which had enraged her further.</p><p>Cronus blinked as an idea took root. Could the answer be that simple? Had Scarlet somehow invaded his Eye\u2019s dreams? Had she shown her a false reality? He and Scarlet had been enemies since her birth, and hurting each other had become something of a game.</p><p>Perhaps, he thought. Yes, perhaps. Which meant he was most likely on the right path. Galen was the biggest threat, and so Galen had to be corralled.</p><p>Sienna now knew exactly how ruthless Cronus could be to ensure his goals were met, and she would come through for him. If she failed, he would make good on his threat. Paris would die. And he would make her watch.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</p><p>A STAY OF EXECUTION, Sienna thought, but only because Galen\u2019s bodyguard, Fox, had done what he had not and tasted her blood. As the woman had dragged Sienna out of the bedroom and into a cellar room boasting only a long table with a drain underneath it, she\u2019d gotten blood on her hands. Sienna had made certain of that. She\u2019d promised Paris she would kill whoever tasted her blood, and she would do her best to see that through.</p><p>And as the woman lifted her onto the table, she\u2019d caught the sweet coconut scent of ambrosia. She\u2019d licked, closed her eyes and moaned in bliss. Then, of course, had come the feasting. Fox had fallen on her, lapping at her, biting her. And when she\u2019d finished, she hadn\u2019t rendered the death-blow but had carted Sienna to her bedroom and tied her up in a corner.</p><p>That had been...how many days ago? Sienna had lost track. Time passed too slowly for her\u2014and yet too quickly\u2014measured only by the number of visits Fox paid her. Her initial injury had healed, but Fox kept making new incisions, taking more blood, keeping her weak.</p><p>What was Paris doing right now? Resenting her? Hating her? Had Lucien managed to keep him inside the castle? Yeah. Probably. The Lords had made their feelings about her clear, and they would jump on this chance to deepen his negative emotions.</p><p>Don\u2019t go there. It\u2019s bad for your mental health. Besides, she needed to plan. First up? Getting Legion out of here. Second, returning and force-feeding Galen her blood. \u2019Cause no way he\u2019d trust her after she absconded with his woman, and she really needed his trust. She couldn\u2019t kill him if she couldn\u2019t get close to him.</p><p>Legion\u2019s frightened face flashed through her mind. Not Galen\u2019s woman. Galen\u2019s perceived woman.</p><p>Wrath stretched inside her head. Like her, he was growing weaker. He needed to feed himself, was desperate to punish someone, and Galen was the perfect candidate.</p><p>She wiggled on the floor, rubbing her bound wrists against the wall behind her. Unfortunately, her wings kept getting in the way. And there was a gag in her mouth, so she couldn\u2019t call for help. Not that she would have. Zacharel would sweep her straight into the heavens and expect her to march to his Do What I Say band. So not happening.</p><p>The bedroom door swung open, and Fox stomped inside. She wore combat boots, black leather pants and a bustier. Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail, and she was licking her lips. She\u2019d come to toke up.</p><p>She fell to her knees in front of Sienna, removed her gag, said \u201cMiss me?\u201d and palmed a blade.</p><p>Come on, fight her. Do something. \u201cYou\u2019re pathetic, you know that? Galen had the strength to resist me, but not you. Are you embarrassed?\u201d</p><p>Fox was too enraptured by the pulse in her neck to reply, and never even bothered to check her restraints, something she\u2019d done every time before. The addiction was getting worse, then. Good.</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re not. You\u2019re too stupid to\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a growl, Fox lunged, lowering her head. Sienna jerked her knees up, knocking the female in the temple and sending her flying to the side. Sienna lumbered to a stand, which was difficult to do with her arms shackled behind her and her ankles held together. Not to mention the Tilt-a-Whirl inside her head.</p><p>Scowling, Fox jumped to her feet. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for that.\u201d</p><p>What she would do next, she didn\u2019t know, but then, it didn\u2019t matter. Suddenly Legion was there, behind Fox, unnoticed\u2014and swinging a frying pan. The cast iron slammed into Fox\u2019s skull, a loud clang echoing. Fox\u2019s eyes went wide, rolled back, and her knees collapsed.</p><p>Legion dropped the pan as if the handle was on fire and stood there, panting, staring down in horror.</p><p>\u201cGrab her knife and cut me loose,\u201d Sienna commanded, taking over. \u201cHurry, we don\u2019t have a lot of time.\u201d</p><p>Shaking, crying now, Legion remained exactly as she was. \u201cI\u2014I know you\u2019re here, but I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t see you, can\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>No. No, no, no. If Legion couldn\u2019t see her, Legion couldn\u2019t touch her. Sienna tried everything she could think of to make herself known. All the while Wrath slammed against her temples, desperate to escape. Finally, not knowing what else to do, she allowed him to take over.</p><p>For the first time after ceding control to the demon, Sienna was aware of her surroundings, of her body and her mind. She wasn\u2019t sure if it happened because she was stronger or Wrath was weaker, but she felt her skin change, from smooth to scaled. Felt her teeth sharpen and her nails elongate.</p><p>A second later, Legion gasped. \u201cWrath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Sienna\u2019s voice was lower, gruffer than ever before.</p><p>The girl worked up the courage to bend down and pick up the knife, then close the distance between them. Delicate hands cut the rope away, freeing Sienna\u2019s arms.</p><p>Through the demon she commandeered the knife. Bending down proved to be a huge mistake, though. The dizziness cranked out of control, and she ended up sprawled on her stomach. She drew up her knees and sawed at the rope, cringing as every inch of her throbbed.</p><p>\u201cI knew she hadn\u2019t killed you,\u201d Legion\u2019s soft voice proclaimed. \u201cI could feel my Wrath. I would have come sooner, but Galen commanded me to stay in his room for however long he had to stay inside it. Turned out to be three days. He left this morning, nullifying the order, and I followed Fox to the kitchen and then to her room.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sienna\u2019s mind caught on only one fact. Three days. Paris would have had to sleep with at least one woman to maintain his strength. More likely two. Don\u2019t think about that, either. A breakdown would stop her from doing what needed doing.</p><p>Completely free now, she anchored the blade at the waist of her pants, pushed to a stand, and held out a hand to Legion. The girl hadn\u2019t moved, was frozen in place, her expression one of great misery.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Galen now?\u201d Sienna asked, still using that gruff voice.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He hasn\u2019t returned.\u201d</p><p>Good. That was good. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d She waved her claw-tipped fingers. \u201cMe and you, right now.\u201d</p><p>Blond hair fluttered around slender shoulders as she shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I took a vow.\u201d The misery increased. \u201cI have to stay with him.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019ll see about that. Vow or not, Sienna was taking this girl to safety. Now. Arguing would waste time. Fighting would be ineffective. As weak as Sienna\u2019s body was, Legion would escape her in seconds. Sneaky route, here we come.</p><p>\u201cAll right. We go without you,\u201d she lied. \u201cNeed another weapon first.\u201d Though she almost fell a thousand times, she managed to pick up the pan, straighten\u2014and brain the girl the same way she\u2019d brained Fox. Clang.</p><p>Legion crumpled, landing on top of Fox. Yeah. That was gonna leave a mark.</p><p>Getting the girl, who was no lightweight, positioned properly on her shoulder was a nearly impossible task. At the last moment, Sienna found the strength to pull through and level out. But the burst cost her. Wrath lost his hold on her, her image returning to normal and her body now moving under her own steam. She stumbled her way into the hall.</p><p>A long hallway. Papered walls, freshly polished furniture. Only the best. A spiral staircase loomed ahead. Miles away, as far as she was concerned.</p><p>Then, at the far end of the hall, Galen took a corner as if he were wearing skates, all speed and furious grace. He was armed like a tanker, and menace rippled off him. Had she spotted him on the street, she would have run like hell and prayed for a quick death. Now, she could only watch as he barreled toward her, intent on taking Legion back.</p> <p>No, he would never trust her now. Her only hope was to engage him, and force her blood down his throat. Then he\u2019d want her alive. Right? Please be right.</p><p>She was about to set Legion down when she caught sight of Zacharel on one side of her and the shadow guy from Cronus\u2019s realm on the other. Dang it, how many people were after her? These two were closing in. Galen noticed them, too, and shouted a black curse. They would reach her before he did.</p><p>And then it happened. Contact. The black mist enveloped her first. She and Legion were swept up into a world of dizzying screams. Beneath those, she thought she heard Zacharel\u2019s roar of frustration and anger. A mistake on her part, surely. The angel was emotionless.</p><p>Wrath retreated to the back of her mind, and just as Sienna opened her mouth to release a scream of her own, the noise quieted. Wrath caught those grainy images again, and had no idea how to react. She tried to fight her way free, but the black mist held tight around her, blocking the view of her surroundings.</p><p>\u201cFemale.\u201d Shadow Guy\u2019s voice was raspy and coaxing. \u201cI have a bargain to propose to you.\u201d</p><p>Legion slipped from her grip. Sienna reached for her, but couldn\u2019t quite get to her, the girl remaining inside the mist, floating, spinning. Eyes closed, she slept on.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>When he offered no more, she snapped, \u201cWell, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome call me Hades.\u201d</p><p>The king of the dead? High Lord of the Underworld? Greek god? The one Hunters feared above all others? That Hades? I am not intimidated. \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d she said, because she had no idea what else to say.</p><p>\u201cYour man needs you.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach bottomed out. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe refuses all women and grows weaker by the moment. I will take you to him. After we reach an agreeable end to our negotiations.\u201d</p><p>Paris, weak and growing weaker. The news that he\u2019d remained faithful to her shouldn\u2019t have relieved and delighted her, but it did. It so did. \u201cHow do I know you\u2019re telling the truth? What would you want in return?\u201d More bodies to feed his shadows?</p><p>\u201cUnlike that fool Cronus, I have no need to lie. And part of me hopes you turn me down so that I can force you. Your screams will join my others, and the symphony will thrill me for centuries to come. I\u2019m feeling magnanimous, however, and we will try your way first.\u201d</p><p>This can only end badly.</p><p>He continued, \u201cI heard what the angel said to you. I heard what Cronus said to you. You are a key to victory, and I want you to play for my team.\u201d</p><p>Argh! Once, no one had wanted her. Now everyone did. \u201cNope. Sorry. I\u2019ve already picked my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you would say such a thing. But I heard you bargain with the goddess. She asked for a boon, and you agreed. I will accept the same arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to slay one of your enemy?\u201d Shocking. He should have no problem doing that on his own.</p><p>\u201cNo. I simply wish for a boon, to be named later. Anything I desire, as long as it does not hurt your man or his friends. Do you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go back to Paris. You\u2019ll have to do something else to save him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot, but you can. All you must do is allow me to take you to him. So simple, so easy.\u201d</p><p>Hardly. \u201cLeaving him nearly killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaying away from him will kill him.\u201d His voice became a caress. \u201cLet me take you to him. You may be with him, strengthen and save him, and then you can convince him to give you up, for no one else has been able. No one else will be able.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so weak. Can\u2019t leave him in danger. \u201cThe girl goes with me, and that\u2019s nonnegotiable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. For a second boon.\u201d</p><p>Sweet heaven, how many would she owe when this was over? \u201cVery well, but only if the same conditions apply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do. And so the new bargain is struck.\u201d Though she could make out no faces in the dark, the shadows thinned in one area, light seeping through to reveal a hint of a grin. \u201cI take you to your man, who is searching for you, and the girl to Aeron, the one searching for her.\u201d</p><p>Sienna blinked, and next found herself inside a tent located somewhere outside the Realm of Blood and Shadow. Too much light seeped in from the tent\u2019s cracks. But then she spotted the fur rug and her location ceased to matter. Paris was sprawled on top of it. He was still. Too still. Fear nearly drilled her to her knees. Until she inhaled. Warm air, scented with champagne and chocolate, fogging her up in the most succulent of ways. His demon\u2019s special scent. Her mouth watered, and her blood quickened. Her own injuries were forgotten as warmth pooled between her legs.</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d she whispered. His skin was fever-bright, flushed and beaded with sweat. He was gloriously naked, and thickly aroused. His eyes were calm behind his lids, his chest barely rising with his breaths. \u201cOh, Paris.\u201d I can\u2019t let him get like this again. Have to do something.</p><p>\u201cSienna?\u201d</p><p>She rushed over to him and kissed him, knowing even so small a gesture would help revive him. The more their tongues dueled, the more aggressive he became. When his lids flipped open, eyes of brilliant red pinned her. With a growl, he grabbed her by the waist and tossed her to her back. Her heart sped into a superbeat as her wings flared to avoid being crushed.</p><p>He ripped at her clothes, shredding them. The very moment she was naked, he had her legs spread and was inside her, thrusting hard and deep.</p><p>As he worked her, he threw back his head and roared. She arched up and took him even deeper. Brutally, wondrously.</p><p>She\u2019d missed this, missed him. Needed this, needed him. Her nails went to his ass and guided him into a faster rhythm. The passion swept her up, overwhelmed her, consumed her, broke her heart and fit the pieces back together. Her love for him knew no bounds, had no limits.</p><p>Just as climax loomed, he stopped. Just stopped, and peered down at her, panting breaths bursting over her. The flush had drained from his cheeks, and realization now flooded his eyes, followed by concern and horror.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby. Did I hurt you?\u201d His thumbs dusted over her lips with exquisite care.</p><p>\u201cTalk later. Make love now.\u201d So close. Any second now, she would hurtle into satisfaction.</p><p>His cock jerked inside her, as if the command had sparked all kinds of naughty desires. \u201cHow are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater!\u201d She squeezed at his massive length.</p><p>\u201cYesss.\u201d His hips pistoned once, pistoned again, and then he was slamming in and out, and they were both moaning. Then his lips were on hers, and their tongues were intertwining, and she was swallowing his taste, and it was better than ever, and she couldn\u2019t get enough, never wanted this to end, and...and...and... Oh!</p><p>Little pleasure bombs exploded through every inch of her. His name left her mouth over and over again, the chorus joined by his shouting of her name as he came. He jetted white-hot, giving her every drop of his passion. She relished the moment, savoring him, thrilled by all that he was.</p><p>When he fell on top of her, she cradled his weight, exactly where she wanted to be. Where she wanted to stay, forever. She\u2019d left him once. She didn\u2019t think she could leave him again.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better,\u201d he murmured against her ear.</p><p>That\u2019s my man. Such a Paris thing to say, and she grinned.</p><p>He disengaged and rolled to his side, but kept her close, his arm wrapped around her. \u201cAnd now that I\u2019m not dying,\u201d he announced, expression growing somber, \u201cwe talk.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT</p><p>PARIS KEPT HIS BODY LAX, not wanting to make Sienna uncomfortable, or aware of the fact that he basically had her in a choke hold. A gentle choke hold, one that did nothing to impair her ability to breathe, but a choke hold all the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wasn\u2019t going anywhere, and that was that.</p><p>Thankfully, Sex was out for the count and unable to comment.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk. I\u2019ll start. Do you hate me now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHate you? Baby, that might be the stupidest thing you\u2019ve ever said. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken. I\u2019m too relieved. After what I did to you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you did was remind me that I need to up my game where you\u2019re concerned.\u201d And honestly? Her actions had given him hope that she felt as deeply for him as he felt for her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad at me for going to Galen?\u201d</p><p>When he would have done the same thing? \u201cOnly at myself. I should have sated you so sublimely, you were never again able to walk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little more practice on your end,\u201d she teased, \u201cand that\u2019ll be a possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitch.\u201d</p><p>When she reached up to brush her hair off her face, he saw that she was cut up and bruised. He swallowed back a bark of fury. Having been restrained a time or twelve throughout his life, he recognized the markings for what they were. Rope burns. \u201cDid Galen do this to you?\u201d</p><p>Dread shuttered her features. \u201cNo, and I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Very well. He wanted to reassure her about a few things first, anyway. But he would find out who had harmed her afterward, and as soon as he did, he was going on a rampage for revenge.</p><p>\u201cThat means you\u2019re ready for talk, part two,\u201d he said, all hint of his amusement gone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. You need to know that I didn\u2019t sleep with anyone while we were apart.\u201d No matter how weak he\u2019d gotten, no matter how many females his friends had shoved at him. Finally, all but Lucien had continued on their quest to find Sienna.</p><p>Mental note: tell Death to call off the search party.</p><p>Speaking of, he was pretty sure Lucien had popped in while they were having sex, thinking to protect him from whatever had come to kill him, then had popped back out when he realized what was going on.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The tips of her fingers traced languid circles around his nipples. \u201cI trust you. But Paris, you were so near death.\u201d She kissed his chest, just above his heart. \u201cI don\u2019t like that you allowed yourself to get in that condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care. And just so you know, Sex missed you, too. You wear a lot of hats, and he wants to do them all.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled, a warm, rich sound that acted as manna for his ears. \u201cRight now I\u2019ve got my stern taskmaster hat on, so you two better listen. I have to leave. I just have to, but I need to know you\u2019re taking care of yourself and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to leave. Just try it. See what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stay or I let myself fade. End of story. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>Such heavy silence. \u201cI have a plan I have to see through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlans change. Deal.\u201d</p><p>She banged her fist against his chest. \u201cYou are so frustrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what I want to hear, Sienna.\u201d</p><p>A sigh slipped from her, seeming to drain the fight out of her. \u201cFine. I\u2019m staying with you, but we\u2019re going to have to brainstorm a solution to our Cronus and Rhea problem, our Galen problem, and our you\u2019re-gonna-die-prophecy problem. Because, did I tell you? Cronus told me that if Galen dies, you and your friends die. If Cronus dies, you and your friends die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying I doubt what you\u2019ve heard, but I do doubt the source. But even if what he said is true, there will be a way around this prophecy. There always is. I\u2019m not worried in the least.\u201d In fact, he was overjoyed. And were those tears in his eyes? Yeah. Yeah, they were. If that made him a wuss, that made him a wuss. He didn\u2019t care. She was here, she was staying. She was his.</p><p>He glided his arm from around her neck to her lower back, splaying his fingers over her curves. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, but the words weren\u2019t enough. They didn\u2019t convey enough. \u201cAnd now that we\u2019re officially together, I want to tell you some things about me. I want everything out in the open, nothing hidden. I want to share all that I am.\u201d</p><p>She must have sensed the direction he headed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. What happened in the past is the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFull disclosure. I want you to know what you\u2019re getting with me. That way, if Wrath ever shows you something, or my friends ever say anything, we\u2019ll already have dealt with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say won\u2019t change the way I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad, but I\u2019m doing it anyway.\u201d</p><p>Her sigh caressed his skin oh, so deliciously. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>She loved him. She\u2019d copped to the feeling. This would be okay. \u201cI\u2019m an ambrosia addict. But I haven\u2019t touched the stuff since before reaching you,\u201d he rushed to add. \u201cAnd if something ever happens and I\u2019m exposed to your blood, you don\u2019t have to worry. I will not hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Her silky hair tickled his chest as she nodded. \u201cI know you won\u2019t hurt me, but Paris, I drugged you. I didn\u2019t know about your addiction, or I would have found another way to knock you out. I am so, so sorry, and I will never forgive myself.\u201d</p><p>He hated the implication that she would have left him still, but he drank up her concern for him. \u201cForgive yourself right now. That\u2019s an order. But I will, of course, be spanking you before I forgive you.\u201d</p><p>The most adorable noise escaped her, a snort and a laugh combined. \u201cI accept the spanking. Deserve it.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched with the sweetest kind of humor. \u201cYou can\u2019t accept your own punishment, baby. You\u2019ll have to fight me.\u201d</p><p>She purred, actually purred, and the vibrations had him rock-hard again.</p><p>Tell her the rest, so you can move on to the good stuff. He lost his half grin. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s part three. I know you told me you\u2019ve seen my past, but I\u2019m not sure if Wrath showed you everything. I told you about that one slave, but he wasn\u2019t the only one. I\u2019ve...been with men.\u201d</p><p>Not even a pause. \u201cOh, yeah? Well, in college I kissed a girl. She was my roommate, it was raining outside, dark with the occasional flashes of lightning, romantic yet scary. You know how it goes.\u201d</p><p>That she wasn\u2019t going to make a big deal about it, that she again just accepted each facet of him...no wonder he loved this woman. \u201cDid you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kinda did,\u201d Sienna said in a scandalized whisper.</p><p>Mmm, but he liked her scandalized. Wondered what he could do to ramp that up, what would make her nervous but too excited to say no. Finding out, well, he\u2019d never looked forward to a bedding more.</p><p>\u201cLater, after your spanking, we\u2019re gonna do a little role playing. I\u2019m going to be your sweet, innocent roommate, Parette, and you\u2019re going to demonstrate that kiss on me.\u201d And then I\u2019m going to talk you into doing things you\u2019ve only ever dreamed about.</p><p>\u201cIncorrigible beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you always.\u201d</p><p>Before he could respond, there was an explosion of white light at the front of the tent. In a flurry of movement and frothing rage, Paris grabbed both the crystal blades, pressing one into Sienna\u2019s hand. He was standing a moment later, unconcerned by his nakedness.</p><p>Cronus had arrived, and if his fearsome scowl was any indication, he was ticked. First instinct: attack. Paris tamped it down. Barely. Second: recon. Answers, he needed answers.</p><p>The king\u2019s narrowed gaze slid past Paris and onto Sienna, who had just finished righting her clothing. \u201cYou ruined everything,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Paris moved in front of her, blocking the king\u2019s view. Cronus merely pointed to the side of the tent, and Paris was propelled there on a powerful gust of wind, his arms spread, his legs spread, invisible ropes tying him in place. Though he fought, he couldn\u2019t free himself.</p><p>Helpless. Just like that. Panic was like bitter pills in his mouth, and he swallowed so many he might just overdose.</p><p>Darkness...so much darkness...I will hurt him. I will kill him. He struggled so viciously his muscles began to tear from his bones. That didn\u2019t slow him.</p><p>A scowling Sienna popped to her feet. Use the crystal, he projected with the last vestiges of his control. She didn\u2019t; she stood her ground, her chin held high.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going back to Galen,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cEven if he were addicted to you, Galen will not trust or follow you now. He hates you. You took his prisoner, damaged his soldier, and he is not the type to forgive or forget. To him, every offense is to be returned a thousandfold.\u201d</p><p>Those gossamer black wings extended. \u201cThere\u2019s another way. We\u2019ll find it. Just give us time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime? Time.\u201d Menace pulsed from Cronus. \u201cYou once asked me why I wanted you willing. The answer was simple. Eventually you would have turned on me. Now you have and that\u2019s no longer a concern. So, no, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re out of time. Now I will destroy everything you hold dear.\u201d</p><p>Paris snarled as Cronus vanished and reappeared in front of Sienna in a single blink. He snagged her by the hair. At last Paris managed to free himself, both shoulders popping out of joint. He was running for them. Nearly upon them.</p><p>Just before he reached her, Sienna shouted, \u201cZacharel! I summon you.\u201d</p><p>Cronus reached out and stabbed Paris just before Paris reached them. Sienna gasped. The pair vanished, her gaze locked on Paris as he fell to his knees, a searing pain consuming him.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-NINE</p><p>\u201cWE ARE NOT DOING THIS again,\u201d Sienna shouted, worried for Paris, desperate to return to him. \u201cI\u2019m sick of everyone flinging me where they want me to be.\u201d Black, all around her. In her nose, in her lungs, pouring through her bloodstream. No color, no life, just an endless void. \u201cThat ends now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou failed to take the easiest route, and now you\u2019ll have to live with Plan B,\u201d Cronus said, his voice slithering from the nothingness.</p><p>I won\u2019t ask. His plans mean nothing to me.</p><p>\u201cZacharel!\u201d she called again. Work with the angels? Why not? She would learn to fly properly, and finally, once and for all, control her own destiny.</p><p>A flicker of light. A return of the dark. Another flicker, lasting just a bit longer. She caught a glimpse of big, puffy clouds, glued to an endless expanse of night sky. A star here, a star there, twinkling from their perches like eyes trained on her, watching her every move. She must be in another realm. One without a single living creature in residence.</p> <p>She turned a full circle, and found Cronus standing a few yards away. His arms were crossed over his chest, his legs braced apart. She was suddenly very grateful she\u2019d maintained her grip on the crystal blade Paris had given her.</p><p>\u201cAnother reason I wanted your willingness,\u201d Cronus said. \u201cIf you had turned on me, you would have become Rhea\u2019s soldier and therefore been under her protection.\u201d</p><p>Now he wanted to talk? Well, he could take his confessions and shove them. \u201cI\u2019m warning you. Return me to Paris. Now.\u201d</p><p>He arched a mocking brow at her. \u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I will fight you.\u201d Planned to, anyway. You just sped things along.</p> <p>A booming laugh, sharp and bitter, even anticipatory. \u201cYou could try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReturn me to Paris,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThis is your last chance.\u201d</p><p>He continued on as if she hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cRhea did not kill your sister. I did.\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat as denial rushed through her. \u201cNo.\u201d A lie, surely. One meant to punish her. Because, if he were telling the truth, she would have helped the very man who\u2019d destroyed her precious Skye, leaving her bloody and broken, her last memory of a knife slicking through her skin. She would have bled for the man who had destroyed an innocent. She would very nearly have sacrificed her own life and happiness for her sister\u2019s killer...</p><p>No!</p><p>And yet, Wrath\u2019s earlier insistence that something had been wrong suddenly made sense. The moisture evaporated from her mouth. A knot grew in her throat, and she had trouble drawing in the necessary oxygen. Dizziness took center stage in her head.</p> <p>\u201cI held her in my hands, and I slit her throat. I watched the life drain out of her. I killed her husband first. Made her watch. I can prove it.\u201d He reached up and jerked a chain from around his neck. A butterfly carved from a black diamond dangled from the center.</p><p>In the next moment, the shield that had prevented Wrath from seeing his sins crumpled to nothing. She clutched her temples, squeezed her eyes closed as the scene unfolded inside her head. Cronus, holding Skye and a human male at his sides. Making them kneel. Stabbing the male. Skye, fighting, shoving herself into his blade. Skye, bleeding. Cronus, finishing her off. Skye, dying.</p><p>Nausea rolled through Sienna\u2019s stomach, a churning acid threatening to boil up and out. A fury drenched in seething flames and sharpened by jagged bits of glass.</p><p>\u201cI have lived for millennia,\u201d Cronus said. \u201cThink you I have not learned a few tricks along the way?\u201d</p><p>We will punish him. A whisper. WE WILL PUNISH HIM. A scream.</p><p>I will, she replied. A vow. Oh, I will. For Skye. For Paris. For herself.</p><p>\u201cYou ruined my plan, and now I will ruin yours,\u201d he seethed. \u201cI will bargain with Galen. For his eternal allegiance, I will hand you over, his to punish as he sees fit. If you run from him, I will bring you back to him. And if you think to flee to your demon lover, I will make Paris suffer before I kill him. And have no doubt, I will kill him. He thinks to take revenge on me for everything I\u2019ve done to you.\u201d</p><p>The king had made that kind of threat one too many times.</p> <p>Hatred joined the sickness, as did a dollop of darkness. Violence waltzed between those shadows, the urge to maim and destroy so strong she felt as if she were drowning in them. She didn\u2019t fight them; she embraced them.</p><p>He would be punished. Here. Today.</p><p>Hold, Wrath said. Not yet...not quite yet...</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what Wrath planned; she only knew she trusted him to lead her in vengeance.</p><p>Cronus added blithely, \u201cDid you know four artifacts are needed to find Pandora\u2019s box? Galen has one, and the Lords have three. That will change. I will take the All-Seeing Eye, the Cage of Compulsion and the Paring Rod, and I will bestow them on Galen. All four artifacts will be his. He will be so grateful for my gifts, he will vow never to harm me. He will find the box, and your precious Lords will die.\u201d</p><p>Hold...</p><p>\u201cYou trust Galen that much, do you? You actually think he\u2019ll keep his word? That he won\u2019t try and take your demon, too?\u201d She flashed a patronizing smile. \u201cI bet he\u2019s as trustworthy as you are. So, after you do all of that for him and he goes in for the kill shot, what will you do, hmm? Are you going to fight him? Or finally accept your death sentence as your due?\u201d</p><p>Cronus stalked to her, but stopped midway, his ears twitching. A smug, eerie laugh bubbled from him. \u201cSpeak of the devil. Or in this case, the man who masquerades as angel. Galen approaches, woman. And never has a warrior been angrier. He wants what you stole from him, and he will extract his pound of flesh from your body.\u201d</p><p>Hold...</p><p>\u201cBring it,\u201d she said. Because, yeah, she was going to punish Galen, too. Punish him for every crime he\u2019d ever committed against Paris. For everything he\u2019d done to Legion. Everything he\u2019d ever thought to do. At long last.</p><p>The king\u2019s nostrils flared. He clearly wasn\u2019t fond of her lack of fear.</p><p>Well, too bad.</p><p>Hold...</p><p>\u201cNo worries, baby. We\u2019ve already brought it,\u201d Paris said from behind Cronus.</p><p>The darkness fell away, as if a curtain had been jerked to the floor. Bright light exploded, the sun shining so vividly. Her eyes stung, but she kept them open. Paris was pale and bloody but steady on his feet. He stood with the rest of the Lords behind Cronus, who spun to face them. They were armed for war. Unlike in the painting, they weren\u2019t here to protect him.</p><p>Even better, an army of warriors whose white wings proclaimed them angels stood behind them, and they were armed for war. Zacharel claimed the helm. Every time she\u2019d encountered him, his lack of emotion had amazed and even disturbed her. Now, she was grateful for it. He was determination itself, as cold and cruel as the snow falling from him, clearly willing to do anything to meet his goals.</p><p>\u201cYou broke the rules, Cronus,\u201d the warrior angel said flatly, \u201cand now you will pay.\u201d</p><p>What rules?</p><p>\u201cMind if we join the party?\u201d another voice\u2014a female voice\u2014said from behind Sienna. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this moment for far too long.\u201d</p><p>Sienna whipped around to see a beautiful brunette who could only be Rhea. The regal Titan queen stood beside Galen, who was glaring at Sienna as if he would come for her first. An army of Hunters flanked them, and she recognized a few faces.</p><p>I\u2019ve picked my side. Beware, she projected through her narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Cronus demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe first battle of the new war,\u201d Zacharel replied gravely.</p><p>\u201cWell, then. It begins. I\u2019ll need my own army, won\u2019t I?\u201d He waved his hand and a great throng of his people appeared, Titan gods and goddesses enveloping him, hiding him in a sea of stunning, flawless faces and immaculate, jewel-studded gowns and togas. They were obviously confused by the sudden change of scenery and none were armed.</p><p>When they spotted the unrest surrounding them, they wised up fast. Weapons of every kind appeared out of thin air.</p><p>\u201cTo the death!\u201d Cronus shouted.</p><p>As if his voice was the starting bell, the armies rushed each other.</p><p>Now! Wrath shouted at her.</p><p>Sienna opened her mind to her demon, allowing him to take over, and threw herself into the thick of the action.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTY</p><p>PRIORITY ONE: SIENNA.</p><p>For once, Sex didn\u2019t hide deep in a corner of Paris\u2019s mind. The demon, on a high from their woman\u2019s body, pumped strength straight into his veins as he rushed toward her, the wound from his stabbing having already healed. The darkness inside him frothed and writhed, guiding him but not consuming him. The three of them were one.</p><p>When he saw a man, a Hunter, coming up behind Sienna with a Glock raised and aimed, he roared, quickened his pace. Met the guy with an arcing blade to the throat before a single shot was fired, even as he spun his woman behind him.</p><p>Zacharel had warned him that up here, in this realm between realms just above the heart of the heavens, everyone could see her. And if they could see her, they could touch her. If they could touch her they could hurt her. And like him, she could be killed, her body too injured for Wrath to repair it, especially considering the damage done to her during their separation\u2014which she still hadn\u2019t told him about.</p><p>Paris\u2019s first casualty of the battle crumpled. One down. Only about a thousand more to go. \u201cCan you fly to safety?\u201d he asked, nailing another Hunter. There went number two.</p><p>She offered no reply. Fearing the worst, he swung his sword to take down any threat in front of her. Only, she had worked her way back in front of him. He spotted the back of her head, her wings tucked safely out of the way, and realized she was engaged in her own battle. Either she had allowed Wrath to overtake her or she had learned some new skills in the hour they\u2019d been parted. He was betting on the former. Good.</p><p>Clasping only the crystal dagger, she danced through the crowd with lethal menace, her focus on Cronus and the men and women surrounding him. Hunters fell all around her. She spun, she ducked, she darted left and right. Her wings flared suddenly, and she lifted high, higher, cutting someone down below her.</p><p>A true angel of death. Paris had never seen anything so beautiful. He trailed behind her, and anyone who turned their sights on her, he killed savagely. No hesitation. No regrets.</p><p>A throwing star sliced his forearm. There was a sharp sting, a warm trickle of blood. Neither slowed him, and he didn\u2019t bother checking for the culprit. There were so many people, so many bodies, so many wings and weapons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The gods and goddesses wore bejeweled robes and hummed with electrical energy that lifted his hair. Some could shoot fire from their fingertips, some could shoot ice. Besides Cronus and Rhea, he\u2019d never really had a beef with the Titans, but the angels, who were, miracle of miracles, on his side, did have a beef, so...the enemy of my friend is my enemy. Anytime Paris spotted a Titan, he slew first and decided to ask questions later.</p><p>Why Titans versus angels, though? A turf thing, maybe? Like, the heavens belonged to the wingers and they weren\u2019t going to tolerate encroachers anymore? Made sense, but even if the reason had been something as lame as \u201cWe don\u2019t like the Titans, whaa, whaa, boo-hoo, they\u2019re mean,\u201d he\u2019d be in this at full throttle.</p><p>A group of Hunters surged toward Sienna, claiming his complete focus and rage. They seemed to recognize her as one of their own. Or rather, a traitor to their kind. Their abhorrence was evident, as was their spotlighting of her, as though Rhea and Galen had placed her at the top of the must-kill list.</p> <p>Moving faster than human eyes could track, Paris twisted and turned, arms always crossing, swinging, cutting. Grunts and groans sounded. Screams, too. Ahead, a Hunter aimed a .40. Even as he continued forward, Paris threw his crystal blade as if it were a deadly boomerang. And actually, it was. It changed shape midflight and sliced through the Hunter\u2019s wrist before the shot could go off, taking both the hand and the gun, before hurtling back to Paris\u2019s waiting grip.</p><p>Except, he\u2019d missed the other Hunter with the other gun, currently aimed at Lucien. Paris went to throw the blade, but the shot boomed out, nailing Lucien in the side. Blood spurted. The warrior shouted, but didn\u2019t go down. Kept fighting.</p><p>The other Lords closed ranks around him, protecting him. Good men. The best. They\u2019d fought together a long time, in the heavens and on earth. They knew to stay close, to fight with their backs to each other and to draw tighter when an injury was sustained.</p><p>But Lucien gathered his strength and flashed himself directly behind the Hunter who\u2019d harmed him. The man was dead before his body hit the ground.</p><p>\u201cLook out,\u201d Paris shouted as another Hunter came at his friend. His boots hammered at the ground as he raced to intervene.</p> <p>Lucien ducked. The human\u2019s dagger swiped nothing but air. And then Paris was on the guy, slamming into him, propelling him down, down. He punched once, heard bone crack, twice, felt bone crack, then finished him off with a swipe of his blade.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Lucien said, helping him up.</p><p>\u201cNo prob.\u201d He scanned the area, even as he threw himself into another fight. Shit. He\u2019d lost sight of Sienna. Humans and immortals were still standing, weapons locked in battle. The injured had slinked off to the sidelines to protect themselves from further harm. Of course, warriors, being warriors, hunted them and took care of business.</p><p>Meanwhile, body parts were flying and blood was pooling. And was that a wing at his feet, white threaded with gold? Yeah. Damn. Poor angel.</p><p>Find Sienna. A command from his demon, his darkness and himself.</p><p>He barreled in the direction he\u2019d last seen her, leaving a trail of death in his wake. This was why he\u2019d been created, after all. To fight. To kill. He rolled with the violence, bending, straightening, darting as needed. Throwing punches, slicing through skin and into organs. He experienced several more stinging pains and trickles of blood, but still he kept going.</p> <p>From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Maddox fall. Then Reyes. And was that Sabin? They would be fine, he told himself. Like Lucien, they were strong. He would not believe otherwise.</p><p>A few feet ahead, Gideon was sliced through the stomach and bleeding like a sieve, fighting off two giants. Strider was...nowhere. Gone. But there were Kaia and Gwen, Haidee and Scarlet, hacking through enemy lines with grins on their faces.</p><p>My boys are fine or the girls wouldn\u2019t be so happy, Paris assured himself. He quickened his steps and took one of the giants from behind, the decapitation allowing Gideon to center his efforts. There were just so many Hunters, so many immortals. If they could hurt his friends, then Sienna would be\u2014</p><p>There! He caught a glimpse of those black wings. Blood dripped from their tips, and he wasn\u2019t sure if it was hers or someone else\u2019s. Urgency rode him, guiding him faster and faster. A war cry echoed as a male plowed toward her from the right. Paris noticed and launched himself at the man, catching him around the waist. They skidded across the floor. A swift twist of the guy\u2019s neck, and that little battle was over.</p><p>Paris hopped to his feet and headed for his woman. She took down a big bruiser of a man with a swing of her dagger. Crimson stained her arms to the elbows. Her shirt was torn, her side bleeding.</p><p>The darkness inside him thickened.</p><p>Zacharel appeared in front of Sienna, cutting a clearer path for her and challenging the Titans who clashed with other angels in front of Cronus. Big shocker, Cronus was fighting, too. Rhea\u2019s men had come from the other side, and were currently hacking at him as if he was a pi\u00f1ata and they wanted the candy inside him. And yet, they hadn\u2019t managed to inflict a single injury on him. He was too strong, too fast. Too damn powerful.</p><p>Then those Hunters were down, and it was Cronus against Rhea, no one standing between them, the rest of the battle raging behind them. Both held two short swords, and both raced toward each other. Contact. Metal clanged against metal, even sparking.</p> <p>\u201cBitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your man kills me, you\u2019ll die, too,\u201d Cronus spat.</p><p>\u201cWorth it,\u201d the queen gritted.</p><p>All around, the humans and angels\u2014and hell, even the Lords, because yeah, Paris felt it too\u2014experienced an increase of fury. As if their emotions fed off the king\u2019s and queen\u2019s. Teeth were bared. Claws unleashed.</p><p>Paris had a strange thought that the entire world was probably shaking from this. Earthquakes, tornados, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, storms of any and all kind. What would he find when he returned there?</p><p>Head in the game.</p><p>Kill, he thought. He threw himself back into the fray. Dagger, swinging. Bodies, falling. Sienna, close by. Finally he reached her. Of course, that\u2019s when Galen appeared. He was soaked in crimson, shaking with rage. And he swung a long broadsword at Sienna\u2019s neck.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t noticed, too busy finishing off another Hunter.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Paris leapt between the two combatants. Because he was taller than Sienna, the tip of Galen\u2019s sword cut through his chest rather than his neck. Skin, muscle, bone, all three split. Warm blood poured as his knees buckled.</p><p>A high-pitched scream of unholy rage and denial nearly busted his eardrums. Sienna had noticed. He thought maybe his heart had taken some of the impact, too, because the organ skipped one beat, then another.</p><p>His vision fogged. Bodies became blurs of movement. Black\u2014Sienna and her ire. White\u2014Galen and his brute force. The two engaged, a whirlwind of motion and menace.</p><p>Come on, come on. Paris wasn\u2019t going down like this.</p><p>He pushed to his feet, but was immediately tossed back down. Someone had barreled into him, was punching at his face. Got his lip but good, the tissue slicing on his teeth. Though Paris couldn\u2019t see who it was, he suspected the culprit was human, and kicked out. The weight left him, and he got back on his feet.</p><p>The male came at him again. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted the honor of killing one of your kind.\u201d</p><p>Paris still held his dagger and swiped. Contact, gurgling. Another body joined the ever-growing pile.</p><p>Sienna...Sienna... There! Still fighting Galen. Her motions were slowing, and there were seemingly thousands of new streaks of red interspersed with the black of her broken wings. She was hurting, weakening. Eyes narrowing, homing in on his target, Paris kicked forward. More Hunters rushed him, but he kept his eye on the prize and hacked at whoever got in his way. Then it happened.</p><p>Galen pinned her to the floor, ready to render the final blow.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Legion?\u201d the keeper of Hope shouted, going to his knees, putting his weight on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNever...tell...\u201d Her voice held no trace of Wrath. Which meant the demon wasn\u2019t guiding her right now. She was in control. She would feel every injury.</p><p>Hurry! Get to her! Paris stumbled, righted himself, kept moving. Closer...but not close enough...so damn far away.</p><p>Another human, tossed aside.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Galen.</p><p>\u201cWhere you\u2019ll never find her.\u201d Sienna.</p><p>Just beyond them, Cronus drilled Rhea\u2019s sword with so much force, the queen lost her grip. The king pounced, fisting her hair and forcing her to her knees. And there was nothing she could do about it, weaponless as she now was.</p><p>With his free hand, Cronus withdrew a thin link of chain from the pocket of his robe and bound her wrists behind her. Struggling the entire time, she spat curses at him. He hooked the chain around her ankles. A hog tie. A good one. The queen wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere until he let her.</p><p>A sharp lance of pain seared between his shoulder blades. Someone had just stabbed him in the back, Paris realized distantly. Once again his knees gave out. This time, he couldn\u2019t get to his feet. Commanding his crystal blade to elongate, he shoved the length backward, nailed the one who\u2019d taken him down, then he began crawling. He would reach Sienna. He would, even though every inch he gained left a thick trail of blood behind. In fact, he\u2019d lost so much he wasn\u2019t sure how he was still conscious.</p><p>Galen swung around, removing his weight from Sienna, but she stayed where she was. Prone, motionless.</p><p>What had the bastard done to her? \u201cNo. No.\u201d On his hands and knees, Paris worked his way to her. \u201cHold on, baby. I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>Cronus and Galen circled each other. Both were cut and bleeding profusely. Both were limping.</p><p>\u201cWell, well. Our showdown at last,\u201d the king said. He coughed and spit out a tooth. He was without a weapon, having dropped them to confine his wife.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t flash away, too injured to do so.</p><p>Galen raised his sword. \u201cWell, well, indeed. You didn\u2019t bring what you promised me, and now you are defenseless.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAm I? I think not. If you want your woman,\u201d the king continued, \u201cyou\u2019ll walk away now. I will bring her to you, and you may keep her. But you are never to defy me again. So walk away. Now.\u201d</p><p>Sienna twitched. Twitched again. Relief consumed Paris. Almost there, almost... Slowly she rose, shook her head and took stock of the scene playing out in front of her, clearly still consumed by Wrath\u2019s influence after all. Cronus had his back to her. Galen was in front of Cronus, but paid her no heed.</p><p>The crystal dagger she held glinted in the light. And it elongated as his had just done, thickened, the end becoming a hook. Becoming a scythe. Becoming the only weapon capable of killing the man who ruled from the Titan throne. Paris realized what was about to happen and froze.</p> <p>Oh, damn. Anyone looking from behind Galen, which was the view from Danika\u2019s painting of this moment, would see only Cronus. They wouldn\u2019t see the slight female behind him. The female who would change the world with her next action.</p><p>\u201cI will never bow to you,\u201d Galen snarled. \u201cAnd I will get my woman on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get her after I kill her, then.\u201d</p><p>Galen roared, his weapon shaking in his grip.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Sienna said, even as Galen swung, \u201cyou\u2019ll be the one dying.\u201d She, too, swung.</p> <p>Her weapon was longer, stronger, and far more powerful, and she beat Galen to the punch.</p><p>Cronus never knew what hit him.</p><p>His head detached, flew, and his body collapsed. Rhea screamed, but for a split second, she looked nearly triumphant. \u201cWorth...it,\u201d she whispered, and then she, too, went silent, suddenly motionless.</p><p>My woman. Pride joined Paris\u2019s relief. My woman did this. Won this.</p><p>As the throngs began to shout in revelation, a dark, screeching form rose from the king\u2019s body, its crimson eyes glowing, its fangs long and sharp, and a tail swishing behind it. A similar form rose from Rhea, only hers had a stooped back with horns and claws so long they could have been sabers.</p><p>Their demons were escaping.</p> <p>Crazed, Greed and Strife shot high into the air, disappearing into the night. Two of Pandora\u2019s demons would once more be unleashed upon the world.</p><p>\u201cSomeone should go after them,\u201d Paris tried to say, but then Sienna screamed, hitting her knees, and he no longer cared about anything else. Her arms spread wide, her back arched, contorting her. Her head fell back, and she released another scream, then another and another.</p><p>At last Paris reached her. At last she quieted, her voice box razed. She remained in that position, shaking, shaking so badly. He wanted to gather her into his arms, to offer comfort, but he put himself in front of her. He was her shield. Now, always.</p><p>Galen stood there, panting, and maybe he would have attacked, but the battle had ended as suddenly as it had begun. The few remaining Hunters realized they were outnumbered and took off in a dead sprint, though where they thought they could escape to up here, he had no clue. Bloody gods and bedraggled goddesses sank to their knees. Some bowed their heads; others simply looked stunned.</p><p>The angels came up to flank Sienna, daring the keeper of Hope to make a move.</p><p>\u201cAll hail the new queen,\u201d a goddess suddenly said.</p><p>The rest of the Titans repeated the phrase, their voices rising in fervor, as one by one, they kneeled in front of Paris. He wasn\u2019t sure what was happening; surely they would not refer to him as the new queen. He had his moments, sure, but maybe it was a Titan thing, like how Viola called her male pet \u201cprincess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey speak to the girl behind you,\u201d Zacharel said, moving to stand beside him.</p> <p>Sienna? Sienna was queen? Of the Titans? Still crouched, he swung around to check on her. The dizziness increased, and he realized his line of sight was completely blown.</p><p>The angel added roughly, \u201cChoices decide our fate. And though I was not made aware until now, she was to be the king\u2019s greatest asset\u2014or his only downfall, depending on the choice she made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he would...have known. His Eyes...would have...told him.\u201d Every word scraped his throat, burning. Every word weakened him further.</p><p>\u201cI am sure they did,\u201d Zacharel said. \u201cIn their own way. Perhaps he did not look closely enough, or perhaps they did not show him everything. And now Sienna has taken the godly throne. This is why we wanted her on our side, why everyone wanted her on their side. The powers Cronus stole from so many others over the centuries have now become hers.\u201d</p><p>Do I know how to pick \u2019em or what? This was one more hat for her to wear, he thought with a faint laugh that caused blood to bubble up his throat, spilling out of his mouth.</p><p>A fog drifted through his mind, but it couldn\u2019t hide the revelation that he was dying. Already he\u2019d lost too much blood, and with every second that passed, breathing became more difficult. But Sienna would be safe, always safe, and that was all that mattered. He couldn\u2019t ask for more than that. Except for a future with her. He would have liked that.</p><p>The rest of his strength draining, he allowed himself to fall backward, his head landing in her lap.</p><p>\u201cParis?\u201d</p><p>Darkness that had nothing to do with his anger closed in. \u201cI...love...you,\u201d he croaked out.</p><p>\u201cParis!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave...friends...don\u2019t let...die.\u201d The darkness consumed him, and he knew nothing more.</p><p>Except...</p><p>\u201cParis!\u201d</p><p>Her voice jerked him back. A flash of white. Darkness. A flash of white, lasting several seconds longer. Another flash, lasting...lasting...his body and demon seeming to stretch apart, disconnect...until he heard Sienna\u2019s voice and everything snapped back together.</p><p>\u201c\u2014not leaving me! I won\u2019t let you. Remember when we talked about having someone to die for? Well, you\u2019re mine. You\u2019re my someone. If you pass, I\u2019ll follow. Somehow, I\u2019ll follow.\u201d Oh, was she pissed. That temper of hers was coming out to play. \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d</p><p>The ground rumbled beneath him.</p><p>He smiled, because in that moment he realized something wondrous. Everything was going to be okay. Sienna was stubborn to her core. She had defeated Cronus, outwitted Galen. This was nothing.</p><p>They would be together, one way or another. She would make sure of it.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE</p><p>SIENNA HATED TO LEAVE PARIS in bed, and didn\u2019t want him to wake up without her by his side. His body was in the process of healing from the massive wounds he\u2019d sustained during battle, and when he opened his eyes, he would want answers. Answers she would happily give, just as soon as she learned them.</p><p>So, after brushing her knuckles over his beautiful face\u2014though he turned toward her, he gave no other reaction\u2014she hurriedly left the chamber they shared in the Realm of Blood and Shadows. Then she stopped. Wait, wait, wait. She could flash now, couldn\u2019t she?</p><p>In fact, that\u2019s how she\u2019d gotten Paris and all of his friends back here. She\u2019d entertained a simple thought: I wish we were home, and boom, she\u2019d blinked and every single one of them had materialized at the castle. Shock had drilled her to her knees, and her mind had gone into a tailspin. For hours after that, her mind had reeled with the possibilities\u2014Hawaii, Russia, Ireland, Key West, plus everywhere else she\u2019d ever wanted to visit\u2014and she\u2019d ended up flashing all over the world by accident.</p><p>That had been, what? Two days ago. Two days that seemed like an eternity, but she\u2019d finally gotten control of that particular ability. She didn\u2019t think she would ever get used to some of the others.</p><p>Power swirled inside her, so much power her skin felt too tight for her body and her pores felt stretched, as if at any moment she could shatter into a thousand pieces. Apparently, taking Cronus\u2019s head meant she was entitled to nearly all of his powers, and definitely all that he\u2019d owned. Like, say, his home in the heavens and even his harem\u2014from which she\u2019d promptly freed everyone.</p><p>One of the females inside\u2014Arca\u2014had asked her if Paris had sent her. In exchange for Arca\u2019s aid, he\u2019d vowed to free her after saving Sienna. She\u2019d said yes, and now that debt was paid.</p><p>On top of everything else, Cronus\u2019s allies were hers\u2014as were his enemies. But she wasn\u2019t worried.</p><p>She could also feel the darkness inside her now, the darkness Zacharel had told her about, the darkness Paris had given her\u2014a darkness Wrath loved to devour. He\u2019d never fed from her, but had begun to feed from Paris, taking that part of him and lessening its hold on him. Zacharel would have to approve.</p><p>With a sigh, she flashed into Lucien\u2019s room, ready to begin her daily checkup on all of Paris\u2019s friends. He and Anya were in bed, sleeping peacefully. His injuries were less severe than Paris\u2019s, and he had finally crawled out of bed this morning, only to stalk into the entertainment room, toss Anya over his shoulder, and vanish them both.</p><p>Maddox and Ashlyn were also in bed, but they were cooing to their babies, who kicked and gurgled in their adoring parents\u2019 arms. Maddox was bandaged pretty heavily, was pale and bruised, but he was smiling. The little boy, Urban, met Sienna\u2019s gaze and winked.</p><p>Winked? Surely not.</p><p>Strider and Kaia were\u2014having sex. Oh, oh, ick! My eyes. Sienna moved to the next room.</p><p>Sabin and Gwen\u2014someone save me. They were also going at it. What was with the people in this castle? Had Paris\u2019s demon somehow rubbed off on all of them?</p><p>Gideon and Scarlet were snuggled together, talking. And a stranger conversation Sienna had never heard.</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you most.\u201d</p><p>Moving on.</p><p>Amun and Haidee were in the kitchen, baking cookies. Haidee had flour streaked on her cheeks, prints on her breasts and butt, all courtesy of Amun and his wandering hands.</p><p>Reyes and Danika were in their bedroom. Like Paris, Reyes was sleeping off his injuries. Danika was painting.</p><p>Sienna knew Danika was the current All-Seeing Eye, and purposely didn\u2019t look at the colorful scene being created. She didn\u2019t want to end up like Cronus, obsessed with what was to happen and doing everything in her power to prevent it, all while forgetting to truly live in the present. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All she\u2019d been willing to listen to was Danika\u2019s claim that the Lords\u2019 fortress in Budapest would soon be too dangerous to occupy, though she didn\u2019t know why, and that the whole crew needed to stay here for the time being. Sienna had, of course, given her blessing.</p><p>Cameo was in the entertainment room, polishing her daggers while the TV played an episode of 1000 Ways to Die. Yes, the warriors had found a way to rig the immortal realm to receive a satellite signal.</p><p>Aeron and Olivia\u2014 Not again! Seriously. The castle was more like a zoo with monkeys. Wrath gave his customary heaven/hell coos, and there was still a hint of yearning in his tone, but no more of the whimpers.</p> <p>Happy to be with me? Sienna asked the demon. At least a little?</p><p>You aren\u2019t so terrible.</p><p>She laughed. Wrath talked to her more and more now, real conversations rather than a spew of single-minded words. He\u2019d helped her on that battlefield, guiding her actions but not overtaking her completely, just as he\u2019d done with Fox, allowing her to work with him and do what was needed. She suspected he felt that this way, he helped protect his Aeron and Olivia.</p><p>Legion was in the room they\u2019d chosen for her, as well, but one of her wrists had been chained to the wall. A long link allowed her to move freely about, but the cuff itself kept her from flashing to Galen to keep her vow to him.</p><p>I\u2019ll have to fix that, Sienna thought.</p> <p>Hope will fight to the death to win her back, Wrath said.</p><p>Yeah. Probably. But that was a worry for later in the day.</p><p>Viola and her princess dog thing were in there with Legion, and Viola was regaling the chained girl with stories about herself. A captive audience. Seemed about right. Poor Legion, though. The princess was licking her feet.</p><p>Torin was in his room, sitting in front of a bank of computers. There was a faraway expression on his face, and she wondered what he was thinking about.</p><p>In a snap, she knew. Could actually hear what he was thinking.</p><p>\u2014supposed to do with the All-Key now? Cronus won\u2019t be asking for it back, he\u2019s dead, and crap, what\u2019s up with Paris\u2019s woman being queen of the Titans? Are you kidding me with that? She\u2019s a former human and dead besides. Not to mention a former Hunter. And we already know how whacked it is to be ruled by those with demons inside them. Do we bow to her now? Damn, this is weird and I have no clue\u2014</p> <p>Enough! she thought, and the volume on his mind was completely shut off. Much as she didn\u2019t want to know the future, she didn\u2019t want to know more than her fair share about the present, either. Invading people\u2019s thoughts was so uncool. Mrs. Manners would not approve.</p><p>Sienna hadn\u2019t spoken much to the Lords in the past two days, too busy tending Paris and adjusting to her new position, but now she knew most of them were still uneasy about her. Fine, whatever. That would take time. Time she was willing to give them. Anything to be with Paris.</p><p>Next, she appeared in front of the three rooms occupied by Cronus\u2019s immortal prisoners. Cameron, Winter and Irish. Unlike all the times before, she saw no flashes of their crimes inside her mind. During the battle in the heavens, Wrath had fed to the point of sickness and currently had no appetite.</p><p>Cameron spotted her first, and alerted the others. She wasn\u2019t surprised that they could see her now. Everyone else could, too. They strode to those air-shielded doorways.</p><p>Cameron sniffed, caught her scent and growled. \u201cAmbrosia. Again. I know you. You\u2019re that bastard\u2019s invisible spy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good news,\u201d she replied. \u201cThat bastard is dead, and clearly I\u2019m no longer invisible.\u201d</p><p>All three blinked at her. Irish gave no reaction, but the other two laughed without humor.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to set you free,\u201d she said, and that shut them up fast. They stared over at her, suddenly serious. She hadn\u2019t done this earlier because she hadn\u2019t been sure it was the safest course of action. How would they react to her as queen? Try to kill her? But then she\u2019d decided, so what if they did? My powers are greater than theirs. \u201cIf you harm the Lords of the Underworld, your brothers by circumstance,\u201d she stressed, \u201cyou will regret it. They are mine, and I protect what\u2019s mine. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Stiff, disbelieving nods.</p><p>\u201cAsk around,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll discover that I can hurt you in ways that will haunt you for eternity.\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward, touched Winter\u2019s door. The shield fell away, and Winter gasped. A second later, the girl was gone. She repeated the process with the men, and they, too, left in a snap.</p><p>So easy, when only a few days ago, such a thing had been impossible. Go figure.</p><p>Sadly, she still was not done with her chores.</p><p>William was not in his room, but a human girl\u2014Gilly, she recalled\u2014was sleeping soundly in his bed, her dark hair spilled out over his pillow. The scent of sex was not in the air, but fear was, with an overlay of comfort. Gilly had come here, afraid for William, who had also been injured during the battle. He had soothed her until she\u2019d fallen asleep beside him, then he\u2019d left.</p><p>Now he was perched on the rooftop of the castle, popping gummy bears into his mouth and talking to another man in hushed tones. Hades. Instantly both males sensed she was there, as proven when they glanced in her direction.</p><p>\u201cHello, girl I helped time and time again,\u201d William said, his sly humor evidently intact despite his battle wounds.</p><p>\u201cHello, girl who owes me many favors,\u201d Hades added. Black mist enveloped him, veins of fire running through what appeared to be wings.</p><p>Maybe her new powers had improved her vision, because suddenly she could see things she hadn\u2019t noticed before. He had long jet-black hair, eyes of pure black, no pupils evident, and a face even more handsome than Paris\u2019s. Well, a face that other women might consider more handsome than Paris\u2019s. She didn\u2019t.</p><p>His muscles were huge, and there appeared to be tiny stars tattooed all over his chest.</p><p>I like him, Wrath said.</p><p>That kinda scares me, just so you know.</p><p>\u201cIf two equals many in your world, yeah,\u201d she replied dryly. \u201cHave you decided what you want me to do yet?\u201d What left her uneasy was the fact that he could ask for the world and she would have to give it to him, as long as it didn\u2019t harm Paris or his friends.</p><p>Hades shook his shadowed head, his grin serial-killer wicked. \u201cSoon,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said, and left them to their secret conversation. A blink, and she was up in the heavens, standing inside Zacharel\u2019s cloud.</p><p>It amazed her that the angels lived in the clouds, and those clouds were actually like homes. Furniture, hallways, gardens. Whatever the owner desired. Zacharel\u2019s had the requisite bed, but it had a man with pink hair and blood-inked tears chained to it. A blindfold was wrapped around his eyes, a gag stuffed in his mouth, and a sheet draped over his waist. The rest of him was naked.</p><p>Don\u2019t look. Not my business. On that nightstand was an hourglass-shaped jar with some kind of gooey substance in it. She did not want to think about what he did with the stuff.</p><p>\u201cZacharel,\u201d she called, gaze already returning to the pink-haired man. Her eyes narrowed. This was Paris\u2019s assailant from the cavern...and, she saw with her new and improved vision, he was no man at all, but a fallen angel. Since when were his kind held hostage in the very place they\u2019d chosen to escape from? She watched as he struggled for freedom.</p><p>Zacharel walked through the far doorway, and he was naked and wet, and oh, sweet Lord, he was gorgeous. Just...wow. A muscle mass to rival Paris\u2019s, and he must be smuggling tube socks in his stomach, because damn. He had muscled roll after muscled roll. Small brown nipples, and some serious man business, and no body hair.</p><p>Only flaw that he possessed was a black spot as big as her fist on his chest, just above his heart. The spot bled out in a few places, as if ink had been smudged. Wait. Nope. Not the only flaw. Whip marks seemed to wrap around his ribs, red and raw. And could she really call the snow still falling from his wings a sign of perfection?</p><p>He stopped when he spotted her. A second later, a white robe draped him. Also, his bed\u2014and its prisoner\u2014had vanished. \u201cI had a do-not-disturb barrier outside.\u201d His emotionless tone had returned. \u201cHow did you get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, sorry about that,\u201d she said. \u201cI just, uh, kind of willed myself here.\u201d</p><p>No chastisement. Just a tight \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to thank you.\u201d He was the reason Paris and company lived. \u201cYou gave me water from the River of Life. I didn\u2019t know what you had to do to obtain that water at the time, but I do now, and I\u2019m aware you had to make some sort of sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>Tidbits of information came to her at the oddest times now, and only this morning, she\u2019d realized angels had to give up something they loved to even approach the water. And to leave with a vial? They had to bleed. A lot. Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019d been whipped.</p><p>After the battle, as Paris\u2019s energy had drained right along with his blood, Zacharel had traded her a vial of the stuff for a simple promise to help the angels in the coming war. Apparently, the battle against Cronus was not the one he needed help winning.</p><p>\u201cI will do everything I can for you,\u201d she finished. There were limits to what she could do, of course. She couldn\u2019t bring her sister back, though she\u2019d tried. She couldn\u2019t find Kane. She couldn\u2019t heal others. Cronus had never been the all-powerful entity he\u2019d made himself out to be.</p><p>\u201cYou have much to learn about yourself,\u201d the angel said. \u201cYou will spend the next few weeks with us, and we will teach you what you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as Paris is up and around. He\u2019ll be coming with me,\u201d she said. And she prayed she was right, that he would want to.</p><p>\u201cHe shared his darkness with you, and you want him still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I am a light for him, a way out, and somehow his darkness is my light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough about this, I know. I want him with me, and that\u2019s that.\u201d She disappeared, having one more stop to make before she could return to Paris. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Galen\u2019s home.</p><p>He and Fox were seated at their kitchen table, piles of guns and ammo spilled out around them. They were polishing metal, checking clips, fitting bullets.</p><p>Wrath growled, but didn\u2019t say anything.</p> <p>Galen looked upset. Fox looked strung-out. Her nostrils flared, and she sniffed, hard, and then her head was whipping around. Her gaze landed on Sienna and she jumped to her feet, about to lurch in Sienna\u2019s direction, obviously craving another taste of her.</p><p>With a flick of her wrist, Sienna willed the female to the very table where Sienna herself had been snacked on, chaining her there.</p><p>Galen jolted to his feet, his chair skidding behind him. \u201cYou!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want my women back. Legion and Fox.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I want you to release Legion from her vow to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that.\u201d She glided over and eased into Fox\u2019s seat. He made no aggressive moves toward her, but then, he knew what she could do now.</p><p>Maybe she should have killed him for all the wrongs he\u2019d committed. But most of his Hunters were dead, decimated in the battle, so perhaps he\u2019d suffered enough. Also, she didn\u2019t want his demon loose, like Greed, who had belonged to Cronus, and Strife, who belonged to Rhea, the two now out there somewhere, no doubt plaguing the world.</p><p>\u201cAs you know, the Unspoken Ones were bound to Cronus. Now that he\u2019s dead, they are free. I tried to keep them chained, but by the time I realized who and what they are, that I, too, could bind them, they were long gone.\u201d Her gaze was piercing. \u201cThey want your blood, Galen. They want it bad. They\u2019ll be coming after you hard-core.\u201d And really, she was surprised they hadn\u2019t gotten to him already. \u201cDo you really want to put Legion in that kind of situation? That kind of danger?\u201d</p><p>A long moment passed. His answer would reveal his true feelings for the girl.</p> <p>His shoulders sagged. He sank back into his seat. \u201cNo. I do not.\u201d</p><p>He cared for her, Sienna realized. Truly cared for the girl.</p><p>\u201cI...release her,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cRelease Legion from her vow to remain with me, obey me.\u201d</p><p>Double wow, but she didn\u2019t comment. She didn\u2019t know what to say. So she moved them on to their next order of business. \u201cYou have something I want.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand. \u201cThe Cloak of Invisibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine. Mine.\u201d</p><p>How she wished she could make him give her the artifact, but free will was a greater power than what bubbled inside her. Whatever Cronus had told her, that\u2019s why he\u2019d worked so hard to convince her to do what he wanted. Immortal or not, king or not, you messed with free will, and you would be punished. Severely. She was pretty sure that\u2019s why she had ultimately defeated him. Because he\u2019d taken hers, he\u2019d lost his own in turn.</p> <p>\u201cWhat will it take to convince you to give me the Cloak?\u201d she asked. She\u2019d learned a thing or two about bargaining.</p><p>His eyes narrowed on her. \u201cProtection. You must protect me from the Unspoken Ones.\u201d</p><p>And wouldn\u2019t the Lords just love that? \u201cFor a year,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cEternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne year,\u201d she said, her own eyes narrowing.</p><p>He popped his jaw. \u201cVery well. Two years of protection. Maybe in that time, I\u2019ll kill you and take those kingly powers for myself. Protect myself.\u201d</p><p>By that time, she would have found Pandora\u2019s box, but she didn\u2019t tell him that. \u201cMake a play for me, Galen, and you\u2019ll find yourself in a special prison for immortals for the next two years.\u201d</p><p>He paled.</p><p>Yeah. He caught her drift. He\u2019d be rotting next to the Greeks he\u2019d once betrayed. \u201cGive me the Cloak.\u201d</p><p>His motions jerky, he pulled a small square of gray material from his pant pocket and tossed it at her. \u201cThere. Yours.\u201d</p><p>There was no time to bask in her victory.</p><p>\u201cSienna!\u201d</p><p>She heard Paris\u2019s bellow across the vast distance between them. Her cheeks flushed with pleasure as she stuffed the tiny, folded Cloak in her bodice. He was awake! \u201cGotta go,\u201d she said, and willed herself back inside her bedroom.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</p><p>PARIS WAS JUST ABOUT TO GO on a rampage when his woman appeared beside the bed. He caught his breath and fell back against the pillows. Her dark hair tumbled over one shoulder. She wore a gown threaded with gold and emerald, jewels sparkling in the material. Her hair was brushed to a luxurious mahogany shine. Those black wings arced over her shoulders.</p><p>She had never looked more beautiful.</p><p>He sighed with happiness as she threw herself on top of him. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re awake!\u201d</p><p>Her slight weight settled on him, her hair creating a curtain that made them the only two people in the world. He rejoiced. They belonged together.</p><p>\u201cIs it true you\u2019re now the boss of us?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou have such a way with words. But yeah, I am kind of the boss of you. Titans kept appearing out of nowhere to pay their respects, and I finally had to make a royal decree for space.\u201d</p><p>Queen Sienna. He liked it. \u201cI guess that makes me King Paris.\u201d</p><p>A tinkling laugh escaped her. \u201cI\u2019ve always known you were destined for greatness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to boss my boys around, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, so damn happy he could burst. \u201cI knew you\u2019d bring me back, baby. So, am I an undead soul?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head, a soft smile lighting her delicate features. \u201cNo, you\u2019re very much alive, and you still have your demon.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he could feel the bastard waking up, stretching, demanding Sienna, only Sienna. Sex wasn\u2019t after random grind anymore. The demon had embraced Sienna and all the different facets of her personality, and didn\u2019t want to lose her. She was their lottery ticket.</p><p>Maintaining his grip on her with one hand, he patted himself down with the other. No injuries. He was completely healed. \u201cWhat happened up there?\u201d</p><p>She kissed his cheek, his neck. \u201cAfter you passed out and I flipped my ever-loving lid, Zacharel calmed me down and told me about my new status and abilities. He also gave me a vial of water from the River of Life. For a price. I gave you and all the Lords a sip and you guys have been healing ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat price?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, all along the angels have wanted me in the heavens, helping them with their war. I told him that I was willing to help, but I wouldn\u2019t be living there. I will stay with you. If you\u2019ll have me. Except, we do have to stay up there for a few weeks so I can learn how to use my new powers. There\u2019s where I was just now. And I\u2019m rambling, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love when you ramble. But did you really just say the words if you\u2019ll have me?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help himself. He kissed her hard and fast, staking his claim. \u201cI will have you today and every other. And I will help you help the angels. And yes, I will go with you, wherever you need to go.\u201d</p><p>A relieved breath left her. \u201cI\u2019m glad. Oh, and just in case it comes up, the darkness inside of you is now inside of me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He sputtered, paled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, so sorry. I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it...husband.\u201d</p><p>Everything stilled inside him. His heart, his lungs, the synapses in his brain. \u201cYou know I married you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d A sly smile lifted her lips. \u201cI know a whole lot of stuff now. Like, world-changing stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorld-changing, smorld-changing. You\u2019re okay with being bound to me forever? Because I get the impression it\u2019s not a two-sided marriage until you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying so, and I\u2019m better than okay with it.\u201d</p><p>He so loved this woman. \u201cGood, because I feel the same. Wife.\u201d</p><p>Her smile quivered as if she were fighting tears. She told him about Arca, and rather than displaying his customary guilt and shame because of his past actions, he kissed her tenderly. She loved him, too, and she had forgiven him. She saw the best in him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all of my heart, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome. Now, back to the darkness,\u201d she said, probably trying for a business tone but failing. His woman was a softie, a Twinkie with a cream filling, and he loved that, too. \u201cWrath feeds on it, and that helps keep him calm. And you know what that means, right? We\u2019re perfect for each other in every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI so agree with that. We\u2019re a family, you and me, and I love you more than I can ever say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, because that\u2019s how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>He planted a quick kiss on her mouth. Anything more, and he\u2019d be all over her before he had all the information he needed. \u201cSo where are we right now?\u201d</p><p>A wicked glint in her eyes as she said, \u201cBack in the Realm of Blood and Shadows. All the Lords but Kane are here. Amun and Haidee found him, fought for him, but then they lost him again somehow. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m on the case now. I\u2019ll find him once and for all. And I\u2019m, uh, kind of a big deal.\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>\u201cNow, on to the next topic. I want to show you something,\u201d she said. Rolling to her side but remaining within his embrace, she swirled her hand in the air above them. Shimmers of light, a thickening of the particles, and then colors bloomed around a mist.</p><p>He saw Baden. Red hair, muscled body.</p><p>Joy and grief bloomed inside him.</p><p>He saw Pandora. Black hair, leanly honed body.</p><p>Guilt and shame.</p><p>He saw Cronus. Brown hair, muscled body.</p><p>Smugness.</p><p>He saw Rhea. Black hair, slender body.</p><p>Vindication.</p><p>Their mouths were moving, but he couldn\u2019t hear them. They stood between thick, white pillars in a temple.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dead,\u201d Sienna said, \u201cbut I live. So I can do what even Cronus could not when he had the throne. I can travel there. I can talk to them. And I think I can even get your Baden back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears suddenly burned his eyes. A puss once again, but whatever. This was a dream come true, all of it. \u201cI would love that. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes misted, and she cleared her throat. \u201cOkay, so do you want the good news or the bad news next?\u201d</p><p>There was more? His chest constricted. \u201cBad. Give me the bad, no matter what it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith Cronus dead, his enemies are now mine. I\u2019m not exactly sure who they are, so I\u2019m not exactly sure who to trust. Also, the Unspoken Ones are free, and I have to protect Galen from them.\u201d</p><p>He breathed out a gust of relief. He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d expected, but that wasn\u2019t it. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with the enemies as they come. As for Galen, we\u2019ll discuss it.\u201d</p><p>She planted another kiss on his neck. \u201cGreat, because that\u2019s the perfect transition into the good news.\u201d</p><p>He would never grow tired of her caress and angled his head so that she\u2019d kiss him again. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this is a two-parter. First, the Hunters have been all but obliterated. Second, Galen gave me the Cloak of Invisibility.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait, wait, wait. Back up. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are currently enemy-free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d Have any words, he realized. He experienced shock, then excitement, then disbelief, then shock again. He\u2019d been fighting the Hunters for so long. Thousands of years. To suddenly find out he would never have to battle another? Almost too much to take in.</p><p>When he found his voice, he managed to croak, \u201cWhy would Galen give you his only artifact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when Cronus and Rhea died, the Unspoken Ones were freed, as I told you. They are now after him. He gave me the Cloak and in return, I offered him my protection. He hated doing it, and I whittled him down to only two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have saved yourself the hassle. One, everyone here wants him dead no matter what, and two, with the Hunters out of the picture, we\u2019re good without the Cloak. We won\u2019t need to use it to sneak into enemy territory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she said, chin going in the air.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry. I\u2019m grateful, I swear. That came out wrong. I just hate the fact that you were around him, and now you have to protect him.\u201d Which meant Paris had to protect him, too.</p><p>She softened. \u201cYou still need the Cloak. You can\u2019t be sure no one else will rise up against you, and it\u2019s better for you to have every weapon at your disposal, rather than someone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a smart girl.\u201d</p><p>Our girl.</p><p>Definitely.</p><p>\u201cBesides, we can now search for the box,\u201d she said, beaming.</p><p>All four artifacts, he mused, awed by this woman of his. She was right. They needed the artifacts, not only to keep them out of enemy hands but to find Pandora\u2019s box and destroy it before anyone could use it against them. The goal they had been working toward so single-mindedly and for so long was nearer than ever to being met. \u201cLet\u2019s not go searching for the box just yet,\u201d he said, tugging at her clothing.</p> <p>\u201cSuch a smart boy.\u201d She met his waiting mouth with her own, licking and kissing and sucking on him. \u201cWe\u2019ll search later. Much later.\u201d</p><p>Yes! I\u2019m on board!</p><p>IN A CORNER OF SIENNA\u2019S MIND, a man\u2019s thoughts bubbled up. What\u2019s up with this crap? Here comes another apology I have to make.</p><p>Strider\u2019s voice, she realized. He was walking toward their bedroom, even then.</p><p>I tried to talk Paris into booting his girl, just like I tried to talk Amun into booting his, and both of them suffered for it. Not to mention how their women must have felt. So that\u2019s it for me. I\u2019m done. No more getting involved with my boys and their women. But then, the only single ones left are Kane and Torin, but Torin is a recluse so he doesn\u2019t count. And if ever Cameo brings home a guy, well, all bets are off. Guy will have to prove himself worthy, no matter what. And damn, I\u2019m almost there. Kaia better thank me properly for this, since she\u2019s the one who insisted I do it. I hate apologizing, and Paris is the vengeful type. He\u2019ll make me get on my knees and beg, I know it. This is gonna be embarrassing. And painful!</p><p>Knock. Knock.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Paris shouted, hands clenching on Sienna\u2019s ass.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you, man,\u201d Strider replied, voice muffled through the doorway. \u201cAlso to Her Highness, who I assume is in there with you. I don\u2019t really have to call her Your Highness, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. But talk later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow. So, uh, yeah. I\u2019m sorry. See ya.\u201d Yep, hurt just as bad as I thought it would, Strider thought.</p><p>His footsteps faded away.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Paris asked.</p><p>Sienna\u2019s own thoughts filled her head. I will not laugh. \u201cMe. He was saying sorry for the way he messed with you about me. Apologizing to both of us, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby,\u201d Paris said.</p><p>Her lips stretched into another grin. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>When they were both naked, he sank inside her. He was home, finally home. And he was at peace. His woman was with him, and she wasn\u2019t leaving him. They were going to be together.</p><p>Whatever else came, whatever else happened, they would be together, just as he\u2019d wanted since the beginning.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>ONCE AGAIN ZACHAREL found himself high in the heavens, Lysander beside him, the pair of them peering down at a very content Paris and Sienna.</p><p>I gained her cooperation,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not the way you wished. Paris will be joining her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not the travesty I had feared it would be,\u201d Lysander replied. \u201cWhen dealing with people and their emotions, allowances must always be made. I sometimes forget.\u201d</p><p>Emotions. A waste of energy in Zacharel\u2019s estimation. You lived, you warred and one day you died. Anything else was unnecessary.</p><p>Lysander continued, \u201cI am surprised they complement each other so well, even more surprised they actually aid each other both emotionally and physically. I never would have guessed.\u201d</p><p>Nor he. Paris should have dragged Sienna down. She should not have had the determination and strength to pull him up. \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, I will begin Sienna\u2019s training, and take responsibility for Paris. And you, in turn, will heed the Deity\u2019s newest order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d The Deity\u2019s newest order\u2014or rather, sentence\u2014had come only this morning. Zacharel had been summoned to the Deity\u2019s temple, where a second punishment for his prior sins had been heaped upon his head, as if the eternal snowfall wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cYou must admit you have the easier task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I do not envy you, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel was to lead his own army of warriors. Warriors just like himself, only far worse. Men who had defied the rules one too many times. Men who would\u2014supposedly\u2014teach him the value of following heavenly laws.</p><p>They were like no other angels he\u2019d ever dealt with. Some took lovers. Some cussed and drank. Some were tattooed and pierced, and as dark in spirit as many humans.</p><p>If he trained them well, the Deity had proclaimed, the snow would cease to fall from his wings, and he would be allowed to remain in the heavens himself. If he failed, if they failed, they would all fall together, forever banned from the only home they\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Whatever it took, Zacharel must remain in the heavens. His greatest treasure was here, and he would rather die than be parted from it. He did not consider his attachment emotional, but rather, essential to his survival.</p><p>You might not survive even if you remain up here, he thought, rubbing the dark spot growing on his chest.</p><p>\u201cIf ever you need me,\u201d Lysander said, pulling him from his musings, \u201cyou have only to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I feel the same. If ever you need me...\u201d I might not be around to help. At that moment, the Deity\u2019s parting words echoed in his mind. Your life will soon change in ways you cannot even imagine. I hope you are prepared.</p><p>Was he? He and his men would find out together, he supposed. </p> </body></html>"]
