Okay, that\u2019s a lie. I hear dead people\u2014on an antique radio of all things. I know, right? But I didn\u2019t make the rules. If I had, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be working at Pretzel Pirate. The uniform is unrelenting polyester, and I can\u2019t pull off white lace or a swashbuckler hat. I\u2019m into striped tights, combat boots, cosmetics, piercings, and tattoos.</p><p>I\u2019ve also got an amnesia thing going on. Don\u2019t ask me to explain it, but my head\u2019s foggy. I used to live in Kilmer, Georgia, and for reasons I can\u2019t recall\u2014I\u2019m sure it seemed like a good idea at the time\u2014I split with a cop from Texas...and some other guy. I haven\u2019t seen the second dude for a while, but the cop brought me to Laredo. It was weird in Kilmer, and my mom\u2019s...gone. I should be sad about that, but that part of my life is misty. Which makes me wonder if I used to do hardcore drugs. It would explain a lot, huh? I should be grateful it was a cop who pulled me out of that death spiral and not some perv who\u2019d chain me up in his basement.</p><p>So I\u2019m in Laredo now. The cop who saved me\u2014and I\u2019m sure whatever he hauled me out of in Kilmer, it was ugly\u2014then deposited me with some family friends. They\u2019re a married couple, nice enough, but I felt like I was cramping their style. They just had a baby, and I\u2019m not au pair material. To make matters worse, their house burned down, and we were all out of luck for a while.</p> <p>They went to stay with relatives, and I didn\u2019t feel right about going along. So this guy, Chuch, found me a roommate, his cousin, Maria. She\u2019s a nice girl, but not home a lot. We both work, and I\u2019m trying to get into community college. Things being what they were in Kilmer, I got my GED here.</p><p>So anyway, it\u2019s five thirty p.m. on a Thursday, and I\u2019m stuck at Pretzel Pirate. The food court is hell. Each afternoon, I stare across at the same dorky kid selling burgers. Sometimes he makes a pirate hat out of a paper placemat and puts it on to mock me. I give him my middle finger as a special prize. Good times. This job pays minimum wage; it also siphons off a portion of my soul each time I say, \u201cArrr, matey, want to try a Buccaneer special pretzel with extra cheese?\u201d FML.</p><p>Unlike charlatans who use a crystal ball, I can tune into dead people on my radio\u2014and not random ones, either\u2014so considering that I\u2019ve learned to control the ability, I should be raking in the cash. But due to snafus like the Salem Witch Trials, the Gifted community frowns on us using our talents in the open, so any medium listed in the Yellow Pages is a fake. I wish I could figure out a way around this restriction, but for now, I\u2019m working at the mall to make ends meet.</p><p>The only bright side is that I\u2019m sober, apparently, and the guy who rescued me cares enough to check in on a regular basis. At least, I think that\u2019s why he\u2019s coming toward me. Here\u2019s something I didn\u2019t mention. The cop\u2019s smoking hot. Jesse Saldana, that\u2019s his name. I\u2019ve never written it all over my notebooks or drawn hearts around it, but sometimes I do whisper Jesse in a certain way.</p><p>I have zero shot, but since the moment I saw him, I\u2019ve been on fire. He\u2019s got tawny hair and dark eyes, a hint of Mexican heritage in his tan skin. Plus, with a day or two of golden scruff, he always looks like he could use a shave. I see him and I just want to take a bite; he\u2019s the ultimate forbidden fruit. I\u2019m not sure exactly how old he is, but I\u2019m guessing twenty-eight or twenty-nine.</p> <p>Did I mention I\u2019m not quite nineteen?</p><p>Ten years might not seem like such a big difference down the road, but right now, it\u2019s insurmountable. Because he sees me as a project\u2014I\u2019m the girl he\u2019s saving. And unless you\u2019re crazy, you don\u2019t kiss the crap out of damsels in distress. Christ, I hate that label. I wish I could prove that I\u2019m not an at-risk youth, but I have no idea how to make it happen.</p><p>He cuts through the tables, making a beeline for Pretzel Pirate. Let me point out, there are way better places to eat. If he\u2019s after actual food, the court has sushi, sandwiches, pasta, pizza, and burgers. Some of it even tastes decent.</p><p>God, Jesse Saldana\u2019s smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, as he reaches the counter.</p><p>\u201cArr,\u201d I answer. \u201cPrepare to be boarded.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, God, why? I have no idea why I said that. It\u2019s not even an official Pretzel Pirate greeting. Mark, my manager, would vehemently disapprove. He\u2019s all about corporate policy and reminds me of that movie where Jennifer Aniston works at a terrible restaurant and they give her shit for not wearing enough buttons.</p><p>Fortunately, Jesse laughs. He\u2019s got a great smile, white teeth\u2014and dimples. How am I supposed to cope? Dimples. It\u2019s absurd.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the pretzel business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s horrible. I have no dignity. On the plus side, I\u2019ll be able to make rent.\u201d When his brow furrows, I realize I\u2019ve reinforced his impression of me as vulnerable, someone who needs looking after.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever need anything, Shan, let me know. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been sentenced to community service? What\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. Can I get a lemonade and an order of toasted pretzel bites?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me this isn\u2019t your dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Now he looks defensive. \u201cIt\u2019s food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDebatable.\u201d But Mark would not be amused to hear me talking this way about our fine products.</p><p>Glumly, I put together Jesse\u2019s order, mentally counting the seconds before he walks away. \u201cSo what\u2019re you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you believe I was craving pretzel bites?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even on my dumbest day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCar charger for my phone.\u201d He lifts a small plastic bag. \u201cI\u2019m always forgetting to plug it in at night.\u201d</p><p>Take me home with you. I\u2019ll remind you. Oh, God. Why does he have to be so...day-um? And so oblivious to the fact that I\u2019m female. He treats me like a little sister, maybe one he adopted through a charitable organization. I suppose I\u2019m lucky he doesn\u2019t offer to take me out for ice cream or to play skeeball once a week.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s hard to save the day when people can\u2019t reach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I detect sarcasm, Shannon Cheney?\u201d Jesse props himself on the counter, giving me a look that melts my knees.</p><p>\u201cOnly always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too young to be this cynical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re too old to be this hot.\u201d Shit. I said it out loud.</p><p>To my relief, he laughs. \u201cThanks. That made my day.\u201d</p><p>Wow. So I\u2019m the waitress who flatters him despite being undateable. If he ruffles my hair, I\u2019ll bite his hand. No joke, I will draw blood. When he gets a tetanus shot, he can think of me. I shove the pretzel bites at him, set the lemonade on the counter, and mumble the total. He pays in exact change, and I pretend it\u2019s because he\u2019s trying to make my life easier.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here\u2014to provide excellent customer service. And pretzels.\u201d</p><p>And to want things I can\u2019t have. As he waves and turns, I can\u2019t help checking out his lean, muscled back and the fit of his jeans. I\u2019ve done my share of screwing around, but I could ride this cowboy until the break of dawn. I\u2019m actually chagrined by the rush of heat that accompanies the thought. And then the unthinkable happens. Jesse Saldana whirls to face me.</p><p>See, this is the other thing I haven\u2019t mentioned. Jesse Saldana isn\u2019t simply a smoking-hot cop. He\u2019s also an empath. Dunno if he\u2019s been trying not to read me, or if I\u2019ve done a good job keeping it locked down until now. Color touches his cheeks, and he hesitates, like he\u2019s not sure if he should acknowledge what he just felt.</p><p>I raise a brow at him, the one with the piercing. \u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d</p><p>It seems best to brazen it out; I refuse to pretend I don\u2019t feel as I do. He can think it\u2019s ill-advised or that I\u2019m too young, or a bad bet in other ways. God knows that\u2019s all true. But it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want him, more than anything.</p><p>\u201cSeems like there\u2019s something on yours.\u201d He summons a gentle, let her down easy smile. \u201cWhile I\u2019m flattered, I\u2019m not the one for you, Shan.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cToo bad. You\u2019re missing out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jesse sounds like he means that.</p><p>My ego poofs a little.</p><p>This isn\u2019t easy when you\u2019re wearing the polyester Pretzel Pirate uniform. But he\u2019s seen me in my street clothes; he knows I can rock a look. I\u2019m the kind of girl who scares males my own age and attracts those old enough to know better. Apparently Jesse thinks he falls into the latter category, but I don\u2019t see it that way. A guy needs to be on the wrong side of forty-five for me to dub him a creeper for wanting to date me. To put it another way, my dad\u2019s forty-two. I\u2019m never going out with anyone older than my father; that\u2019s the rule.</p><p>Because I\u2019m curious\u2014and there will never be a better time to find out\u2014I ask, \u201cIs this the first time you\u2019ve noticed how I feel?\u201d</p><p>Jesse shakes his head. \u201cOnly the most potent flash. I knew you were nursing a crush, but I figured you\u2019d get over it without me needing to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this where you warn me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be wrong to take advantage while you\u2019re feeling grateful. I extracted you from a bad situation and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you visit me, I could take it for encouragement,\u201d I interrupt, unable to listen to more bullshit about my alleged emotions. \u201cYou\u2019ve found reasons to stop by three times in the last week. And the mall\u2019s nowhere near the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking out for you,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>\u201cThen stop. I can take it from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you cutting me off?\u201d He tries to say it lightly, but I can tell that this feels like a breakup to him, too. A weird one, certainly, but there\u2019s a bond between us, one I can\u2019t explain and didn\u2019t ask for.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>I\u2019m never gonna smother these feelings as long as he\u2019s coming round, fanning the flames. Though I played the role once, I refuse to be Jesse Saldana\u2019s permanent damsel in distress, always yelling for help from a tower. I can make a rope out of bedsheets and climb down my own damn self. So he can take his white-knight complex and go tilt at somebody else\u2019s windmill.</p><p>\u201cShan... I just want...\u201d In the end, he trails off, unable to express whatever it is. \u201cLook, can\u2019t we be friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when I want to kiss you so bad that it\u2019s all I think about.\u201d There\u2019s no point in playing coy. He knows.</p><p>For a few seconds, his gaze locks on mine, and there\u2019s a swirl of superheated awareness in his eyes. Holy shit. He feels it too. I have no idea if it\u2019s an echo of what I\u2019m offering, or if he\u2019s been suppressing this because he feels like a dirty old man. Before, I didn\u2019t chase him because I thought he saw me as a kid. But if he can look at me, right here, right now, and find anything desirable? Then he wants me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I just have to decide what I\u2019m going to do about it.</p><p>Two</p><p>Jesse\u2019s the first to look away. \u201cThere\u2019re so many reasons why we shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we only need one why we should.\u201d I\u2019m smiling now, confident that I know where this is going.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we want to. Pick me up tomorrow night at eight. You know where I live.\u201d He helped me move in, after all.</p><p>\u201cWe can have dinner,\u201d he decides. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a date.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, like a label\u2019s gonna stop me. I merely smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve got my number, right?\u201d</p><p>In answer, he taps out a quick hey and my phone pings. I shouldn\u2019t find this so endearing. \u201cSee you tomorrow, cowboy.\u201d</p> <p>After he leaves, the rest of my shift is...bearable. I shut the place down at nine, and by fifteen past, everything is sparkling clean. I take the bus home, wishing I had a car. Maria\u2019s out with her boyfriend, no surprise there, so I strip off the Pretzel Pirate get-up and take a shower. It\u2019s not even ten thirty, and I\u2019m bored as hell. I have the sense that I used to have somebody to hang out with\u2014but maybe I left her in Kilmer. My head hurts when I poke at this half-formed memory, so I switch on the TV and numb my brain.</p><p>While some stupid show plays, I waver, tempted by an unwise idea. I\u2019ve thought about doing this before, but I always decided against it. For obvious reasons, I can\u2019t raise the dead when Maria\u2019s around. Since she\u2019s an Ortiz, I\u2019m sure she knows about the Gifted population, but it seems best not to rub her nose in the fact that I can talk to dead people. Before I can think better of this, I head into my small bedroom. It didn\u2019t come furnished, so right now there\u2019s a futon in it, and I\u2019m storing my personal stuff in the closet and in milk crates I stole from behind a convenience store.</p><p>Pulling the antique radio out of my closet, I sit cross-legged on the floor for a few seconds, holding it. Nobody else can feel this\u2014I\u2019ve tested it\u2014but to me, this old gizmo radiates cold energy that tingles in my fingertips. There\u2019s not much left from my Kilmer days since I bolted in a hurry, but I do have an old ring that belonged to my mother. Actually, I stole it from her jewelry box before she died. I used to be kind of a klepto, though I control the impulse these days. They\u2019re serious about loss prevention at the mall, and I\u2019d look horrible in an orange jumpsuit.</p><p>I dig it out of the small, satin-lined box that houses my jewelry. I don\u2019t have much, and I wear most of my bracelets at the same time; I\u2019ve grown accustomed to the weight and jingle on my wrists. If I ever went into the sun, I\u2019d probably have tan lines from my bracelets. But I\u2019ve been cultivating this pallor for years, mostly to irritate my mother. Now, however, the results are permanent. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d burst into flames if I tried to tan.</p><p>Clutching the ring in my left hand, I focus on recalling how my mother looked and sounded, before the mental fog set in and my memory got weird. I just simply can\u2019t recollect certain things anymore. My exodus from Kilmer is wreathed in shadows, which makes me think it must be bad. Either someone doesn\u2019t want me to remember, or I\u2019ve forced myself to forget. And you don\u2019t usually block out the happy times.</p><p>Nervous, I fiddle with the dials of the radio as I whisper, \u201cRestless dead, blood of my blood, I summon you to this place.\u201d</p> <p>The room immediately chills, raising goose bumps on my arms. Hissing static crackles from old speakers as I scan various stations by adjusting the dials. I\u2019m into the AM side, down on the low end, when the white noise resolves into intelligible words, spoken in a familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have called me, Shannon.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s my mom all right. She finds reason to bitch at me even from beyond the grave. \u201cWhy not? I have questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of them, I\u2019m not permitted to answer.\u201d The display glows when she speaks, something I\u2019ve never seen. This analog device doesn\u2019t have a backlight.</p><p>The cold intensifies, so I can actually see my breath. \u201cNot about the afterlife. I\u2019m wondering what happened in Kilmer. I can\u2019t remember how I ended up in Laredo or why Jesse Saldana was there in the first place.\u201d</p><p>I mean, he\u2019s from Texas for fuck\u2019s sake, and it\u2019s not like a creepy, haunted little town in Georgia is a tourist hot spot. When I ask him, Jesse smiles and says in his super-hot drawl, \u201cChalk it up to fate, sugar. I was destined to save you.\u201d</p><p>Which is sweet, but it\u2019s also bullshit. I want\u2014I need\u2014answers, but when I push too hard, it feels like my brain is about to pop out of my skull. Most people would heed that warning, I guess, but you can tell by looking at me that I\u2019m not normal. That\u2019s partly what my style\u2019s about, honestly. It seems wrong to go around in jeans and hoodies. Then a guy who asks me out might expect an average girl, not one who talks to dead people. This way, I feel like he\u2019s been forewarned, and if he still wants to date me, he shouldn\u2019t be surprised that there\u2019s a spooky surprise in this box. I mean, the package was wrapped appropriately, after all.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason you can\u2019t remember,\u201d my mom tells me.</p> <p>Well, duh. Sadly, this is the most civil exchange I\u2019ve had with her in years. Most of our discussions ended with me screaming you don\u2019t understand anything and slamming into my room. In life, my mother was a pearl-clutching Southern belle, and I suspect she used to prowl our house, searching for proof that I\u2019m a changeling. So in that respect, death eased the tension between us\u2014yep, oblivion\u2019s the ultimate icebreaker.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you could clue me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pain you experience when you try to remember is a clue, Shannon. You can\u2019t circumvent a spell before its time through sheer willpower or mental force. There could be...repercussions.\u201d</p><p>A spell? So somebody made me forget? What the hell. There are so many questions I should ask, but my energy is limited. The power to communicate with her is pulled directly from me in the form of life energy, and I suspect if I stretch my reserves too far, it might be lethal. Tonight\u2019s not the time to find out.</p><p>So I settle on asking, \u201cDo you know who did this to me? Or why?\u201d</p><p>But the radio crackles, and I feel woozy. My mom\u2019s gone. I desperately need a sugar rush or I\u2019ll pass out. On hands and knees, I crawl over to the crate I keep stuffed full of chocolate. I\u2019m pretty sure Maria thinks I\u2019m bulimic. With trembling hands, I tear open a candy bar and cram it in my face. In a few minutes, I feel better. The black spots are gone, and my hands aren\u2019t shaking anymore. Five years down the road, I\u2019ll have rotten teeth and probably diabetes as well. They don\u2019t warn you about this shit when you first start talking to dead people.</p><p>I try to picture what it\u2019s like on the other side; I\u2019ve never queried a spirit on how it feels when I summon them. Is it a painful tug or more of a warm, delicious rush? I highly suspect I\u2019m feeding them. Ew. I close my eyes for a few seconds, then turn off my radio, killing the chaotic snake hiss.</p><p>The conversation with my mother told me enough to get started. If it\u2019s a spell, it can be broken, right? Magick wears off on its own, unless it\u2019s powered by some natural source, a ley line for instance. But I\u2019m not attached to anything like that. Time will probably dissipate it, but I need to recover the missing pieces of my life; the hole\u2019s bothering me, as if I\u2019ve forgotten something super important.</p><p>The room is still freezing when Maria comes home a little later. She pops her head in and shivers. \u201cDid you leave the window open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust closed it.\u201d The lie seems better than an actual explanation.</p><p>\u201cFresh air is good if it doesn\u2019t kill you,\u201d she says dubiously.</p><p>She\u2019s a nice girl, two years older than me, but sometimes I feel ancient by comparison. So far as I can tell, despite having an oddball family, she\u2019s totally normal. Maria works at a jewelry store and goes to night school, learning to do hair. Which is cool and she\u2019s good at it. She\u2019s already volunteered to help me freshen up the blue streaks in mine; I have to do that often or the vivid color dies away to a sickly mermaid seafoam. She looks somewhat like Chuch, Jesse\u2019s family friend, but not enough to be alarming in a girl. I just mean she has dark hair and eyes, plus a stocky build.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much the way I feel.\u201d</p><p>We make a little more awkward small talk because we\u2019re roomies, not friends. She tells me about her date and the movie she saw. I joke about the kid who makes paper pirate hats in the food court. She seems to think this suffices for polite interaction and says something about a shower. I\u2019m relieved, as I don\u2019t know anything about dealing with regular people. I\u2019m like one of those kids from Hogwarts, dodging through the train station and muttering, \u201cMuggles.\u201d</p><p>Once Maria leaves, I shut my bedroom door. I\u2019ll scrub off my makeup later, after she goes to bed, like I always do. This is a quirk, but I don\u2019t enjoy people seeing me without it. It\u2019s armor in a way. For me to let someone see my skin? It\u2019s major. Like, I\u2019ve slept with guys who never did\u2014and it\u2019s probably why we broke up, too.</p><p>I pop my laptop, planning to watch some TV on the \u2018net, but my mail client dings. No lie, my heart skips a beat when I see the name. Jesse Saldana. I got a couple of emails from him while we were moving me into this apartment, and he insisted on helping. But since then, there have just been his casual visits to the mall.</p><p>Which are definitely increasing in frequency.</p><p>Opening the message, I read:</p><p>Hey, Shan.</p><p>I\u2019ve been thinking about you since I got home, and I just want to make sure we\u2019re okay. It was a little awkward before I left. Or did I imagine it? I\u2019m trying really hard not to be a jackass here.</p><p>Jesse</p><p>I skim the words twice. Most of it, I don\u2019t care about, but for obvious reasons, I fixate on I\u2019ve been thinking about you. Since I wake up with Jesse Saldana on my mind, I spend the workday daydreaming about him while making pretzels and pouring drinks for people, and then I come home to obsess about him some more, this seems like the least the universe can do to level the field. I hate the word crush, but it so totally applies here. And I don\u2019t want to be that girl; I kind of hate myself for it, actually.</p><p>So I decide to make him sweat. Deliberately, I close the program and find some free TV online; there are sites that let you watch if you\u2019re willing to put up with their stupid ads. It\u2019s on my to-do list to get a monthly subscription to Netflix, but you need a credit card for that, and I\u2019m not exactly flush with cash. So I watch this sitcom until I\u2019m tired enough to sleep, and it makes me happy to imagine Jesse wondering why I haven\u2019t replied.</p><p>In this single matter, I agree with my mother.</p><p>It\u2019s best to leave a man hungry.</p><p>Three</p><p>I\u2019m looking hot tonight. Maybe it\u2019s immodest to say so, but I know what suits me and I\u2019m good with hair and makeup. I suspect Jesse\u2019s never dated a girl who looks like me, though. I could be wrong. Maybe he\u2019s all about bad girls deep down...and if so, he\u2019s knocking on the right door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before answering, I count to ten, then answer his hesitant tap, relishing his stunned expression when he takes in my platform boots, striped tights, short leather skirt and black corset top. His gaze doesn\u2019t reach my face for a full ten seconds, and then he jerks his eyes upward, looking so guilty that I could shove him against the wall and take a bite. He cherishes a mistaken image of me as a helpless flower, and I want to scratch it off like a one-dollar lottery ticket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d I say, smiling.</p><p>He looks like he\u2019s torn between a compliment and telling me to go put on some pants. Instead, he only nods and ushers me downstairs, where his green Forester is parked. I notice his ride has seen better days and is in the process of being repaired, a little at a time.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p> <p>He frowns, seeming not to want to talk about it. \u201cI... Car chase. Any thoughts on where you\u2019d like to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that your job?\u201d I ask, teasing him. \u201cTo read my mood and figure it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell if you want tacos or Chinese, just based on\u2014\u201d The words cut off as he registers what I really want. And he stumbles from the intensity.</p><p>Here\u2019s a hint\u2014it\u2019s not food. I can\u2019t tell you what it is about him; I\u2019ve known hotter guys and I didn\u2019t spend my time thinking about them naked. I cop to being obsessed, Officer. You should definitely cuff me now. Part of me wonders if this attraction springs from the spell my mother mentioned. Maybe the magick tampered with my memory and made me crazy for Jesse Saldana. If so, it\u2019ll be awkward when the mojo wears off. But I still wouldn\u2019t regret any bedroom action between us because he moves like he knows how to show a lady a good time.</p><p>Jesse opens the door for me, the consummate gentleman, and I flash him some thigh as I climb into his SUV. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>He narrows his eyes, dark and shadowed beneath the streetlights. \u201cI care about you, Shan, but you shouldn\u2019t push me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad, because that\u2019s exactly what I plan to do,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>Circling around the truck, he doesn\u2019t catch that, and it\u2019s just as well. After thinking aloud, he decides to take me to a dive his folks like. It\u2019s apparently a family place, noisy and crowded, one of those tiny neighborhood joints that you\u2019d be afraid to try if you didn\u2019t already know the food was delicious. I can surmise why he\u2019s chosen such a venue; I\u2019m supposed to be a good girl if there are children running around and not allude to the fact that I want to end the night on top of him.</p><p>We\u2019ll see.</p><p>He tells me about his day as he drives. Apparently it\u2019s not always thrilling to be a cop, and I hear about the extensive interviewing he did. His partner died a while back, and they just assigned him a new one. Her name is Stella, and Jesse likes her. He\u2019s also grateful that she\u2019s ten years older than he is and happily married. This carries us all the way to the small, adobe restaurant with hand-painted lettering on the front that reads TITO\u2019S. There are lots of cars parked on the street too, always a good sign.</p><p>Deliberately, I sit in the car until he comes around and opens my door. He may not want to think of this as a date, but it definitely qualifies in my mind. I hop down and take two steps toward Tito\u2019s. People are sitting out front, eating tacos from Styrofoam trays. Rising up on tiptoes, I can see there are no tables open indoors, but there are picnic tables out here. This is the opposite of romantic, exactly what he was going for.</p> <p>\u201cIt smells great,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He was expecting me to object, but they\u2019ve got proper pork roasting on a spit behind the counter, which means these tacos will taste right. There\u2019s nothing like tacos al pastor, loaded up with cilantro, green sauce, chopped onion, and fresh pineapple. I pull up short, frowning. Why do I know that? For a few seconds, there was a voice in my head, making me think I\u2019m an expert on Mexican food.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever been to Mexico?\u201d I ask Jesse.</p><p>It\u2019s a stupid question...because how the hell would he know? He\u2019s frowning, though, and he puts a hand to his head, like thinking about it hurts.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he finally offers.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hungry, I think. I skipped lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go get some food. I\u2019ll grab a table.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight away.\u201d He pretends to be irked that I\u2019m coming across bossy, but I see the smile playing at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>You can\u2019t fool me, Jesse Saldana. You think I\u2019m pretty.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long for him to come back with drinks in paper cups and two trays piled with tacos of varying types. But they\u2019re all made right, none of that crunchy shell nonsense, stuffed full of ground beef. Damn. I have no idea where this attitude came from, but I\u2019m apparently awash in scorn for Mexican fast food.</p><p>\u201cThis is great,\u201d I say, digging in.</p><p>\u201cMost women don\u2019t like it. No ambiance.\u201d He stills, seeming to realize what he\u2019s implying there.</p><p>Too late. You said it. You can\u2019t unsay it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly the poster girl for normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal\u2019s overrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saying you like what I\u2019ve got to offer?\u201d I smile at him, holding his gaze for several heartbeats.</p><p>\u201cShannon, stop.\u201d</p><p>I widen my eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlirting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlirting never hurt anyone. You\u2019re a big, strong man. You can take it.\u201d</p><p>He swallows. \u201cSeriously. Quit trying to make me want things I can\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I\u2019m pretty sure you can.\u201d I make a show of checking my phone for prior engagements. \u201cYep. I can pencil you in. But it\u2019d be better if we go to your place. Maria might eavesdrop on our moaning and banging around. Do you break things during sex? I always wanted to knock over a lamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo corrige me, all night long. I\u2019m positive I could be reformed by hands-on attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat your dinner,\u201d he says in a suffocated voice.</p><p>\u201cWill I get candy after? Just so you know, I\u2019m not getting in your panel van.\u201d</p><p>He swears softly. \u201cI\u2019d think you were screwing with me, if not for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way I feel to you?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I swear, you could scoop up the atmosphere with a spoon. He\u2019s still, but I notice him breathing faster. This is dirty pool, but I\u2019m not trying to suppress how much I want him. I spackle it with levity, but this longing is a tidal wave. I can\u2019t get enough oxygen. There are people all around us, but I have the crazy feeling we\u2019re inside a bubble; the world recedes like a hitchhiker in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d I tell him. \u201cOr pretend. It\u2019s up to you how to respond.\u201d</p><p>He clenches a hand on the table, apparently on edge. Then his voice drops deep and low, so I lean in to catch it. \u201cI don\u2019t break things. I go gentle and slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I want you to be wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not a bad boy, right? I\u2019m the one mothers love to meet and their daughters love to fuck over.\u201d Jesse sounds slightly bitter.</p><p>For a few seconds, I consider sending the dead to traumatize Jesse\u2019s exes. Then I choose sanity instead. But I can\u2019t decide if his penchant for crazy girls makes his refusal to explore the chemistry between us better or worse. Does his reluctance mean I\u2019m too batshit to date him or not nutty enough?</p><p>\u201cBeing a sweet guy doesn\u2019t mean you have to repress your desires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I am?\u201d He scowls at me, devouring half a taco in one angry bite.</p><p>\u201cEvery guy has fantasies he\u2019s afraid to share. And if you\u2019re slow and gentle all the time, it\u2019s because you\u2019re trying to make a woman feel loved. But what men don\u2019t understand is\u2014sometimes we just want to be fucked. We need a sexy beast, not Prince Charming.\u201d I watch his reaction to that, then add, \u201cIf you\u2019re doing well, you make us feel cherished out of bed, and then we have rough, dirty sex.\u201d</p><p>He groans, scrubbing a palm across his face. \u201cI\u2019m starting to suspect you\u2019re a demon, a Luren, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook it up,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>Smart ass. I\u2019ll be on Area 51, searching that word, right after I get home. Unfortunately, I\u2019m pretty sure Jesse means to drop me off untouched. But he looks pained now; I hope it\u2019s because his pants are too tight. Unfortunately, the picnic table doesn\u2019t offer a subtle way to check.</p><p>\u201cYou know what your problem is?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you plan to tell me.\u201d</p><p>I beam. \u201cYou so get me. Here\u2019s what I see, cowboy. You put women on a pedestal. You worry about looking after them. Then they get sick of being handled with kid gloves and they bail on you.\u201d</p><p>Jesse seems honestly astonished. \u201cDid Eva tell you to say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t seen her since I moved, though I get the occasional email.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you possibly know that? We haven\u2019t been friends that long.\u201d But I hear the doubt in his voice. He\u2019s not sure when we met, either.</p><p>\u201cSomeone roofied us,\u201d I say. \u201cMagical roofies. It\u2019s the only explanation.\u201d</p><p>But this seems like a good time to elaborate on what my mom told me, so I do. Maybe Jesse will have some idea who might\u2019ve wanted us to forget. I have an awful suspicion that I did something horrible, and this was done to protect me. I imagine setting my ghosts on a human being and shiver, staring at my fingers.</p><p>Are these the hands of a killer?</p><p>I\u2019d get away with it, too. If the dead suck all the energy out of a person, they fall down and don\u2019t get up. It would look like a heart attack. At length, I fall silent, waiting for his response.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d He\u2019s got his cop face on now, simultaneously alert and alarmed. \u201cYour mother\u2019s reliable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in life, but maybe death has improved her.\u201d I suck it up and ask the hardest question ever. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a good person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answers without hesitation. \u201cYou dress dark, but you feel like sunshine to me, Shan. Pure light.\u201d</p><p>Nobody\u2019s ever said that to me before. I\u2019m sure, no matter what else I\u2019ve forgotten. I\u2019d remember if a man had ever made me feel like the witch Dorothy threw water on, melting from head to toe. Naturally, I can\u2019t let a moment so touching pass unremarked.</p><p>\u201cI would bang you like a gong,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too young to talk like that,\u201d he snaps.</p><p>\u201cI just did, so clearly that proves your hypothesis false. I suppose if you added a Mormon control group, you might find that some females my age don\u2019t communicate in such a way, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to understand why men kiss women to shut them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel free. I wouldn\u2019t find it disrespectful.\u201d</p><p>He shoves to his feet, goaded. Jesse hovers on the brink of grabbing me, but instead he clutches the tatters of his self-control and clears the remnants of our meal. But no joke, he slams the rubbish into the bin like he\u2019s punching a wall. I love the fact that I\u2019ve riled him. He\u2019s usually so sweet and calm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI better take you home. I\u2019ll ask around, regarding the spell, and I\u2019ll let you know what I find out.\u201d</p><p>Balls. Round one to Jesse Saldana, but I\u2019m in it to win it.</p><p>Four</p><p>Since I have Saturday off, I hop a bus that takes me partway to Chuch and Eva\u2019s house. They live outside of town, so it\u2019s still a fair walk. I could call instead, but if you\u2019ve ever tried talking to new parents on the phone, then you know why I\u2019m making the trip. Along the way, I turn down a couple of guys who slow with suggestive looks. Yeah, they\u2019re offering more than a ride...or rather, it\u2019s not transportation they\u2019re thinking about.</p> <p>As with so many other facts, I\u2019m fuzzy on the details, but I get the impression that Chuch used to be a badass before he settled down. He hasn\u2019t told me as much, but I suspect their old house burned as a result of his shady past. On the plus side, the insurance paid, so they got a new house out of the deal, bigger and better than the old one, mostly because Chuch and his cousins did most of the actual labor, so the money stretched.</p><p>The new place is beautiful. It\u2019s weird that I can remember what their old place looked like but not how long I\u2019ve been in Laredo. Or how we met, exactly. But I\u2019m used to that kind of thing\u2014fucking magick, man. Anyway, the architectural style borrows from a couple of schools, Colonial and Mediterranean, which maybe doesn\u2019t sound like it would work, but together, they create an amalgam of Texan charm, warm with stucco and mosaic tiles.</p><p>I walk up to the front door and ring the bell. Eva answers a few minutes later, looking harried. Baby Camille is propped on her hip. \u201cHey, Shannon. How are you? I\u2019ve been meaning to call, but these days, it seems like I stumble from nap to nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. Can I come in for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Just be warned, the house is a mess.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes when people say that, they\u2019re being disingenuous and you step inside to find tidy d\u00e9cor worthy of Martha Stewart. This is not the case with Casa Ortiz. It kind of looks like a baby store exploded in here. There are blankets and afghans everywhere, toys strewn on the floor. A fine layer of dust coats everything, and I couldn\u2019t tell you how long it\u2019s been since the floor was mopped.</p><p>And there are frogs everywhere. Not live ones, but little ceramic or china knickknacks. Chuch collects them, apparently. He says they\u2019re good luck.</p><p>\u201cYou want something to drink?\u201d Eva looks so tired.</p><p>\u201cJust water for me. Sit down... I\u2019ll get it. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want coffee, but I can\u2019t have it. I\u2019m breastfeeding. So water for me too.\u201d</p><p>From my stay with them before, I\u2019m familiar with how she organizes her cupboards, so I fill two glasses with ice and pour from the filtered pitcher Eva keeps in the fridge. Then we both sit down at the kitchen table. I feel guilty for bothering her, but I really need to know.</p> <p>\u201cSo I talked to my mom,\u201d I start.</p><p>Both her brows shoot up. \u201cI thought she was dead.\u201d</p><p>The weird thing is, I don\u2019t remember telling her that...but clearly she knows. This is kind of like me knowing things about Jesse that he can\u2019t recall sharing. Something super weird is going on here.</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d I answer, my expression reminding her that for me, death\u2019s not a barrier to conversation.</p><p>\u201cRight. You were saying?\u201d She jogs Camille on her knee, which makes the baby smile, all pink gums and chubby cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI learned something interesting from her. It appears that this brain fog comes from a spell. Do you know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>For a split second, she freezes. But I read the answer in her eyes. She does know. Maybe not everything, but there are definitely secrets hidden in Eva Ortiz\u2019s dark eyes. Yet she shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s strange. But it explains a lot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you tell me if I pissed off a witch?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, you haven\u2019t irked anyone. I mean, you haven\u2019t been living in Laredo that long, relatively speaking.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Spells don\u2019t last forever. I\u2019m sure if you\u2019re patient, your memories will return on their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d I mutter. \u201cYou\u2019re not the one with a hole in your head. Figuratively speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her look becomes sympathetic. \u201cIt must be frustrating.\u201d</p><p>Then why are you lying to me?</p><p>But before I can press the point, Chuch comes in the back door. \u201cShan! You missed us, huh?\u201d</p><p>Chuch is a thick, short guy just starting to get a paunch. Considering how classically gorgeous Eva is, they make a bit of an odd couple since his face can best be described as...battered. He\u2019s also a hugger. He demonstrates the latter by yanking me out of my chair and squashing me against his chest. Since he smells like motor oil, I guess he was working in the garage. That\u2019s how he makes his living, restoring old cars.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, prima?\u201d Chuch calls me \u201ccoz\u201d like we\u2019re related. I\u2019m told it\u2019s affectionate, meant to acknowledge me as family even though I\u2019m really not.</p><p>\u201cNot great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Eva shoots him a sharp look, but Camille interrupts with a loud noise, then the smell that permeates the kitchen is truly horrific. If I were eating, I might hurl.</p><p>\u201cI need to take care of this,\u201d Eva says.</p><p>\u201cBefore it eats through her skin,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>I\u2019m not sorry to see her go, however. Based on past experience, I know Chuch is susceptible to big eyes and feminine pleading. This means his daughter has him wrapped him around her pinkie. Maybe I can do the same. I lean forward, elbows on the table, watching him as he fixes a glass of sweet tea.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe amnesia spell somebody dropped on me.\u201d</p><p>He offers an assessing look, and his expression turns cagey. \u201cYou know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Maybe I can make him think I know more than I do, trick him into revealing something crucial. Eva will be pissed, but I can live with that.</p><p>\u201cThen you know it was done with the best of intentions.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t, actually. But that dovetails with my fear that I\u2019ve done something terrible, so bad it had to be wiped from my brain for me to cope. A shiver rolls through me, and it\u2019s not hard at all to aim an anguished look at Chuch.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me what happened, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShan, if I remind you of what the spell\u2019s blocking too soon, the feedback could seriously hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo people keep telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should listen. We\u2019re not keeping quiet to be assholes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould\u2019ve fooled me.\u201d But being rude will just annoy the few friends I have, so I shove to my feet. \u201cThanks for the drink. I should get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Maria drop you off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. For me, it\u2019s the bus, then the pedestrian shuffle.\u201d I should\u2019ve lied because now he\u2019s on his feet.</p><p>\u201cLet me run you back. It\u2019s two miles to the nearest bus stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware. But you don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva!\u201d Chuch calls. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in half an hour. I\u2019m taking Shannon home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick up toilet paper and baby wipes!\u201d</p><p>He sighs but he\u2019s smiling. \u201cI swear she thinks of something for me to buy anytime I leave the house. It\u2019s like she\u2019s proving I\u2019m properly trained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Chuch owns six cars in various stages of restoration, and he chooses the sportiest, a black Charger. I climb in, listening to him ramble about marriage and fatherhood. This monologue would constitute complaining from any other guy, but Chuch loves Eva so much that he\u2019s happy she\u2019s there, organizing his life and telling him what to do. I\u2019ve noticed that he doesn\u2019t always listen, however. Sometimes he nods at whatever she says and then does something else.</p><p>He\u2019s a fast driver, but safe, so it doesn\u2019t take long to reach my neighborhood, much quicker than the bus. I convince Chuch to drop me off at the mom-and-pop store five blocks from my apartment, and through some miracle I persuade him to let me walk home afterward. He comes in long enough to grab Eva\u2019s requested items, but he hurries off, officially relieved of responsibility. I\u2019m grateful that people care what happens to me, but I need to take care of my own business.</p><p>In the market, I take my time since I\u2019m on a budget and it\u2019s an exercise in humiliation if I bring more to the register than I can afford. In my shopping basket, I\u2019ve got bread, cereal, milk, turkey, lettuce, noodles, tuna, tomatoes, and good cheese. Hopefully these groceries will last until my next payday.</p><p>At first, I don\u2019t notice my shadow. I mean, the guy\u2019s not memorable: thin, middle-aged, wispy brown hair, and a sallow face. He\u2019s just another shopper in the small store, browsing among the pasta. But when I turn down the next aisle, I see him move in the round, silver mirror hung at the back of the store.</p><p>A chill goes down my spine.</p><p>Without my radio, I\u2019m as helpless as the next girl, and I don\u2019t like the feeling. As I shop, I watch the way he keeps pace. I can\u2019t decide if this is regular pervert stalking or if he\u2019s observing me for some other, possibly more alarming, reason.</p><p>It\u2019s fine. There are other people around.</p><p>I\u2019m a little nervous about walking home, but there are no back streets. One of the reasons my half of the rent is so cheap is because the apartment\u2019s on a main road, noisy, but there\u2019s a bus stop nearby and shopping within walking distance. It\u2019s not upscale, but most of Laredo has seen better days. On the positive side, it only costs three hundred a month to live here, plus my share of the utilities.</p><p>The creeper\u2019s still following me.</p><p>There\u2019s only one cash register, so he waits for a few more people to get in line behind me, while he pretends to study a display. Then he joins the queue. My heart beats faster as I wait my turn. After check out, I have two dollars and forty-six cents left. Could be worse. I already gave Maria the rent money, and the other bills aren\u2019t due until later. I might need to take a second job in order to afford tuition, but that leaves the excellent question of when I\u2019ll find the time to attend classes.</p><p>Whatever. I hurry out of the store, wondering if he\u2019ll drop his items and follow. When he does, it feels like ice freezing at the base of my spine. Instead of leaving the parking lot, I set my bags down and get out my phone. When Mr. Nondescript pops out of the market, I snap a picture.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending this to my boyfriend, who\u2019s a cop.\u201d Jesse isn\u2019t, but this asshole doesn\u2019t know that. \u201cIf I catch you tailing me again, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find something to charge you with.\u201d</p><p>The man stills, scanning me head to toe at a leisurely pace, and I feel like I need a hot shower. Or maybe I need to sit in the shower to rock and weep...because I\u2019ve never felt tainted by a look before. In the afternoon sunlight, his eyes glint strangely, first yellow, and then red, like blood\u2019s flowing inside his sclera. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell-played, Ms. Cheney. I assure you, you won\u2019t spot me next time. Not until it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d It sounded like a threat.</p><p>But he\u2019s already striding away, crossing the busy street with a speed and agility entirely foreign to his build. Belatedly I realize, that bastard knew my name. At that point, my flight instinct kicks in. I grab my stuff and sprint all the way home.</p><p>Maria\u2019s at work, so she doesn\u2019t witness my collapse against the front door. All my natural intuition tells me that guy wasn\u2019t normal. I feel like such a dipshit since I\u2019ve been full of big ideas about taking care of myself, but this is weightier than dinner or the phone bill. So I type a succinct message to Jesse about my creeper and then send him the photo.</p> <p>I\u2019m surprised when he calls me five minutes later. I figured he\u2019d be tied up in interviews today, but he might have the day off. I haven\u2019t memorized his work schedule or anything.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, sugar?\u201d His voice is buttery sweet, warm with concern, and my toes actually curl.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he just freaked me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened, exactly what he said.\u201d</p><p>So I repeat the encounter, word for word. He sounds troubled when he replies. \u201cSounds like you\u2019ve drawn somebody\u2019s eye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a normal perv, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say no. Be careful, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think this has to do with the spell?\u201d</p><p>He hesitates. I so wish I could see his face right now. \u201cHard to say. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChuch and Eva know something, by the way. But they\u2019re not talking. Did you find anything out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. There\u2019s no relevant chatter on Area 51, but...today, my boss asked me if I was still dating that sweet redheaded girl.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s seeing someone? What the hell. Somehow I keep my voice from trembling. \u201cWell, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the strange thing, Shan. To the best of my recollection, I\u2019ve never gone out with anyone like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust how big is this spell?\u201d I wonder.</p><p>\u201cNo idea. But we need to get to the bottom of it.\u201d His voice deepens, softens. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay safe for me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for you,\u201d I answer breezily, and I guarantee he has no idea how much I mean it.</p><p>Five</p><p>Sunday is laundry day. I use two bucks to wash my work uniforms, which is almost all I wear during the week, so I\u2019m set when Monday rolls around.</p><p>The next morning, I take the bus to work, as usual, and I\u2019m jumpy, watching for the spooky dude, but I don\u2019t spot him. There\u2019s just the usual bunch of commuters who can\u2019t afford a car or insurance or both. They nod at me as I board; I lift my chin in response.</p> <p>I sit next to an older woman who clutches her bag as if I\u2019m likely to mug her. People often respond that way to the piercings and my general style. It\u2019s not personal, though. I\u2019ve watched folks with similar looks receive the same treatment.</p><p>It\u2019s a decent day, bright enough and unlikely to rain. Most of us hop off at the mall and I traipse inside, ignoring the kid from the hamburger stand who\u2019s puffing away near the ashtrays; he looks like he isn\u2019t even old enough to buy smokes. I give him a wide berth. Despite my cold shoulder, he falls into step beside me.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in school?\u201d I ask.</p><p>That makes him scowl. \u201cI graduated last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve come so far. Your mother must be so proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I bother trying to be nice to you.\u201d</p><p>So maybe he\u2019s attempting humor when he makes the paper pirate hat? Or possibly it\u2019s a nerd courtship ritual. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery to us all.\u201d</p><p>He follows me to the food court. During this interminable walk, I learn his name is Felix and he wants to be an optometrist but his grades weren\u2019t good enough to get into the university of his choice, so he\u2019s taking a year off to figure out his next step. I\u2019m puzzled why he thinks I care enough to merit this vomitous outpouring of personal information.</p><p>\u201cNow you,\u201d he prompts as we cross through the tables. \u201cThat\u2019s how conversation works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Shannon. I was born in the Deep South in a cursed little town, one full of witches, demons, and shit. Then some horrible things happened, and I probably killed my mother, but because I have partial amnesia, I can\u2019t be sure. Now I\u2019m working at Pretzel Pirate, which might literally be an annex in hell. Who says there\u2019s no such thing as karma?\u201d</p><p>To my surprise, he cracks up. \u201cOkay, I get it, I\u2019m pushy. Talk to you later, Shannon...if that is your real name.\u201d</p><p>Huh. Telling the truth is fun, boys and girls.</p><p>Bemused, I head toward my penance for the bad deeds I don\u2019t clearly remember. Opening at Pretzel Pirate has become second nature; I could do it in my sleep. I set the dough in the machines, put pretzels in the oven, and turn on various gadgets. Work passes with routine issues, like people bitching that their pretzel is too soft, not crispy enough, or I didn\u2019t top it with enough jalape\u00f1o cheese.</p><p>The hamburger stand closes an hour before Pretzel Pirate, so I get to chat with Felix before he gets too hungry to wait any longer. This is good because if he\u2019s still here when I close, he\u2019ll ask me to dinner. I can read the signs, but there\u2019s no way in hell that would ever happen. We may be the same age, but he looks like a toddler to me. He\u2019s barely pubescent, let alone interesting in a sexual fashion.</p><p>As I\u2019m locking up, I get a text from Jesse. Come out the west doors. I\u2019m taking you home. If I didn\u2019t have the dude from yesterday fresh in my mind, I\u2019d bitch at him. It\u2019s only nine fifteen, and I\u2019ve been taking the bus for weeks. Yet tonight, the mall seems silent and faintly ominous as I pass through the food court; I don\u2019t see any security guards and the stores have all shut down. Metal gates cover the shops, and the fountains aren\u2019t flowing. Maybe I\u2019ve seen too many zombie movies. Despite my best intentions, I quicken my steps.</p><p>It\u2019s probably my imagination, but the faster I move, the surer I feel that someone\u2019s watching me. I mean, there\u2019s a night watchman on the security cameras. Maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019m sensing. Goose bumps rise on my arms. I feel...hunted. Darkness flashes to my right, but when I turn, there\u2019s nothing, just a residual chill.</p><p>Bullshit to this. I take off toward the western exit, easier in my Pretzel Pirate shoes than it would be in combat boots. To my astonishment, Jesse comes tearing at me, his strides ringing on the tile floor. He stops when he sees nobody\u2019s chasing me. That\u2019s when I realize he\u2019s drawn his weapon.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know,\u201d he snaps.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d I don\u2019t even know what to ask. He was running like he thought my life was actively in danger. Now, I figure I probably overreacted. I\u2019ve got a vivid imagination.</p><p>\u201cYou were scared to death,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>My eyes widen. \u201cYou could tell?\u201d</p><p>He ignores the implicit question. \u201cDid you see the guy again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just...\u201d It sounds dumb. \u201cI felt like I wasn\u2019t alone, as if somebody was watching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible. Show me where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me.\u201d</p><p>So I lead him back to the spot where the impression was strongest, just past the dark water in the silent fountain. Jesse pulls a pewter keychain out of his pocket, but there are no keys attached. He cradles it between his palms and walks a slow circuit around the area. Finally he stops, his gaze level and somber.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t imagine it. Scrying magick\u2019s been used here recently. The water is a natural conductor for those kinds of spells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was the weirdo from yesterday. He did say I won\u2019t see him again until it\u2019s too late.\u201d I sound calmer than I feel.</p><p>This makes no sense. Why would the Gifted hunt me? If they need me to contact a dead relative, I\u2019ll do it for twenty bucks, a six-pack, and a pizza.</p><p>Jesse pulls out his phone. \u201cYou see the odd shadings on his skin?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the photo I sent him. \u201cYeah, I figured it was my crappy camera.\u201d</p><p>Absently, he shakes his head, reaching for me. Speechless, I let him lace our fingers together. It\u2019s a protective gesture, not a romantic one, but I\u2019m fucking holding hands with Jesse Saldana, so I\u2019d be crazy to complain. His fingers are lean and long, callused in the right places, and his palm is hard against mine.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk and talk. I showed this to someone on my lunch hour today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said the discolorations are consistent with long-term demonic possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I know demons are real...and they usually don\u2019t have enough power to traverse the gate between our worlds physically. It requires less juice to send mental energy, which results in a person being driven like a meat wagon. That\u2019s not news, but I\u2019m startled to hear my stalker is most likely extra-dimensional.</p><p>Mustering some presence of mind, I add, \u201cSo can your thingie tell if witch or demon magick was used to spy on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, no. But I\u2019ll feel better once we get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might still be watching? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew, Shan. Let\u2019s go.\u201d He tugs gently on my hand, and we hurry back toward the exit.</p><p>The air\u2019s still cold inside the mall, a chill deeper and more disturbing than what comes from good air conditioning. There\u2019s a faint smell too, sickly sweet, like death drizzled in honey. I don\u2019t look back as Jesse shoves the door open. He\u2019s left his Forester parked at the yellow curb, and the engine is running. In fact, the driver-side door\u2019s open, too.</p><p>\u201cYou were pretty worried about me, huh?\u201d I imagine him getting a wash of my emotional state and coming at a dead run.</p><p>Oh, Jesse. So many ways I\u2019d love you, if you\u2019d let me.</p><p>\u201cFor good reason, as it turns out.\u201d He opens my door and waits until I\u2019m settled to shut it behind me.</p><p>I could get used to being treated like a princess, as long as he brings the dirty cowboy to bed. Of course, I\u2019m still working on that development, but it\u2019s a good sign that the idea of me in danger scared the shit out of him. He starts the SUV and pulls out of the mall parking lot. For a few seconds, I watch as he eyes his rearview mirror, but nobody seems to be following. They don\u2019t have to; they can use standing water to watch me. Note to self\u2014showers only until we resolve this shit.</p><p>Jesse drives to my place, but he doesn\u2019t drop me off. Instead he escorts me to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll wait here. Pack a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you here alone when we have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a roommate and I know how to dial 911.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re willing to endanger Maria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a low blow, but I\u2019m not going home with you, Jesse. Not unless you\u2019re taking me there for better reasons.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cG\u2019night. Thanks for the ride.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think he expects me to close the door in his face. When I turn, I spot Maria in the hall, just stepping out of the bathroom. \u201cDid I hear voices?\u201d</p><p>I squelch the urge to reply, I dunno, but if so, you should check your medication. \u201cYeah, I bummed a lift from a friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe hot cop? Are you guys a thing?\u201d She skims me up and down, not meant to be insulting, but I suspect she can\u2019t picture Jesse and me together.</p><p>Dammit. Neither can he.</p><p>\u201cNope. He\u2019s just overprotective. Apparently the public transportation system is fraught with many and myriad dangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should go for it,\u201d she advises.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d I mumble.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d offer to lend you some sexy undies, but I don\u2019t think they would fit.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not a slam. Maria\u2019s butt is bigger than mine, plus who wants to borrow sexy panties? Pass.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I appreciate the thought, though.\u201d</p><p>Maria heads to her room after that. We don\u2019t talk extensively, but she\u2019s a decent roomie, here enough that I don\u2019t feel totally alone, but she\u2019s not always in my business, either.</p><p>First I wash the Pretzel Pirate smell off, then I make a salad. Along with some tuna and buttered noodles, this is dinner. I\u2019m not much of a cook, but I\u2019ve gotten good at putting healthy meals together from fairly little. Maria goes to bed while I\u2019m still eating, so I turn on the TV for company.</p><p>I\u2019m almost ready to turn in when my phone vibrates with a text from Jesse. You drive me crazy. Why won\u2019t you let me protect you?</p> <p>I reply, That\u2019s not your job. You\u2019re my friend, not my lover or my bodyguard.</p><p>There\u2019s a pause between messages. I picture him on the couch, like I am, frowning at his phone. If we WERE together, would you fight me this much?</p><p>Elation surges through me. He might not realize it, but that reveals how much his thinking has changed in a relatively short time. Even if it\u2019s a hypothetical question born of aggravation, it also means he\u2019s wondering what we\u2019d be like as a couple. So obviously, I flirt with him.</p><p>That depends, I answer. How much do you like it?</p><p>A whole lot...and not at all.</p><p>Look, J, I\u2019m never gonna sit on a pedestal and wait. I\u2019m not that kind of princess. I\u2019ll insist you take me with you to storm the castle and I\u2019ll carry my own sword.</p><p>You won\u2019t let me slay your dragons? I imagine him saying it in a soft, teasing tone.</p><p>Without hesitation, I type, there\u2019s only one circumstance where I would.</p> <p>What\u2019s that? He responds so fast; there\u2019s no way he\u2019s doing anything but talking to me. That makes me ridiculously happy. His dinner might be cooling on the table beside him, the TV playing unnoticed.</p><p>If you want me to say yes to you, you have to say yes to me.</p><p>Blackmail\u2019s illegal. But damned if you don\u2019t make it tempting.</p><p>That\u2019s the idea. Night, cowboy.</p><p>Six</p><p>All through the week, Jesse sends me texts and emails.</p><p>Those messages are the high point of my day, no matter what he says. Sometimes he writes about how work\u2019s going, though nothing specific about his cases. Other times, he talks about his partner, and then rarely, his family. I wonder if he realizes how much he\u2019s sharing, how much he\u2019s opening up. I keep teasing him, and soon he\u2019s flirting back. It\u2019s easier to get him to respond this way, possibly because he\u2019s not looking at me and thinking how young I am.</p><p>Wednesday, Maria and I have a Chris Pine movie marathon by connecting my laptop to the TV; she has a Netflix account\u2014or rather, she knows a cousin\u2019s password. So we\u2019re all set. As we\u2019re watching Mr. Pine use psychic powers, I try not to think about the weirdo who was watching me. I haven\u2019t sensed anything out of place since then, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m clear. It\u2019s hard to feel safe when somebody could be staring up at you from your dishwater.</p><p>A text comes in from Jesse as the last movie ends. What\u2019re you doing?</p><p>Admiring Chris Pine\u2019s hotness.</p><p>He\u2019s older than I am!</p><p>Like I care. Or as if age would stop me. What\u2019s your point?</p><p>Mentally, I hear him sighing. Never mind. I wish you were here. Texts and emails are fine, but I want to talk.</p><p>About what?</p><p>I just miss you, that\u2019s all.</p><p>This feels like a huge admission. So I stand up and say to Maria, who\u2019s been watching me text, \u201cI\u2019m gonna call it a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It was fun. We should do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris Evans next time?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Once I\u2019m in my room with the door shut behind me, I dial Jesse\u2019s number. I\u2019m not a phone talker, you understand, but I\u2019ll make an exception to capitalize on this emotional confession. It rings twice before he answers. I\u2019m already snuggled down on my futon. Low-level arousal percolates through me as I picture him doing the same. In my head, he\u2019s in bed and shirtless, listening to my voice.</p><p>Mmm, yeah.</p><p>\u201cHere I am,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cShan...\u201d His voice is rich, the drawl pronounced, and he imbues my name with a kind of longing I\u2019ve never heard before. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me feel this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s me and not you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. I\u2019m never sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would be with me.\u201d</p><p>Silently, I replay his words in my head. Is he picking up how I feel, from all the way across town? I don\u2019t know much about empathy, but that\u2019s an enormous range.</p><p>\u201cHow do you keep from drowning in other people\u2019s emotions?\u201d I ask, before I can think better of it.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. The distance is more of a gauge,\u201d he mutters. From his tone, it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t care to elaborate.</p><p>And that makes me even more determined to get an answer. \u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you care...a Laredo-sized amount about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShan,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI doubt you could go anywhere that I wouldn\u2019t feel you.\u201d</p><p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>He goes on, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this since high school. You\u2019re burning me alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid the flame to the moth.\u201d</p><p>He must be wondering how he\u2019d explain me to his friends and family, his work colleagues. I won\u2019t change for him. If he wants me, I come with Gothic splendor. He has to love me enough not to care what other people think or how they feel about us together. I don\u2019t know if Jesse has that much of a lawless streak in him.</p><p>I sure hope so.</p><p>And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m jailbait. I\u2019m just not the girl anybody would pick for him.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to think I\u2019m bent on your destruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes it feels that way. No matter how many times I tell myself it\u2019s a bad idea, I close my eyes and see your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with that.\u201d</p><p>Then I disconnect the call because I\u2019m ready to turn it into something filthy, and I don\u2019t think Jesse\u2019s ready for that. I suspect he\u2019d feel guilty if we had phone sex, which would set us back. I text him a good night, and then I handle my own needs, all the while conscious that he\u2019s probably feeling everything I do. I consider how he might respond, and that\u2019s enough to make me arch and quiver. Afterward, I\u2019m glowing when I get his texted reply to my emotional message.</p><p>God, that was good.</p><p>For obvious reasons, I start all over again.</p><p>On Friday, I\u2019ve been working for about four hours when I straighten up too close to the drink machine and whack my head. There\u2019s a line of customers, and a few of them act like they might slip behind the stand to help me. Mark would throw a fit and probably fire me; I can hear him ranting about liability. God, training with him sucked so much.</p><p>Through sparkling vision, I mumble, \u201cI\u2019m fine, just give me a few seconds.\u201d</p><p>I stumble through their service, and they\u2019re all humane enough not to whine. I probably give them the wrong food and beverages, but I\u2019m barely conscious. Afterward, it\u2019s like that impact shook something loose\u2014or broke it more likely\u2014but now I\u2019ve got this picture sitting in the front of my head.</p><p>From the outside, it looks like an Oriental trading company, a shop where they sell rugs, fans, and cute imported things. I see myself walking into the store, through the front, and into a private room in back. Here, it\u2019s clearly an arcane supply house with wards, runes, wands, herbs, athames, and other rare spell components. Since I\u2019m pretty sure I can\u2019t cast spells, I can\u2019t fathom what I was doing there. I get flashes, too, of the woman who accompanied me, but there\u2019s a blank spot where her face should be, one I just can\u2019t fill\u2014and pushing ends with me crouched on the floor, cradling my head. Bumping it was painful, and I\u2019ve got a lump rising; this is more of an iron spike through my frontal lobe.</p><p>Felix comes jogging over. \u201cDamn, you okay? I heard that bang from across the way, over the whir of the milkshake machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look good. Come on, sit down for a minute.\u201d</p><p>I let him help me up and lead me out to the nearest table. Unless my vision clears up, there\u2019s no way I can finish my shift. Which is unfortunate because the manager\u2019s on vacation for two weeks. He\u2019s been running the place with little help for months, not too surprising, given the uniforms and the pay. My hours might get cut once he comes home, but I\u2019ll worry about that later. Like when my brain isn\u2019t trying to leak out my ears.</p><p>\u201cIs there anyone you can call to cover your shift?\u201d Felix asks.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d It\u2019s past three, so Tim, the high school boy who works on the weekends, might be able to come in. But we\u2019re not supposed to swap hours without Mark\u2019s approval. But I don\u2019t give two craps about policy at the moment.</p><p>After a few seconds, I hobble back to the stand, the ache in my head subsided to a low roar, and I dig for the personnel roster. Soon I\u2019m on the phone, begging Tim to save me. \u201cI\u2019ll work all day tomorrow for you, promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d he says.</p><p>Four hours for eight is a bargain. Despite working at Pretzel Pirate, Tim is no fool. He gets a free Saturday out of this arrangement. As I disconnect, a coworker calls Felix back to continue flipping burgers, and I dig the Yellow Pages out from beneath the counter, then look up the shop. I recall the name from the signage, and to my surprise, I find the listing. Huh. I tap the page. So it\u2019s a real place downtown...and I\u2019m not crazy. I enter the address in my phone and then use an online service to figure out what buses to take from here. I note that on my phone, too. Hopefully, if I make all the right connections, I\u2019ll get there before closing time.</p><p>I can\u2019t shake the certainty that it\u2019s important. Honestly, that\u2019s why I\u2019m so set on getting out of here. I could finish work with a sore skull, but since Tim agreed to fill in, I\u2019m heading out as soon as he shows; maybe the place will jog my memory. It only takes fifteen minutes for Tim to saunter in. He moves slow, but he\u2019s a good worker, and he\u2019s not annoying like Mark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He eyes the bump on my head and says, \u201cI get it. No explanation necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days are like that,\u201d I say with a sigh.</p><p>He grins. \u201cMost of mine, actually. Later, Shannon.\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m heading for the bus stop, my phone beeps. Honestly, I\u2019m surprised Jesse hasn\u2019t messaged me sooner. I\u2019m not 100% sure if I love being looped in so tightly, but on the other hand, it means he cares. So I can handle the attention, especially when it comes with perks like the other night.</p> <p>This might sound dumb, but are you all right?</p><p>Minor head trauma, self-inflicted. Nothing to worry about.</p><p>But worrying is my only superpower.</p><p>Lies. You also look amazing in jeans.</p><p>It\u2019s absurd that I can enjoy flirting with him so much via text. But I\u2019m smiling as I board the bus. Patting my bag, I make sure my radio\u2019s still in place. Since that freaky meet-up outside the market, I don\u2019t go anywhere without it. My magickal focus, so to speak, fits in a backpack, so there\u2019s no reason for me to go unarmed, especially when things could turn scary in a split second. Reassured that I\u2019m not helpless, I transfer near downtown and ride a little farther, then I hop off a block from the store. The whole time, I\u2019m aware somebody could be following me, but I don\u2019t see anyone. Nobody else gets off at my stop, anyway, and there are no puddles they can use to spy on me.</p> <p>I hurry along the sidewalk and enter the trading company. A bell jingles, and I\u2019m overcome by an urge to leave. The feeling almost chokes me, but I force myself to continue deeper into the shop. As I get closer to the back room, the aversion dissipates. I push through the curtain, and everything\u2019s just as I\u2019d pictured in my mind\u2019s eye. Only I don\u2019t remember coming here per se; it\u2019s more like a dream.</p><p>An elderly woman sits behind the counter. She watches me with still, dead eyes, and she doesn\u2019t smile. Customarily, a greeting might be in order or an offer to help the customer find what she\u2019s looking for. This clerk tracks my movements with her eyes, which seem impossibly dark and deep, too much for her grandmotherly demeanor. For God\u2019s sake, she has knitting on the counter. I feel weird thinking she\u2019s pure evil, like I might be guilty of ageism, but I have the same feeling now as I did the other night at the mall.</p><p>I hardly dare to breathe as I move through the shop, pretending to look at the arcane accoutrements. I suspect this might\u2019ve been a mistake. Why didn\u2019t I tell Jesse where I was going? I\u2019m wondering if they can track my phone. He\u2019ll try that, right, when I turn up missing? Then I remember that\u2019s for contract phones and mine\u2019s pay-as-you-go. Dammit.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for anything in particular?\u201d She speaks at last, and her voice has an awful quality, like a dead thing scrabbling up from the bottom of a well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just browsing.\u201d What the hell. Since I came all this way, I might as well ask what\u2019s on my mind. \u201cThis might be an odd question, but...have I ever been in here before?\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when the old woman vaults the counter like a stick bug and tries to kill me.</p> <p>Seven</p><p>I stumble back a few steps and topple a display between us. The shattering glass slows her down long enough for me to pop open my backpack. Dodging between display racks, I weave away from her. Madness and malevolence radiate from her in smothering waves, and she\u2019s eerily silent, just the rough gasps of a body unused to such physical exertion.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could talk things through,\u201d I offer. \u201cGet some counseling? I\u2019m sure whatever it is I did to you, which I apparently don\u2019t remember, I can make amends. How do you feel about macram\u00e9 rugs?\u201d</p><p>Her bony fist smashes through some stained-glass shelving, and her blood spatters me as I dive away. It smells faintly of rotten eggs.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a no on arts and crafts?\u201d</p><p>When she sweeps her arm across a shelf, crystal shards rain down, tangling in my hair. At her next attack, some kind of dust explodes all over us, making me choke, but it hampers the crazy demonic assassin as well. Close up, I can see the uneven patches on her skin. Her eyes roll in her head, spinning like no human could manage, and that creeps me out enough that I almost drop my radio.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>I tug at the dials with cold, shaking fingers. I\u2019ve never tried to summon whatever spirits might be listening, but I need help. So I spin at random and call out, \u201cRestless dead, I summon you to this place, I call you to my aid.\u201d</p> <p>At first it seems like I\u2019ve chosen a bad channel and nothing\u2019s within the sound of my voice. Worried, I duck the heavy urn she hurls at me. If she keeps this up, she\u2019ll destroy the store\u2019s whole inventory. Also, she\u2019ll open my head like a melon. Of the two, I\u2019m more concerned about the latter.</p><p>I jiggle the dial and mutter the call again, and this time, I feel them coming. The temperature in the room drops by ten degrees, sending a chill down my spine. Tingles radiate outward from where my fingers are touching the radio, my energy fueling their hunger, but it\u2019s not sated. I could never give enough to make them feel warm or whole. This is like tossing a few scraps to a starving predator. Though it\u2019s dusk outside, that purple plum of a sunset, it\u2019s darker still in the store, as if some pagan god dropped a black bag over the sun.</p><p>\u201cDrain her,\u201d I command.</p><p>Darkness swarms around the old woman. I stop running then, watching in horrified fascination as her body pulls taut, held by unseen hands. Her feet come up, nearly off the floor, and she quakes from head to toe. At first, she lashes out, snarling in incoherent rage, but her skin grows paler and paler, then the creature driving her body leaps away. It\u2019s hard to distinguish its sooty swirl from my starving spirits, but I track the energy; it dives from the old woman into the telephone, and I\u2019m astonished. Is that how demons travel? If they\u2019re energy, it stands to reason they could pass in telephone or electrical wires, right? Holy shit. It makes me want to break all my electronics, right this minute. But I\u2019m so busy pondering the implications that I almost forget to stop the feast.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I call. \u201cDon\u2019t kill her. Restless dead, I send you from this place.\u201d</p><p>The room chills further, and I fear they won\u2019t listen. Part of me wonders why they heed me at all. But the ghosts withdraw in a misty blur, quick as they came. The old woman drops in a heap on the floor, amid the wreckage. With trembling hands, I turn off the radio. There\u2019s no sign of what truly happened here, apart from her collapse and my minor injuries. How the hell can I explain this?</p><p>Good thing I\u2019ve got a cop on speed dial, but like usual, he\u2019s already calling me. \u201cShan, what the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. So can you please send EMTs...and I\u2019d appreciate it if you came too. There will be questions...and I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d I give him the address.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d He sounds frantic. I hear horns honking, Jesse swearing, and the screech of tires. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in fifteen minutes. Sit tight. Wait, no, first get to a safe location and sit tight.\u201d The fact that he\u2019s repeating himself is kind of adorable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hurt. The ambulance is for someone else.\u201d I kneel beside the old woman and press two fingers to her throat. \u201cShe\u2019s alive but in bad shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist almighty, Shan.\u201d He produces a string of curses that would impress me at any other time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging up now. I\u2019ll be here, and you need to focus on your driving.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s still ranting when I cut the call. Sometimes I think Jesse\u2019s not used to females like me. I sit down beside the old woman, feeling horrible and helpless, but was I supposed to let her kill me? I did the best I could. Heart heavy, I dig into my bag and produce a chocolate bar. Eating it keeps me from passing out.</p><p>Jesse arrives before the medical personnel. He runs through the shop, apparently not bothered by the aversion spell that rocked me in the front of the store. I guess if you can shake it off, you belong here. His cop instincts make him clear the room before he approaches, then he kneels beside me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened here?\u201d</p><p>I give him the nutshell version of how I remembered this place and thought visiting might help. Then I explain the woman\u2019s weird reaction and how she went after me. He can tell by looking at her she\u2019s been hosting for a while, as that\u2019s not good for your health, but this account won\u2019t satisfy the authorities.</p><p>Quickly, he searches the premises, and I watch, puzzled. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet. I\u2019ll deal with you later.\u201d</p><p>Hm. I like the sound of that. So I shut up, letting him do his thing.</p><p>At last he comes back, seeming relieved. \u201cThis is a break for us. There are no security cameras, so we\u2019ll go with an unknown assailant. Caucasian male, late twenties, brown hair, no distinguishing features.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThat\u2019s your report, right, Ms. Cheney?\u201d</p><p>I see where he\u2019s going with this. That\u2019s too general a description to convict anyone; it applies to billions of men across the country. \u201cAbsolutely. He tore up the place and scared the clerk so bad, she had some kind of seizure. I ran away from him and called you...because we\u2019re acquainted and I thought you might come faster than 911.\u201d I wish I could use a stronger word to describe our relationship, but I rather doubt Jesse wants me to announce that I\u2019d give a kidney to fuck him, especially in official documents.</p><p>The EMTs race in, just as I\u2019m concluding this version of events. Other police officers arrive as well, and they start the inquiry. Jesse tries to shield me from the worst of it, but he can\u2019t keep the rest of the force from trying to figure out what happened. Fortunately, the shop is busted up enough that they can\u2019t be sure what kind of goods were sold. Some of the powders and potions would probably draw strange looks if the officers were reading the labels instead of questioning me.</p><p>The ambulance takes the old woman away, and I\u2019m left repeating my story, hoping it doesn\u2019t sound rehearsed. I don\u2019t have to pretend I\u2019m shaken or that I can\u2019t remember much because, oh my God, it all happened so fast. I\u2019ve seen enough cop shows to be confident these guys hear that all the time from agitated witnesses.</p><p>Finally, Jesse says, \u201cI\u2019d like to get the cuts on her hands checked out. I\u2019ll make sure she comes in for a follow-up interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re good, actually.\u201d The other cop puts away his notepad. \u201cIt was probably a tweaker, looking for some fast cash. Don\u2019t imagine he found any in a place like this. They usually knock over convenience stores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was just in the neighborhood,\u201d Jesse says with a straight face.</p><p>The uniformed officer laughs. \u201cCrime of opportunity? Maybe. It doesn\u2019t sound like much planning went into this.\u201d</p><p>Soon after, Jesse escorts me to his SUV, makes sure I buckle up, and then he drives exactly two blocks. For the first time, I notice how tightly he\u2019s locked himself down, like if he didn\u2019t have his hands balled into fists, he\u2019d be screaming and punching things. Is it odd that I find this self-control insanely hot, even while I\u2019m contemplating all the delicious ways I can make him lose it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He jams his finger into my seat belt button and drags me up into his arms, across the console and onto his lap. I settle, deciding this isn\u2019t the time to fight him. Jesse runs his hands up and down my back, burying his face in the curve between my neck and shoulder. Tentative, I touch his jaw, bristly with scruff, and then walk my fingers up his cheek to his temple, stroking back toward his hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI handled it. I just needed an assist with the logistics afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take this, Shan. Do you have any idea how much I worry? I think about someone hurting you and I can\u2019t fucking breathe. I want to invent a hundred new kinds of pain and teach it to anyone who looks at you the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he snarls.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a copout. Or a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re in me like a fever. I wake up thinking about you. I go to sleep that way. I find you in my dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019m I doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d he bites out.</p> <p>And then he kisses me like he needs me more than air. His mouth is fierce and hot, ravenous as he nuzzles into me, tongue surging in lavish strokes. I can feel his desire, both from the hard length under my ass, and because he\u2019s totally lost the reins on his gift. Powerful empaths don\u2019t just read emotions; they can also broadcast, but I\u2019ve never known Jesse to do that. He\u2019s off the chain now, though, wild as a Texas storm and twice as dangerous. He pulls me to him until I\u2019m sure he\u2019s leaving bruises on my hips. His emotions feed mine, which ratchets his need higher in turn, until we\u2019re both damn near mad with lust.</p><p>I scramble, not fighting him, but helping, until I\u2019m astride his lap. With a growled curse, he shoves the seat all the way back, making room. He bites down on my neck, hard enough to hurt, not quite enough to bruise, but I wouldn\u2019t mind if he broke the skin. I\u2019d be glad to walk around with Jesse\u2019s teeth marks on my body. In fact the thought of it makes me hotter, and I move on him. He\u2019s ablaze beneath me, panting against my lips.</p><p>We\u2019re gonna do it. He can\u2019t stop. I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>Then someone taps on the window. Motherfucking bastard-ass shitballs\u2014I melt down silently in frustrated rage. The glass is fogged up, so whoever it is can\u2019t see us. My knees are weak when I slide off his lap. Jesse looks like he could happily tear somebody\u2019s heart out with his teeth when he powers down the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snaps.</p><p>It\u2019s one of the uniformed officers from the scene, looking curious, terrified, and intrigued, all at the same time. \u201cI saw your vehicle and I wondered if you\u2019d broken down. You said you were taking her to the doctor...\u201d His voice trails off, then he changes his mind. \u201cI can see things are fine. Sorry to bother you.\u201d</p> <p>Once he walks away, I check my reflection in the mirror attached to the visor. My hair is a mess, my lips are swollen, and I\u2019m covered in glass fragments and speckles of blood. It\u2019s obvious to me\u2014and probably the other cop\u2014that we were making out.</p><p>Jesse slams a hand into the dashboard, and my heart sinks. I guess he\u2019s ashamed that we got caught, and the hurt swells up until I think I might be sick. His look softens at once, and he covers my hand with his.</p><p>\u201cHey, no. It\u2019s not that, Shan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pissed we had to stop.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t suggest that we pick up where we left off. This isn\u2019t the time or place. We both got carried away, but damn, was that amazing. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, his dark eyes warm as melted chocolate. \u201cNow I have to be responsible and make sure you don\u2019t need stitches. Then you\u2019re coming home with me. No arguments, or I\u2019ll remember that I\u2019m furious. You don\u2019t wanna find out how that story ends, sugar.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. Actually, I kinda do.</p> <p>Eight</p><p>Jesse takes me to a twenty-four-hour clinic, where the doctor cleans and wraps my injuries, apart from a deep cut between my middle fingers. It gapes open when I flex my knuckles; that gets two stitches, but since they\u2019ll dissolve on their own, I don\u2019t have to come back in. The doc looks tired, and he doesn\u2019t ask any questions. I\u2019m sure Jesse was prepared to answer them, but I guess the doc sees much worse on a daily basis.</p><p>This time, when we get in the SUV, Jesse doesn\u2019t take me to my place. He\u2019s gotten savvy; he figures I might change my mind if he gives me the chance, so we end up at his apartment, even though I don\u2019t have any clothes. Like me, he doesn\u2019t live in a complex. Rather, this is a three-story brick building. From the size, I estimate there are six apartments total, two on each floor.</p><p>Jesse leads the way up two flights, then unlocks the door. Inside, it\u2019s tidy, but I glimpse the ravages of an old scuffle; there are lighter spots on the walls, as if small holes have been patched, and the furniture is so crisp and new that I figure something must\u2019ve happened to his old, comfy stuff. This doesn\u2019t look like I imagined, however. It\u2019s warmer and less modern, possibly because of the combination of textiles and colors. I would never have pegged Jesse as favoring red and yellow. Against the white walls, it works, though.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll sleep on the couch,\u201d he says.</p><p>I\u2019m not surprised. The heat of the moment overwhelmed him in the car, but now that logic\u2019s driving the bus again, he doesn\u2019t feel right about asking me to get naked and hop in his bed. Though that would totally be all right with me.</p><p>\u201cI hope you have a spare toothbrush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the medicine cabinet.\u201d</p><p>When he comes back with it, I ask, \u201cAre you worried about your coworker telling everyone...?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably give me shit for steaming up the windows with a girl in a Pretzel Pirate uniform, but I can take it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. I realize I am, in fact, still wearing my work clothes. \u201cDo you have a washer? I have to go in tomorrow. I promised Tim I\u2019d cover his shift if he took over for me today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could go poking around a store that came to you in a vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it was almost a memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just went off on your own. Were you thinking at all? You know somebody\u2019s stalking you, Shan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when is shopping hazardous to your health?\u201d I bristle.</p><p>Jesse sighs. \u201cYes, I have a washer. This way.\u201d</p><p>His apartment is definitely nicer than mine. His bathroom has a small space set back in the wall, which holds a stacked washer and dryer. I\u2019d love if I didn\u2019t have to drag my clothes downstairs to the communal laundry room. Because I\u2019m made of evil with whipped cream frosting, I start stripping right there.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d he demands, whirling away.</p><p>\u201cWashing my things. Do you have anything you want me to add? It seems like a waste to run the machine for four items.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my laundry basket.\u201d He sounds strangled. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll bring you something to put on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppreciate it,\u201d I say cheerfully.</p><p>So I\u2019m literally standing naked in Jesse\u2019s bathroom when his arm reaches around the corner. He\u2019s holding a white V-neck T-shirt and a pair of boxers. I scramble into them, then I step out, so he can add his clothes to the washer. This outfit\u2019s not exactly modest. You can see the points of my nipples and the fly gaps when I walk.</p><p>\u201cI should get you a robe. Dammit. I don\u2019t own one. I\u2019ll go to the store.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNow you\u2019re being silly. I\u2019ll wrap up in a blanket in the living room. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t,\u201d he mutters. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing my clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. You don\u2019t need any hints on how to drive me crazy.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring my offer of help, he aims me at the couch and whips up a quick meal. The chicken and rice is fancier than I\u2019d have made, though it\u2019s not haute cuisine. It\u2019s also really good. He turns on the news as we eat, and I have the thought that I\u2019d be so happy if this was my real life. I mean, not necessarily wearing his underwear every night, but curling up with Jesse, eating dinner?</p><p>God, yes. Please.</p><p>After dinner, he dumps the plates in the sink and joins me on the couch. It\u2019s just past nine by now, not early enough for bed, and I have no idea what he\u2019s thinking. With a sigh, Jesse wraps an arm around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, Shan. I won\u2019t do anything. I was an asshole to treat you like I did in the car.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cSeriously? You think that\u2019s why I\u2019m uptight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my mind, that\u2019s the best move you\u2019ve made where I\u2019m concerned, and certainly the most honest. And now you\u2019re back to being the good guy, the one with perfect manners. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll raise up the walls between us and I\u2019ll have to start all over again.\u201d I pause, wondering if I should say this. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have the energy. I mean, I want you. I\u2019ve made no secret of it. But I won\u2019t chase you forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an ultimatum?\u201d He sounds coldly furious.</p><p>I\u2019m a little proud of myself. I didn\u2019t know it was possible to make Jesse angry so fast. \u201cJust a fact. In time, I\u2019ll move on, find someone who wants me more.\u201d</p><p>Rage bludgeons me. For the second time tonight, he loses control and his emotions hit me like a hammer. It\u2019s a mad wash of fury, jealousy, frustration, and a hint of possession that thrills me to my core. He might be struggling, but he doesn\u2019t take me lightly.</p><p>\u201cThat would be impossible,\u201d he growls.</p><p>I never imagined he\u2019d be so intense; he projects such casual charm. Most likely, other women couldn\u2019t handle it, so he hides. He pretends to be gentle and tender, no darker feelings, no obsessive tendencies. He\u2019s been playing that violin so long, it\u2019s become the only tune he knows. But I don\u2019t just want his sweetness.</p><p>I want everything.</p><p>\u201cTell me about her,\u201d I say then.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I\u2019ve surprised him.</p><p>\u201cThe girl who made you like this. Before, you said you haven\u2019t felt this way since high school. I\u2019m guessing it didn\u2019t end well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt never does.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him until he shifts uneasily. Then he pushes out a sigh of mingled annoyance and capitulation. \u201cYou want to know how it goes, sugar? I\u2019m a black hole. I want and need and I devour their feelings, until they\u2019re empty, too. Nobody can satisfy me. And I drive everyone away in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re not actually with me. If you were, you\u2019d come to hate yourself...and me. Because you\u2019d see me reacting to other women, just like they did. Do you have any idea how hard it is not to reciprocate when somebody wants you and you can feel their desire coursing through you, sweet and hot? It\u2019s like a drug.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, I understand\u2014and the barrier isn\u2019t what I thought. He\u2019s not thinking about how wrong I am for him, or that I\u2019m too young anymore. It\u2019s not being with me that he fears; it\u2019s losing me. And I fall in love so hard that I see stars. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s my opinion: I don\u2019t care where you start the fire, as long as you bring it home to me.\u201d</p><p>Desperation wars with hope in his dark eyes. \u201cYou say that now. But it wears away at you. I\u2019ve heard it so many times, why aren\u2019t I enough for you? Why\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t compare me to other women, Jesse. That\u2019s not fair, and...I\u2019m not doing it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he begs, pained. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking lovely that there must\u2019ve been guys, but when I think about it, I could kill somebody.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me some time. Not long. Just...I need to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Thinking is bad.\u201d But I\u2019m teasing him. When I said I\u2019d move on, I meant after fruitless months...or maybe even years. I\u2019ve never been in this situation before, so I can\u2019t say with any surety when I\u2019d run out of patience. So if he needs a few days to consider where we go from here, that\u2019s fine.</p><p>And he knows this. That\u2019s a handy adjunct to his empathy; he can feel my amusement. His expression lightens to relief and appreciation. I don\u2019t have to worry about stupid fights with Jesse. He\u2019ll always know how I\u2019m feeling when I say something. It also means there will be no secrets, no quietly nursed resentments. I bet most women found that much honesty terrifying, but I\u2019m on board.</p><p>\u201cIf...when...we do this, just know...I\u2019m gonna be possessive as hell. I\u2019ll crowd you. I might annoy you. And I don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey. None of that\u2019s a surprise to me. If you start bugging me, I\u2019ll push back. I\u2019m not made of spun sugar and unicorn whiskers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo unicorns have whiskers?\u201d</p><p>I grin at him. \u201cThat\u2019s completely beside the point.\u201d</p><p>Jesse puts on a movie after that, and the air feels clear between us. We\u2019re not together, exactly, but we\u2019re in the sweet anticipatory stage where desire flares like a bottle rocket and lights the sky with promise.</p><p>At the midway point, he squeezes an arm around my shoulder. \u201cStop thinking about sex. It\u2019s distracting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guarantee nothing.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, he sleeps on the couch with me. I suspect his neck hurts in the morning because we drifted off snuggled up with his arm about me. Jesse rushes around getting ready, and I can tell he feels awful that he has to run, and he can\u2019t take me to work, but I don\u2019t have to be there for three more hours. So I hang out at his place until it\u2019s time for my shift, then I catch the bus as usual.</p><p>I come in through the employee entrance and draw up short when I step into the food court. Strangely, there\u2019s a man sitting at one of the tables, even though none of the stands are open yet. He\u2019s not eating, either, or reading a magazine. He\u2019s just...waiting. There\u2019s a niggling familiarity about him, but I can\u2019t place the memory\u2014and when I try, that old sharp pain surges forth. The last few days have been weird enough that I pull my radio out of my backpack. Better to look like an oddball than to be caught defenseless.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t need that, Shannon.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s with all of these guys knowing my name?! I stop, narrowing my eyes. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>From this distance, I can see that his skin isn\u2019t quite right, either, but it\u2019s not as bad as the old woman or the man who was following me at the market. He clasps his hands before him, like that will reassure me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to offer you a deal,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you I could restore all your lost memories? How much is that worth to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot,\u201d I answer, before I can stop myself.</p><p>Dammit. I just gave up some leverage.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d The man looks dreadfully pleased. \u201cAnd what if I told you that regaining your memories means losing Jesse Saldana forever?\u201d</p><p>Shit. Is that his price? I\u2019m familiar enough with the concept to realize I\u2019m being offered a demonic bargain. There\u2019s always an awful aspect to the deal, but they don\u2019t usually spell it out for you upfront.</p><p>Yet I don\u2019t even have to think about it. \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll handle the uncertainty. I won\u2019t live without Jesse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I told them you\u2019d say,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>When I turn, he\u2019s already gone.</p><p>Nine</p><p>The week ends without further complications. This makes me nervous because demons have been all up in my business, whatever that is. I imagine it\u2019s related to the memories I\u2019ve lost. Since they want Jesse as the price for getting them back, well, it\u2019s not happening. I\u2019ll deal with this some other way.</p><p>I don\u2019t see Jesse until the following Saturday, though he sends regular texts, so I know he\u2019s thinking of me. And I hope he\u2019s contemplating our situation. But I\u2019m trying not to be pushy. He has to want this as much as I do.</p><p>Early on Saturday afternoon, he calls me. \u201cI\u2019ll be at your place in half an hour. Pack a bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not moving in with you. What if the sex is terrible? I\u2019ll have to take all my stuff home again, and I\u2019m opposed to so much extra work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop trying to sidetrack me, woman. I know I\u2019m supposed to want to prove my prowess now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t you?\u201d I ask softly.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Shan. Later.\u201d He sounds equal parts amused and turned on. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a meeting with Twila tonight.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s the woman who runs Texas. I\u2019ve never met her, but I\u2019m told she\u2019s the most powerful person in the whole state, so far as the supernatural community is concerned. Whether you\u2019re a witch, warlock, wizard, Gifted, or demon, you owe Twila fealty. I probably should\u2019ve gone to see her when I first arrived, but I had other things on my mind, like not being homeless or unemployed.</p><p>\u201cDoes she know about my gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwila knows everything, but she\u2019ll ask a steep price for her information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can afford it, I\u2019ll pay. And...I\u2019m getting my stuff together now. Gotta go.\u201d</p><p>I hang up on him again, something that gives me inordinate pleasure. The background noise made me think he was in the car when he called, so I hurry through packing. I take enough for an overnight stay: clean panties, bra, fresh outfit. The combat boots I\u2019m wearing will work tomorrow, so I don\u2019t need extra shoes. Then I stuff my huge cosmetic bag into the backpack.</p><p>The weird thing is, I can imagine washing off my makeup before going to bed with Jesse. I can picture letting him see my naked face in the morning, the way other people rarely see me. In my mind, it\u2019s like when a Victorian maiden lets down her long hair only in front of her husband. There\u2019s a sexual component to it, a sense of stripping down with him completely. I want that. The other night, I didn\u2019t take my paint off, so it was kinda smeared when we woke up, but he was in such a hurry that I don\u2019t think he paid much attention.</p><p>I\u2019m waiting out front when he arrives. Waving, I jog toward the SUV, but he\u2019s faster, sliding across the hood to keep me from opening my own door. I find his eagerness adorable. He sets a palm to my cheek and kisses me softly, sweetly.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s a thousand words crammed into one. It\u2019s hello and how are you and I missed you and thanks for coming when I call.</p><p>I hear him. I hope I always do.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m as eloquent with my tone as he is with that sexy-as-fuck drawl, but he can feel my emotional response.</p><p>I watch his eyes melt. Deep down I highly suspect the women who left Jesse just couldn\u2019t carry his love, because it\u2019s a big, deep-swimming plesiosaur of a thing, and if you\u2019re not strong enough, it could swallow you whole. There\u2019s something I haven\u2019t told him, though. I\u2019ve spent my life with a hole inside me too, waiting for somebody who\u2019ll make me the center of his world\u2014and without trying to change me. It feels like nobody\u2019s ever loved me exactly as I am.</p><p>\u201cNot...sad. Wistful? Why?\u201d</p><p>I just shake my head and hop into the Forester. It\u2019s not time to be emotional. Since this is a road trip, I buckle up and fiddle with the radio. \u201cDoes Laredo have a non-country radio station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he teases. \u201cYou might end up with dead people instead of music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day, when you least expect it, I\u2019ll make you sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShan, you\u2019ll never make me sorry for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it impossible to stay pissed at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh. As if you were.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s got me there. I find some decent music, and Jesse doesn\u2019t object to what I like. Good sign. The drive to San Antonio passes with him teasing me, and I joke back. Every word has a flirty, playful undertone; it definitely qualifies as foreplay. But he quiets the closer we get to the city, and he\u2019s not talking at all by the time he pulls off the highway.</p><p>Twilight is situated in a seedy area, a strip on Main full of Goth bars and gay clubs. A few of them look like they\u2019d be fun. Does Jesse like to go dancing? Our destination occupies the corner, and it\u2019s built of crumbling brick. If Jesse wasn\u2019t leading the way, I\u2019d have no reason to head into such an unremarkable place. The only bit of color comes from a small purple neon sign that says Twilight.</p><p>\u201cThis is kind of a hub,\u201d he explains, opening the black metal door for me. \u201cWhere the Gifted populace can mingle, make connections. Sometimes there\u2019s work for hire. Other times it\u2019s just people cutting loose.\u201d</p><p>The floor is hardwood in need of refinishing and partially covered in faded carpet. On the walls, red lights glow in scalloped sconces, then there\u2019s this funky maroon striped wallpaper. Dark beams give the place a certain rugged charm. I like that it isn\u2019t pretentious. You could really settle down and drink here. Well, as long as you like the Dropkick Murphys, currently blaring from the jukebox.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever play anything else?\u201d Jesse asks the ginger-haired, freckled bartender.</p><p>The woman shrugs. \u201cThey\u2019re Twila\u2019s favorite band. Haven\u2019t seen you in here for a while. Everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less. Is she ready for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite. I\u2019ll let you know when she buzzes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s have a drink while we wait.\u201d Jesse orders a lime fizz, which is basically just lime juice and seltzer. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s thinking about the drive back.</p><p>I\u2019m not technically old enough to drink, but I wear so much makeup that bartenders rarely card me. They assume the paint is to cover wrinkles, I guess. So I say, \u201cCan you make me a Forbidden Fruit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing right up.\u201d I watch as she mashes the kiwi, adds sugar, Midori, sake, Zubrowka, and lemon juice. The resulting cocktail is fresh, fruity, and a delightful blend of sweet and sour. Jesse raises a brow at me, looking bemused, as I sip.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the girliest drink I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not even pink. I\u2019m sure Cosmos are girlier. Even a Tequila Sunrise looks more feminine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t do tequila.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor?\u201d I guess.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cMore than once, and I finally learned my lesson. The agave plant and I simply do not get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. For light drinking, you prefer a bottled beer, probably microbrew. And when you\u2019re feeling fancy, it\u2019s expensive Scotch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSmart-ass.\u201d Jesse leans in and kisses me. \u201cMmm. Forbidden fruit, so very sweet.\u201d His drawl kills me dead. Dead, I tell you, especially the way he stretches the word very. He goes on, \u201cBut yes. In beer, it\u2019s Flying Dog pale ale. For sipping, I prefer Chivas, if you\u2019re looking to buy me something nice.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cI doubt I can afford it on a Pretzel Pirate\u2019s salary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better find a higher-paying job if you intend to keep me in the style to which I\u2019ve become accustomed.\u201d</p><p>I absolutely love this exchange because the idea of me being Jesse\u2019s sugar momma is hilarious. Besides, he gets a cop\u2019s paycheck, so he\u2019s not used to a lavish lifestyle. I\u2019m giggling quietly as the bartender says: \u201cTwila will see you now.\u201d</p><p>Jesse takes my hand and guides me back, suddenly somber, and I take my cue from him. My first impression of the Queen of Texas is regal beauty. Her presence is powerful, making you want to drop to one knee in obeisance. I can imagine her seducing Mark Anthony or captivating Caesar on a barge drifting slowly down the Nile. She\u2019s tall, stately, with graceful shoulders and dusky skin. Her black hair hangs in beautiful braids, twisted together and caught in a golden snood. This only reveals her strong jaw and sculpted cheekbones. Right now, I realize I\u2019ve been staring too long, but she must be used to startling people with her majesty.</p> <p>Her office is equally impressive, all old-world elegance. I dip at the knee, unable to control the urge. Jesse bends as well, bowing before her.</p><p>And Twila smiles.</p><p>\u201cI wondered how long it would be before you lost lambs came bleating at me.\u201d Her voice is lovely too, mellifluous and rich with just a hint of tropical islands. \u201cSit, little one.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s clearly talking to me, so I obey, folding my hands in my lap like I\u2019ve been called out for disciplinary action. I\u2019m so nervous, more than when the old woman was trying to murder me. And what sense does that make? Yet the air feels thick, not with the dead, but...sentience. It\u2019s like no feeling I\u2019ve ever had before.</p><p>Before I can speak, she adds, \u201cLet me save you some time. You want your lost memories...and to know why the demons are involved.\u201d</p><p>Jesse was right; she does know everything. She\u2019s like that song, where Santa Claus sounds like a stalker. He sets a hand on my shoulder, obviously sensing my emotional state. Something about this room is freaking me out. My skin literally creeps, like when I was being watched at the mall, only not quite.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re more sensitive than most,\u201d she says softly. Then she whispers a few words, and the atmosphere lightens.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSent the loa away. Most people can\u2019t feel them.\u201d</p><p>Wow. The power she commands awes and terrifies me. \u201cYou were right about why we\u2019ve come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBut it will cost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout knowing what you\u2019ll charge, I can\u2019t say whether I\u2019m willing to pay.\u201d</p><p>Twila arches a brow, glancing at Jesse. \u201cI like this girl.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s good, right?</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re willing to talk terms,\u201d Jesse says. \u201cBut not before full disclosure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me spell it out. In return for my aid, Shannon Cheney will come to work for me. People occasionally leave this life without telling me what I need to know. It would help me immeasurably to have someone who can coerce answers from beyond the grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d I ask, before realizing that might sound offensive.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cMy loa can do many things, but they cannot pass to the other side. As I understand, nor can you. Instead, you call the dead back to you.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a fair assessment. I\u2019m about to agree to her bargain when Jesse presses on my shoulder. \u201cCan we talk in private for a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You have five minutes.\u201d She rises smoothly and steps out of the office, then I hear her moving away.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this, Shan. Your life wouldn\u2019t be your own...Twila will keep you on call twenty-four seven. And she won\u2019t have a reason not to kill people. It\u2019ll become more efficient to dispatch her enemies and question them after death. Can you imagine the toll it\u2019ll take on you?\u201d</p><p>Not to mention the jump in murder rate. I didn\u2019t think of that, but it makes sense. Twila doesn\u2019t run Texas by being gentle and generous with her rivals. I push out a sigh. \u201cThen I have to turn her down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>When she returns, I decline her offer with as much courtesy as I can muster. Whatever she thinks of this, she only inclines her head. \u201cThe offer will remain open until the situation is resolved, one way or another.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, that sounds ominous.</p><p>Once we\u2019re back in the bar, Jesse wraps his arms around me and pulls me close. \u201cTry not to worry. We\u2019ll figure this out. She\u2019s just trying to spook you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He rubs my back gently. \u201cI know, honey. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>The return trip is much quieter; I don\u2019t feel like joking around. Though it takes a lot to depress me, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that something major\u2019s about to go down\u2014and maybe I would\u2019ve been better off throwing in with Twila, who can protect me, even if she makes me do bad things. Yet I don\u2019t want to be an accomplice in her dark business, either. This would be the classic rock-versus-hard-place dilemma, and I get to be the squishy thing in the middle.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jesse says, as we exit the highway and drive through the dark Laredo streets toward his apartment. \u201cYou know I won\u2019t let anything happen to you, right?\u201d</p><p>I feel like saying I understand he\u2019ll do his best to protect me, but there are no guarantees...and I don\u2019t expect him to be my hero. I just want him to be the man in my bed. Hell. I\u2019ll eat a quart of ice cream if he makes me sleep on the couch again.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I manage to reply.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re scared. Sad. Confused, too, unless I\u2019m reading you wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that covers it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to make it better?\u201d</p><p>Despite myself, I grin. \u201cAre you really asking me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShan. I\u2019m being serious. Sex won\u2019t fix your emotional\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t hurt. It produces endorphins, you know, and those improve your mood. Doctors have proven that orgasms help with headaches, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can expect you to say, definitely tonight, baby, I have a headache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could stop at definitely tonight and you\u2019d be covered.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s easier for me to put aside the bad mood when he\u2019s smiling. My breath hitches a little when his dimple puts in an appearance, creasing his lean cheek. He\u2019s wearing cowboy boots, and I\u2019m discomfited at how hot I find him\u2014from the softly worn chambray shirt to the faded Levi\u2019s, down to those battered boots. He\u2019s all Texas sexy, and I\u2019m incapable of resisting him. To look at me, you\u2019d guess I go for thin, sensitive types with dyed black hair, partial to basements and bad poetry, but no. I\u2019ve never had an eye for pretty emo boys in guyliner.</p><p>Jesse parks the car, still amused. He grabs my bag from the back, then comes around to open my door. I follow him up to his apartment, which is even cleaner than the last time I visited. It smells of lemon furniture polish and...air freshener? Yep, there\u2019s a deeper citrus scent circulating.</p><p>\u201cAw, you got me a Glade PlugIn. You shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for you.\u201d He quotes back my words, and I wonder if he means them as fully as I did. My heart clenches a little at the possibility.</p><p>\u201cSmooth talker. Is my toothbrush still in the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>He draws in a sharp breath, as if he hadn\u2019t thought of it that way before. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s in the glass next to mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll get changed and wash up.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no way he can understand how momentous this is. I\u2019m going to take off my makeup before he sleeps with me. I\u2019ll sit and talk with him, barefaced. Naked. My heart is pounding so fast as I take my bag from him and head down the hall to the bathroom. I lean against the door, nervous but also excited. If I want everything from him, I must be willing to give it back.</p><p>Still, I take my time with my nighttime routine, and it\u2019s hard to work up the courage to step into the hall. With all of the kohl, eyeshadow, lipstick, and foundation removed, I look younger. I hope that doesn\u2019t deter him. I don\u2019t think I look like a kid, but he\u2019s not used to seeing me this way, either. He might not want the real me.</p><p>Please, want the real me.</p><p>Since I own no sexy pajamas, these are simple, a white top with huge blue polka dots, worn with matching shorts. I brush my hair one last time before I exit and head back to the living room. Jesse\u2019s already changed into baggy athletic shorts and a plain gray T-shirt. The soft cotton clings to his chest and shoulders to reveal a lean yet muscular build.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>God, I hope he doesn\u2019t turn on the TV. But I move toward the couch, head down. Jesse startles me by tugging me onto his lap. Well. That\u2019s a good start. Warm hands cradle my cheeks, forcing me to meet his gaze. He skims my face with dark eyes, silently rapt.</p><p>Then he whispers, \u201cI had no idea you were this beautiful, Shan. No wonder you wear camouflage.\u201d</p><p>Heat rockets through me, starting in my chest and working its way down until I\u2019m squirming on his thighs. There\u2019s no way I can survive wanting him this much. I\u2019ll go nova and explode in a cascade of lights, like the umbrella fireworks on the 4th of July. I tuck my face against his shoulder, trembling with the intensity.</p><p>\u201cBack home, there was a boy... Funny how clear I remember him when so much else is fuzzy. Late at night, we\u2019d sneak off to the woods. He said he loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar, if you think I want to hear this\u2014\u201d</p><p>I ignore him because he needs to. \u201cWe had sex, more than once. I liked it, but I didn\u2019t kid myself that it was anything special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit.\u201d His voice is a raw ache. \u201cI guess I\u2019m supposed to feel better about fucking you now, knowing I\u2019m not the first? So you\u2019re not untouched, I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point at all. I\u2019m trying to say, this is special. You are. And I\u2019ll never want anyone more than I do you.\u201d That said, I open the floodgates and let him feel...everything, how deep and far my yearning runs. It\u2019s an underground river, racing endlessly toward a sunless sea.</p><p>\u201cGod help me,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI can\u2019t stop this. Not again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d I\u2019ll leave if he feels strongly against it. Seducing him through my own desire is fine, but only as long as he won\u2019t hate me afterward. I want more than one night with Jesse Saldana. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot even a little bit.\u201d Abruptly, he shoves to his feet, swinging me up in his arms in the same motion. \u201cYou\u2019re coming to my bed tonight, sugar, and if you\u2019re good, I may never let you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re assuredly not going anywhere.\u201d He growls the reply into my ear.</p><p>In ten strides, we\u2019re in his room. Jesse\u2019s bed is made, a striped comforter tucked in around the pillows. He rips it back with impatient hands, then he turns to me. \u201cI want those pajamas off. Now.\u201d</p> <p>I remember him saying he was gentle and slow, but a hungry wolf shines out of his dark eyes. He\u2019s longed for someone like me, starved even. I don\u2019t need pretty words, flowers, or expensive dinners. I just want to learn the taste and scent of his skin. I want to drown in him.</p><p>Deliberately, I strip. Beneath, I\u2019m wearing only simple black panties, but his gaze sharpens. He takes in the body that I know is decent, if not spectacular. Somehow I manage not to cross my arms to shield my breasts. This is where I\u2019ve wanted to be for so long; I won\u2019t back down now.</p><p>\u201cYour turn, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen a man shuck his clothes so fast. His shirt goes flying, then he shoves his shorts downward. God, is there anything sexier than a man showing that sweet spot on his pelvis? I love the way his hip curves, slightly concave, with layer of muscle and jut of bone. I could start licking there and work my way to the center. Mmm. His underwear shows...everything. Damn. I\u2019ve never been this turned on in my life...and he hasn\u2019t even kissed me. Desire washes over me\u2014and Jesse\u2019s head falls back. A groan escapes him. A small damp spot appears on the front of his boxer briefs.</p><p>\u201cYou could make me come without touching me,\u201d he growls. \u201cBut don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen come here.\u201d</p><p>In answer, he prowls toward me and shoves me back on the bed. I bounce once, then he\u2019s on top of me. The sudden shock of his heat and weight on me spikes my urgency, and he feels it. I dig my hands into his back as his lips claim mine. It\u2019s a sirocco of a kiss, all heat and irresistible power. He tastes of lime and I, of mint, so our kisses are like mojitos, savored again and again. When he comes up for air, he studies my swollen mouth...and smiles.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s how it\u2019s gonna be, Shan. You\u2019re gonna take every stroke, one for every time you teased me, each time I went home hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to make you come until you beg me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t happen.\u201d I manage a hint of bravado. \u201cBut you\u2019re welcome to try.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s wild with me, just like I knew he could be. There\u2019s no gentleness at the moment, no good manners. Jesse pulls my panties off and then his own briefs. From his night table, he grabs a condom, and though I\u2019d like to put it on him, he tugs my hands away. Tonight, this is definitely his show. I shiver, hard. For good measure, he lifts my arms above my head.</p><p>\u201cLace your fingers together and don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to touch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you how it would be...this time.\u201d</p><p>Which tells me he\u2019s open to other things, later, but this must be a fantasy of his, one he\u2019s been afraid to explore with anyone else. So I lock my hands and nod. I think he\u2019ll just take me because we\u2019re both so damn hot, but instead he whispers with his fingertips, gliding, stroking, until I arch up off the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou want me so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty and slick. Later, I\u2019ll lick you, right here.\u201d A graze of his fingertips drags a moan from me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll enjoy that,\u201d I gasp.</p><p>I\u2019m panting, but I don\u2019t beg. Need will surely overwhelm him soon. We\u2019ve been fighting this for weeks.</p><p>\u201cYou know how many nights I yanked my cock, thinking of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Instead, he nuzzles and bites a path down my throat, over my breasts, past my belly and onto my thighs. Yeah, he likes using his teeth. When we\u2019ve been together longer, I can see him wanting to leave marks. God, he\u2019s so close; I can feel the heat of his mouth swirling over my hip. My whole body\u2019s trembling now.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be more often than I did,\u201d I whisper in an attempt to break him.</p><p>And...it works. His control snaps.</p><p>Jesse finally fills me in a long, hard thrust. It\u2019s all I can do not to grab on to him, but the restriction on my movement heightens the heat and tension. I can only work my lower body beneath him, so I wrap my legs around his hips. That makes him growl and push faster. Since he was on the edge earlier, I don\u2019t know how he can keep this up. Then he cheats like a bastard and opens himself to me. His lust hammers through me, along with chaotic impressions of how good this is: so much, more, faster, take, take, claim. My nails bite into my palms as I come.</p><p>And Jesse keeps his promise, somehow. The pleasure loops between us, and I swear he gets off too, but he doesn\u2019t soften. He pushes, grinds, until I\u2019m weak and shivering when he arches into me the last time, his teeth sinking into my shoulder. The pain sparks a soft, weak orgasm, just exhausted flutters. That\u2019s the sign for me to unlace my hands and wrap my arms around him, stroke his back. I\u2019d hold him like this forever, only he rolls away to dispose of the sticky condom.</p><p>But he comes back. I hope he always does.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Sunday morning with Jesse is a new kind of wonderful. We fix breakfast together and then turn on the sports channel. You wouldn\u2019t guess it, but I enjoy watching men celebrate their penises by knocking each other down and tossing things at each other. So I snuggle up with Jesse happily, wearing a white dress shirt that belongs to him instead of the pajamas he made me take off the night before.</p><p>Later, I\u2019m in the bathroom brushing my teeth when he comes in. He steps up behind me, wraps his arms about my waist and nuzzles my neck. I spit, drop my toothbrush in the sink, and turn into his embrace. Jesse lifts me up and carries me back to bed. We stay there for most of the day, and I only get up because it\u2019s getting late, and I need to shower so he can take me home.</p><p>\u201cNo regrets?\u201d I ask him, as I\u2019m climbing into his SUV.</p><p>\u201cOnly that you\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you how this would go, though, Shan. You\u2019re mine now, and I\u2019m very opposed to sharing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ll run into men who tempt me at Pretzel Pirate?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cWhen you put it that way...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to take from this. I\u2019ve been trying to hook up with you for weeks. Now that I have, you figure I\u2019m done, mission accomplished?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cNo thanks. I\u2019d much rather be your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Jesse starts the SUV, looking pleased.</p><p>And frankly, after the last twenty hours, he should be. I know I am. \u201cDefinitely. Or were you trying to talk me out of a relationship?\u201d</p><p>He leans over and kisses me. \u201cNo. You\u2019re in this now. I tried to be smart and sensible and let you move on to somebody else. Hell if that\u2019s happening now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anybody else.\u201d A surge of love rolls through me.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking like that, looking at me with those eyes, and I\u2019m carrying you right back up those stairs, Shan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get back. My work uniforms are at home.\u201d</p><p>Jesse bitches under his breath, giving me the first glimpse of how possessive he can be. But it\u2019s not like it comes as a surprise. He puts the vehicle in gear and takes me back to my apartment. I think he\u2019d like to come up, but that will just make it harder to say good-bye later, and I haven\u2019t talked to Maria about having overnight guests. If her boyfriend has ever stayed, I didn\u2019t see or hear him. So I feel like it\u2019s polite to check with her first. Plus, my futon isn\u2019t as big or comfortable as his bed.</p><p>He parks on the street and shifts to study me. \u201cWork\u2019s likely to keep me tied up this week. There are some things going on in the department. But if you have any problems, text me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t text you anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I do. I\u2019m teasing him. \u201cIf anything weird or scary happens, you\u2019ll be the first to know.\u201d</p><p>This is a little awkward because I don\u2019t know where to go from here. I can\u2019t seem to make myself get out of the SUV. Jesse kisses me again; this one is deep and lingering, his hands in my hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up Friday night at eight, sugar, unless there\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear something sexy, suitable for dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the perfect outfit.\u201d</p><p>After that, I hop out and head upstairs. There\u2019s no reason to feel so sad, like the minute we separate, he\u2019ll have second thoughts and I\u2019ll never see him again. He\u2019s not changeable like that. In fact, I\u2019ve barely gotten inside my front door when I get a text message from him.</p><p>I miss you already. Think about me this week, k? I\u2019ll know if you are.</p><p>Okay, that\u2019s kinda hot. I\u2019m smiling when Maria wanders out of her bedroom. She takes one look at me and grins. \u201cGood weekend, huh?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what she means until I peek at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. There are faint bruises on my throat, whisker burns on my cheeks and jaw. I\u2019m not wearing my usual makeup to cover it either. Damn. I can\u2019t believe I left the house without putting my war paint on. I can remember a time when I\u2019d have died before doing that. Like, the house could be on fire, and I\u2019d still apply cosmetics.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d I answer belatedly.</p><p>After checking to make sure I have a clean uniform for tomorrow, I crash with Maria and we have our Chris Evans marathon. During intermission, I ask, \u201cSo I\u2019m wondering about your policy on overnight guests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a rhetorical question, I take it. You finally bagged the hot cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make him sound like a deer I shot.\u201d I grin at her. \u201cBut yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen as long as he sleeps in your room and you\u2019re not too loud, I\u2019m fine with it. I\u2019d appreciate it if you don\u2019t send him out naked to rummage for food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect we\u2019ll be at his place more often, but I thought I\u2019d ask.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI appreciate the consideration. I\u2019ve had so many roommates who did what the hell ever. And the last one left without any notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat had to suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. But I\u2019m glad Chuch introduced us. I like you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s nice to have female friends. \u201cBack at you.\u201d</p><p>That night, I go to bed early and wake up in time to do some mundane chores. Our apartment doesn\u2019t sparkle like Jesse\u2019s, but it\u2019s not a sty either. I already have a message from him on my phone. He warned me he would crowd me, but it\u2019s not a needy, where are you, type text. Instead he\u2019s written, my bed was fucking empty without you. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Way to curl my toes before noon, Saldana.</p><p>I type back, you\u2019ll be good and hungry by Friday night.</p><p>He must\u2019ve gotten busy at work because he doesn\u2019t reply until after I\u2019m at the mall. If I last that long.</p><p>I\u2019m smiling up until the point where I reach Pretzel Pirate...and find Mark already behind the stand. He\u2019s frowning at me. \u201cYou\u2019re two minutes late.\u201d</p> <p>Vacation has not improved his temper. I want to protest that I\u2019ll still have plenty of time to open because it\u2019s not like it takes a full hour to turn on the machines, get the pretzels going, and put cash in the register. But men like Mark are petty dictators; that would only piss him off more. So I mumble an apology. And the day only gets worse from there.</p><p>Mark picks on me all damn day, bitching about every little thing. I\u2019m starting to understand why he can\u2019t keep employees. My annoyance builds to the point that Jesse actually texts me around four to ask, you all right?</p><p>Fine. Just pissed. My boss is an asshole.</p><p>Somehow I finish my shift, but the next day is more of the same. By two, I\u2019ve had enough. \u201cThis is bullshit,\u201d I say, interrupting his lecture. \u201cI did a great job while you were gone. I deposited all the money, balanced the cash drawer, handled all of the setup and break down. And now I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk off the job!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWatch me, fuckhead. I\u2019ll drop off these stupid uniforms tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Earlier, I saw a Help Wanted sign in a clothing store that sells really cool merchandise: funky graphic tees, studded wristlets and belts, earrings, skinny jeans, that kind of thing. The workers are all around my age; most have dyed hair or piercings and tattoos, also. If I could get a job there, it would be leaps and bounds better than Pretzel Pirate. I mean, it would still be customer service, but maybe I could earn back a fraction of my lost dignity. I\u2019m not applying dressed like this, though. Presentation matters in a shop like that, so I\u2019ll put in an application tomorrow when I return these stupid polyester pirate suits.</p><p>Grumpy, I take the bus home. Maria\u2019s not off work yet, so I throw myself down on the couch and watch Netflix. Around six, I fix myself some food and go back to watching feel-good movies. Half an hour later, somebody knocks at the door. Cautiously, I peer out the peephole and spot Jesse. It\u2019s only Tuesday, and he told me he\u2019d probably be busy until Friday. He holds up a carton of ice cream.</p><p>\u201cYou had a bad day,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I brought the chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest boyfriend ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d I step back to let him into the apartment.</p><p>He smirks when he notices I\u2019m watching Iron Man. \u201cMost girls would be watching chick flicks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just lump me in with all the other estrogen bearers? For your sake, I hope that you did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense intended. Tell me what happened?\u201d He pulls me into his arms, after I get a spoon.</p><p>And between bites of ice cream, I lay out my day. \u201cSo now I\u2019m unemployed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long, I\u2019m sure. If you need cash\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right there. Taking money from the guy I\u2019m sleeping with is beyond skeevy, and it will never, ever happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see your point.\u201d Before he can say more, his cell rings. Jesse pushes to his feet, listens, and then sighs. \u201cYeah. I hear you. I\u2019ll be there in twenty minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWork?\u201d I guess.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry. I thought things had settled, but it seems not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p><p>He hesitates, then shakes his head. \u201cIf I could say more, I would.\u201d</p><p>I remember he mentioned there was some kind of scandal with the partner he had before Stella, and he\u2019s still dealing with the fallout. \u201cI get it. Thanks for stopping by to cheer me up. And thanks for the ice cream.\u201d</p><p>He draws me up into his arms and kisses me until I\u2019m actually dizzy. \u201cI hate it when you\u2019re sad. See you Friday.\u201d</p><p>When Maria gets home an hour later, I\u2019ve eaten most of the chocolate ice cream. I regret nothing. I don\u2019t mention that I\u2019m now sans income; she might fret. We watch a little TV, then I head to my room to pick out an outfit for the job I intend to snag tomorrow. The store is a better fit for me, similar to Hot Topic but cooler.</p><p>At eleven, Jesse rings my cell. I expected he might text. A voice call seems special, fancier somehow, mostly because people don\u2019t bother anymore. I\u2019m snuggled into bed, wearing the jammies I took to his place. Smiling, I tuck the phone against my ear.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYou know the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s polite to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take care of things at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less. I put a patch on the situation anyway.\u201d His voice drops low. \u201cWish you were here, Shan. How\u2019s it possible that I already have a hard time sleeping alone?\u201d</p><p>That fast, I\u2019m turned on. He only needs to drawl the word hard and I\u2019m like, yes, green light, let\u2019s go. The chemistry between us has always been incendiary; he just didn\u2019t want to admit it. I suspect he gets that flash of heat, but my breathing quickens, too. I can\u2019t hide anything from him.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey. Really?\u201d It\u2019s like he can\u2019t believe that\u2019s all it takes.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d better get off the phone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s pretty clear what he\u2019s asking, and I don\u2019t really know how to do this, but I\u2019m willing to try. In the end, it\u2019s mostly sounds and sighs while we both work, slow at first, then faster, until I hear him moaning my name, and then I\u2019m gone, too. Gradually my heart rate slows.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d And I hear his need, his uncertainty. This is his gift to me.</p><p>I\u2019ll cherish it always.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>The next day, I wake up feeling off since strange dreams chased me all night long. Shaking that lethargy, I don my coolest outfit: striped stockings, combat boots, faux-leather mini, black lace peekaboo blouse with a corset vest over the top. I study myself in the mirror, then add chunky, funky jewelry. I take my time with my makeup. Fortunately, Maria goes to work earlier, or she\u2019d wonder why I\u2019m not a pirate today. Last thing, I bag up those fucking uniforms.</p><p>I take the bus and get to the mall by ten. Mark isn\u2019t even at the stand yet. Excellent. I don\u2019t want to see that asshole. I drop my stuff off behind the counter and hurry through the food court. Unfortunately, I run into Felix on the way. He seems really happy to see me.</p><p>\u201cHey, Shan, how\u2019s it going? Damn. You\u2019re looking hot today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I feel like saying, dude, I have a boyfriend. But even if I didn\u2019t, this is not on. It will never be on.</p><p>Yet that would be like kicking a puppy. So I listen to his chatter with a faint air of impatience. \u201cLook, it\u2019s good to see you, but I have a job interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He seems sad to hear that I\u2019m leaving our food stall hell. \u201cI won\u2019t keep you, then.\u201d</p><p>His downcast look goads me into adding, \u201cBut I\u2019ll stop by on my way out, okay? We can talk more then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great. I\u2019ll spot you a free Coke.\u201d</p><p>Be still my heart.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say aloud.</p><p>Steeling my nerves, I stride toward Toxic, the store where I want to work. The sign\u2019s still posted, so they haven\u2019t filled the position yet. Go big or go home, right? So I pull the Help Wanted notice from the window and take it inside with me.</p><p>I set it on the counter. The guy behind the register is hot, but not my type. He\u2019s the skinny, emo, guyliner sort, one who fits with me in theory. I guarantee he\u2019s nowhere near Jesse Saldana\u2019s level, however. This dude is the reason girls eat chocolate ice cream; he sure as shit doesn\u2019t bring it to them.</p><p>\u201cHire me,\u201d I say.</p><p>He skims me up and down, seeming to decide I\u2019ve got the right look. \u201cYou have to fill out an application first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it to me, then.\u201d I have to be careful not to let the attitude cross the line into bitch territory. I think I\u2019m standing right on the border.</p><p>He does, and I get out my pen. Hm. Chuch and Eva as personal references. I add Jesse too, though it\u2019s probably immoral to use your boyfriend in that respect. The rest of the app doesn\u2019t take long since I\u2019ve had exactly one job and I quit it yesterday. Once I\u2019m done, the guy skims my information.</p><p>\u201cPretzel Pirate, huh? I can see why you\u2019d rather work here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, Mark probably won\u2019t have good things to say about me. But I\u2019m a hard worker for anyone who\u2019s not a complete asshole.\u201d Hard to say if that\u2019s too much honesty.</p><p>Then the guy smiles. \u201cUnderstood. I\u2019m Nick, the assistant manager, so you\u2019ll need to meet Kim, too. She\u2019s in the back.\u201d</p><p>I end up having an impromptu interview with both of them, so it turns out I didn\u2019t lie to Felix after all. When I leave Toxic, I have a fucking job. I start tomorrow. Thirty hours a week to begin with, but the pay\u2019s a little better. I can still afford to cover my bills, at least, and I get to wear my own clothes. That was one thing Kim stressed; we need to look the part, making people want to be cool like us.</p><p>Keeping my promise, I head back to the food court. It\u2019s close to noon, so a few people are scattered at the tables, eating an early lunch. Felix waves at me as I amble toward him. His stand has no line, so he pours me a drink, then hands it over without his coworker noticing. It\u2019s sweet, but I hope he doesn\u2019t get in trouble.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering...\u201d</p><p>Shit, here we go. I have to shut him down politely. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a break coming up...and there\u2019s a car for sale in the parking lot. I was wondering if you\u2019d look at it with me.\u201d</p><p>Huh. That isn\u2019t what I thought he\u2019d ask at all. \u201cDo I look like a vehicular expert to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not why I want your opinion. I thought you could tell me if it\u2019s something girls would think is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. You want me to gauge its chick appeal?\u201d Poor kid. He\u2019s so clueless.</p><p>Felix nods. \u201cIf you have time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. You can walk with me out to the bus stop. I\u2019ll rate it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I don\u2019t have a lot of friends who are girls.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s been a good day. Not only did I get an awesome new job, I also avoided crushing Felix\u2019s dreams. Maybe he\u2019s not interested in me after all. I\u2019m happy to be his friend, as long as he\u2019s not secretly angling for more. That never ends well.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I beckon.</p><p>Once he calls that he\u2019s taking a break, Felix comes around the counter and walks with me to the exit. \u201cI think the car\u2019s pretty sweet, but my sister tells me I have no idea what\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll sisters say that.\u201d Or so I imagine, anyway. I have no siblings, unless my father is breeding as we speak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s this way,\u201d he says, leading me through the parking lot.</p><p>I imagine he spotted a car with a sign in the window; the owner must work at the mall. Then he wheels and punches me square in the face. I go down because it\u2019s so unexpected. The pain doesn\u2019t incapacitate me, but I can\u2019t process what\u2019s happening. I scramble backward beneath a car and roll out the other side.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d</p><p>Is he a psycho, or is this something else? I get a glimpse of his face between the cars as I run, and it\u2019s...odd, wavering. His skin shivers like his face doesn\u2019t fit right, and his eyes are swimming in darkness. Goddamn them. This isn\u2019t Felix. There\u2019s a demon in him, one that whispered about the car but didn\u2019t drive him out here. The thing knew I\u2019d notice. So this is the perfect ambush. I\u2019ve dropped my bag, and I scramble for my radio. I don\u2019t want to hurt Felix like I did the old woman. This isn\u2019t his fault; he was a target of opportunity.</p> <p>He lashes out. The kick connects to my shoulder, and my backpack bounces away. I need to learn how to fight; the dead won\u2019t always be able to defend me. My arm\u2019s numb now, too. Feels like he dislocated my shoulder. I crawl away, beneath a car, and then I scream. With my good hand, I dig out my phone and speed dial Jesse. I wish I had some mace, pepper spray, anything.</p><p>The call goes to voice mail as the demon grabs my ankle and hauls me out from under the car. My phone bounces away. I keep yelling and aim a kick at his junk, but he\u2019s too fast for me, even in a teenager\u2019s body. But my shouts have drawn attention; there\u2019s a woman getting out of her car, and when she sees what he\u2019s doing, she runs toward us, scrabbling at her purse. My vision goes blurry when he punches me in the head, trying to shut me up, but from the sound, I think she tases him. His body jerks, but it\u2019s not enough to drop him with the demon driving, so she hits the button again.</p><p>That time, he drops, twitching, and she helps me up. She\u2019s shaking, and I\u2019m one big mass of bruises, but alive. She just keeps saying, \u201cOh my God, oh my God,\u201d and that pretty much sums up my reaction, too.</p><p>A minute or so later, mall security arrives. The guy rolls Felix over, but he\u2019s stopped moving. The darkness swims in his eyes slower and slower, but nobody else seems to notice. Dread swells inside me, heavy as lead. He\u2019s just a kid, a dumb, sweet kid, who wanted to be an eye doctor. Fucking demons. And the worst part is, they even warned me. The other one said I wouldn\u2019t see them coming until it was too late. And while I survived, he was still right.</p><p>The guard takes the boy\u2019s pulse, then gazes somberly up at us. \u201cWhich one of you did this?\u201d</p> <p>Nervous, the woman hands over her taser. \u201cHe was attacking her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that, ma\u2019am. But it looks like the shock stopped his heart.\u201d He radios in, then starts CPR, but it\u2019s no use.</p><p>By the time the EMTs arrive, there\u2019s nothing left to do but call time of death. Jesse gets there ten minutes later, a perk of being a cop. Though I didn\u2019t leave much of a message, he got the gist from the police scanner. I\u2019m sitting on the curb wrapped in a blanket when he rolls up. He takes one look at me and rage goes off in his head like a bomb. I don\u2019t know if other people can feel it, but for me, it\u2019s a constant wash of red, lapping over me like lava.</p><p>Yet he\u2019s gentle when he pulls me into his arms. A few seconds ago, the EMTs popped my shoulder back into place, and they\u2019re trying to talk me into a trip to the ER, but I knew Jesse was on his way. I knew it. And the police still have questions. I\u2019ve done my best to answer them, but there are a lot of gaps in my story. They sense it, even if they aren\u2019t sure what they are. When they look at Felix\u2019s life, they won\u2019t find any sign that he was obsessed or stalking me. They\u2019ll see a normal kid, trying to figure out his life. The pieces don\u2019t add up, and only Jesse and me know why.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he whispers into my hair. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he can tell, somehow, that the demon didn\u2019t get out of the host before Felix died. I can\u2019t ask what that means for a demon. It makes me happy to imagine the thing trapped in his corpse, unable to muster enough power to move, now that the life force has gone. That\u2019s the most fitting prison imaginable, except that it cost this boy his life. The only reason he\u2019s dead is because the demons saw me talking to him. I feel horrible about it.</p> <p>Once we deal with the preliminary questions, Jesse takes me to the same clinic. At this rate, they\u2019ll think I\u2019m a battered wife. After a few X-rays, the doctor determines I don\u2019t have a concussion and I just need some rest and pain medicine. Afterward, Jesse drives me to his place; I don\u2019t protest. I\u2019m not up to facing Maria or explaining what the hell happened, especially since I\u2019m not sure myself.</p><p>Inside his apartment, Jesse draws me gently into his arms. The thump of his heart is reassuring beneath my cheek. \u201cI was so fucking scared, Shan. I know we\u2019re brand new, I know it\u2019s too soon, but I have to say it. I am crazy in love with you. Please don\u2019t ever make me feel that way again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>After that, he whispers not to worry\u2014I\u2019m safe. But I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever feel safe. I can\u2019t trust my eyes or my judgment. Since one demon failed, who\u2019s to say they won\u2019t send more? I can\u2019t live in a bubble, though. I have work tomorrow, and I\u2019ll be damned if I let them turn me into a cowering ball of fear.</p><p>\u201cI want to learn how to defend myself,\u201d I say then.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find a class for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that woman hadn\u2019t been carrying a taser, I\u2019d be dead. Or gone.\u201d</p><p>He swallows hard. \u201cI didn\u2019t do enough. I should\u2019ve put a protective detail on you after what happened at the shop. I knew it wasn\u2019t random violence, but I thought I could keep you safe on my own. But I\u2019m not with you all the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit. The PD has budgetary considerations. And based on the evidence, they wouldn\u2019t have judged my danger to be acute.\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cGoddammit. You\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes there\u2019s just nothing you can do, too many factors in play.\u201d If I worked for Twila, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. Felix would be alive, but others would be dead. I can guess and second-guess, but bottom line, this is where I am.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I need to tell you something.\u201d Jesse pulls back, serious as I\u2019ve ever seen him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dreamed of her last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe redheaded woman.\u201d</p><p>I freeze, unsure of what to ask. \u201cWhat...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were in Kilmer...and you were there, too. And we were in this old, creepy house, and you had a bicycle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. And there was writing on the walls, letters scratched into the windowsill in the attic. The red-haired woman ran into the woods, and I woke up.\u201d I\u2019m able to finish his description, because last night, I had the same fucking dream.</p><p>\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know. But I think she must be a real person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone we\u2019ve forgotten because of the spell?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, my head aching too bad to think on this any further. I\u2019m hurt. I\u2019m scared. But I\u2019m still here. I\u2019ll get stronger and I\u2019ll learn to fight. Whatever\u2019s going on, Jesse and I will figure it out together.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the answers,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got me. If it helps any, I checked on the woman from the store. She\u2019s non compos mentis but she\u2019s alive. And I saw on Area 51 that her shop will reopen in a few weeks. Some relative\u2019s taking over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does make me feel a little better, actually.\u201d I don\u2019t tell him that if I could, I\u2019d swap the shopkeeper\u2019s life for Felix\u2019s. She was old whereas he\u2019d only just begun.</p><p>He murmurs in my ear, \u201cYou need to rest, so we can go dancing on Friday.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I won\u2019t be up to it, but I\u2019ll try. And we\u2019ll probably fight over whether I\u2019m strong enough to start my new job tomorrow. I\u2019m not scared of arguing with Jesse, only being without him. So I\u2019ll muster my strength for battles to come. When he sweeps me into his arms and carries me to the bedroom, the future strikes me like an Impressionist painting, all my tomorrows blurring in a haze of pink and gold, because for me, that\u2019s heaven\u2014Jesse Saldana\u2019s arms.</p><p>And even with dark clouds rolling in, a storm on the horizon, there\u2019s no place in the world I\u2019d rather be. </p> </body></html>"]
