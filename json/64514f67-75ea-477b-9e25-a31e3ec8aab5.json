I stare at him with my mouth hanging open. \u201cWhat\u2019s not possible? At least tell me.\u201d</p><p>Cole leans close enough to kiss me, but he doesn\u2019t. My heart jumps. Those blue eyes are on me and my brain melts. His perfect lips form words and I can\u2019t take my eyes off of them.</p><p>\u201cUs. We\u2019re not possible.\u201d He licks his lips as he speaks. My eyes fixate on the movement. I think he\u2019s going to say more, but he doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>Disappointment leaks across my face. My heart is pounding and I don\u2019t even know why. The way he looks at me, the soft touches\u2014that kiss\u2014all of it says we\u2019re out of the friend-zone, but this utterly confuses me.</p><p>Cole sees it in my eyes, I know he does. But instead of putting my confusion to rest, he leaves it there. I feel hollow, like fragile glass, like I might shatter.</p><p>I want him to say it. I think about forcing the issue, but I can\u2019t. Blowing the relationship apart, banishing the pieces I have for the pieces I want, seems foolish.</p><p>The disappointment slides off my face. Cole crosses the room and sits in the blue chair. His dark hair falls forward, obscuring his eyes. Tension lines his shoulders and creases his brow. This relationship will break if I push him. Something is there, something hidden that I can\u2019t see. It holds him back. It makes him act like this.</p><p>I shift my weight in the bed and pull my knees into my chest. I don\u2019t take my eyes off of him. Cole feels my gaze and looks up. I manage to say, \u201cThen give me something else.\u201d My heart is pounding. \u201cYou hold me at arm\u2019s length with some things and then with other things, well\u2014\u201d I point both hands at the bed I\u2019m sitting in, \u201cJust give me something. Anything.\u201d The plea in my voice makes my stomach twist.</p> <p>Cole gazes at me from the chair, \u201cWhat do you want, Anna? No one is as close to me as you are. No one else shares my bed. Ever. It\u2019s been years since another woman walked through that door every night,\u201d he points toward the front of the house as he says it. Cole doesn\u2019t sound mean, but he does sound like I\u2019m asking for something he can\u2019t give.</p><p>My voice is soft, \u201cI\u2019m not asking for everything. I actually like this, even though it sounds insane.\u201d I wish it was more, but if it\u2019s this or nothing, I choose this. I lick my lips, watching him shift his weight in the supple chair. \u201cTell me something, something about you. We can trade secrets. Tit for tat.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s gaze narrows and a dark brow lifts, \u201cReally? You\u2019d be willing to answer anything I asked you? A complete revelation? No holding back? No areas off limits?\u201d He leans forward, placing his elbows on his knees. Cole shakes his head, but he smiles softly as he does it, \u201cI hardly think that\u2019s wise, Miss Lamore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf the things I do aren\u2019t wise, Mr. Stevens. As an act of good faith, you go first.\u201d My hands are pulling the sheet over my lap. My bottoms are nothing more than a lacy boy short.</p><p>Cole is bare-chested. Soft flannel pants hang from his hips showing off his toned body. His tanned skin is smooth and completely lickable. Cole wiggles in the chair as a smirk lines his lips. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good idea, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too tempting to refuse?\u201d</p> <p>He nods, \u201cLike so many things about you, it has the same seductive allure.\u201d The corners of my mouth lift and I look away. His gaze is too intense. Cole straightens and leans back in the chair, \u201cVery well, I\u2019ll play along, but it\u2019s only because I have a few questions that you aren\u2019t forthcoming with, and your logic is baffling at best\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ask, Cole.\u201d</p><p>He takes a breath, \u201cThe day you came to the internship interview, it was obvious that you didn\u2019t hold me in the highest regard\u2014\u201d</p><p>I laugh, \u201cI didn\u2019t like you, dude. You can say it.\u201d I lower my voice and bob my head as I imitate him, \u201cAnna detested me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think I sound like?\u201d he grins and shakes his head. Smiling,</p><p>I lift a brow at him and say, \u201cIs that your question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he becomes serious again. \u201cI am however wondering if I want to know the answer. It seemed like I disgusted you. I want to know why.\u201d Cole\u2019s voice becomes a whisper as he speaks.</p><p>I fidget in the bed. Swallowing hard, I look him in the eye, \u201cThe reasons seem stupid now. I didn\u2019t know you, then. I thought I did, and I was wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was hardly a personal answer, Miss Lamore. Care to elaborate?\u201d His voice is teasing, but I can hear the genuine curiosity there as well.</p><p>I press my lips together gathering my thoughts. \u201cI thought you were a sleaze, running a sleazy studio, groping girls in their underwear. Add to that your money and you didn\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe money made it worse?\u201d he asks, his fingers steepeled at his lips. Those blue eyes gaze at me, unblinking, waiting for an answer.</p><p>I nod slowly, feeling more exposed than I thought I would. \u201cYes, the money made it much worse. It would have been better knowing you were disowned.\u201d I straighten and kick the sheets off. Moving to the end of the bed, I flip onto my stomach and pull my feet up behind me, twisting my ankles together. I can tell he wants to ask more, but he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p><p>Cole seems nervous, but he doesn\u2019t look away. He leans to the side, resting his head on his hand. \u201cAsk me, Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the chick in the red dress?\u201d I nervously tuck some of my loose curls behind my ear. Ever since first seeing her, I\u2019ve wanted to learn who she was and what she means to him.</p><p>\u201cMy lawyer. She\u2019s been helping me prepare for something... unpleasant.\u201d His voice is cool and even as he says it. This wasn\u2019t the answer I expected. It\u2019s revealed more questions I don\u2019t have the answers to. But, whatever is going on, whatever Cole is dealing with, must be crushing him. The things that make him sound like that\u2014voice level to the point of apathy\u2014are the things that are the worst. Something bad is happening to him, something that requires legal advice.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I prompt.</p><p>\u201cAnd nothing more. I believe you were inquiring as to our relationship status. It is professional and always has been. The formality of our attire was for appearances only, part of a public display to help cushion what\u2019s coming.\u201d As he speaks, Cole\u2019s eyes take on a distant expression. The muscles in his arms tighten as his fingers fist. He tries to hide it, but he can\u2019t. Something\u2019s going to happen to him, something that I can\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d I want to fix it, I want to take away his burdens, but I don\u2019t know how. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s wrong. Attempting to lighten the mood I say, \u201cAsk me about Vanilla.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes dart up and meet mine. He holds my gaze and finally says, \u201cTell me why you prefer vanilla, Miss Lamore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna. Call me Anna, Cole.\u201d</p><p>His chest expands as he takes a deep breath and I openly admire him, my eyes drifting and lingering on his smooth skin. \u201cWhy do you prefer vanilla, Anna,\u201d he breathes my name and sends shivers down my spine.</p><p>A wicked grin twists my lips. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d The words roll of my lips and I\u2019m suddenly very aware of my tongue.</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes darken. The stubble lining his cheeks accentuates the strong lines of his jaw. He\u2019s gazing at me with a predatory look. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ex liked things plain and simple. I don\u2019t. I like things he didn\u2019t think were sexy. I like sticky, sweaty, slippery sex. I\u2019m not Miss Vanilla, Cole. I\u2019m the opposite.\u201d</p><p>Cole works his jaw as I speak; his eyes riveted to my face. He stares at my eyes, then my mouth. He sucks in air and tilts his head back as I speak. \u201cThe opposite?\u201d I nod slowly. My hair slides forward and I reach around and pull it to one side. Cole\u2019s eyes drift to my chest and the cleavage that becomes visible as I do it. Something changed, but I don\u2019t notice it yet.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say looking back up at him. Shrugging I add, \u201cI\u2019d just met you and was thinking I was a bit of a freak for even wanting what I want. It seemed like a strange thing to tell you, so I hid it and switched things around.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s tension sky-rockets as I speak, but when I say that I think I\u2019m a freak, he drops his hands and stares at me slack-jawed. \u201cHow could you possibly think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I wanted to do,\u201d my face flames as I choke out the words. Cole opens his mouth to ask more, but I shake my head. \u201cJust so you know, we\u2019re crossing my hell-no line, and whatever I ask you next has to be comparably horrifying. So tread lightly, Mr. Stevens.\u201d</p><p>Cole nods slowly as his lips pull into the sexiest smile I\u2019ve ever seen. Shaking his head, he says, \u201cI understand. And I promise I\u2019ll answer whatever you ask, even if it crosses my hell-no line, as you call it.\u201d I grin at him and waggle my eyebrows. Taking a deep breath, I pull up the sheet. I can feel the question building before he even says it. I want to hide behind the sheet. Cole\u2019s voice cuts through me and makes me melt. \u201cWhat do you want most that he wouldn\u2019t do?\u201d</p><p>A high-pitched moan travels up my throat. I don\u2019t want to tell him. I want to tell him. I clutch the sheet and cover my face. It sizzles as he asks; it burns because I know the answer. Cole stands, crosses the room, and pulls the sheet from my face as he kneels on the floor in front of me. We\u2019re nose to nose. I feel his breath on my lips as his gaze pins me in place. I can\u2019t look away. My pulse pounds in my ears and I shiver. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he says gently, taking my shoulders in his hands. His fingers swirl little circles on my smooth skin. He swallows hard, waiting.</p><p>Butterflies fill my body, making me giddy. His hands are strong and warm. I feel them pressing against my skin and I wish they were on my face, cupping my cheeks. As if he heard me, Cole lifts his hands and splays them on the sides of my face. His thumbs stroke my skin as his fingers slide back into my hair.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds silly, like nothing.\u201d My voice is light as a caress, barely audible. I watch Cole\u2019s lips as I say it. I can\u2019t look him in the eye and take the full on heat of his gaze. \u201cI wanted him to kiss me between my legs where no one has, taste me, swallow, and ask for more.\u201d Fear twists my stomach, sending a series of shivers cascading over my skin. I\u2019m clutching the sheet, strangling it. Whenever I brought up oral sex with my previous boyfriends they were ecstatic that I wanted to do that with them, but they felt no desire to reciprocate. It made me feel like wanting them to want it was dirty.</p><p>Cole releases my face a beat after I say it. He remains in front of me, but looks away. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing freaky about that, Anna. It\u2019s a normal sexual act and I\u2019m sorry he deprived you, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re into kinky things.\u201d He looks up at me, his expression soft and kind.</p> <p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s just an example, Cole. The thing I wanted most that he wouldn\u2019t do. I didn\u2019t say it was the kinkiest. That\u2019s the tip of the unfulfilled, sexually frustrated iceberg.\u201d My voice is husky and I can\u2019t look away.</p><p>Cole stares at me like he\u2019s never seen me before. The rosy glow that was limited to my cheeks now sears my entire body and he grins. \u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me\u2014let me make sure I got this right\u2014that a kinky sex goddess has been laying in my bed every night for the past few weeks?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I nod once. The way Cole looks at me makes me think it\u2019s okay, that things will be all right. He lowers his dark lashes and releases a breath slowly. His hands run through his hair tousling it even more. When he looks up at me, I can\u2019t breathe. Everything about him tempts me beyond control. I want to tangle my fingers in his hair and pull his mouth down on mine.</p><p>Cole shakes his head like he can\u2019t believe it and then sits back in the chair. It\u2019s my turn to ask a question. Internally, I\u2019m fighting over what to ask\u2014about the ring in the safe or why he won\u2019t touch me. Every inch of my skin prickles as I think about his hands on me. I wish he were close. I wish so much that he\u2019d tell me. While I want to know about the ring, I want to know this more.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you touch me?\u201d My voice is a whisper. I don\u2019t look at him. I expect his answer to punch me in the gut. I expect to hear, because he doesn\u2019t think of me that way, that I\u2019m too young, too inexperienced to be with him like that.</p> <p>\u201cAnna,\u201d he breathes my name like it haunts him. When I steal a glance, his eyes are closed and his face is in his hands. I turn away before he says it. I don\u2019t want to hear the reason. I\u2019m sorry I asked. As Cole opens his mouth to speak, I cut him off.</p><p>Raising a hand, I reach it out in front of me, holding up my hand and say, \u201cStop. Wait.\u201d Breathing hard, I look into his face. Remorse consumes him. I wish I could fix it. I wish he\u2019d let me hold him and take away whatever sins haunt his memory. Cole\u2019s lips remain parted, but he doesn\u2019t speak. He waits for me to finish. I sit up in the bed and pull my feet under me. \u201cI don\u2019t want know.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s quiet for a moment and the only sounds I hear are my racing heart and my ragged breaths. Then Cole says, \u201cThe answer isn\u2019t just one thing. I can\u2019t dismiss you Anna, but I can\u2019t make this more than it already is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Cole? Are we friends? This feels like more to me, but I can\u2019t wrap my mind around it. I don\u2019t understand how you can lay next to me at night without touching me.\u201d I feel the panic in my voice and try to shove it back down, but it won\u2019t recede. \u201cDon\u2019t lead me on. Don\u2019t make me think one thing and then do another. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cole crosses the room in two steps and scoops me up in his arms. He sits down on the bed with me in his lap and I rest my head against his bare chest. His heart is racing. His arms tighten around me before he kisses my hair gently. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my intention to lead you on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is your intention?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo protect you. To keep you from getting hurt. I thought that this was better, but it\u2019s not. I should have kept my distance, but I didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t reverse this Anna. I can\u2019t undo weeks of you sleeping in my bed and seeing your face every morning.\u201d</p><p>I glance up at him. Fear pinches my throat tight. \u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes are crystal clear and lock onto mine. I start to look away, but Cole gently pulls my chin back to meet his gaze. \u201cNo. Every memory of you, every moment was\u2014\u201d he presses his lips together and stops speaking for a minute. Finally, he breathes deeply and sets me down on the bed. \u201cI have to maintain my original boundaries, otherwise this won\u2019t work and I\u2019m not ready to say good-bye yet. It\u2019s utterly selfish, but it\u2019s the best I can offer.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t understand, but I don\u2019t say so. Dejected, I slide back into the bed away from him. What is this? Why won\u2019t he let me get closer? I lay my head back onto my pillow and stare at the ceiling.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing more to say.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Early the next morning, I slip away to the parking garage across the street to get my bike. It\u2019s safe, well, as safe as a parking garage can be. It\u2019s well lit and has a guard booth at the front, but it still makes Cole uneasy. If I park in one of his slots, below his building, he knows nothing will happen to me or my bike. After last night, though, I don\u2019t want to bring up anything that might torch our already precarious relationship.</p><p>Pressing my eyes closed as I reach the bike I sigh and press my fingers to my eyes. What relationship, Anna? There is no relationship. Correction, there is no sexual relationship. Somehow I\u2019ve ended up in the same goddamn boat I had been in with Edward. With that thought, the skin on the back of my neck begins to prickle, making me glance around, but I can\u2019t see anything except parked cars.</p> <p>I reach for my helmet and unlock it, pocketing the keys as I slip it onto my head. I fish a ponytail holder from my other pocket and work my hair back to the base of my neck and twist the piece of elastic in place. As I\u2019m fastening my helmet, I feel like someone is watching me. My skin prickles all over and my heart starts to race. I turn and look around, but I still don\u2019t see anyone. A car drives by and heads toward the exit. I can see the street from where I stand. The early morning traffic catches my attention with glittering red taillights and raucous horns blaring. Then I see him on the sidewalk. Edward. He sees me, waves and approaches me from the street.</p><p>Jogging over, he says, \u201cAnna, good to see you.\u201d Edward looks perfect. His jeans hug his slender hips and his long-sleeved pale-blue shirt brings out his eyes. But something puts me on edge. I can\u2019t say what, I just feel uneasy around him and want to get away as quickly as possible. But I can\u2019t seem to get my helmet strap tightened. Apparently, it twisted when I pulled it through the metal loops. I try to fix it without taking it off. I want to leave.</p><p>I nod and smile even though I don\u2019t feel like it. \u201cGood morning, Edward.\u201d I can be civil. There\u2019s nothing wrong. The fluttering in my heart and the panicked feeling telling me something isn\u2019t right is insane. This is Edward. \u201cWhat are you doing over here so early in the morning?\u201d I glance up, wondering where the security guard is. His booth is empty, and a car that\u2019s waiting for him decides to bypass payment and darts out into the street. It\u2019s quiet again. No car engines rumbling inside the sunken cement, no exhaust fumes clinging to the ceiling.</p><p>He shrugs and slips his hands into his pockets, \u201cOn my way to an interview up the street.\u201d</p><p>I arch a brow at him, \u201cWho\u2019s over here? I thought all these buildings were residential?\u201d The helmet isn\u2019t cooperating. I can\u2019t seem to get it untwisted. I undo the chin strap completely, pull it, and start over.</p><p>Edward\u2019s eyes fixate on my hands fumbling the helmet strap. \u201cIt is, but there\u2019s a\u2014\u201d he stops talking and steps toward me. He reaches for the black straps and says, \u201cHere, let me do that. You seem shaken up.\u201d</p><p>I want to jerk my head back, but I don\u2019t. Instead I stand there like an idiot and let him strap my helmet on. His fingers push the black strap through the metal loops and he pulls, tightening it. I grip my hands in front of my waist and try to slow my pulse.</p><p>When he finishes, he grins at me. When I don\u2019t smile back, he asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You seem out of sorts.\u201d</p><p>I want to say only around you, but I don\u2019t want him to think that he affects me. Besides, this doesn\u2019t make sense, any of it. Why is he here? What are the odds that he\u2019d walk in front of this garage at this time? Is he following me? I think I\u2019m being paranoid, but the feeling doesn\u2019t fade.</p><p>I turn away from him, smiling nervously and reach for the bike. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m just jacked up on caffeine. You know me.\u201d I lie and swing my leg over the motorcycle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do know you, Anna. And I\u2019m here if you need me.\u201d He glances at me on the bike for half a beat and adds, \u201cBe careful with this guy, Anna.\u201d He says it like he knows something I don\u2019t, like it\u2019s more than a general warning.</p><p>I wonder how he knows anything about me and Cole. It must have been Emma. She must have told him I was with Cole. Irritation shoots through me. I didn\u2019t think it was necessary to tell her not to discuss my love life with her brother, but apparently I was wrong.</p><p>I start the bike and say, \u201cI can take care of myself, Edward. And you better get to your interview or you\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, \u201cI\u2019m never late. I\u2019m still early actually.\u201d That was probably true. He is always early. It irritated me when we were dating. Everywhere we went, he had to arrive half an hour early. Edward looks from his watch to me and steps in front of the bike. He rests his fingers on the handlebars and looks up at me. \u201cJust be careful, okay?\u201d</p> <p>I nod at him, wanting this conversation over. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d Edward steps aside and I rev the engine and pull away from him. I can feel his eyes on my back until I\u2019m out of the garage and on the street zipping through early morning traffic.</p><p>I stop on the side of the Long Island Expressway and grab a cup of coffee. The morning air is cooler than usual. I breathe deeply, admiring the white fluffy clouds strewn across the sky. If I was still in high school, I\u2019d be drawing clouds today. I had one art teacher who was always excited when those fluffy white ones appeared. I didn\u2019t understand why until I tried to draw one. It turns out that drawing clouds is hard. Mine looked like floating bricks. There was nothing light and fluffy about them.</p><p>I pull out my phone and rest the coffee on my thigh. I won\u2019t have time to see Emma until this weekend, but I have to know if she told her brother about me and Cole.</p><p>I text her as I sip my coffee.</p><p>Me: Hey Em. Saw your bro. Did you tell him anything about Cole?</p> <p>A few minutes pass. Emma is in class. I don\u2019t expect anything back right away, but my phone dings.</p><p>Emma: No. That\u2019d be worse than talking to u about him. What happened?</p><p>Me: Saw him in the garage this morning. He warned me away from Cole. Wondered how he knew.</p><p>Emma: idk. I swear I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Me: OK. Just asking. Will u b around tonight?</p><p>Emma: Yup. Catch up then?</p> <p>Me: Hell yeah. Lots to tell u.</p><p>For a second I just stared at the screen. How did he know about Cole? And did Edward really know something about Cole, or was he just screwing with me? I wasn\u2019t sure, but it left me feeling very uneasy.</p><p>I poured the rest of the coffee down my throat and tossed the cup before pulling back into the traffic. Why I took the LIE is beyond me. It\u2019s always crammed with traffic this far west. Once I got out onto the Island a little ways, it would clear up. In the meantime, I bobbed and weaved between cars and trucks, passing the occasional driver who was horrified of motorcycles. One woman nearly drove into the wall trying to get away from me. I zip past her and feel the rush of early morning air on my face.</p><p>I refuse to let my mind play games with me. Edward\u2019s not a stalker. I dismiss my lingering apprehension from this morning and push it out of my mind, giving the situation with Cole full access to my entire brain.</p><p>Last night didn\u2019t go the way I planned. I want more from Cole, but I don\u2019t want to risk losing him. Finding out the woman in the red dress was his attorney doesn\u2019t make me feel better. At first it did, then I realized that if she\u2019s around that much something must be very wrong. I wish he\u2019d ask me for help or at least lean on me a little, but Cole is so closed off. He keeps his emotions close to his chest and it\u2019s hard to tell what he\u2019s thinking. But after last night, I did learn one thing\u2014I do mean something to him\u2014I just have no idea what.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>\u201cRegina, we have a full calendar today so I need you to fix the sets as we rotate through. That way as soon as the next client is here, we can start.\u201d</p><p>Regina looks up at me. Her copper hair dangles over her shoulders. The green top she wears makes the color more awesome and her crop pants are so cute. Like all Le Femme employees, she\u2019s barefoot. She nods, \u201cNo problem. Oh, there was a message from your school. They said they hadn\u2019t received your internship papers yet and they need them back by the end of the week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy tomorrow?\u201d My brows pinch together as I straighten and look at her. I drop the rug I\u2019m holding and stare at her. That\u2019s not right. The internship papers weren\u2019t due until two weeks after the internship was over. That is four weeks away.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Regina says. She looks up at me when she sees my expression. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Cole probably lost the papers or something.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly and go back to what I\u2019m doing, \u201cOr something,\u201d I say under my breath, trying to figure out what it is.</p><p>By the time I get to the campus, it\u2019s nearly 5:00pm. They\u2019ll close before I get to talk to someone. I glance at my watch. The line at the registrar\u2019s office is moving at snail speed. When I finally get to the front, I\u2019m really anxious and not looking forward to talking to some kid about the lost papers or why the university wants them back early.</p><p>I step up, ready to ask what the hell is wrong with them, when Jesse Oden looks up at me from the desk. \u201cCan I help\u2014\u201d he smiles when he sees me, his expression completely changing. \u201cAnna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesse? What are you doing here? I thought you graduated?\u201d The girl behind me audibly sighs and folds her arms.</p><p>He ignores her, \u201cI did. I\u2019m doing some grad work over the summer. Student job. So what do you need? Enrollment forms? Application for graduation?\u201d he guesses.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve done all that stuff already. I got a phone call today that said my internship papers weren\u2019t turned in. I thought they were due after the internship was over. I have two weeks left. Could you check my account and see what they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he smiles tapping the keyboard. After I tell him my student number, he\u2019s into my files. He grins, \u201cImpressive GPA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnoop,\u201d I laugh. He looks up at me and winks.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d he says, his finger tracing lines on the screen, scanning it quickly. His expression changes as he does so. He glances up at me and I can tell something\u2019s very wrong, but he says, \u201cYes, they want your papers early. There\u2019s a note here for me to hand them to you when you come in, and schedule you an appointment with the dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dean? What for?\u201d Everyone is watching me now. This isn\u2019t typical. Something is wrong, I just don\u2019t know what.</p><p>Jesse nods as he collects the papers I need from the slots on his desk. Taking the stack, he taps them once on his desk and shoves them under the stapler, then hands them to me. \u201cGet these back to me by tomorrow. And I\u2019m scheduling you for an appointment with the dean for tomorrow at 4:00pm.\u201d He hands me an appointment card. I\u2019m annoyed and worried. I just take it and don\u2019t look at it.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say and head out the door.</p><p>If I blow this internship, I don\u2019t graduate. I want to pull my hair out. I exit the building and find a bench. Sunlight pours through the leaves forming a lacy pattern on the ground. Taking my phone, I enter the appointment time for tomorrow and notice Jesse wrote a note on the back of the card.</p><p>Wait for me.</p><p>I sit under a tree and watch the students as they head toward their evening activities. About ten minutes later, Jesse walks out of the building and sees me. He smiles initially, but it fades quickly. He sits next to me on the bench.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s new?\u201d he asks teasingly.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! Is it that bad? I saw your face. Just tell me.\u201d</p><p>Jesse looks up at me and I can tell it\u2019s bad. His smile falters and he looks at his hands. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to say anything, but it seems too insane to be true. Your internship was ended early,\u201d he says softly. \u201cSomeone reported that you\u2019re having sexual relations with your boss.\u201d His dark brows creep up his face as he says it, looking at me like he can\u2019t believe it.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe. I feel like someone hit me in the stomach with a board. I lean forward, panic flooding every inch of me. Even though Cole and I don\u2019t have a sexual relationship, it looks like we do.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s true? I\u2019m guessing this is the guy who had your heart when I first met you, too\u2014isn\u2019t it?\u201d He sounds sympathetic. He places his hand on my back and pats once like a friend. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to go well if you tell them.\u201d</p><p>I sit up quickly and stare at him, \u201cThere is no sexual relationship with him. There hasn\u2019t been. It\u2019s been all work. Nothing else.\u201d My voice is soft, remorseful.</p><p>\u201cBut you wish it was,\u201d he adds, and I nod. Blinking hard, I look over at him. \u201cThank you. I know you\u2019ll get in trouble if they find out you told me. Did it say who made the allegation?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, \u201cNo. The complaint was filed directly with your dean. The info wasn\u2019t put into your main file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t happening,\u201d I clutch my face, horrified that I\u2019m reacting this way in front of someone I barely know. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, if nothing happened, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d I feel desperate and lost. He leans close to my face, tucking a curl behind my ear. Our eyes lock. He wants what Cole can\u2019t. Jesse breathes, \u201cI\u2019ll cover for you. I can tell them how we met that day on the beach. There were other people around. If you say that me and you are together, and deny your relationship with your boss, they should let it drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have you lie for me,\u201d I say, not looking away, not putting more space between us.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a lie,\u201d he says lifting his hand to my cheek. \u201cI haven\u2019t stopped thinking about you. I keep checking my phone, hoping you\u2019re over him\u2014and calling me.\u201d</p><p>I feel so lost, so alone. I need Cole, but that will just make it worse. The entire relationship with him made everything worse, including me. I want something with him that he won\u2019t give. I want his whole heart, but he won\u2019t let me in. Loneliness and fear mingle together and I can\u2019t stop looking at Jesse\u2019s lips. He pulls me to him slowly, gently pressing his mouth to mine. It\u2019s like last time. The kiss is sweet and chaste, asking me if I want him.</p> <p>Indecision flashes through my mind. I could try to hold onto whatever I have with Cole, but there\u2019s nothing there. Correction, there\u2019s friendship there and nothing more. We traded sex secrets and he didn\u2019t even look at me last night. I thought I meant something to him. The way he cradled me in his arms felt like I mattered, but I went to sleep alone and woke up alone. Cole didn\u2019t see me off this morning and didn\u2019t say anything else last night. Was it cheating to continue this kiss?</p><p>There\u2019s nothing between you and Cole, so how are you cheating? The voice inside my head snaps at me like I should know better.</p><p>Jesse\u2019s breath is warm, and the feeling of his hand on the side of my face is strong and perfect. He lingers by my lips, his lashes lowered, looking\u2014waiting for me to push him away. But I don\u2019t. I lean into the kiss, feeling a rush of emotions race by as I plummet off an emotional cliff and obliterate any chance of being with Cole.</p><p>Jesse\u2019s tongue slips past my lips and into my mouth. He strokes me slowly, like he\u2019s thought about this since the first time we met. I want to lean into him. I want to feel nothing, to let go of the weeks I\u2019ve spent with Cole, but I can\u2019t. I break the kiss and look down. Jesse\u2019s hands remains splayed on my cheeks, cradling my face. I can\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I just can\u2019t...\u201d my voice is shaky and trails off.</p> <p>He touches his forehead to mine, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to say anything, Anna.\u201d When he leans back, he drops his hands to his lap. He smiles at me sadly, \u201cI wish I had better timing. I wish I found you first.\u201d</p><p>I glance up from my hands, and try to smile, but I can\u2019t. Everything is pressing down on me, making me feel like a claustrophobe trapped in a coffin. I can\u2019t stand it. I want to nod at Jesse and act like he doesn\u2019t affect me, but he does. I stand and he does the same.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks, trying to catch my eye.</p><p>I mean to look up and nod, but a sob catches in my throat. Tears fill my eyes as I nod and cry, \u201cYeeees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you mean no.\u201d He steps toward me and says, \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go grab an early dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so nice to me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be your friend than nothing at all. Besides, it seems like you could use a friend right about now, anyway.\u201d He keeps his distance, occasionally brushing against my arm or directing me by my elbow, as we walk across campus and emerge onto the jammed streets. It\u2019s rush hour. He takes me into the first place he sees and we grab a table in the corner.</p><p>I dab my eyes with a tissue and look up at him. He\u2019s the only one who seems to want me, and I keep telling him no. What\u2019s wrong with me? Jesse is my age, my type, and I\u2019m pushing him away because I want something I can\u2019t have\u2014Cole Stevens.</p><p>\u201cSo, you want to talk about it?\u201d he asks, leaning his arms on the table.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about. Nothing happened with me and Cole. Nothing\u2019s happened the entire summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you wish it did?\u201d he says.</p><p>I nod. \u201cI thought there was something there, but I was wrong. When we talked about it last night, he pretty much told me no.\u201d</p><p>Jesse\u2019s face twisted with confusion. \u201cThen where\u2019d the complaint come from?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cNo idea. It\u2019s a slap in the face after last night. Honestly, you got further with me than I got with him.\u201d</p> <p>Jesse smiles. \u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>I nod and look up at him. \u201cIf I met you a few weeks ago...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cListen, if things fall apart, you risk not graduating. We need to focus on that. That\u2019s the main problem right now.\u201d I nod, agreeing with him. \u201cLet\u2019s assume that they find you guilty.\u201d My spine goes rigid as my mouth falls open.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but say things go to hell\u2014worst case scenario. You\u2019ll need another internship. Something where you can jump in and wrack up a ton of hours fast. Did you have a fallback?\u201d I nod. Sophia ended up being my second choice. \u201cI\u2019d contact that person if the shit hits the fan and the university scratches your hours, especially if that studio showed any interest in you. It\u2019s the fastest way to fix it.\u201d</p><p>I think about that for a second. I\u2019d be back where I was in the beginning, except Sophia would know I\u2019d chosen Cole over her. I wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d do with that. I nod and look up at Jesse across the table. I wonder why I can\u2019t let Cole go for him. I wonder if I do this to myself\u2014pick guys who are defective to prevent having a real relationship with them. It seems like a double strikeout, first with Edward and now Cole. Meanwhile there is a perfectly hot guy sitting in front of me, who seems genuinely interested in me. I sigh and lower my gaze to the table. I\u2019m such a head-case.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really the only option I have, right? Go back to Sottero and beg?\u201d I look up at Jesse to see him nod.</p><p>\u201cDo you have classes in the fall?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, I finished everything early by taking short courses last year. Usually people have their internship over the summer, come back and complete their classes. The dean let me flip them around so that I could walk in graduation at the end of August.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s your best bet. Go see the dean, deny the whole thing and hope it was just some jealous guy spewing crap. Maybe it won\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d Jesse waves at the waitress and she refills our glasses.</p><p>Sipping my soda, I ask, \u201cYou think someone did this to me on purpose?\u201d Who would do that?</p><p>Jesse shrugs, \u201cMaybe. Or maybe something just didn\u2019t look right. Is there anything that would have made someone think you were together?\u201d</p><p>My face flames. \u201cAh, well that answers that question. Listen, Anna.\u201d He leans forward in the booth and pats my hand to get my attention. \u201cThink of it as just another hurdle to jump over before graduation. No big deal. It\u2019s your boss that\u2019s going to catch hell for it, not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s against university policy to have a sexual relationship with your intern. Period. If they think he did it, well, I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019ll do, but since it\u2019s Cole Stevens I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll just get swept under the rug. Tabloids have been following him around for the past couple weeks. It\u2019s like they sniffed out something brewing below the surface with him.\u201d</p><p>As Jesse speaks I think about the woman in the red gown, his lawyer. Something bad was coming. Something Cole already knew about. My stomach twists and I wonder if he already knew about the accusations, if that\u2019s the reason why he won\u2019t touch me. Hope and dread flood through me, making me feel sick.</p><p>Jesse sees me pale. \u201cListen, you can handle this. Keep acting like it\u2019s nothing. Don\u2019t react until it hits the fan, okay?\u201d He squeezes my hand. I look up at him and nod slowly. There isn\u2019t a doubt in my mind that it already has and I\u2019m the last to find out.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>\u201cAnna Lamore is here to see you,\u201d says a woman twice my age. She looks up at me with judgment in her eyes.</p><p>The intercom buzzes back, \u201cOne moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a seat. He\u2019ll be with you shortly.\u201d She gazes at me briefly and then returns to tapping the keys on her computer. I slip into a seat and wait. Students come in and out, scheduling their appointments to make last second changes to their fall schedule.</p><p>The commercial carpet on the floor is pristine. It must be new. The walls are lined with commercial art -- if you could even call it that -- of large flowers in ugly vases. The pale mint green paint does nothing to add any warmth to the room either.</p><p>The big brown door in front of me cracks open and the dean walks out. Dr. Grillo is a vertically-challenged man, close to fifty years old with a dusting of grey scattered through his remaining hair. He wears a brown suit with a pair of loafers that have seen better days.</p><p>\u201cMiss Lamore,\u201d he calls my name and holds the door open. He doesn\u2019t smile at me the way he usually does and my stomach drops into my shoes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walk past him into the office. He closes the door and clears his throat as he makes his way to his desk. \u201cSince there is no easy way to begin this conversation, I\u2019m just going to jump right in.\u201d He sits behind an old wooden desk piled high with papers. He shifts his work to the side, folds his hands together, and looks at me sitting across from him. \u201cMiss Lamore, someone has brought to our attention that you may be in an inappropriate relationship with your internship supervisor. Is this true?\u201d</p><p>My voice catches in my throat, \u201cNo,\u201d I clear my throat and say it again, louder. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not true. Whoever told you that was misinformed.\u201d</p><p>The dean\u2018s shoulders don\u2019t slump with relief when I say it. \u201cAnna, we know you\u2019re an adult and can make your own choices when it comes to dating, however, when coupled with academia\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off. \u201cNothing happened.\u201d My hands are clutching the arms on the chair so hard that my knuckles are turning white. I don\u2019t let go. This has me so angry that I can\u2019t stand it. \u201cCole Stevens has been an excellent supervisor. My internship is going well, which is why I can\u2019t understand who would say this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been sleeping with him?\u201d He asks me pointe blank.</p><p>I don\u2019t think he means it literally, so I shake my head, \u201cNo. We do not have a sexual relationship. This is ridiculous! Graduation is too close for me to start over. You have to believe me.\u201d I\u2019m pleading with him. It hurt that Cole rejected me, but this makes it even worse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to, Anna, but the person who brought this matter to our attention has proof that you did stay at Mr. Steven\u2019s residence on multiple occasions.\u201d</p><p>My skin prickles as I realize what it means\u2014someone has been following me. All those times I felt like someone was watching me, I thought I was insane, but now I\u2019m angry.</p><p>\u201cSo, let me get this straight, Dr. Grillo. Someone provided you with proof that we were having sex. Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d I\u2019m at the edge of my seat, ready to bounce out of it. Fury is fuming silently inside of me, threatening to explode. This is so wrong.</p> <p>\u201cPlease Anna, calm down. It\u2019s enough to have your internship pulled and have Mr. Stevens reprimanded. We cannot allow even the appearance of indiscretion when it comes to academics. You know this, Anna. Do you want people questioning your grades? Do you want them to say your class rank had nothing to do with your mind? They will -- especially with regards to you. You\u2019re at the top of your class. I\u2019m sorry Anna, but we can\u2019t let this slide. You\u2019ll have to find another internship and start over in the fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that means I won\u2019t graduate until December.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is nothing I can do about that. The internship is a requirement for graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I get another internship and complete the requirements in the next three weeks, can I still walk in August?\u201d I don\u2019t breathe. I didn\u2019t want it to come to this, but this is what it came to.</p><p>The dean leans back in his hair and looks at me like he feels sorry for me. \u201cIf you can complete the requirements, then yes.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly. I don\u2019t know what to say. It hurts that my words don\u2019t matter, that the appearance of a relationship was enough to damn me. A question crosses my mind, \u201cHave you spoken to Mr. Stevens yet?\u201d</p> <p>Dr. Grillo nods, \u201cYes. He knows the repercussions for such an accusation.\u201d I wait for him to explain, to tell me more, but he doesn\u2019t. Instead he stands and says, \u201cGo to the registrar\u2019s office, get new forms, and if you manage to talk someone into an internship now, file the papers directly with me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Emma isn\u2019t home yet. I move around the tiny apartment, wandering like I\u2019m lost. I don\u2019t know what to do. Jesse was right. My internship with Cole is void and I have to start over. Nerves choke me, but I have to do it\u2014there are no other options.</p><p>Dialing her number, I wait for Sophia to pick up. \u201cSottero Studios,\u201d she says, even though she has caller ID and knows exactly who it is.</p><p>\u201cMs. Sottero, this is Anna Lamore. We met earlier this summer at an internship interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Anna. How can I help you?\u201d Although that\u2019s what she said, her voice sounds clipped, like she doesn\u2019t want to waste more time on me.</p><p>\u201cI need an internship. I\u2019m willing to work every waking moment for the rest of the month.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cWhat happened? Did Cole fire you? I told you to avoid that man, but you didn\u2019t listen. Why should I take you now?\u201d</p> <p>That is a good question. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cI should have listened to you. I\u2019m sorry to have bothered you. You\u2019ve been more than kind. Thank you for your time\u2014\u201d I feel dejected and embarrassed.</p><p>She cuts me off, \u201cOh, don\u2019t be so melodramatic, Anna. It\u2019s not the end of the world, it\u2019s an internship. Come to my office tomorrow morning. Bring the papers. We\u2019ll get you started. How many hours do you need to log before the end of August?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree hundred and twenty,\u201d I say cringing.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt\u2019s wedding season. We can knock that out in a couple of weeks if you\u2019re willing to work 18-hour days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Be here at 8:00am.\u201d After giving me final directions on attire and locations, she hangs up.</p><p>I hold my phone in my hand looking at it. Nausea washes over me. It feels like I stabbed Cole in the back. It\u2019s necessary I tell myself. Cole will understand.</p><p>The key scrapes the lock and Emma pushes through the door. \u201cOh, my god. Has hell frozen over?\u201d She glances around the room and then back at me with a grin on her face. \u201cAre you actually going to sleep in our apartment tonight?\u201d</p><p>Emma should have been the only one who knew where I have been sleeping. Leaning on the counter I ask, \u201cDid anyone ever talk to you about me? Ask where I was sleeping?\u201d</p><p>She tosses her purse on the couch and sits down like her knees broke. \u201cNo. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I told her everything and she listened with her mouth hanging open. \u201cNo fucking way. What did Cole say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he already knows,\u201d I say. \u201cHis lawyer\u2019s been around a lot lately.\u201d I press my lips together to keep from saying more. \u201cI need to go see him.\u201d I head toward the door.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>By the time I get to Cole\u2019s apartment, it\u2019s nearly midnight. I walk through the front door and call his name. When I don\u2019t get a response, I make my way through his house and find him sitting in the blue chair in his bedroom. A glass of amber liquid is in his left hand. His dark eyes look more black than blue. He sits in the shadows with the lights off.</p><p>\u201cCole,\u201d I say, and he looks up at me in the doorway. I linger there for a moment, afraid of what will happen when I tell him, but from the look on his face I suspect he already knows.</p><p>\u201cMiss Lamore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d I correct and walk to the bed and sit on the edge across from him. \u201cI suppose you already know.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me blankly. Nerves slither over my skin and make me shiver. Finally he says, \u201cThe University told me that you\u2019ll no longer be working for me. Is that your decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a decision, Cole. I need an internship to graduate. If I don\u2019t do one, the last four years mean nothing.\u201d My voice is higher than usual. Panic spreads through me. He doesn\u2019t want me to leave, but I have to.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who decides, Anna. Not them.\u201d He swirls the contents of the glass and stares at me like I stabbed him in the back.</p><p>\u201cMy decision would have been to be with you. My decision would have been to have you touch me. My decision would have made the accusations true.\u201d The words pour out of my mouth and don\u2019t stop as I rise and step toward him. \u201cBut my decision doesn\u2019t seem to matter.\u201d I stand before him with my hands on my hips. Cole stares up at me.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for depriving you, Miss Lamore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna.\u201d</p><p>The way his eyes bore into me steals my breath. \u201cBut I make decisions and stick with them. I will not touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Then don\u2019t.\u201d Turning on my heel, I mean to leave, but he grabs my wrist.</p><p>My pulse skyrockets as he speaks. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he breathes inches from my lips. The way he says it sounds sexy, like that\u2019s all he thinks about. He steps forward and I back into the bed. \u201cSit,\u201d he says and I comply.</p><p>The intensity of his gaze and the way his body moves, like he wants to crawl across the bed and take me, makes me shiver. I don\u2019t speak. I can\u2019t. The entire thing seems surreal.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>Any restraint Cole kept in check snaps. His lips gently brush against mine and I melt. My stomach flips inside of me and I want to tangle my fingers in his hair, but he pulls away. His hands are splayed on my face. He presses his forehead to mine and sucks in a ragged breath, before stepping away from me and back into his chair. I don\u2019t know why he left, what he\u2019s doing. He relaxes a little, and grips the sides of the chair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My body aches for his touch. I\u2019m wound so tight that it feels like I\u2019m coming undone. \u201cCole, you can\u2019t leave me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re up to the kind of things I like to do.\u201d Cole tosses back the rest of his drink and leaves the glass on the table next to him. \u201cAnd I have no intention of pressuring you. You\u2019re too young for me, Miss Lamore. There\u2019s no way this will end well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d I say breathlessly. My eyes lock with his. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care how old we are or aren\u2019t. I know you want me. I can feel it. I can see it in your eyes, in the way you look at me.\u201d His lips part like he\u2019s going to say something, but he doesn\u2019t. He watches me as I crawl back onto his bed and lift my shirt over my head. I wiggle out of my pants and sit half-dressed on his bed. He watches me, his eyes drinking in every inch of my body. I kneel there, letting him look before saying, \u201cShow me what you like.\u201d</p><p>Cole remains still, slouching back in the chair like he doesn\u2019t care that there\u2019s a naked woman on his bed, but his eyes say something entirely different. They are dark, and threaten to devour me.</p><p>Cole blinks slowly, like he made a decision. His voice is even, unemotional. He breathes normally, like I don\u2019t affect him. \u201cLean back against the headboard, and part your legs.\u201d His tone is firm, commanding. It makes me feel afraid and excited. My eyes are locked on his face. I can\u2019t look away. Pushing myself up, I lean back against the headboard and part my legs. He can see between my legs from where he\u2019s sitting. My heart slams into my ribs as my stomach swirls with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cSlip your bra off,\u201d he commands. I reach around and unhook the bra. Cole watches carefully, taking in the sway of my breasts. When my hands are over my head, I realize how much he likes to watch. I slow my movements before tossing the bra to the floor, letting him look. \u201cNow the panties,\u201d he says.</p><p>I lift my bottom, and slide them down my thighs. I lift my legs, pulling them out of the leg holes one at a time. I pick up the bottoms and toss them to him. Cole catches them and presses the scrap of fabric to his face and breathes in. The action shocks me so much that I gasp. Cole glances up at me and smiles that predatory grin he has sometimes. It makes me shiver, but I\u2019m not backing down. I want him and this is what he wants. I part my legs, spreading them wide. Cole\u2019s eyes are locked on the sensitive flesh between my legs. I press myself back against the headboard, arching my body as I do it. His eyes drift to my breasts and then my face. His eyes lock with mine.</p><p>\u201cTake one hand and spread your lips. Take the other and run a single finger over your clit, barely touching it.\u201d His voice slides over me. His words make my face turn bright red. Cole watches me, his arms folded, his gaze hot. My left hand parts my lips and my breath hitches. I lower my gaze when my right hand is on my clit, but he says, \u201cWatch me, Anna. Don\u2019t look away.\u201d</p><p>I stroke my clit and look into his eyes, \u201cYes, Cole,\u201d I purr his name and blink slowly. My hand moves between my legs stroking the sensitive skin again and again, never taking my eyes off of him. My body flares to life, the lower parts of me tingle with anticipation, wanting more. My hips lift slightly, meeting my hand.</p><p>Cole sits across the room. He leans back in his chair, his hands on the arms. He breathes deeply, and leans forward watching me, not breaking eye contact. When my hips start to buck, he says, \u201cOnly move your hand, Anna.\u201d Cole\u2019s voice is hard, commanding.</p><p>I watch him as he says it and notice his gaze darken. He watches me move my hand across my body, stroking myself slowly. I try not to move and find it difficult. If he suggested doing this, I would have been mortified, but in the moment, it feels sexy and I don\u2019t want to stop. My fingers move against my slick flesh with Cole watching, his gaze taking in every slow blink, every hitched breath as I fight to keep my senses and not come.</p><p>Cole\u2019s gaze shifts between my eyes and the place between my legs. He watches as my muscles tense, and I try to remain still. I have trouble keeping my eyes open. I want to close them and lose myself in the steady heat that\u2019s building between my legs, but Cole changes things. The onslaught of sensations flooding through my body overwhelms me. I want to do anything he says, I want to hear his voice telling me what to do. It\u2019s hard to stay still, but Cole\u2019s eyes pin me, so that only my hand moves.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d he says. \u201cHarder.\u201d</p><p>My hand develops a quick rhythm moving between my legs. Wet heat throbs inside of me, begging for release. Every inch of my body is corded tight. My stomach twists into knots as Cole watches me. The way he sits there makes me think he doesn\u2019t care, but his eyes say something else.</p><p>The damp heat spreads as my fingers stroke the skin between my legs. My mouth parts and I\u2019m breathing hard. I fight my body as it wants to move, and buck my hips into my hand. I\u2019ve never wanted to be touched so much in my life, but Cole doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>Instead he says, \u201cStop.\u201d My hand stills and I\u2019m shaking. \u201cPinch your clit. Hard.\u201d</p><p>My fingers grip the nub and press together. Air rushes out of my throat in a high pitched moan. I can\u2019t think. I can\u2019t talk. I want Cole to fuck me until I can\u2019t walk. I want to feel him inside of me, pushing against me. The pressure on my clit is tormenting me and I realize that I\u2019ve closed my eyes. When I reopen them, Cole is standing over me.</p><p>I\u2019m trying so hard to stay still, but I can\u2019t. My muscles are twitching on their own, making my hips move the tiniest amount. Cole grabs me by my ankles. He yanks me until my feet hang off the end of the bed. Crossing my ankles, he forces me to flip over. I lay face-down on my stomach gasping, with Cole between my legs, standing at the foot of the bed. Before I can say anything, I feel a hand across my ass. He strikes me and it stings, sending jolts of electricity through my pussy. I yelp and look back at him.</p><p>Cole says, \u201cA little mistake gets a little spanking. Two more, Lamore.\u201d</p><p>I relax and put my face down on the cool sheets. I purr and his hand lands on my bare skin again. I gasp and my knees threaten to give out. I want him. I can\u2019t stand him teasing me like this. By the time the final strike comes, my body is ready for it. My hips buck as his hand connects making him strike me harder.</p><p>Cole pulls me until my hips are hanging off the bed. \u201cSpread your legs.\u201d I part my ankles and feel the cool air rush between my lower lips. Before I have a chance to breathe, I feel Cole\u2019s hand on my back, pushing me into the bed. His hand slides lower, down to the small of my back. I remain like that, with my ass in the air, hoping he\u2019ll fuck me.</p><p>Cole brushes his jeans against my ass, allowing me to feel his excitement. I want his hard length inside me. I bite my lip to keep from calling out. I can\u2019t see what he\u2019s doing, but I felt his hands on me, between my legs. He strokes me gently a few times, feeling me, learning every inch of me. He grips my clit hard and I start to lift off the bed, but his hand is still on my back and holding me down. \u201cDon\u2019t move, Lamore.\u201d</p><p>As he speaks, I feel warm breath across my soft, damp skin. I shiver. He\u2019s going to kiss me between my legs. The heat of his tongue makes me gasp, but I stay still. He licks me from my ass to my clit, his broad tongue sweeping over every inch of me, caressing every soft fold. My hands clutch the bed to keep from screaming. I want more. I can\u2019t stay still. Then his tongue is inside me, thrusting deeper, tasting me. He shifts his hands until he holds my hips and pulls me down harder on his face. Rocking me slowly, he builds a rhythm that I can\u2019t ignore. His tongue licks and sucks me, tasting every inch of me, driving me wild until my body is coiled so tight I can\u2019t last another second.</p> <p>\u201cCole!\u201d I cry as I shatter, coming in his mouth. His lips don\u2019t pull away. His tongue licks my tender skin, tasting me until he is finished.</p><p>When he lifts his head, Cole steps back. My arms are weak, shaking\u2014but I manage to roll myself over. My heart feels like it exploded. I try to speak, but only huffs of air come out. When I look at Cole, his gaze isn\u2019t readable. He lifts me onto the bed, gently laying me on the pillows next to him. I am completely naked, sucking in ragged gasps, trying to stop and gain some semblance of control. But Cole just watches me. He lays on his side, bare-chested, above his jeans. His gaze lights a trail over my abdomen as he trails his finger from my navel to my neck.</p><p>\u201cCole,\u201d I moan his name, not wanting him to stop.</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d he whispers in my ear, making me shiver. When I finally come back to myself, I gaze up at him.</p><p>\u201cThat was the sexiest thing anyone has ever done to me.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything. Cole just slips his gaze over my body taking in the slight sheen of sweat and sliding his finger over my curves. Finally, he says, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d</p><p>Taking his hand, I push myself up on my elbow and look him in the eye, \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, it was a mistake. I have trouble refusing you. Please forgive me.\u201d He sits up and pulls his hand out of mine. Crossing the room, he places his hands on his dresser and doesn\u2019t look back at me.</p><p>My heart is pounding hard again, reacting not to excitement but the regret that floods his voice. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut there is. There is so much.\u201d He turns and when he looks at me fear crawls up my throat like an icy hand. \u201cI think it\u2019s best for both of us if you complete your internship and seek employment elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d It feels like I a sucker-punch. I sit there, pulling up the sheet to cover me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>Anger flashes in my eyes, but Cole doesn\u2019t look away. Grabbing my clothes, I pull them back on hastily. \u201cFine.\u201d My voice is flat. \u201cI\u2019m done with this. I\u2019m done with you.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>I cried my eyes out for the rest of the night and it shows. Sophia Sottero looks like perfection next to me with my puffy eyes and dark circles.</p><p>She gives me a once over in my black skirt and white blouse. It was the same outfit that Cole told me was too formal for work. \u201cAnna dear, you look like hell frozen over. If you want to work eighteen-hour days, you can\u2019t stay up doing god-knows-what the night before. For the next three weeks, you\u2019re mine. No one else. Understand? Tell this boyfriend he\u2019ll have to wait, because I won\u2019t have this.\u201d She gestures to me like I\u2019m disgusting.</p><p>Offense flows through me. I don\u2019t look that bad, but I also don\u2019t look perfect, which Sophia obviously demands. I nod, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She puts her hands on her hips and says, \u201cGood. I\u2019m glad we understand each other. Now, go grab me a cup of coffee\u2014two creams, no sugar\u2014and bring it to my desk. You\u2019ll do that every morning.\u201d I nod, realizing I\u2019ve been demoted to gopher.</p> <p>Thoughts of Cole flood my mind as I try to adjust to working with Sophia. She\u2019s anal OCD to the max. If I think about her too much she makes my eye twitch. Later that afternoon, another intern found me in the ladies room.</p><p>\u201cYou have been in here way too long,\u201d she says zipping around the room, washing her hands and drying them before running for the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? It\u2019s barely been three minutes.\u201d</p><p>She glances back at me, her dark eyes wide. \u201cI know. Hurry up or she\u2019ll bite your head off.\u201d</p><p>After washing my hands, I emerge from the rest room.</p><p>\u201cMs. Sottero wants you in the shooting room,\u201d says another intern. She glares at me like I\u2019m irresponsible.</p> <p>I head to the shooting room and kick off my heels as I walk through the door. Sophia looks over at me, her dark eyes darting to my feet and then back to my face. \u201cShoes are required at all times, Anna dear.\u201d She sighs and walks toward me. \u201cIt appears that I\u2019ll be unteaching what Cole has taught you. Assuming nothing, all right?\u201d</p><p>I slip back into my shoes and nod. I don\u2019t like the way she speaks about Cole. I sense some unspoken resentment there, but I can\u2019t put my finger on what exactly. A bride and her entourage arrive a few minutes later. I become a coat rack. Then I help dress the bride, pulling corset strings and making sure she looks perfect. I fan her train. I bring her water. I do everything that Regina does. Sophia doesn\u2019t trust me with the lights or the camera. I groan internally. This is going to suck.</p><p>Sophia snaps her fingers in my face, \u201cWake up, Anna. Really.\u201d She scolds. \u201cFan her train again and give her back her flowers.\u201d</p><p>When I hand the bride her flowers, I notice she\u2019s fidgeting - which seems to irritate Sophia. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYes, the top of my foot is itchy. I think it\u2019s from the petticoat. It keeps tickling me.\u201d She moves again trying to get the itch. When she can\u2019t she looks up at me, \u201cCould you do it?\u201d</p><p>That sums up the rest of my first day at Sottero\u2019s: scratching feet, fetching coffee, and being all around slave labor. Sophia is kind enough to remind me before I leave that this internship position is not paid.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>It is late by the time I walk through the front door. Emma is sitting on the couch with Jesse. Surprised, I stop in my tracks and look up at him. \u201cHey,\u201d I say.</p> <p>Emma waves at me, \u201cHe came by about an hour ago. I told him to wait for you.\u201d She pops a chip into her mouth.</p><p>Jesse stands and walks toward me. \u201cI hope that was okay.\u201d He says, uncertainty lining his face.</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the papers for the new internship come through the office. Actually, I was the one to enter them into your account. I assume things with the dean didn\u2019t go well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d I say, taking off my heels and rubbing my feet. The idea of shoving those on again tomorrow sounds horrifying. \u201cThey scrapped my hours with Cole and made me start over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Anna. I know how much you were dreading that.\u201d</p><p>I try to sound like it\u2019s a good thing, but don\u2019t quite manage it. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I originally wanted this internship anyway. Life has a funny way of sorting things out. I just didn\u2019t belong with Cole, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Jesse looks up at me. We gaze at each other for a beat, before I look away. \u201cUh, let\u2019s go back here to talk, so Em can watch whatever\u2019s on TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can leave. Damn, just say it Anna.\u201d Em says getting up.</p><p>\u201cSit down, grump. Eat your chocolate. You\u2019re acting like the PMS Troll again.\u201d Jesse\u2019s eyes go wide as I toss Emma a Hershey bar.</p><p>She catches it and laughs. \u201cSorry. And thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I say, and indicate Jesse should follow me. As he walks into my room, I say, \u201cNow don\u2019t get the wrong idea. The apartment is really small and for some reason you know more about me and Cole than Emma does.\u201d</p><p>Jesse nods and looks around for a place to sit. He chooses the chair in front of my desk. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was an invitation for a booty call.\u201d He grins. \u201cI\u2019m not that dense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I like you.\u201d I peel off my jacket as I talk and put my shoes in the closet. Jesse watches me. He dangles his arm over the back of the chair.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he says, looking at me shyly. It\u2019s a very different gaze than the intense looks Cole gives me.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I reply and smile weakly at him. The corners of my mouth fall and my worries can be seen plainly on my face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, Anna. You can do this. Think of the time with Sottero like trying to sit through Peters\u2019 class if it was a short course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about the only thing that would be worse.\u201d Professor Peters was so boring I never even noticed Jesse sitting in front of me. I had to drink two Red Bulls to keep my head from hitting the desk. Thinking about Sottero, I say, \u201cShe\u2019s nothing like I thought she\u2019d be. Cole let me shoot...on my own. Sophia has me getting her coffee and scratching people\u2019s feet. Feet, Jesse.\u201d</p><p>He nods sympathetically. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve heard.\u201d He pauses for a second, leans toward me. His gaze falls to the floor and then back up to my face. \u201cYou know, there have been some interesting remarks about her when all the internship papers are handed in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>He smiles at me, and I get the feeling he\u2019s telling me stuff I\u2019m not supposed to know. \u201cNothing you can\u2019t handle, not after putting up with Stevens. Sottero can be thoughtless and pushy. The interns didn\u2019t feel they really got a hands-on learning experience. It was more like going through the motions to get to the next phase of life. But on the bright side, Sottero\u2019s name is gold. You\u2019ll get a job when you\u2019re done without a problem.\u201d</p><p>Pulling off my thigh-highs from the toe, I wad them up and toss them on my bed before sitting down hard. \u201cI had a job. It was a great job.\u201d</p><p>Jesse asks, \u201cIt sounds like you miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d I glance up at him.</p><p>Jesse glances at his watch. \u201cI should get going. I just wanted to stop by and make sure you were okay.\u201d</p><p>I nod and stand. \u201cBetter. Today was definitely better than yesterday.\u201d Yesterday, when Cole jerked my emotions around like it didn\u2019t matter. Yesterday, when I finally gave up on him even though I didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Sophia snaps her fingers at me, \u201cAnna, dear, we must hasten.\u201d</p><p>Hasten? Really? Sophia Sottero is like Mary Poppins on crack. She smiles widely and makes everyone love her, well, everyone who doesn\u2019t work for her. It seems like the interns scatter when Sophia is around. She\u2019s constantly snapping her fingers and smacking people with newspapers and magazines like they\u2019re wayward puppies. It\u2019s getting on my nerves, but I made it through a week. Jesse was right. I can do this. The shorter time span meant longer hours each day, but it meant less days as well.</p><p>I jog toward her and she frowns at me, snatching the prop out of my hand, \u201cDo not run.\u201d</p><p>I smile and nod. I want to tell her that she\u2019s friggin\u2019 crazy and then quit, but I can\u2019t. I deal with her the best I can. If I was stuck here permanently, I\u2019d bash my brains in.</p><p>My mind drifts back to Cole. That night on his bed still floods my dreams and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it\u2014about him. Sophia is telling the bride how stunning she is and it sounds sincere, but she sneers when she turns to take the other camera in my hands. It\u2019s clear she thinks the girl looks like a train wreck, but when she turns back around Sophia is all fake compliments. I get tired of this. Day after day, it\u2019s the same thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I finally ask, after a shoot one afternoon, \u201cWhen will I be allowed to assist with the lights? Or a shoot? Or tag along to a wedding?\u201d</p><p>Sophia turns slowly and looks at me like I\u2019ve said something funny. When I wait for an answer, she places her hand over her heart and says, \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re serious. You think you\u2019ll get to shoot. How sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I thought I\u2019d get to shoot. You told me over the phone that I\u2019d be doing all of these awesome things, and I\u2019m not doing any of them. I\u2019m not learning anything.\u201d Sophia has me sorting extension cords and wrapping them with zip ties. A large orange cord dangles from my wrists as I speak.</p><p>\u201cI told you about the things you would do if you were hired here. I wasn\u2019t referring to the internship, dear.\u201d When Sophia says \u201cdear\u201d she really means \u201cidiot.\u201d</p> <p>Remembering the conversation, I shake my head. \u201cNo, I specifically recall you telling me to intern with you\u2014that Cole couldn\u2019t teach me the things you could. Then you went into detail about what those things were. Bundling extension cords wasn\u2019t on the list.\u201d I sound snitty, but I don\u2019t care. I feel like this was the biggest bait and switch I\u2019ve ever fallen for.</p><p>Sophia steps toward me, her stiletto heel clicking on the tiled floor. \u201cCole, is it? Not Mr. Stevens?\u201d She arches a brow at me. When I say nothing, she smiles as if she knows how hard I\u2019ve fallen for him. \u201cDo yourself a favor and get over him.\u201d</p><p>I hate the way she\u2019s talking to me. I smirk, \u201cI\u2019ve never been under him and I don\u2019t plan on it, so there\u2019s nothing to get over. He was just more casual in how he conducted his business.\u201d</p><p>Folding her slender arms across her chest she says, \u201cI see. And tell me, Anna dear\u2014did he keep you around? No. He fired you like all the rest. Every year it\u2019s the same thing; interns calling up, crying their eyes out that Cole Stevens fired them. Please hire me, Ms. Sottero.\u201d She tilts her head at me, \u201cI would have thought you had more sense.\u201d</p><p>I never told her that the university was the reason I didn\u2019t finish with Cole. I can\u2019t reply without making it known, so I just look away.</p> <p>\u201cThought so,\u201d she says, and saunters away, spewing verbal vomit at the next client.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>After two weeks of non-stop Sottero I want to rip my ears off and my nerves are shot to Hell. Jesse offers to meet me at the bar on the way home. Still wearing my work clothes, I see him standing outside waiting for me. He looks good, wearing dark washed blue jeans and a black blazer. When he turns his gaze in my direction, his eyes slip over my tight skirt and sheer blouse. My jacket is over my arm. I would have thrown the shoes away on the subway, but walking barefoot in the city was a surefire way to contract cooties.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d I say, when I get close enough. My entire body wants to fold in half.</p><p>Jesse grins and takes my jacket. \u201cThat bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse,\u201d I say heading for the door. \u201cTake the worst thing you can imagine and multiple it by a hundred. Then add the word idiot to the end and that sums it up. I plan on getting completely and totally drunk. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be responsible for me for the rest of the evening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, but won\u2019t Sophia go crazy on you if you show up with a hangover?\u201d He holds the door for me. I look into my purse, trying to fish out my ID in the dim light. There are a few people in line in front of us.</p><p>I shake my head, \u201cNope. Tomorrow is Sottero-free. I have the day off. My only day off, so I plan on getting every annoying thought of her out of my head so I don\u2019t accidentally claw her face off Tuesday morning.\u201d</p><p>Jesse laughs. \u201cYour eye is twitching again.\u201d</p><p>I feel it flutter and press them closed, listening to Jesse chuckle. His arm wraps around my shoulders and pushes me forward. When I look up, I hand my ID to the guy at the door. He nods and let us pass.</p><p>The bar is dark and fairly crowded, but there are so many people in Manhattan that, at times, I go weeks without seeing a familiar face. I don\u2019t expect to see him sitting there at the bar, hunched over a drink. When Cole looks up, his gaze makes my heart convulse. My feet don\u2019t move. Whatever Jesse was saying is lost.</p><p>Cole\u2019s gaze slides from me to Jesse, to Jesse\u2019s arm at the small of my back pressing me toward the bar, and Cole. I stiffen and feel Jesse\u2019s gaze on my face. He follows my stare across the room as he asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. Instead I watch Cole get up and toss cash on the bar. He walks toward me and I\u2019m caught in those sapphire eyes. There\u2019s nothing else there. There\u2019s no bar. There\u2019s no Jesse. There\u2019s no Sophia making my life hell. It\u2019s the way it was last time we were together. It\u2019s all tension and tingles. It\u2019s all sweaty thoughts and scandalous surges of lust.</p><p>Cole stops in front of us. \u201cMiss Lamore,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I don\u2019t correct him. I try to steady my voice even though my heart is beating wildly. \u201cThis is Jesse.\u201d</p><p>Cole turns his gaze to Jesse. \u201cMr. Oden.\u201d</p><p>Jesse finally figures out who this is, \u201cWow, Mr. Stevens.\u201d He sounds like a star struck teenager.</p><p>Cole glances at me once more and says, \u201cSo this is what you\u2019re doing now?\u201d</p><p>Smirking I say, \u201cThis and Sottero. Bet you wish you could watch.\u201d</p><p>When I say Sophia\u2019s name, Cole\u2019s eyes snap to mine. I have no idea what possessed me to say it, except I don\u2019t like his innuendo and I can\u2019t let it alone. Saying I know how he likes to watch seems harmless enough, but I know he does. Remembering the way his eyes moved across my body the last time I was with him is enough to make me damp just thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken, Miss Lamore.\u201d His tone is flat, like he couldn\u2019t care less. \u201cGood night.\u201d Cole walks out the door without a backward glance.</p><p>My entire body is strung so tight it feels like my head will burst. Jesse takes my hand and pulls me to the bar. He waves down the bartender and orders us shots.</p><p>\u201cSo, that was Cole, the guy who\u2019s been giving you a mind-fuck since before we met?\u201d Jesse asks and I nod.</p><p>The drinks are placed in front of us. I\u2019m not a heavy drinker and I know that if I swallow that I\u2019ll fall out of my chair, but I\u2019m not thinking. I take the tiny glass and throw back the contents. It burns my throat as I swallow and I open my mouth wide.</p><p>Jesse watches me and laughs, \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink a lot. I like to be in control of things, and being drunk is kind of the opposite.\u201d I glance at him. \u201cI usually drink wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many glasses \u2018til you fall over?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, \u201cThree, maybe four.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, \u201cWell, no more shots for you. Part of this therapy is venting and you can\u2019t do that if you pass out after one shot.\u201d He orders me wine. Grateful, I take the glass and sip it. \u201cSo rant. Pick one, because now I suspect Stevens is going to be part of what\u2019s driving you crazy. If he looked at you any harder, he\u2019d need a condom.\u201d</p><p>Grimacing at him, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, are you blind? Did you not see that back there?\u201d Jesse\u2019s brows shoot up his face and he points to the spot where Cole stood. \u201cHe wants you bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I told him I was doing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks for that one, by the way. He\u2019s probably waiting for me outside so he can chop my nuts off.\u201d</p><p>I spew my wine and try to use the tiny napkin to wipe it up. \u201cHe is not. He\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like what? A guy? Anna, I may be wrong about other things, but not this.\u201d He switches to beer after doing the shot. \u201cHell, I don\u2019t even\u2014\u201d</p><p>Taking his jacket lapels in my hands, I pull Jesse toward my mouth. His lips land lightly on mine. Shock silences him and I feel his lips move against mine. When he pulls back he\u2019s grinning, \u201cYou always make guys stop talking that way?\u201d</p><p>I smile softly and down the rest of my wine. \u201cWait until you see what I do later.\u201d I waggle my eyebrows at him.</p><p>Jesse is too sweet for his own good. He takes my hand. \u201cAbout that, I don\u2019t mind being your plaything\u2014I mean I\u2019m actually really excited about it\u2014but let\u2019s keep it to one thing at a time, okay? Check off your list in order. Number one: Get drunk. Number two: Get home. Number three: Kiss Jesse good night.\u201d</p><p>Smiling at him I say, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the rebound guy.\u201d The softness in his voice and the way he looks at me makes me think he wants more than that, when I\u2019m ready to give it.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cDefinitely not. The more I\u2019m around you the more I can see that you\u2019re worth waiting for.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>I no longer know what I\u2019m saying. My heart spills over my lips as Jesse alternates between walking me home and carrying me home.</p><p>\u201cI just want to be with someone who likes me the way I am. It seems like such a major thing.\u201d I stumble and Jesse holds my elbow, righting me. I glance at him and the streetlights continue to spin. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>He smiles at me and helps me along, occasionally saying soothing words. It finally dawns on me that I shouldn\u2019t be saying this stuff to him and I grow quiet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare at the sidewalk, at my feet as we walk. I\u2019m barefoot. My thigh highs are in my right hand. I don\u2019t really consider where I step. Jesse steers me around things that might puncture my feet.</p><p>\u201cPenny for your thoughts?\u201d he finally asks as we walk up my front stairs.</p><p>Leaning on the door, I turn back to him. \u201cWhy\u2019d I let him do it? Why did I let him get to me like this? I can\u2019t get him out of my head. He\u2019s always there. His voice is always there echoing inside my mind.\u201d I glance up at him and say what I\u2019m thinking. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot. Sottero is right. She calls me Anna Idiot, you know, and she\u2019s right. Only a total idiot, I mean a prime, grade A, kind of idiot would fall in love with a guy twice her age who doesn\u2019t even like her. How am I supposed to deal with this? I don\u2019t even know what to do, Jesse. There was no relationship. No breakup. There should be nothing to get over, but I feel like I\u2019ve had my guts ripped out.\u201d</p><p>As I speak, I slide down the door and sit on the front stoop. It\u2019s nearly 3:00am and New York is as sleepy as it\u2019s going to get. A couple walks hand in hand down the street, their faces close as they whisper to each other.</p> <p>Jesse sits next to me and runs his hands through his hair. \u201cAnna, you had a relationship. It\u2019s normal to feel something when it\u2019s over. It doesn\u2019t matter what he says, I see it when he looks at you. He wanted you. He wants you still. I have no idea what\u2019s holding him back, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not happy about it.\u201d I lean on his shoulder and he puts his arm around me.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to be the rebound guy? All sex, no strings attached?\u201d</p><p>He laughs, \u201cYou don\u2019t want a rebound guy. They have herpes.\u201d</p><p>This pulls a smile to my lips and I look up at him. He\u2019s grinning at me. \u201cJust wait a little longer. Deal with one thing at a time. Wait out Sottero, then deal with the rest.\u201d I nod, accepting his plan, because I don\u2019t know what else to do.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p> <p>The knock on my bedroom door sounds like cannon fire. I groan for Emma to go away, but she comes in anyway. Crossing the room, she quickly flicks on a light. I bury my head under my pillow.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t babe,\u201d she says and sits on the edge of my bed. \u201cYou need to get up.\u201d The tone of her voice is wrong, even with the mind-splitting headache, I can hear it.</p><p>Glancing out from beneath the covers I ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She hands me a newspaper, but I don\u2019t understand. I sit up slowly and grab my head. The paper slips off my lap. Emma picks it up and gives it to me again. \u201cLook, Anna.\u201d</p><p>I force my eyes to focus and see a picture of Cole. The headline says MULTIMILLIONAIRE COLE STEVENS IS RUINED. My heart lurches as I clutch the paper and gasp. Turning to Emma, I ask, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p> <p>She has that look on her face that parents have when they have to tell their kid that their puppy died. My stomach churns and I feel sick. She takes my hand like I\u2019ll need her support. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It says that Cole was in a lawsuit and settled. His properties were awarded to the other party as part of the settlement. Le Femme is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I can\u2019t think. I can\u2019t breathe. Wildly, I try to read the article, but my eyes won\u2019t focus. \u201cWho\u2019s the other party? Who\u2019d he settle with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia Sottero.\u201d</p><p>The name smacks into me like a frying pan. \u201cWhat? Sophia? How? What does it say? I can\u2019t fucking see!\u201d Tears sting my eyes and even the headline blurs.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have all the details, but it sounds like they\u2019ve been in a dispute for years and Cole finally settled to keep it out of court. His assets are going to be liquidated to pay off the settlement. It looks like a rape charge that was hushed. The article claims the nature of the attack was private and Sottero didn\u2019t comment to the paper this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why she gave me the day off.\u201d I rub the heel of my hand into my eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>Emma sits next to me and says nothing. Her hand is on my shoulder, then she just looks at me with sympathy. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d The question makes something inside of me snap.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I scream in her face. \u201cHe didn\u2019t fucking touch me!\u201d</p> <p>She holds her palms up, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t know how to ask and after reading this... forgive me, but I saw the way he looks at you. I just want to make sure you are okay.\u201d</p><p>There it is again, that same phrase\u2014the way he looks at me. I shake my head and instantly regret it. \u201cHow does he look at me, Em? Like an intern? Like a student? Like he can\u2019t stand the sight of me?\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head and snaps back, \u201cNo, Anna. Like he wants to tie you up and fuck you. Like he can\u2019t get enough by just looking at you. Like he won\u2019t stop if you ever give him the chance.\u201d She spits out the words like they\u2019re poison. Each one makes me feel more lost than I already am.</p><p>Near sobbing, I say, \u201cHe never looked at me like that.\u201d</p><p>Em smiles and shakes her head. \u201cHe looked at you like that every day.\u201d</p><p>Her words are too much. Tears spill down my cheeks and Emma\u2019s tone softens, \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t mean to dump this on you first thing, but it gets worse.\u201d</p><p>Wiping the tears from my eyes I ask, \u201cHow can it possibly be worse?\u201d</p><p>She turns to the page with the full article on Cole\u2019s ruin and there is a smaller article across from it with information about the alleged sex scandal at the university. It ends with not naming the student involved. I glance up at Em.</p><p>\u201cThey figured it out?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cReporters have been camped on the front steps since 4:00am. You\u2019re lucky you missed them last night.\u201d</p><p>I bury my face in my hands. Shame floods me, flushing my entire body scarlet. This can\u2019t be happening. I stumble out of bed and go to the window with Emma warning me to stay out of sight. I peek through the blinds and cringe. It\u2019s true. There\u2019s a swarm of people toting cameras outside. I suck in a sharp gasp and release the blinds.</p><p>Looking at Emma, I say, \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d My voice shakes. I need to cry or yell or something but my hangover prevents me.</p><p>Emma says, \u201cWe shove through them and get the hell out of here. We\u2019ll hang out with your parent\u2019s for a while and give them time to go away. They shouldn\u2019t smear you for not wanting to talk to them about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it makes him look guilty if I don\u2019t.\u201d I tilt my head back against the wall. My entire body aches. Why did I choose last night to drink too much? This kind of crap always happens to me. Once I decide to do something selfish, like wallow around in my own misery for a night, it blindsides me the next day.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to get over him,\u201d I say to Emma with my eyes pressed closed.</p><p>\u201cI know, Anna. I know.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>I get dressed and Emma says she\u2019ll help me out the door. I don\u2019t plan on speaking to them. I\u2019m going to make a beeline for my bike and not come back until they\u2019re gone.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Emma asks as she reaches for the front door knob.</p><p>I smooth my jeans and tug on my leather jacket. I look too badass to be taken advantage of -- at least I hope I do. I have no idea how I\u2019ll react to their questions, so I put on the huge sunglasses Emma wore to a 70\u2019s beach bash last year. They cover half my face.</p><p>\u201cThese are guilty glasses,\u201d I tell her. They\u2019re the kind movie stars wear when they get tossed in jail for drinking and driving or something equally stupid.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look guilty. You actually look a little intimidating with that helmet under your arm. Listen, I\u2019ll follow you to your motorcycle to make sure you get out okay. Just keep walking. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d I nod sadly. \u201cYou can do this, Anna. I know what they\u2019ll do. This is my job, remember? I\u2019d die to be able to interview you right now. Every single one of them is standing there hoping you\u2019ll crack and say something worth reporting. They\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll say it to them, that they\u2019ll be the reporter who gets the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I say as she starts to open the door. Emma stops and turns toward me. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea. What if you interviewed me? What if you had the story so that they followed you when I walk out the door? You can tell them that you\u2019ll answer a few questions and a full story will be in your paper.\u201d</p><p>Emma stares blankly at me for a moment. \u201cI can\u2019t ask you to do that. So much has happened. I don\u2019t want to make it worse for you, and a story might do that.\u201d</p><p>I point at the people parked on the porch, \u201cToo late for that, now. Let\u2019s just try to control the carnage. Besides, I can\u2019t hide out at my parents forever and Sophia expects me in tomorrow. It\u2019s my last week.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes bug out, \u201cYou\u2019re still going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to. What choice do I have?\u201d</p><p>She nods slowly and crosses the room. \u201cSo, Miss Lamore,\u201d she says in a different tone, one that tells me she means business, \u201ccome sit and tell me your story.\u201d</p><p>The plan works. When I step out onto the porch an array of flashes blind me. They expect Emma to walk with me, but she stays on the steps and does as I asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a few questions on Miss Lamore\u2019s behalf.

He\u2019s walking to his car, which is parked right next to me.</p><p>He rushes toward me and wraps his arms around me before I have time to blink. \u201cAnna! Thank God you\u2019re all right. I\u2019ll kill him for touching you. I swear,\u201d he says holding my helmeted head in his hands, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure he never touches you again.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m past the point of reasonable conversation. I\u2019m angry and hurting. I hate that he\u2019s here now, seeing me like this. I hate that he assumes I let Cole use me like that. I swat his hands away. The expression on his face changes rapidly from concern to shock. His lips part like he\u2019s going to say something else stupid or condescending.</p><p>I speak before he has the chance, \u201cNothing happened between us. It was lies. I didn\u2019t cheat on you. I never did anything with Cole like they implied in that article, so don\u2019t stand there feeling sorry for me because nothing happened. It\u2019s part of whatever crap is going on with my current boss\u2014an attempt to smear Cole more than she already has. She tossed me under the bus with him. Do you understand? I\u2019m pissed, but other than that, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Edwards eyes are too cool for someone so mad only seconds ago. He nods calmly. \u201cMany victims can\u2019t accept what happened to them. It\u2019s not your fault, Anna.\u201d He reaches for my hand.</p><p>I snap. I can\u2019t stand him. I don\u2019t want to be here with him. I smack his hand and rev the engine as I kick start the bike. \u201cStay away from me, Edward. If I see you again, even by accident, I swear to God that I\u2019ll punch you. So just stay away.\u201d My voice is full of anger as I speak. When I finish I don\u2019t wait for him to respond. Instead I gas the bike and peel out of the parking spot, zipping into traffic.</p><p>I drive too fast, bobbing and weaving when there\u2019s no need. I do everything possible to hold myself together until I step onto my parent\u2019s doorstep. Then the tears start and don\u2019t stop.</p> <p>My mom takes me in her arms and for once doesn\u2019t ask about anything. She runs her hand over the back of my head, and pulls me inside.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>\u201cFrankie, grab us some coffees. Anna looks like she could use one.\u201d Ma says.</p><p>Daddy grabs the coffee pot and makes me a cup the way I like it. Then he grabs some cookies from a white bakery box and puts them on the plate, too. He hands it to me and I know he\u2019s thinking of me when I was little and he knew what to do. Now he stands there awkwardly, not sure if he should chase down Cole and skin him, or wait and listen to what I have to say.</p><p>\u201cHere baby,\u201d Dad says. His voice is gruff, like his rage is barely in check. After a moment, he says, \u201cTell me the truth. That guy, the one you brought here\u2014was he forcing you to...?\u201d Dad can\u2019t finish the sentence. His face turns red, his mouth crushing into an expression of fury as he says it.</p><p>I reach out for his hand and look him in the eye. \u201cNo. They lied. The paper lied, Dad. Whoever had that article run was gunning for Cole. I just got caught in the splatter.\u201d At least I hope that\u2019s it. Admitting that Cole somehow wronged Sottero like that, with a settlement so large, is unthinkable. Cole is always so careful, not touching, always asking the assistant to do things at shoots. I never even saw him touch a woman at the studio, well, besides me.</p> <p>I backtrack and tell my parents about the dean and the internship. I tell them how I was surprised that I liked working with Cole and how horrible it was with Sottero. When I\u2019m done they know everything. I even told them that I had a crush on Cole, and that he said no.</p><p>Dad\u2019s shoulders relax as I speak, but the tension in his arms remains the same. He still wants to break something. There\u2019s no doubt that Dad would be happy to kill someone and bury them in the backyard if they hurt me. The nervous twitch of his hands, the way his fingers move like he wants to strangle something doesn\u2019t stop, even after he knows the truth.</p><p>Ma is silent, which is unusual. She watches me as I speak and I feel foolish telling her about the crush on Cole. I don\u2019t mention the stripping, the touching right before he told me good-bye. Sadness consumes me, but I don\u2019t want it to. Clearing my throat, I push away from the table.</p><p>Ma says, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to find Cole. I have to know what\u2019s going on. Whether I like it or not, I got sucked into this mess, and tomorrow I\u2019m supposed to walk into Sottero\u2019s and act like nothing happened?\u201d My voice is getting louder, more terse as I speak. I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not, but I\u2019m not sure if talking to Cole is a good thing now or not.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing my helmet, I say, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing. I need this. It\u2019ll tell me what I need to know. It\u2019ll give me closure.\u201d I strap my helmet on as I speak, my fingers expertly moving the strap through the metal loops. I pause for a second, thinking of Edward and glance at my parents. \u201cHas anyone been out here looking for me?\u201d</p><p>Dad shakes his head, but Ma looks away. I tilt my extra-large, helmeted head and put my hands on my hips. \u201cJust tell me, Ma. Who was it? And when?\u201d</p> <p>She blinks rapidly, looking at my face. \u201cJust a young man. He said you knew him.\u201d</p><p>My heart flutters faster. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>She fumbles it for a moment and shakes her head as she tries to remember. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say, but he knew so much about you that I thought you were close. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her for a minute, too afraid to ask if it was Edward, if the man at the door matched his description. I can\u2019t fathom it. I can\u2019t picture him finding my parents and driving all the way out here to do...what? A chill races up my spine.</p><p>\u201cIs someone following you?\u201d Dad asks, voice stern. He looks at me, still tense.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to worry them more, but I feel sick. My stomach is churning like I drank sour milk. Flashing a false smile, I shake my head. \u201cNo, Dad. I\u2019m fine.\u201d I give him a hug from behind, careful not to hit him with my helmet. \u201cI\u2019ll be back after dinner. Call me if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Dialing Cole\u2019s number, I sit on my bike and wait but he doesn\u2019t answer. I think about where he\u2019d be, where he\u2019d go, and I know where he is. That place outside the Le Femme studio in the Hamptons. He went there last time he got bad news.</p><p>When I get there my skin is chilled. It starts misting like the sky is going to open up. There are no cars out front. No reporters. There\u2019s a sign on the door that the studio is closed. Ignoring it I reach for the handle, but it doesn\u2019t open. I place my helmet on the porch, under the awning, so it doesn\u2019t get wet.</p><p>Unzipping my leather jacket, I walk around back looking for the path that leads to the bench down by the water. The sound of the waves fills my ears. My stomach is climbing up into my throat. I don\u2019t know what to do or what to say when I see him.</p><p>I stop a few paces back. Cole is sitting on the bench. He is leaning forward, his head in his hands. His dark hair hangs over his fingers as he stares at the ground. Everything I feel for him comes rushing back. I can\u2019t stand to see him like this. Suddenly, I don\u2019t care that he pushed me away, that he told Jesse he could have me. I step toward him slowly, carefully. When I\u2019m a few paces behind him, I call his name.</p><p>\u201cCole.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t move. Instead he closes his eyes tightly and clenches his hair hard. His fingers practically pull it out by the time he sits up and looks at me. \u201cLamore. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I want to go to him and wrap my arms around his shoulders, but I don\u2019t. I maintain my distance. The sky opens up and the mist turns to drizzle. Beads of water cling to my bare arms and run down to my wrists. My hair finally stops frizzing under the weight of the water and drips onto my tank top. My jeans stick to my skin, making me shiver. But none of that matters. The look in Cole\u2019s eyes makes me forget everything else.</p><p>\u201cI saw the paper. What happened with you and Sottero?\u201d Cole watches me, his eyes giving nothing away. I step closer. \u201cI have to know. They ran an article next to it. One about me.\u201d</p><p>Cole exhales loudly and stands. \u201cSo that\u2019s what you want? A piece of me? Well, get in line. Sottero will wipe me clean. You can take whatever you can scavenge before that.\u201d Cole turns his back to me and walks toward the water. The ocean is churning like a storm is coming. The waves crash into the shore.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m not here for a damn thing. Damn it, Cole! Wait!\u201d I run up behind him and grab his elbow.</p><p>He spins around. Leaning down in front of my face, he says, \u201cYes, you are. Is that why you did it? Is that why you couldn\u2019t keep your pants on? Now you have something to go with your claim at the University? I would have given you anything you asked for, but doing it like this was\u2014\u201d he shakes his head and doesn\u2019t finish. His fingers pinch his eyes and I can tell his voice is caught in his throat. \u201cJust leave. Tell Sottero you got what she needed. Game over.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI swear to God, i have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Tears stream down my face and mix with rain drops. \u201cI went crawling back to Sottero after the school told me I couldn\u2019t intern with you. I didn\u2019t tell her anything.\u201d He doesn\u2019t turn back to look at me. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d</p><p>He turns quickly, his eyes burning like blue flames. In a low tense voice he warns, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d He practically growls the words at me. My heart pounds harder in my chest. I don\u2019t step away even though I want to run. \u201cSomeone gave Sottero exactly what she needed to hang me. You\u2019re the only explanation.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing hard, I look him in the eye, \u201cI never said anything to anyone about you. I sure as hell didn\u2019t tell Sophia Sottero!\u201d I\u2019m shouting in his face. He doesn\u2019t flinch. He doesn\u2019t back away. \u201cShe\u2019s a two-faced bitch. I can\u2019t stand her. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d Cole shakes his head ever so slightly, like he still thinks I\u2019m lying. I lean closer so we\u2019re nose to nose. \u201cI have never lied to you. Go ahead and think whatever you fucking want, but you\u2019re deluding yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had nothing to do with Sophia? Nothing to do with the paper? Come on, Anna. How foolish do you think I am? Your roommate is a reporter. You\u2019ve been planning this with Sottero from day one. You think I didn\u2019t notice the guy you sent snooping around? You think I didn\u2019t see him watching me? Watching you? Looking for whatever she needed to seal her case.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? I didn\u2019t send anyone to follow you!\u201d</p><p>He continues like I didn\u2019t speak, \u201cI didn\u2019t touch her. I never hurt her. Do you know why she did this? Do you know?\u201d I flinch when he yells in my face. \u201cBecause she thought I lied to her when we were younger. That Tiffany\u2019s ring in the safe was hers. The night I gave it to her, she fucking ran it over with her car. Want to know why, Lamore? Want to know why your boss ripped my heart out and ran it over? Because of my name. My fucking name. She thought I still had my inheritance and I was stupid enough to think she loved me.\u201d My jaw drops as horror bubbles up into my throat. The ring box, the one that I saw, was Sophia\u2019s. She used him. She rejected him after his family disowned him. My God. The devastation from that betrayal is strewn across his face. It was too thick to hide.</p><p>\u201cYou think I helped her?\u201d I can\u2019t breathe. Something changes as he speaks. I finally understand what he\u2019s been through, why I couldn\u2019t get close to him. Sophia broke him. His family shattered him and Sophia destroyed whatever hopes remained. Cole\u2019s been alone all this time, too afraid to get close to anyone.</p><p>\u201cStop acting now, Anna. I applaud your efforts. You were very convincing. I admit it, I fell for it. I fell hard for you.\u201d His eyes narrow as his voice changes. Instead of anger, it\u2019s laced with apathy. \u201cSo tell me, how much did she pay you to get close to me and stab me in the back? One mil? Two?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. Tears overflow from my eyes and continue to fall in a silent stream. He thinks I betrayed him. He thinks everything that\u2019s happening to him is because of me. I can\u2019t think of anything to say, any plea that would make him hear me. His eyes burn into me as they slide over my skin with scorn.</p> <p>I don\u2019t answer him. I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI thought so,\u201d he says. It feels like he hit me with a bat.</p><p>His words knock my breath from my lungs, but I don\u2019t look back. The fact that he can even think that makes me sick. There\u2019s no reconciliation. Not this time. Not for us. Sophia Sottero decimated any chance we had. She fucked with his mind twenty years ago and she stole his life\u2019s work today.</p><p>I find myself walking back toward my bike, wondering how this happened. Sophia Sottero was everything I wanted to be. I said as much to Cole. Damn, he must have cringed when I said it. He knew what she was, what she was capable of, and I was sputtering like an idiot... talking about my idol like she was flawless, like she was a god. No wonder he thought I helped her. I couldn\u2019t blame him. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn\u2019t trust anyone either. I couldn\u2019t. And after this, I didn\u2019t know if I ever could. I\u2019d been lied to and used, manipulated into being the straw that cracked the back of the famous Cole Stevens.</p><p>Turning back, I stare at a destroyed man staring at the sea. The wind whips his dark hair, his wet clothing clings to his body, but he doesn\u2019t care. I watch Cole\u2014I see the man I love becoming a hollow shell of what he once was and I vow that I\u2019ll destroy Sophia Sottero for everything she\u2019s done to him. To us. Cole has never seen forgiveness, so neither will she. </p> </body></html>"]
