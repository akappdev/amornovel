Emily, let go of his hair. Don\u2019t make me stop this car!\u201d</p><p>Her daughter\u2019s face swung into the rearview mirror, outraged as only a six-year-old could be. \u201cMom, he started it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who started it. If you don\u2019t be quiet right now, things will happen!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d Melissa whined. Megan, her twin, stuck her tongue out.</p><p>Karina furrowed her eyebrows, trying to look mean in the rearview mirror. \u201cHorrible things.\u201d</p><p>The four children quieted in the back of the van, trying to figure out what \u201chorrible things\u201d meant. The quiet wouldn\u2019t last. Karina drove on. The next time Jill called to ask her if she would chaperone a gaggle of first graders for a school field trip, she would claim to have the bubonic plague instead.</p><p>The trip itself wasn\u2019t that awful. The sun shone bright, and the drive down to the old-timey village, forty-five minutes from Chikasha, was downright pleasant. Nothing but clear sky and flat Oklahoma fields with an occasional thin line of forest between them to break the wind. But now, after a day of hayrides and watching butter being churned and iron nails being hammered, the kids were tired and cranky. They\u2019d been on the road for twenty minutes and the lot of them had already engaged in a World War III\u2013scale conflict three times. She imagined the other parents hadn\u2019t fared any better. As the six cars made their way up the rural road, Karina could almost hear the whining emanating from the vehicles ahead of her.</p><p>They should have just gotten a school bus. But Jill had panicked half of the parents over the bus not having seat belts. In retrospect, the whole thing seemed silly. Thousands of children rode school buses every day with no problems, seat belts or not. Unfortunately, creating panic was one of her best friend\u2019s talents. Jill meant well, but her life was a string of self-created emergencies, which she then cheerfully overcame. Usually Karina pulled her off the edge of the cliff, but with Emily involved, it was hard to maintain perspective.</p> <p>This pointless worry really had to stop. Emily wasn\u2019t made of glass. Eventually Karina would have to let her go on a trip or to a sleepover without her mommy. The thought made Karina squirm. After Jonathan died, she\u2019d taken Emily to a grief counselor, who offered to work with her as well. Karina had turned it down. She\u2019d already been through it, when her parents passed away, and it hadn\u2019t made things any easier.</p><p>Her cell beeped. Karina pushed the button on her hands-free set. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d Jill\u2019s voice chirped.</p><p>\u201cFantastic.\u201d Would be even better if she didn\u2019t have to talk on the phone while driving. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go potty!\u201d Jacob announced from the back.</p><p>\u201cRobert called Savannah a B word. Other than that we\u2019re good,\u201d Jill reported.</p> <p>\u201cI really need to go. Or I\u2019ll poop in my pants. And then there\u2019ll be a big stain . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Jacob needs to go potty.\u201d She caught sight of a dark blue sign rising above the trees. \u201cI\u2019m going to pull over at the motel ahead of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat motel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one on the right. With the big blue sign, says Motel Sunrise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Jill\u2019s voice came through tinted with static. \u201cI don\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see a motel,\u201d Megan reported.</p><p>\u201cLook at the blue sign.\u201d Emily pointed at the window.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see it,\u201d Jacob declared.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a doofus,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cYou suck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d Karina barked.</p><p>The exit rolled up on her right. Karina angled the car into it. \u201cI\u2019m taking this exit,\u201d she said to the cell phone. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exit? Karina, where are you? You were right there and now you\u2019re gone. I don\u2019t see you in my rearview mirror . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I took the exit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exit?\u201d</p><p>Oh, for the love of God. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>The paved road brought them to a two-story building covered with dark gray stucco. Only one car, an old Jeep, sat in the parking lot.</p><p>Karina pulled up before the entrance and hesitated. The building, a crude box with small narrow windows, looked like some sort of institutional structure, an office, or even a prison. It certainly didn\u2019t look inviting.</p><p>\u201cNow I see it,\u201d Megan said.</p><p>Karina shook her head. You\u2019d think if you owned a motel, you\u2019d want to make it seem hospitable. Plant some flowers, maybe choose a nice color for the walls, something other than battleship gray. It only made good business sense. As it was, the place radiated a grim, almost menacing air. She had a strong urge to just keep on driving.</p><p>\u201cI have to go!\u201d Jacob announced and farted.</p><p>Karina jumped out of the van and slid the door open. \u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen seconds later, she herded them inside a small lobby. The lone woman standing behind the counter turned her head at their approach. She was skeletally thin, with long red hair dripping down past her shoulders. Karina glanced at her face and almost marched back out. The woman had eyes like a rattlesnake, no compassion, no kindness, no anger. Nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Karina said. \u201cCould we please use your facilities? The little boy needs to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded to the archway on Karina\u2019s right. Charming. That\u2019s okay. They just needed to get in and get out. \u201cThank you! Come on, kids.\u201d</p><p>The archway opened into a long hallway. On the left, several doors punctuated the wall, one marked \u201cBathroom\u201d and another, at the very end, marked \u201cStairs.\u201d On the right an older man stood in the middle of the hallway. Heavily muscled, with a face like a bulldog, he\u2019d planted himself as if he were about to be overrun by rioters. His eyes watched her with open malice. The kids sensed it, too, and clustered around her. Karina didn\u2019t blame them.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d</p><p>The man said nothing.</p><p>Okay. She marched to the bathroom and swung the door open. A single-person bathroom, relatively clean. No scary strangers hiding anywhere. \u201cIn you go.\u201d She ushered Jacob inside and stood guard by the door.</p><p>Minutes ticked off, long and viscous. The man hadn\u2019t moved. The children kept quiet under his scrutiny, like tiny rabbits sensing a predator.</p><p>Karina knocked on the door gently. \u201cCome on, Jacob. Let the other kids have a turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost done.\u201d</p><p>Karina waited. The man kept staring at her. Gradually his face took on a new expression. Instead of staring her down, he was now studying her as if she were some bizarre alien life-form. That was even more disturbing. Karina fought a shiver.</p><p>\u201cJacob, we need to go.\u201d</p><p>She heard the toilet flush. Finally.</p><p>Jacob emerged from the bathroom. \u201cI washed my hands with soap,\u201d he informed her. \u201cDo you want to smell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Does anybody else need to go?\u201d</p><p>They shook their heads. Emily hugged her leg. \u201cI want to go home, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea.\u201d Karina led them down the hallway.</p><p>The man moved to block their way. \u201cThank you for letting us use the bathroom,\u201d Karina said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be on our way now.\u201d</p><p>The man leaned forward. His nostrils fluttered. He sucked in the air through his nose and his face split in a grin. He didn\u2019t smile; he showed her his teeth: abnormally large and sharp, triangular like shark teeth, and definitely not human.</p><p>Ice skittered down Karina\u2019s spine.</p><p>The man took a step forward. \u201cYou ssshmell like a donor.\u201d His teeth took up so much space in his mouth, he slurred the words.</p><p>Karina backed away, holding her hands out to shield the kids behind her. She wished she had a can of mace or a gun\u2014some weapon in her purse other than Kleenex, her pocketbook, and a cell phone with a dead battery.</p><p>\u201cLet us out!\u201d</p><p>The man advanced. \u201cRishe! The woman ishh a donor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving now!\u201d Karina put some steel into her voice. Sometimes if you looked like you were ready to fight, people backed down and looked for an easier target.</p><p>The man bared his teeth again and she glimpsed what looked like a second row of fangs behind the first in his mouth. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>Time for emergency measures. \u201cHelp!\u201d Karina screamed at the top of her lungs. \u201cHelp!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo help,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>The kids began to cry.</p><p>Maybe this is a nightmare, flashed in her head. Maybe she was dreaming.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Emily clutched at her jeans.</p><p>Dream or not, Karina couldn\u2019t let him get a hold of her or the kids. She kept backing away to the door behind her, the one labeled \u201cStairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us go!\u201d</p><p>He kept coming. \u201cRishe! Where are you?\u201d</p><p>The wall on their right exploded.</p><p>Splintered pieces of wood peppered the hallway, knocking the shark-toothed man back and missing Karina by mere inches. Stunned, she glanced into the gap in the wall. The redheaded woman\u2014Rishe?\u2014jumped over the counter and ran directly at Karina and the children, her face twisted into a grotesque mask. The skin on Rishe\u2019s neck bulged, rolling up, as if a tennis ball slid up her throat into her mouth.</p><p>This is just crazy . . .</p><p>The woman spat.</p><p>Something dark flickered through the air. Pain stung Karina\u2019s left side. A long thin needle, like the quill of a porcupine, sprouted from her stomach, just under the ribs. She yanked it out on pure instinct. She should\u2019ve been terrified, but there was no time . . .</p><p>Something hit the red-haired woman from behind, arresting her in midstep. Rishe\u2019s mouth gaped in a terrified silent scream. Huge claws grasped her face, jerked, and her head twisted completely around.</p><p>Oh, my God.</p><p>Rishe\u2019s body fell, and beyond it Karina glimpsed a thing. Huge, dark, inhuman, it stared back at her with malevolent eyes. Its very existence was so at odds with everything Karina knew, that her mind simply refused to believe it was real. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An odd odor saturated the air, dry and slightly metallic, like copper warmed by the sun. The thing stepped over the woman, its gaze fixed on her.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Karina turned on her heel and dashed down the hallway, herding the children before her.</p><p>The man with shark teeth rose slowly, pulled a wooden splinter out of his eye, tossed it aside, and, with a deep bellow, charged into the lobby through the hole in the wall.</p> <p>A snarl answered him, a promise of pain and death. It whipped Karina into a frenzy. She swiped Jacob off the floor\u2014he was the smallest\u2014and ran faster to the heavy door barring the stairs. She jerked it open. \u201cUp the stairs, go, go!\u201d</p><p>They ran up, whimpering and sobbing. The same fear that drove her propelled them up the stairs better than anything she could\u2019ve screamed.</p><p>Karina slammed the door closed, balancing Jacob on one arm, and looked for something to bar it, but the stairway was empty. Her stomach burned, the pain from the needle puncture spreading up and down her body as if her skin had caught on fire. She ran after the kids. The boy in her arms was stone heavy. They reached the top of the staircase and crowded on the landing.</p><p>Below something clanged. There it was again, the scent of hot metal burning her lungs.</p><p>Karina set Jacob down and wrenched the door open. They burst into the upstairs hallway. She scanned the rows of doors and tried to shove the nearest one open, but it was locked.</p> <p>Another\u2014locked, too.</p><p>Third\u2014locked.</p><p>This is a nightmare. It has to be a nightmare.</p><p>A vicious snarl chased them. Emily screamed, a high-pitched shriek that could\u2019ve broken glass. Karina grabbed her daughter by the hand and dragged her down the hall, to the single window. \u201cFollow me!\u201d</p><p>Beyond the window a fire escape waited.</p><p>Karina grasped the window latch and jerked it up. Stuck.</p> <p>Her head swam. The air around her had grown scalding hot. Every breath burned her lungs from the inside out. She stumbled, caught herself on the windowsill, and pulled the sash upward with all her strength. The wood groaned and suddenly the frame slid up.</p><p>A door thumped. Kids screamed. The terrible dark beast had made it into the hallway.</p><p>She grabbed the nearest child and hurled her onto the fire escape, then the next, and the next. Little feet thudded, running down the metal stairs. Emily was last. Karina clutched her daughter to her and climbed out on the fire escape.</p><p>A black van waited below. Several men stood by the van. They had the children. They stood there silently, watching her, so calm while the kids screamed, and suddenly she realized that they and the beast inside were allies. They were trapped.</p><p>A growl washed over her.</p><p>The world gained crystal clarity, everything becoming painfully vivid and sharp. Slowly Karina turned. Her daughter hugged her, her breath a tiny warm cloud on her neck. The metal rail of the fire escape dug into Karina\u2019s back. The thudding of her heart sounded so loud, each beat shook her rib cage like a blow from a sledgehammer. Every breath was a gift.</p><p>She saw the thing emerge from the darkness. Slowly, it solidified out of the gloom, one gargantuan paw on the windowsill, then another. Enormous claws scratched the wood. It climbed onto the windowsill and perched there, a mere foot from her. Karina stared into its eyes, inhaled its scent, and knew with absolute certainty that she was going to die.</p><p>The thing opened its maw, revealing huge fangs. Its deep voice issued forth in a single mangled word. \u201cDonor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d asked a male voice from below.</p><p>The beast snarled. Karina jerked back, shielding Emily with her hands. Her legs gave out and she fell to her knees.</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d said the voice from below, closer now.</p><p>She barely turned her head, not daring to take her gaze from the monster in the window. A dark-haired man climbed the fire escape toward her. His face was preternaturally beautiful, his eyes a dark, intense blue. \u201cI have a proposition for you, my lady . . .\u201d</p><p>His voice faded, replaced by darkness and the feel of cotton against her body.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>Karina sat up . . . She was in her bed. The room lay dark about her. A nightmare. That was all.</p><p>Her heart thudded in her chest. She rubbed her face and her hands came away slick with cold moisture.</p><p>I agree. \u201cI agree\u201d to what? What did she agree to in her dream?</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. It was a nightmare. In the morning, she\u2019d call the grief counselor.</p><p>Karina frowned and pushed free of the blankets. She felt a strange sense of wrongness, as if there was something very important she was missing. Something vital. A small lamp waited on the table next to the bed. She flicked it on and a cone of soft electric light illuminated the room.</p><p>The bedroom wasn\u2019t hers.</p><p>For a moment Karina froze, and then fear caught her in its fist and squeezed. \u201cEmily?\u201d she whispered. \u201cEmily?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>She was alone in a strange bedroom.</p><p>There could be a rational explanation for this. There had to be. She just didn\u2019t know what it was.</p><p>I agree. An echo of her voice from the dream. She had a terrible suspicion the unfamiliar bedroom and those two words were connected.</p><p>Her clothes were gone. She wore only underwear and a giant T-shirt, three sizes too big.</p><p>A pair of carefully folded jeans lay on a chair next to the bed. Her jeans, the ones she had worn on the field trip. Karina pulled them on. She had to find Emily.</p><p>The door swung open with ease and she found herself in a hallway. To the left, the hallway ended in a stairway leading up. To her right, a pool of electric light brightened the wooden floor and the rust-colored rug. Quiet voices carried on a soft discussion.</p><p>She followed the voices and stepped into a kitchen, blinking against the light. Three men sat at the round table in the center. They turned to look at her. The one sitting farthest from her wore the unearthly face of the man from her dream. His name surfaced from the depths of her memory. Arthur.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>Arthur nodded to her. \u201cAh. You\u2019re up. Why don\u2019t you sit down with us? Henry, please get a chair for Lady Karina.\u201d His soft, intimate voice caressed her almost like a touch. It should\u2019ve been soothing. Instead her insides clenched into a tight knot.</p><p>A tall man with a shy smile rose and held a chair out for her. So oddly domestic, all three drinking tea. Nobody was startled by her appearance. Clearly she was expected.</p><p>Karina sat. \u201cThank you.\u201d The automatic response rolled from her lips before she even realized it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Arthur said. He leaned back with a quiet elegance, artfully posed without putting any effort into it. His hair was soft, black, and brushed back from his perfectly sculpted face. His eyebrows were equally black and so were his eyelashes, long and soft like velvet. They framed big eyes, crystalline blue, distant, and cold. Angelic, she thought. He looked like an angel, not a plump cherub, but an angel who roamed freely in the sky, possessed of heart-wrenching beauty and terrible power, an angel who had stared into the bottomless blue for so long that his eyes had absorbed its color.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d Arthur asked.</p><p>\u201cChildren . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe,\u201d he said and she believed the sincerity of his words even though she had no reason to do so.</p><p>Arthur rose, took a small blue mug from the shelf behind him, and poured steaming tea into it from a large kettle on the stove. He set the cup in front of her. \u201cPlease drink. It will steady your nerves.\u201d</p><p>Karina looked at the cup.</p><p>He drank from his own cup and smiled in encouragement.</p><p>She picked up the cup and took a sip. Green tea. Odd taste, slightly sour.</p><p>Maybe she was still dreaming. The whole scene had that slightly absurd wrongness found only in dreams.</p><p>Karina looked about the table. The man who had offered her the chair, Henry, sat to her right. He was tall and whipcord lean. His face, serious with somber intelligence, lacked Arthur\u2019s magnetism, but its sharp angles drew her all the same. His tawny hair was cut close to the scalp, but still showed a trace of a curl. His green eyes regarded her and she read pity in their depths.</p><p>The man on her left was model pretty. Strong masculine jaw, deep, dark blue eyes, high cheekbones, a mane of golden wavy hair dripping down to below his waist, hiding half of his face . . . His eyes flashed with wild humor. He gave her a wink, grinned, exposing even white teeth, and tossed his hair back. An ugly scar ripped his left cheek, almost as if something had taken a bite out of him and his flesh hadn\u2019t healed right. She fought an urge to look away. He reached for her hand . . .</p><p>\u201cDaniel.\u201d Arthur\u2019s voice gained a slight edge. \u201cThat\u2019s extremely unwise.\u201d</p><p>Daniel sat back.</p><p>\u201cJust because she didn\u2019t scream when she saw your face doesn\u2019t mean you get to touch.\u201d Henry refilled his cup.</p><p>\u201cPlease forgive Daniel. He doesn\u2019t mean to be rude. He\u2019s just forbidden to speak for the time being. Your tea is getting cold,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>\u201cHe tends to cause problems when he speaks,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>Daniel gave her a smoldering smile.</p><p>She faced Arthur. \u201cWhat did I agree to?\u201d</p><p>Arthur sighed. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Henry leaned forward. \u201cPerhaps we should mend this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The sooner, the better. Lucas might return and that would make things considerably more complicated.\u201d</p><p>Daniel laughed softly. If wolves could laugh, they would sound just like him.</p><p>Henry held out his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s easier if you hold on to me.\u201d</p><p>Karina hesitated.</p><p>\u201cYou do want to remember, don\u2019t you?\u201d Arthur asked.</p><p>She put her hand into Henry\u2019s. His long warm fingers closed about hers. The world tore in two and she was back on the landing of the fire escape at the not-motel, cradling Emily. Her whole body burned with a terrible ache.</p><p>Arthur leaned his head to the side, looked at them for a moment, and plucked Emily from her arms.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Karina struggled to hold on, but her hands had lost all strength.</p><p>Emily didn\u2019t kick. Didn\u2019t scream. Her face was completely blank, as if she had turned into a doll. Arthur turned and handed her to someone behind him on the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEmily!\u201d Karina tried to crawl after her but her body refused to obey.</p><p>Arthur touched the hem of her black top and edged it upward. His fingers touched her stomach. Pain pierced her and she cried out.</p><p>\u201cAh. Now see, this isn\u2019t good.\u201d Arthur shook his head mournfully. \u201cAll of this must seem terribly confusing to you and our time is short, so I will keep the explanations simple. This is the house where monsters live. We are the killers of monsters. I suppose that also makes us monsters simply by necessity. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here. It\u2019s probably a pure coincidence. An unlucky roll of the dice. You and your children were caught in the cross fire. One of the monsters poisoned you with her throat dart. The wound is fatal. You\u2019re dying.\u201d</p> <p>Fear shot down Karina\u2019s spine in an icy rush. She didn\u2019t think she could have gotten more scared, but his tone, that patient, pleasant, even tone, as if he were discussing lunch, terrified her. It\u2019s not a dream, she realized. It\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening to me right now. God, please let Emily be okay. Please. I\u2019ll do anything.</p><p>\u201cI can smell your fear,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cIt rolls off your skin. A better man would feel discomfort at your pain. But I\u2019m not a good man. I feel nothing for you. We rarely have to deal with innocent bystanders and when we do, we strive to send them back unharmed, not out of some altruistic impulse, but because we dislike attention. If you hadn\u2019t been injured, Henry here would wipe your memory and the five of you would go merrily on your way. As it is, however, you will be dead in the next thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>The words refused to leave her mouth. Karina strained and forced them out. \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>His ice-cold smile made her heart jump. \u201cI\u2019m talking to you because I\u2019m about to offer you a deal. You have something we want, my lady. Your body has a genetic predisposition toward producing certain hormones one of us desperately needs. Your subspecies isn\u2019t unique, but it\u2019s rare enough to make you valuable. I suspect that\u2019s also how you were able to find this place, and that\u2019s why the yadovita, the redheaded woman, took the time to poison you instead of defending herself from us. Listen carefully, my lady, because I won\u2019t repeat myself.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, committing each word to memory.</p> <p>\u201cThe creature behind you requires your blood. He will feed on you. His venom will counteract the poison that\u2019s killing your body. In return, he will consume the chemicals your body will produce. You will give yourself to the House of Daryon. You will let the beast feed on you. You will live in quarters of our choosing. You can never leave. You can have no contact with the outside world. For your agreement to this, we will spare your life and the lives of the children.\u201d</p><p>The thing on the windowsill let out a low whine of anticipation. That . . . that beast would feed on her. Forever. Oh, dear God. I can\u2019t do it . . . I can\u2019t . . .</p><p>Arthur leaned forward, his face showing no emotion beyond the pleasant, calm composure. \u201cConsider carefully before you answer. I don\u2019t offer this deal to you because I like you or because I\u2019m moved by some noble emotion. I do it because we need you. What I propose won\u2019t be pleasant for you. You won\u2019t enjoy it. In fact, many would say you\u2019re better off dying now.\u201d</p><p>Fog gathered on the edge of her mind, threatening to smother her. Karina clawed at reality, trying to remain conscious.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter . . .\u201d</p><p>The beast growled on the windowsill.</p> <p>\u201cHe guarantees her safety,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>\u201cThe children . . . will be returned to their families?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>A gentle hand seized her mind and pulled her back through time and space to the reality of the round table and the hot tea mug in her hand. She looked at Arthur.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter, Emily?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cYou promised me the children would be returned to their families. Her father is dead. I\u2019m the only family Emily has. Where is she?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled, a flat curving of lips without any emotion. \u201cShe\u2019s at the main house for the time being.\u201d</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t, Karina realized. He was lying. \u201cI want my daughter. We made a deal. Bring me my daughter, or I am leaving.\u201d</p><p>Daniel rocked back on his chair and laughed. A door slammed. Footsteps echoed through the house. \u201cCooperate with Lucas and your daughter will be brought to you,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>A man walked into the kitchen. Tall, corded with muscle that bulged his T-shirt, he dwarfed the doorway. He wasn\u2019t just large, he was massive and wrapped in menace, as if he were a whirlwind of violence, barely contained in the shell of his body. Black hair fell on his hard, aggressive face in long strands. He glanced at her, his eyes green and merciless. She met his gaze and gulped. It was like looking into the eyes of a tiger. His stare promised death.</p><p>Recognition sparked in his green irises and flared into rage.</p><p>He lunged forward, inhumanly quick, and hit the table with his palm. She jerked back.</p><p>\u201cGet your hands off of her!\u201d His voice rippled with a snarl.</p><p>Henry raised his hands in the air. The man grasped the chair, Henry still on it, and tossed it aside. Steely fingers grabbed her elbow and pulled her up. He swiped her off the floor with ridiculous ease, locking her in the crook of his arm, and snapped like a rabid dog, \u201cMine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have no intention of taking her from you.\u201d Arthur sipped his tea.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t any of you fuckers touch her!\u201d</p><p>She flailed in his arms, trying to break free, but it was like trying to push back a semi.</p><p>\u201cYou must forgive Lucas,\u201d Arthur told her. \u201cHe tends to be overprotective of his food.\u201d</p><p>A familiar scent of heated metal invaded her nostrils. Panic squirmed through her. She fought harder, but her feet kicked only air. He carried her away out of the kitchen back to the bedroom where she had awakened.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Lucas dropped her on the bed and went to lock the door. \u201cStay away from Arthur. He\u2019s a sick fuck.\u201d</p><p>He turned and strode toward her, enormous, overwhelming in his sheer size. Karina shrank back until her spine hit the wall.</p><p>He looked her over, a long, lingering stare that made her want to cover herself, frowned and ducked into a doorway on the left. Water gushed. Lucas reappeared with a tall glass of water and handed it to her. \u201cDrink this. It will help.\u201d</p><p>She drank.</p><p>He sat on a chair across from her and pulled off his socks. Only now she noticed that he wasn\u2019t wearing any shoes. He balled the socks into a clump and tossed them into the room where he\u2019d gotten the water, then shrugged off his T-shirt. Karina\u2019s breath caught in her throat. Faded ragged scars crisscrossed his massive back. His legs were long, his waist narrow in comparison to his vast shoulders. His lines were almost perfect. As he squared his shoulders, muscles rolled under his skin, forming hard ridges. He didn\u2019t move\u2014he stalked and prowled, like a huge predatory animal, menace cascading from him in waves along with his hot metallic scent.</p><p>Her memory thrust Jonathan before her. Her husband had been handsome and well built, an average-sized man. Lucas could\u2019ve snapped him in half and wouldn\u2019t have given it a second thought. He\u2019d just toss the broken body aside and continue on his way. She had no chance. In a physical fight, Lucas would destroy her.</p><p>\u201cDrink,\u201d he said.</p><p>Karina forced some more water down. Her throat had gone dry and she drank again. Suddenly Lucas gathered himself. His gaze fixed on the door. His body tensed, his expression alert. His feet gripped the bare floorboards, his legs bent lightly, as he readied to launch himself into a leap. Muscles bunched and knotted across his shoulders and back. His arms lifted slightly, spread wide, the fingers of his big hands like talons, ready to grasp and crush. His eyes ignited with a hot, hungry fire. Poised like this, he was barely human.</p><p>Someone\u2019s knuckles rapped on the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucas growled.</p><p>\u201cDo you want the sedative?\u201d Henry\u2019s voice asked.</p><p>Lucas glanced at her and asked quietly, \u201cDo you want to be drugged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said no,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>The footsteps retreated. Lucas eased, relaxing slowly, muscle by muscle. He glanced at her with his light green eyes and she shrank from his gaze.</p><p>\u201cHow much did they tell you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI know what I agreed to.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cAre you . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>She tried to reconcile the beast and the man, and couldn\u2019t. That dark, grotesque creature was huge, twice as big as Lucas. A horrible meld of ape, dog, bear\u2014Karina struggled for a comparison, a point of reference, and could find none. Her memory was fuzzy. She remembered fangs and baleful eyes, and massive shoulders sheathed in dark fur. How was it possible? Her mind refused to admit that thing existed. But her body felt Lucas near and knew the beast was real.</p><p>She had to have an explanation. Anything at all. \u201cAre you a vampire?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s no myth or legend or cute explanation. People here call those like me Demons. It\u2019s just a name, nothing religious attached to it. You might also hear people call me Subspecies 30. The rest is complicated.\u201d He took her half-empty glass and went to top it off. \u201cI don\u2019t actually need your blood to sustain me. I require the endocrine hormones your body will secrete in response to my bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo counteract the effects of my venom. It hurts me.\u201d</p><p>He handed her the full glass, rubbed his hand across the back of his neck, and held the palm to her face. The odor of hot metal hit her nostrils and she drew back.</p><p>\u201cThat smell means I\u2019m hungry for you.\u201d</p><p>He was too close. The cup trembled in Karina\u2019s fingers. God, she was scared. It took all of her will not to scream and run. \u201cWill it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s not like vampire movies, where the vampire bites the woman and she moans softly and comes all over herself. There\u2019s no rapture involved. No climax. Just me chewing on you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took her by the chin, lifting her face, and peered into her eyes. Karina pulled back. He leaned closer. She tried to scramble away, but he grasped her shoulder, keeping her still. His lips touched her forehead. \u201cFever.\u201d Lucas grimaced. \u201cYour eyes are still bloodshot.\u201d</p><p>His presence pressed on her like a physical burden. Karina closed her eyes. She sat there, world shut out, and pretended that everything would be okay even if every instinct assured her it wouldn\u2019t. She had to survive and adapt. She had to do whatever was necessary to get her daughter back.</p><p>When she opened her eyelids, he waited for her with a synthetic cord in his hands. She hadn\u2019t heard him move.</p> <p>\u201cTo keep you still.\u201d He moved toward her, uncoiling the cord.</p><p>No. Lying there tied up and completely helpless while he drank her blood would be too much. \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI won\u2019t change my mind.\u201d</p><p>Lucas kept coming.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t change my mind.\u201d Desperation put steel into her voice. \u201cI\u2019ve agreed to this to save my daughter. They\u2019ll let me see her after you feed. I won\u2019t run or fight.\u201d</p><p>He halted.</p> <p>\u201cArthur said I would stay here for as long as I live. That means you have to feed frequently. Might as well start it right.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gripped the rope. His biceps bulged. He snapped the rope apart. Karina winced. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to intimidate me, it\u2019s too late. I\u2019m already as scared as I\u2019m going to get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to scare you.\u201d He rolled the section of the rope into a tight wad, wrapped the end about it several times, tied it, and dropped it in her lap. \u201cTo bite down. In case it gets too rough.\u201d</p><p>She picked it up.</p><p>Lucas sat next to her. \u201cArthur isn\u2019t in charge of your daughter. I am. I guaranteed her safety. Both of you belong to me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas leaned to look into her face. She expected rage, hunger, some violent emotion, but instead she saw only steady calm.</p> <p>\u201cI promise you that no matter what happens between you and me, your daughter will be safe. I will never use her against you. Everyone is afraid of me, and she will never be bullied or mistreated.\u201d</p><p>Karina stared at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to start this right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do that. Let\u2019s be honest. The bitch in the hotel poisoned you. Technically she infected you with a virus that secretes a toxin into your bloodstream. To counteract the virus, you need my venom. I\u2019ve already bitten you once but it will take several feedings before you\u2019re in the clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve bitten me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft thigh,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in the attack variant at the time, and biting you anywhere else would\u2019ve caused too much damage.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed at her leg, trying to feel the wound through the fabric of the jeans.</p><p>\u201cIt was a very quick bite,\u201d he said. \u201cTo keep you from dying. This will be worse.\u201d</p><p>He was serious. The thought of him feeding on her, chewing on her, was almost too much to contemplate. \u201cCan we do a blood transfusion instead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ve tried in the past and failed. There is some sort of relationship between your blood, my venom, and my saliva that we don\u2019t understand. I have to feed on you. You need me to survive and I need you to . . .\u201d He paused. \u201cTo counteract my venom.\u201d</p><p>He was holding something back, she could feel it.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s eyes held no mercy. \u201cI\u2019m a predator and my body knows that you\u2019re my prey. Your fear is exciting. Try not to be so scared. Don\u2019t struggle. The more you flail about and whimper, the more excited I\u2019ll get. If you get me excited enough, I\u2019ll chew up your veins and end up fucking you in a puddle of blood. I take it you don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stay calm.\u201d He nodded at the cord in her lap. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to be tied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lucas stretched out on the bed, took her by the waist, and pulled her down, flush against him. They lay together, her butt pressed against his groin, her back tight against his chest. Like two lovers. Jonathan and she used to lie like this after sex. The perversity of it made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cLie still.\u201d His arms pulled her tighter to him. The hard shaft of his erection dug into her butt. She tried to edge away from it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I can\u2019t help it, but I won\u2019t molest you. Unless you start moaning and rubbing your ass against me.\u201d</p><p>She stopped moving. The odor of hot copper was overpowering now. Karina cleared her throat. \u201cI feel light-headed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breathing in my scent. Your body\u2019s reacting. It will speed things up.\u201d</p><p>That explained the shirt coming off. He wanted no fabric barriers between her and that smell, so it could roll off his skin and take her under. \u201cDo I need to do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust lie there and endure. Your body needs my venom. As I said, I\u2019ve bitten you already to kill the poison, but you got just enough to keep you alive. This will take some time.\u201d</p><p>She brushed her hair from her neck, exposing skin. No point in drawing this out.</p><p>A low laugh answered her. He spoke into her ear, his breath a warm touch on her skin. \u201cYou ever watch hockey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Buffalo Sabres had a goalie\u2014Clint Malarchuk. Steve Tuttle, a guy on another team, was trying to score a goal, and as he charged at the crease, a defenseman grabbed him from behind and swung him up. Tuttle\u2019s skate caught Malarchuk\u2019s neck. A shallow cut, only severed the exterior jugular. Blood sprayed like water from a hose. Covered the whole crease in seconds.\u201d</p><p>For some reason she couldn\u2019t understand, his quiet voice steadied her nerves. \u201cDid he survive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. Had the skate cut a bit deeper, he would\u2019ve been dead in about two minutes.\u201d He gathered her even tighter against himself. \u201cThe neck nuzzling is fun, but the pressure within the jugular would expel your blood so quickly, it would kill you.\u201d His finger traced an outline on the vein on her neck, sending electric shivers along her skin. She wished he hadn\u2019t done that.</p><p>\u201cIf not the neck, then where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe arm works well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you . . . get on with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. The longer we wait, the less painful it will be for you.\u201d</p><p>His body was hot against hers, his heat seeping into her. His scent enveloped her completely now. Her head spun.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he prompted. \u201cGo limp. Don\u2019t strain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The undercurrent of violence that permeated everything he said muted slightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen after you feed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pass out. It\u2019s like giving blood except messier. Your body will go into shock from my venom. If you survive, you\u2019ll get used to the feedings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis just gets better and better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s a bitch.\u201d</p><p>The room crawled. \u201cI\u2019m not dreaming, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this is your dream, you\u2019re seriously fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you . . . all of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask too many questions.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away from her, turned her arm to him, and bit into the soft flesh just above the elbow. Pain lanced through her. Her body tensed in response, but his arms clamped her down and she could barely breathe.</p><p>It hurt. It hurt and hurt, but worse than the pain was the awful sensation of his gnawing teeth and the prickly heat squirming its way up her arm. It spread into her shoulder and fanned out, claiming her body. She wanted to break free, to get away, but Lucas held her tight.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you will make sure my daughter is safe if I die.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cPromise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d he said.</p><p>Karina let herself sink into the pain. Gradually it eased into a steady ache. Her limbs relaxed. She tried to think of something else, anything else, of Emily, of their safe little apartment, of being far away in a different place. But the reality refused to recede. And so she lay there and waited it out, her entire body humming with a distinct unusual pain, until her dizziness blotted out the world and she slipped under.</p><p>Lucas nuzzled her thin neck. Feverish. Not too bad. She was healthy. And clean. The blood work from the main house had shown no abnormalities aside from the poison. That was what donors were. Resilient; resistant to most disease.</p><p>And grounded. She didn\u2019t seem like she would snap, but he\u2019d seen enough people break under the weight of the transition to let his guard slip. And then there was her daughter. Children complicated things.</p><p>She just lay there and let him feed.</p><p>His first donor, Robert Milder, had to be sedated for the feedings. After him, there was Galatea. He had to tie her up. Every time. She had resented her role, loathed being restrained, despised him, and yet pulled him into her bed; and when they fucked, she drained him so completely, he felt blissfully empty, as if he had poured not only his seed, but his pain into her. She took it all and reveled in it, enjoying the power she wielded over him. He wasn\u2019t a fool. He knew she was driven by revenge, but he came back to her again and again, an idiot thirsty for a poisoned spring.</p><p>And now he had Karina.</p><p>A soothing cold spread through his veins, melting the needles of pain that always prickled him in the aftermath of his transformation from the attack variant. Funny. He had survived for six years on injections, shooting himself up every couple of days, but the synthetic hormones failed to soothe the ache. They managed to dull the pain, yet it had still gnawed at him, until he became convinced it would grind him down to nothing. Karina\u2019s body had barely had a chance to respond to his poison, yet even this tiny dose of the hormones brought relief to him. He had forgotten what it was like not to hurt.</p><p>Lucas breathed in her scent. The memory of the chase through the motel danced through his mind. He wanted to chase her again. He felt drunk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He slipped the narrow strap of the tank top off Karina\u2019s shoulder, baring her left breast. Bigger, fuller, softer than he had expected. He imagined sliding his palm over the mound, brushing the nipple with his thumb. He pictured how her body would tighten in response, how the nipple would feel erect against his fingers.</p><p>He slid his fingers under the waistband of her jeans, pulled it up, and looked at the triangle of her white underwear. His cock ached. He wanted to mount her and thrust it inside her.</p><p>So what was stopping him?</p> <p>Lucas slid his hand up, to her slightly rounded stomach, holding her gently, trying to puzzle it out. Had he tied her up before feeding from her, he would\u2019ve fucked her by now, of that he was certain.</p><p>Trust, he realized. She\u2019d held up her part of the deal. It had cost her. She\u2019d cried toward the end, once her grip on consciousness slipped\u2014silent tears that left wet tracks on her cheeks. Her arm would be sore as hell tomorrow. Provided the fever didn\u2019t rise, the poison didn\u2019t kill her, and there was a tomorrow in her future. He wanted her to live, but he had done all he could to help her.</p><p>The feeding had cost her, but she lay there and let him do his thing, as she had promised, and she expected him to hold up his end of the bargain. And the bargain didn\u2019t include fucking rights. She\u2019d made that crystal clear.</p><p>He tugged her tank top back into place, covering her up, and pulled her to him, sliding his arm over her. She was his. She would take away his pain and he would guard her in return. That was the agreement.</p><p>Chapter 3</p> <p>Karina awoke to an empty room. Bright morning light flooded through the open window, drawing a yellow rectangle on the wooden floor. A draft brought an acrid stink of burning bacon.</p><p>Emily.</p><p>She pushed free of the sheets and almost fell. Her head swam. Slowly, very slowly she slid off the bed and stood upright. Her throat was so dry, it hurt. A full glass of water sat on the bedside table beside a pair of binoculars and a yellow sticky that read \u201cDrink it.\u201d She could practically hear Lucas\u2019s growl.</p><p>The memory of his gnawing teeth squirmed through her, dragging nausea in its wake. Karina bent over, gripped the night table to steady herself, and saw a square bandage on her arm. She tugged at it, sending a jolt of pain through her limb. The bandage remained stuck. Karina pulled harder, trying to rip it away as if she could shed the memory of Lucas with it. She struggled with it for a few seconds, pain pounding up her biceps in hot prickly bursts, and finally tore it free.</p><p>A big bruise stained the bend of her arm. Dark purple, it sat there like a brand. Lucas\u2019s proof of ownership. Dried blood was caked in the center, where his teeth had mangled her veins.</p><p>The price she paid for Emily\u2019s life. And her own. The ache in her arm pushed her to scream at the sheer mind-boggling unfairness of it: at being attacked, kidnapped, hurt, held down by brute force, robbed of her daughter, stripped of her freedom . . . At being plucked from her life. Only a day ago, she felt reasonably safe, secure in the knowledge that she could dial 911 at any moment and bring a police cruiser to her door. She had rights. She had protections. She was a person.</p> <p>She felt the hot wet tears well in her eyes and clenched her teeth. She had to get a grip. Thinking like a victim would get her nowhere. Yes, it was terrifying. Yes, it hurt. But it didn\u2019t kill her. She was still alive and as long as she breathed, she had to fight for herself and her child. She had to obey and be sweet. She had to ingratiate herself. That was her only chance at survival and escape. Karina dropped the bandage on the night table and drained the glass. It was time to find her daughter.</p><p>A harsh screech made her turn to the window. She walked to it, picking up the binoculars off the night table on the way. A wide green expanse spread before her, a wooded slope gently rolling away and down, toward mountains, brown and rust, fading to blue and eventually gray in the distance. A scrub forest hugged the roots of the mountains, dotting the grassy prairie in clumps of green. The wind fanned her face, bringing moisture and the tart fragrance of some unknown flower.</p><p>It was the middle of summer in southern Oklahoma and the prairie she\u2019d seen through her windshield the day before had been a brown sea of dried grass. This, this looked like spring after weeks of rains somewhere in the foothills of rugged mountains.</p><p>Where the hell was she? Looked like complete wilderness, probably miles from any road, any people. Any help. If she escaped, crossing across rugged country with a six-year-old would be very difficult. She would have to plan well and bring a lot of water.</p><p>The brush quaked. A small brown animal burst from the growth. It resembled a dog, or maybe a coyote. It dashed across the grass, zigzagging in sheer panic. It didn\u2019t run like a coyote.</p><p>What in the world?</p><p>Karina raised the binoculars to her eyes.</p><p>The creature wasn\u2019t a dog. If anything it looked like a tiny horse, no more than two feet tall.</p> <p>The brush shivered and spat three gray shapes onto the grass, one large and two others smaller. They ran upright on a pair of massively muscled legs, their bodies sheathed with gray feathers speckled with spots of black. Long, powerful necks supported heads armed with enormous beaks. The binoculars picked up every detail, from the crests of long feathers on their heads to the tiny vicious eyes.</p><p>The horse galloped for its life, veering left. The bird closest to it slid and swung toward the house to right itself. A flash of pale red shot through the empty air, as if the bird had run into an invisible net stretched tight, and the pressure of its body caused the threads to glow. The bird screeched and fell, catapulted back. For a moment it lay on the grass stunned, and then it rolled back to its feet and rejoined the chase.</p><p>The small horse was getting tired. It slowed. Foam dripped from its mouth.</p><p>The largest bird sprinted. The monstrous beak rose, then came down like an ax, chopping at the horse and knocking it off its feet. The horse rolled in the grass and staggered upright. The three birds danced about it, jabbing and pecking. The horse cried out and fell. Bloody beaks rose again and again . . .</p><p>Karina lowered the binoculars.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know much about zoology, but she knew enough. They weren\u2019t emus; they weren\u2019t ostriches; no, these were something vicious, something ancient, something that should not exist in Texas or the Ozarks. Or the twenty-first century.</p><p>Suddenly she was cold, freezing from head to toe.</p><p>A triumphant screech rolled up from the plain.</p><p>Karina dropped the binoculars on the side table and slammed the window shut.</p><p>A cloud of oily smoke greeted Karina in the kitchen. By the stove, Henry cursed, slid several charred pieces of bacon out of a pan with a spatula, and deposited them onto a plate. He saw her and waved the spatula around, flinging hot drops of grease onto the table. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she answered on autopilot. \u201cI saw . . . birds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerror birds.\u201d Henry nodded. \u201cNasty creatures. Don\u2019t worry, there is a large fence around the entire hill. We call it the net\u2014it\u2019s thin wire with a powerful current running through it. You\u2019re completely safe within the vicinity of the house. They won\u2019t come close. Besides, they are mostly cowards. An adult human has nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>One of those things would kill a child. A vision of a bloody beak coming down like a hatchet flashed before Karina\u2019s eyes. She swallowed. \u201cMy daughter?\u201d</p><p>The spatula pointed to Henry\u2019s right. \u201cThrough that doorway.\u201d</p><p>Karina forced herself not to run. She skirted the table and walked through the doorway into a living room. Her heart pounded.</p><p>A small shape was curled on the couch, hidden by a green blanket. Karina pulled back the covers. Emily lay on the pillow. Her mouth was open slightly, her eyes closed, her hair a tangled mess.</p><p>Karina knelt and hugged her gently. Emily stirred and she put her face to her daughter\u2019s cheek and clenched herself, trying not to cry.</p><p>\u201cDaniel brought her early in the morning. Arthur told him he would let him speak in return,\u201d Henry said softly from the doorway. \u201cI\u2019ve wiped her memory of the assault in the motel\u2014it was too traumatic\u2014so she won\u2019t recall anything about the place, and that entire day will be dim for her. There are no long-term effects to memory wipes, but there are some short-term consequences: she will sleep a lot more, she will seem confused, and she might have some anxiety. It should last for about a week. Lucas already called the main house. They have a nice room set up for her.\u201d</p><p>Karina turned. \u201cI want her to stay with me.\u201d</p><p>Henry looked uncomfortable. \u201cThere is a reason why the three of us are separated from the main house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree? I thought Arthur lived here.\u201d</p><p>Henry shook his head. \u201cArthur stays at the main compound. Of our entire group, Lucas is the most feared, Daniel is the most despised, and I\u2019m the least trusted.\u201d He paused. \u201cThis house isn\u2019t the best place for a child.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cHenry, why in the world would anyone not trust you?\u201d Of the four men she\u2019d met so far, Henry seemed the least insane.</p><p>He smiled, apologetic, almost vulnerable, and leaned closer. \u201cI can make you forget we ever had this conversation. I can make you forget about Lucas, about the motel, and, if I strain a little, you won\u2019t remember you ever had a daughter.\u201d</p><p>She paused. It seemed insane, but no less insane than the idea of a man who turned into a nightmarish beast. \u201cCan you read thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody can read thoughts.\u201d Henry shook his head. \u201cNot even combat-grade operatives like me.\u201d</p><p>Combat with whom? Why? He was wording his replies very carefully, thinking about them for a moment before answering. If she pushed him too hard, he would stop talking. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand. Do you wipe your enemies\u2019 memories?\u201d</p><p>Henry took his glasses off and cleaned the lenses with the corner of Emily\u2019s blanket. Without his glasses, he seemed younger. \u201cThe mind doesn\u2019t just store memories. It also governs many functions of the body. I can mentally scout the enemy and tell you their numbers. Obviously the more of them there are, the higher the margin of error is, but typically I\u2019m not off by a significant number. I can find your mind in a crowd of people and attack it, so you\u2019ll think you\u2019re drowning. I can disconnect your brain from the rest of you and starve it of oxygen until you become a vegetable. My subspecies isn\u2019t called Memory Wiper. It\u2019s called Mind Bender.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a moment she was more terrified of him than she was of Lucas, and thinking that he might somehow crack her skull open and peer into her brain scared her even more.</p><p>Henry glanced at Emily on the couch. \u201cDo you trust me now? Do you want your daughter near me?\u201d</p><p>No. She didn\u2019t trust any of them. But the main house, whatever it was, would be full of strangers. The thought of someone full of violent rage, like Lucas, or cold like Arthur, being in charge of Emily without her to shield her daughter made her wince.</p> <p>Karina clenched her hands. Screaming and hysterics would do her no good. She had to reason with them. She had to be smart. Use logic. \u201cHenry, I\u2019d rather take you and Lucas over a house of people I don\u2019t know. Emily woke up alone, without me. She must\u2019ve been frightened. She\u2019s my daughter, Henry. She\u2019s safest with me, because I\u2019m her mother and I would give my life to keep her from harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak to Lucas,\u201d Henry suggested. \u201cI\u2019m sure he will permit some sort of visitation.\u201d</p><p>Lucas. Lucas had said he owned both of them. She had to make him understand. Karina fixed Emily\u2019s blanket and rose. \u201cCan I make her breakfast? Or should I ask Lucas\u2019s permission?\u201d</p><p>Henry stepped aside. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to any food we have.\u201d He cleared his throat.</p><p>The fridge contained eggs, several pounds of bacon, some slimy cold cuts, a hunk of mozzarella cheese\u2014dried, yellow, and brittle\u2014and a pack of green-looking hot dogs. Karina pulled out eggs and bacon. \u201cFlour?\u201d</p> <p>Henry dug in one of the cabinets, looking lost, frowned, and opened a door, revealing a huge supply room. \u201cI think in here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>She stepped into the room. Rows and rows of wooden shelves, filled with cans and jars, a huge spice rack, fifty-pound bags of sugar, flour, rice . . . three large freezers filled with meat. Enough food to feed these men for years. \u201cAre you expecting a long siege?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know,\u201d Henry said with a thin smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Daniel, Lucas, me, Emily. . . is anybody else coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Does this mean we\u2019re invited to the meal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m using your food.\u201d</p> <p>Henry exhaled, picked up the plate of black bacon strips, and dumped them into the trash. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>Karina opened the window first, so the kitchen would air out, and set about making breakfast. Henry parked himself by the refrigerator and watched her. There was something disquieting about Henry. When she looked at him, she got an impression of length: long limbs, long frame, long face. Even though she vaguely recalled that he was slightly shorter than Lucas, he appeared taller. He seemed lean, almost thin, but that notion was deceiving\u2014his sweatshirt sleeves were pulled up to his elbows, revealing forearms sculpted with hard muscle. He smiled often, but the curving of his lips lacked emotion. His smile was paper-thin, an automatic, knee-jerk reaction like blinking.</p><p>A Mind Bender. If what he said was true, he could kill Emily in front of her, wipe Karina\u2019s mind clean, and she would never remember it.</p><p>Karina found Granny Smith apples in the bottom of the fridge and checked the drawers. On the third try she hit what looked like a utility drawer: knives, screwdrivers, bottle openers, and wooden spoons. She fished a medium-sized knife from the drawer, peeled the apples, cored and chopped them, and set them to fry slowly, sprinkling them with brown sugar.</p><p>\u201cIt smells divine,\u201d Henry murmured.</p><p>\u201cIs there cinnamon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure there is. It\u2019s brown powder, right?\u201d Henry stepped into the pantry.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She grabbed the knife, pulled the fabric of her jeans away from her hip, and slid the knife into her pocket. The point of the blade cut the lining and she jammed the knife all the way down to the hilt. The blade scraped against her skin. She glanced down. No blood. Karina exhaled. Cutting herself was a calculated risk\u2014she had no other place to hide the knife. Anywhere else it would make a bulge. She pulled her T-shirt down over it.</p> <p>Henry came out of the pantry. She held her breath. Maybe he could read thoughts. Maybe he would pluck the image of the knife out of her head. She had to stop thinking about it, but she couldn\u2019t. The shape of the knife was probably glowing in her brain.</p><p>Henry shook a plastic container of cinnamon. \u201cFound it.\u201d</p><p>She had to say something or he would realize things were wrong. Karina willed her mouth to move. \u201cThank you.\u201d She took the cinnamon and sprinkled it on the apples.</p><p>The bacon rack was missing in action, or perhaps they didn\u2019t have one. She layered a plate with paper towels, placed the strips on top, and popped it into the microwave.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t cook often?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary. I cook quite frequently, out of sheer necessity. Unfortunately, most of what I produce is inedible. Daniel\u2019s cooking is even worse than mine, if such a thing is possible. Lucas can grill quite well when pushed to it, but in the kitchen his idea of a meal involves a raw piece of meat, burned on the outside. Adrino was our cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead. About nine months ago.\u201d</p><p>She paused to look at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Henry nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Karina resumed stirring the pancake batter. \u201cHow did he die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas bit him in half.\u201d</p><p>She stopped. \u201cWas he a member of your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was. He was Lucas\u2019s cousin on his mother\u2019s side, and my stepbrother.\u201d</p><p>Karina found the griddle and set it on the burners to heat up. She stirred the apples with a wooden spoon, then pulled the bacon out of the microwave and peeled it from the paper towels.</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d Henry offered.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She poured the pancake batter on the griddle in quick drips and watched the first pancake puff and bubble at the edges. \u201cWhy did Lucas kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrino tried to murder Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Henry smiled, a quick baring of teeth, meaningless and flat like a mask. \u201cAdrino had raped a woman on base. As a punishment, Arthur had him chained for two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChained?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the courtyard. Eventually Adrino was let off the chain and everything went quite well, until he attempted to solidify Arthur\u2019s blood during the last Christmas dinner. In retrospect, we should have expected it. His subspecies is prone to rashness.\u201d Henry smiled again. \u201cYou will find that we\u2019re a violent, vicious lot, Lady Karina. All of us hate Arthur, hate each other, hate who we are, what we are, why we are. This hate is so deep within us, it\u2019s in our bones. Lucas hates stronger than most of us for his own reasons. But Lucas is also far more controlled in his rages than he lets on. He recognizes the simple truth: Arthur is the glue that holds us together. Arthur makes mistakes, and he\u2019s brutal, but he\u2019s also fair. Every tribe must have a leader. Without the leader there is chaos. May I just mention that your pancakes smell delicious? I don\u2019t suppose there is any way I could steal one right now, is there?\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later, the pancakes were done, the bacon was cooked, and Karina crossed the room to her daughter.</p><p>\u201cEmily? Wake up . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d Emily clutched Karina around the neck and hung on with surprisingly fierce strength.</p><p>Karina scooped her off the couch and held her close, afraid to hug the tiny body too hard. \u201cI\u2019m here, baby. I love you.\u201d Emily never said \u201cmommy.\u201d It was always \u201cmom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t leave?\u201d</p><p>A hard knot formed in Karina\u2019s throat. \u201cLeaving\u201d was Emily\u2019s euphemism for dying. Her daughter thought she had died.</p><p>\u201cI will try very hard not to,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Emily hung on, and Karina gently carried her into the kitchen. \u201cI made your favorite apples.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Emily\u2019s hold on her neck eased. A few seconds later she allowed herself to be put into a chair at the table.</p><p>Daniel marched into the kitchen. \u201cFood.\u201d</p><p>Henry nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Daniel pulled out a chair, sat, and reached for the pancakes.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait for Lucas,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>\u201cFuck Lucas.\u201d</p><p>Karina looked at Daniel. Henry sighed. Daniel looked back at them, glanced at Emily, and shrugged. \u201cThey don\u2019t like it that I swear. Do you mind if I swear?\u201d</p><p>Emily shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSee, she doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Lucas loomed in the doorway. One moment it was empty and the next he was just there, green eyes watching her every move with a hungry light. Karina took her chair, trying to ignore it, but his gaze clasped her like an invisible chain. She looked back at him. Yes, I belong to you. You don\u2019t have to ram it down my throat.</p><p>Emily\u2019s eyes had grown big. She shied a little when Lucas stepped to the table, aware of his movements. Karina read fear in her daughter\u2019s face and reached over to hold her hand. He\u2019d given Emily no reason to fear him, yet she was clearly scared, almost as if she sensed on some primal level that he was a threat.</p><p>Lucas sat next to Karina, opposite of Daniel, and reached for the pancakes. She watched him load his plate: four pancakes, four links of sausage, six strips of bacon . . . The plate would hold no more. He pondered it, frustrated, then piled the apples atop the pancakes and drenched the whole thing in maple syrup.</p><p>It was good that she had made enough for ten people.</p><p>Lucas sliced pancakes with his fork, pierced a slice of the apple, and maneuvered the whole thing into his mouth. Karina sat on the edge of her seat, listening to the elevated tempo of her own heartbeat, watching him chew, and waited for him to throw the plate across the table. She wanted them to like the food; no, she desperately needed the three of them to like the food. Her survival depended on it.</p><p>Lucas swallowed. \u201cGood,\u201d he said and reached for more.</p><p>Karina slumped a little in her chair, unable to hide her relief.</p><p>\u201cGood? It\u2019s fucking divine,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first decent meal we\u2019ve had in weeks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas leveled a heavy stare at him but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cWhat, baby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI left my backpack at Jill\u2019s house. It has my school stuff in it.\u201d</p><p>The three men ate, watching her.</p><p>\u201cThat will be okay, baby,\u201d Karina said. \u201cYou have to change schools anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we live here now and you\u2019ll go to a special school.\u201d The words came out painfully.</p> <p>\u201cDo I have to ride the bus?\u201d</p><p>Karina swallowed a lump that had formed in her throat. Acknowledging where they were was hard, as if she were driving nails into her own coffin. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do we have to stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is where I work now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother is a slave,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cLucas owns her.\u201d</p><p>If only she could have reached across the table, she would have hit him with a closed fist so it would hurt. Karina forced neutrality into her face, pulling it on like a mask. Show nothing. Betray no weakness.</p> <p>\u201cIs a slave better than a payroll supervisor?\u201d Emily asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not that different,\u201d Karina lied. So many times before she had thought she worked like a slave, pulling in long hours, picking up project after project, perpetually behind, trying to get to the bottom of her to-do stack. She thought she had experienced the worst life could throw at her. All of it seemed so pointless now. Her memories belonged to someone else, a happier, flightier, younger person. She had a new life now and new priorities, chief of which was the welfare of her daughter. She had to keep Emily safe.</p><p>Emily poked her pancake with a fork. \u201cWhat about the house? All our stuff is there . . . my Hello Kitty blanket . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get new things.\u201d She cast a quick glance around the table but none of the three men said anything to break down her fragile promises.</p><p>\u201cWill I get my own room?\u201d</p><p>Karina looked to Lucas. Please. Don\u2019t separate me from my daughter.</p><p>He wiped his mouth with a napkin, his movements unhurried. \u201cYou have to stay at the main house. You can come to visit your mother on weekends. We\u2019ll set up a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to stay with Mom.\u201d Emily\u2019s voice was tiny.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>Emily bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a good place at the main house. A room you\u2019ll share with a nice girl. Toys. Clothes. Everything you need. If anybody tries to be mean to you, tell them you belong to Lucas. Everyone is afraid of me. Nobody will harm you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>Lucas stopped eating. Karina tensed.</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me no?\u201d Lucas asked. His voice was calm.</p><p>Emily raised her chin with all of the defiance a six-year-old could muster. \u201cI\u2019m tired and I\u2019m scared, and I\u2019m not going. I\u2019m staying with my mom. Are you going to yell at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my dad. My dad left.\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced at Karina.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a widow,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your father, but I\u2019m in charge,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cYou will obey me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Emily asked.</p><p>Lucas leaned forward and stared at Emily. \u201cBecause I am big, strong, and scary. And you are very small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not nice.\u201d Emily held his gaze, but Karina could tell it wasn\u2019t out of courage. Emily had simply frozen like a baby rabbit looking into the eyes of a wolf.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a nice world and I can\u2019t always be nice,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cBut I will try and I won\u2019t be mean to you without a reason.\u201d</p><p>Karina put her hand on his forearm, trying to tear his attention away from Emily. It worked; he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d It took all of her will to keep the tremble out of her voice. \u201cPlease let her stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to stay,\u201d Emily said. \u201cI\u2019ll be good. I\u2019ll do all my chores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>A half hour later, breakfast was finished. The men rose one by one, rinsed their plates, and loaded the dishes and silverware into the dishwasher with surprising efficiency. Karina put the last of the food away. Henry had stepped out, but Daniel remained in the kitchen, leaning against the counter, watching her. Lucas loomed by the door, watching Daniel.</p><p>\u201cCan I go outside?\u201d Emily asked.</p><p>Karina paused. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Daniel arched an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cBecause there are scary birds out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are scary birds? What kind of scary birds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cThe net keeps everything out.\u201d</p><p>Karina remembered the bird\u2019s body hitting the invisible fence. \u201cWhat if she walks into this net?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d have to walk a mile and a half down the hill before she reached it,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cI want to see the birds,\u201d Emily said. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>It would get them out of the house, away from the men and out into the open. She could get a better look around. Maybe she would see a road, or a house, some avenue of escape. Karina wiped her hands with a towel and hung it on the back of the chair. \u201cOkay. But we\u2019re going to stay by the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>All she wanted was the illusion of being alone with her daughter. He wouldn\u2019t let her have it. Karina clenched her teeth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cBite your tongue. It will come in handy.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave him a flat stare. For a moment they stood still, then Daniel rolled his eyes and casually wandered out of the kitchen into the side hallway. Lucas moved in the opposite direction, through the doorway. Karina took Emily by the hand. \u201cCome on, baby.\u201d</p><p>The hallway cut through the house, straight to the door. They passed rooms: a library filled with books from floor to ceiling on the right, a large room with a giant flat-screen TV on the left, and then Lucas opened the door and they stepped on the porch into the sunlight. The yard was grass, small scrawny oaks and brush flanking it on both sides. A path led down the hill into the distance. To the left a huge oak out of sync with the rest of the scrub forest and probably planted, spread its branches.</p><p>A shaggy brown dog stepped out from behind the oak. As tall as a Great Dane, it trotted forward on massive legs, its long tail held straight behind it. There was something odd in the way it walked, waddling slightly, more like a bear than a dog.</p><p>Karina stepped between Emily and the beast.</p><p>The animal stopped. Large brown eyes stared at them from a massive head crowned with round ears.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s tame,\u201d Lucas said behind her.</p><p>The meld of dog and bear peered at Lucas and let out a short snort.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like it when I phase into my attack variant,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cIt weirds him out for a couple of days. Cedric, don\u2019t be a dick. Let the kid pet you.\u201d</p><p>Another snort. She couldn\u2019t really blame the dog. Considering how Lucas looked in his \u201cattack variant\u201d it was a wonder the dog stuck around at all.</p><p>Cedric pondered them for a long moment and waddled over. Emily stretched out her hand. Karina\u2019s insides clenched into a tight knot.</p><p>Cedric nudged Emily\u2019s hand with his nose, snorted again, and bumped the bulge in the front pocket of her hoodie.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in your pocket?\u201d Karina asked.</p><p>Emily dug into her pocket and pulled out a half-eaten apple.</p><p>Not again. Karina kept her voice gentle. \u201cEmily, you know you\u2019re not supposed to have that . . .\u201d</p><p>Cedric sniffed at the apple. His mouth gaped open, revealing huge teeth.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t hurt her,\u201d Lucas said with absolute certainty in his voice.</p><p>Emily held the apple out. Very carefully, almost gently, Cedric swiped it off her hand, sat on his behind, and raised the fruit to his mouth, holding it with long, dark claws. The black nose sniffed the apple, the jaws opened and closed, and the beast bit a small chunk from the fruit and chewed in obvious pleasure.</p><p>\u201cHe likes it!\u201d Emily announced and jumped down off the steps into the yard. \u201cCome on, Cedric!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Karina took a step to follow.</p><p>\u201cJust to the tree.\u201d</p><p>The oak was barely fifty feet away. Karina bit her lip. Her instincts told her to clutch her child and not let go, but Emily needed to feel normal. She needed to play. Her daughter didn\u2019t understand how precarious their situation was, she had no idea how vulnerable they were, and Karina had to keep it that way.</p><p>Emily was looking at her. \u201cCan I go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You can go.\u201d</p><p>Emily headed toward the tree. Cedric finished his apple in a hurried gulp, rolled to his paws, and followed her to the tree.</p><p>Lucas leaned on a porch post next to Karina. She had expected him to somehow shrink in daylight, as if he were some sort of evil creature of the night whose power faded with the sun, but he remained just as big and menacing. If anything, the sun made it worse\u2014she could see every detail of his severe face. Everything about him, the way he leaned against the rail, the way muscle bulged on his arms and chest, the way he surveyed the yard, inspecting his territory, communicated predator.</p><p>Lucas raised his face to the sun, closed his eyes, and smiled. The smile lasted only a moment, gone like a leaf blown by the breeze, but she had seen it. He was handsome and the danger he emanated sharpened that beauty to a lethal edge. He was beautiful in the same deadly way a tiger was beautiful, and now she was locked in a cage with him.</p><p>If he was on her side, nobody would ever bother them.</p><p>At the tree, Emily picked up a twig and tossed it. Cedric looked at the twig and back at her, slightly puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWhat is he?\u201d Karina asked.</p><p>\u201cA bear-dog. We played with their genetics a few generations back. He\u2019s gentle like a collie with the kids and he\u2019s a lot smarter than an average dog. What\u2019s the problem with her having an apple?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Karina sat on the stairs. \u201cShe hoards food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to tell him. The less he knew about them, the less information he could use against her. \u201cIt makes her feel safe.\u201d</p> <p>By the tree Emily clapped her hands and explained something to Cedric. He sat on his butt again, listening to her.</p><p>\u201cWas she adopted?\u201d Lucas asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t have expected him to know that adoptive children sometimes exhibited food hoarding. Now she had to explain more just to keep him from getting the wrong idea. \u201cIt happened after her father\u2019s death. It\u2019s not an eating disorder. She doesn\u2019t want extra food; she\u2019s just trying to control her environment. We handled it, but with everything that\u2019s happened she might have relapsed. Please don\u2019t berate her or yell at her for it. It . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes things worse,\u201d he finished for her. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me have her,\u201d she said, suddenly desperate. \u201cLet me have her here with me. I thought I lost her on that fire escape. You have everything else\u2014my freedom, my body, everything\u2014and I just want one thing. Just let me keep my baby.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas frowned. He didn\u2019t seem vicious now. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this to be an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep her out of the way . . .\u201d</p><p>Cedric snarled at the bushes, baring his teeth, and lunged into the thicket.</p><p>Karina jumped to her feet. Before her knees had straightened, Lucas had leaped over the railing and was sprinting to the tree.</p><p>Emily stumbled back. Her mouth gaped in a surprised O.</p><p>Karina ran but she was so agonizingly slow.</p> <p>Lucas reached Emily, pushed her back, out of the way, and crashed through the underbrush.</p><p>Karina lunged forward. Her hand closed about Emily\u2019s shoulder. She grabbed her daughter and backed away, keeping her hand on her pocket, feeling the hard knife handle through the fabric of her jeans.</p><p>Lucas jerked something out of the bushes. Long and green and brown, it writhed in his hand, flailing, the elongated olive tail brushing the ground. He roared, a deep growl that nearly made her jump. \u201cHenry!\u201d</p><p>The thing jerked, its throat caught in Lucas\u2019s hand. He turned and Karina finally saw it: it resembled a freakishly large bearded dragon lizard bristling with inch-long spikes on its cheeks and sides. As the creature twisted, a crest snapped open along its back, the spikes standing up like the razor-sharp fins of some deepwater fish. The lizard creature clawed at Lucas\u2019s arm with long black claws. Blood welled in the scratches.</p><p>\u201cA monster!\u201d Emily squeaked.</p><p>\u201cNo, just a big lizard.\u201d Karina kept a death grip on Emily.</p><p>Behind her the door burst open. Daniel charged onto the porch. His face contorted. Something brushed past Karina like a sudden draft. The beast jerked and hung motionless, its legs abruptly gone limp.</p><p>Lucas carried the lizard to the porch. \u201cHenry!\u201d</p> <p>Henry burst onto the porch.</p><p>Lucas slammed the lizard down onto the porch boards. The creature blinked but lay completely still. Henry knelt by the lizard. His hands touched the back of the creature\u2019s skull. He closed his eyes, focused for a long moment, and glanced up. \u201cIts mind is inert. It didn\u2019t transmit.\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked at him. \u201cSure?\u201d</p><p>Henry pushed his glasses back up his nose. \u201cYes. If it transmitted, there would be evidence of a spike in neural activity.\u201d</p><p>Lucas raised his fist and brought it down like a hammer. She barely had enough warning to spin Emily around before his fist crushed the lizard\u2019s skull, flattening it like an empty Coke can.</p><p>\u201cDaniel, call the main house.\u201d Lucas turned to her. \u201cTake Emily and go to our room. Don\u2019t come out until I get you.\u201d</p><p>Karina didn\u2019t ask what was going on. She just picked Emily up, ran inside the house, and didn\u2019t stop until the door of Lucas\u2019s room closed behind her.</p><p>The day burned down to the afternoon. Emily investigated the room, then she whined about being bored, and finally she fell asleep in the overstuffed chair in the corner. At first Karina listened for every noise and creak outside the door. Her nerves were wound so tight, she could barely sit still.</p><p>If the creature in the bushes had been just an ordinary lizard, Lucas would\u2019ve killed it right away. She had no doubt of it. No, this beast had created an emergency. She had no idea why and that somehow made everything so much worse. Eventually her own anxiety wore her out and she sank into a light sleep, a kind of wakeful drowsiness, where every stray noise made her raise her head.</p><p>The room was so quiet. Karina closed her eyes for a moment, opened them, and then Lucas was there, walking across the room. She hadn\u2019t heard the door open.</p><p>Lucas scooped Emily out of the chair. Karina surged to her feet. \u201cWhere are you taking her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a different room,\u201d he said quietly and went out. She followed him down the hallway to a small bedroom. A bed with a red comforter stood against one wall, next to a bookcase filled with children\u2019s books. A desk offered a small computer with a flat-screen monitor.</p><p>He\u2019d made her a room. He\u2019d changed his mind.</p><p>Lucas deposited Emily on the bed and stepped out. Karina pulled the blanket over Emily\u2019s shoulders. She was so tiny on the bed. Karina\u2019s mind replayed Lucas clenching the lizard\u2019s throat. One squeeze and Emily would be dead.</p><p>He waited for her now, in the hallway. Karina made herself step away from the bed and walked out. Lucas closed the door, locked it, and handed her the key. \u201cThis is for her protection. Our room doesn\u2019t have a lock. Daniel is pissed off tonight, and I\u2019m feeling surly, which makes the house a dangerous place to be, so it\u2019s best she stays in this room. This is for tonight only. Tomorrow she will go to the main house.\u201d</p><p>But the room\u2014it was a child\u2019s room, made for a little girl. The blankets and the pillowcases looked brand-new and the rug still had the price sticker on it.</p><p>So he hadn\u2019t changed his mind. She had from now until morning to convince him to let her keep her daughter. Karina opened her mouth and said the only thing she could think of. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. \u201cI could eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny preference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeat would be nice.\u201d He turned away.</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her over his shoulder. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Karina asked him softly. \u201cWhat was that thing?\u201d</p><p>Lucas grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s a long explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I want to know.\u201d Whatever he would tell her had to be better than not knowing.</p><p>Lucas sighed. \u201cThe woman who poisoned you has friends. Her people are looking for our base, so they are sending scouts out. The lizard was one of them. It\u2019s basically a walking camera\u2014it records what it sees and then transmits the information to its owners in short bursts. Luckily we caught this one before any transmissions had gone out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if it had sent this transmission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d be evacuating,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cWe still may. We\u2019ll know more in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Karina hugged her shoulders. \u201cLucas, where are we?\u201d</p><p>He was looking directly at her. \u201cWe\u2019re on base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is this base? I\u2019ve seen those birds. There are no birds like that in North America.\u201d</p><p>Lucas examined her face for a long breath. \u201cYou want the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cYou asked for it. As the planet rotates, fluctuations between the forces of gravity and nuclear reactions on the subleptron and subquark level cause a ripple effect in reality, where time and space are not constant but dynamic. Parts of space-time become incompatible with the current reality and are discarded. In essence, Earth continuously sheds chunks of itself. They linger for a time and dissipate, some slower, some faster. We\u2019re in one such chunk\u2014we call them fragments. It was shed sometime during the late Pliocene, approximately two and a half million years ago in what is now Texas. This pocket is stable and shouldn\u2019t begin to dissipate for another couple thousand years. Can you make cubed steak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Karina stared at him, sure she had misheard.</p><p>\u201cI asked if you can cook cubed steak. I just realized I\u2019d really like some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can. You\u2019re not joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the steak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the fragments.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head.</p><p>This was just insane. \u201cSo we\u2019re in an alternate reality? Like in a parallel dimension? Like in Star Trek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. A mirror dimension is a self-contained, complete reality. We\u2019re in a dimensional fragment.\u201d Lucas leaned back against the wall. \u201cOkay, think of an onion. The inner layers are white, and the outer layer is brown. Suppose the outer layer rots. The onion makes a replacement layer, identical to this outer one, and sheds the rotten layer in bits and pieces, some big, some tiny. We are in a piece of that rotten layer.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. If he wasn\u2019t lying, they weren\u2019t anywhere near Oklahoma. They weren\u2019t even on the same planet. Escape was impossible.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about it too much,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cSubquantum mechanics will drive you insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get back? To normal Earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends on how close the layer is to its reality. The motel where you were attacked was in a layer that had barely begun to separate, so we could cross in and out easily. But this pocket has peeled much too far away for you and I to exit on our own. We need someone to rip it. To open a gateway.\u201d Lucas pushed off from the wall.</p><p>\u201cBut we can go back?\u201d Surely they had to go back occasionally. Their clothes had tags; their plates had Corelle stamped on the back. Microwaves and refrigerators didn\u2019t sprout on prehistoric trees, which meant the people of Daryon had to pop back and forth from the normal Earth to here and back on a whim.</p><p>Lucas leaned toward her. His gaze fixed on her. Suddenly he was occupying too much space. She took a step back, her spine pressing against the wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A slow smile curved Lucas\u2019s lips. \u201cYes. You can go back. But never without me. If you ever try, I will find you and bring you back.\u201d His smile grew wider. \u201cAnd then all bets are off.\u201d</p><p>He was looking at her with an open sexual hunger, so intense, for a second she didn\u2019t think it could be sincere. She froze, terrified. And then a small part of her responded to it. For a second, Karina wondered what it would be like to cross the distance between them, laugh right into that stare, and walk away, leaving him standing there like an idiot. But as long as he controlled Emily, she could do nothing.</p><p>He leaned forward a quarter inch, like a predatory cat about to pounce.</p> <p>In her mind, Karina gulped and fled down the hallway, her heart hammering too fast and too loud. But showing weakness wasn\u2019t an option. Lucas had told her before that he was a predator. If she ran, the predator would chase.</p><p>She raised her face toward him. \u201cIf I do go back without you, don\u2019t find me.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to the side, like a dog, studying her. \u201cOr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a low rich sound that sent shivers of alarm down her spine. \u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>She turned her back to him and forced herself to walk slowly toward the kitchen.</p><p>Lucas tilted his head and watched Karina retreat down the hallway. The look in her eyes, the angle of her face, the way she stood, everything communicated defiance. She challenged him. She had no idea how exciting this made her. He wanted to pin her against the wall, until she acknowledged that he was strong enough and powerful enough for her. He wanted to kiss and taste and grind and own. Different standards, he reminded himself. For him it would be flirting. For her, it would be a prelude to rape.</p><p>Lucas looked at the ceiling. He knew exactly where this violent impulse was coming from. It was an evolutionary echo, the same echo that told him to murder every other male in the house and then hunt her until she gave in. He made a choice to reject it daily. Strangely, it wasn\u2019t getting any easier.</p><p>Henry\u2019s light steps approached him. \u201cPhysical assault is probably not the best way to go,\u201d Henry murmured.</p><p>Sometimes Lucas could swear the man could read thoughts, even though every Mind Bender Lucas had ever met maintained it was impossible. \u201cPlaying in my head?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Henry smiled at him. \u201cYour fists are clenched and it\u2019s written all over your face.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d figured as much. \u201cShe\u2019s beginning to ask questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little faster than I expected.\u201d Henry frowned. \u201cI wiped almost twelve hours of severe pain from her. Usually a wipe of that extent leaves people inert longer. You\u2019re pacing the explanations?\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. \u201cNot my first time.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d helped bring people over a few times before. A human mind could only accept so much. If he flooded her with the information contradicting her view of reality, the impact of it, combined with her physical trauma, would cause her to snap under the pressure. Her body was at its limits already, fighting the poison and coping with his venom and its consequences, which would soon follow.</p><p>Lucas started down the hallway. He needed a shower and some time away from everyone to soothe the excitement rushing through his veins.</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d Henry called.</p><p>Lucas turned.</p> <p>His cousin looked at him for a long moment. \u201cBe kind.\u201d</p><p>An hour later Karina put the dinner on the table. The encounter in the hallway kept replaying in her head and she couldn\u2019t decide if she\u2019d botched it or handled it well. Emily still slept. Henry had said the fatigue was normal, but she worried all the same.</p><p>\u201cCubed steak.\u201d Henry slid into his seat. \u201c \u2018Beef. It\u2019s what\u2019s for dinner.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Karina took her seat. Lucas sat to the right of her. Too close. She should have served the dinner in the dining room instead of the kitchen. The bigger table would\u2019ve given her more space.</p><p>Lucas crowded her, drinking in her anxiety. Karina swallowed, unable to help herself. He was simply too large and he watched her constantly. Even when she couldn\u2019t see him, she couldn\u2019t get rid of the pressure his gaze brought. He leaned toward her, emanating menace, and she shrank from him out of sheer self-defense.</p><p>His lips stretched and Lucas showed her his teeth, large and sharp. \u201cAm I scary?\u201d</p><p>She met his stare. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you know that already. Making me admit it makes you cruel. Corn or beans?\u201d</p><p>He drew back. His eyes widened and for a moment the burden of his presence eased. \u201cCorn.\u201d</p><p>She passed the dish of corn to him.</p><p>Daniel sauntered into the room. While Henry migrated from place to place and Lucas stalked, his steps soundless and full of fierce grace, Daniel strode as if his feet did the ground a great favor. He didn\u2019t walk but floated, devastating in his beauty and perfectly aware of it.</p><p>Daniel took a seat directly opposite her. He speared a steak and dropped it on his plate. \u201cAre you going to do this every day? Cook the dinner, be the dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Karina said with a calm she didn\u2019t feel.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you totally spineless? What do you think sucking up will earn you? Look at him.\u201d Daniel pointed at Lucas. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go.\u201d Henry rolled his eyes.</p><p>Daniel pushed off from the table, balancing his chair on its back legs, and crossed his arms. \u201cNo, I want her to enlighten me. How deeply has Stockholm syndrome set in?\u201d</p><p>Karina put down her fork. Her instinct told her that whatever she said next would define her place in this house. The idea of some flattering subterfuge crossed her mind and died. She wondered if she should say nothing at all. In the end, she decided on honesty.</p><p>\u201cI understand that I can die at any moment. Lucas\u2019s cousin died at the last Christmas dinner. For all I know, Lucas might die tomorrow, killed by your enemies or by your family members. Without Lucas I have no worth. My daughter is here because of me. If I\u2019m no longer needed, I expect that neither will she be. I\u2019ve seen enough of your family to realize we won\u2019t be allowed to leave. You will dispose of us as if we never existed. I have to find some way to make myself valued beyond Lucas. Then, if he dies, both my daughter and I might survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you do this by becoming our housekeeper?\u201d Daniel grinned. \u201cCooking, cleaning up after us? Tell me, how low will you stoop? If I leave some shit in the bathroom for you, will you clean it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Karina said. \u201cYou\u2019ll clean your own shit. Unless you\u2019re sitting in a pile of it right now, you must know how to aim for the toilet and wipe your own ass.\u201d</p><p>The amusement in Daniel\u2019s eyes crystallized into anger. \u201cIf you want to ingratiate yourself, there\u2019s a much easier way of doing it. You can come over here right now and suck my cock. That will put you into my good graces much faster than scrubbing the sink.\u201d</p><p>Karina glanced at Lucas. He cut a piece of steak, chewed with obvious pleasure, and threw her a look that said, Sit tight.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t a fool, Daniel.\u201d Henry snagged another roll from the bread basket. \u201cThese are delicious. She knows that servicing you would put you and Lucas at each other\u2019s throats. You\u2019re playing this game for your personal gratification, but Lucas depends on her for his survival. She\u2019d have to be mentally deficient to choose you over him.\u201d</p><p>Daniel shifted to Lucas. \u201cSo what does his lordship think of all this? Your snack has you buried already. Are you flattered?\u201d</p><p>Lucas cut into his third steak.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do in her place? Would you mop the floors, O mighty one?\u201d</p><p>Lucas thought about it. \u201cIn her place I would\u2019ve killed the two of you already. But I\u2019m not in her place. And I\u2019m not her. I\u2019m not smaller and weaker than everyone around me, nor do I have a child\u2019s life in my hands. She\u2019s being prudent, given her situation.\u201d</p><p>Daniel smirked. \u201cNever thought you\u2019d be so agreeable at the idea of your own death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all must come to terms with it one way or another,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll help you on your way, then, since you\u2019re all prepared. Seems a shame to waste the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you can?\u201d Lucas asked with genuine interest.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Daniel,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThat kind of talk will end with you breaking a nail or messing up your hair.\u201d</p><p>Daniel ignored him and glared at Lucas. \u201cBring it.\u201d</p><p>Lucas put down his fork, smiled, and shoved the table aside like it weighed nothing. Karina scrambled out of the way. Lucas\u2019s huge hand clamped Daniel\u2019s throat. Daniel clawed at Lucas\u2019s forearm. The bigger man jerked him off his feet, shook him the way a dog shakes a rat, and slammed him down onto the table. Dishes flew. Trapped in a corner between the counter and the stove, Karina threw her hands in front of her face. A ceramic dish shattered next to her, spraying green beans over the counter.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Henry screamed. \u201cNot inside! Not inside!\u201d</p><p>Red marks sliced Lucas\u2019s forearms. His skin bulged as if his bones were trying to break free.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d he snarled. \u201cHurt me more. Is that all you got?\u201d His hand still locked on Daniel\u2019s throat, he pulled him up and smashed him onto the table again. \u201cNeed some more?\u201d Daniel\u2019s face had grown bright red. Lucas jerked him up. \u201cNot done yet?\u201d He drove Daniel back down.</p><p>With a thunderous snap, the table broke in two. The two halves fell apart and Daniel crashed onto the floor, Lucas atop him, still crushing his windpipe. Daniel\u2019s feet drummed the ground. Veins bulged on his face, his skin turning magenta. His eyes rolled back into his skull.</p><p>\u201cHere we go.\u201d Henry sighed. \u201cWe lose all the good dishes this way.\u201d He showed Karina the bread basket. \u201cAt least I saved the rolls. And don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m keeping Emily asleep.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas released Daniel. The blond man lay unmoving. Lucas stepped over him, his eyes blazing with fury. His gaze locked on her. \u201cBedtime,\u201d Lucas growled and lunged at her. An unstoppable force swept Karina off her feet and she found herself slung over Lucas\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d She struggled to pull free.</p><p>He swung around to face Henry. \u201cLeave the mess for when he wakes up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Henry saluted him with a roll.</p><p>Lucas headed out of the kitchen. Karina tried to grab onto the door frame, but her fingers slipped and she was carried through the darkness of the hallway to the bedroom.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>The room swung as Lucas slapped the door closed. Karina expected him to hurl her on the bed but he lowered her to the floor. She stumbled, dizzy from being spun back and forth, and scrambled to get away. Steely fingers caught her arm. He held on to her and sniffed at the sleeve of her sweatshirt. \u201cGreen beans. You want a shower?\u201d</p><p>His tone was calm. She glanced at his face. All of the rage had gone out of him. He looked worn out, his fury muted to mere smoldering coals.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t have any clean clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a problem,\u201d Lucas agreed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d His sudden calm threw her off balance. She stood still, expecting him to swing at her or maybe roar into her face.</p><p>Lucas reached into the dresser and pulled out a white T-shirt. \u201cThat\u2019s the best I can do for now. I\u2019ll have something sent up from the main house in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She took the T-shirt. He didn\u2019t offer her any underwear. She would be naked under it.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Lucas pulled off his shirt and dropped it on the floor. Carved muscle bunched on his back. Nude, clothed\u2014he could rape her at any point. Clothes wouldn\u2019t provide much of a defense.</p> <p>He paused, his hand on the door of the bathroom. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d</p><p>Not if I can help it. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in here for hours,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shower stall is enclosed. You can take your clothes off and I\u2019ll see nothing.\u201d</p><p>For hours . . . Why would he be in the bathroom for hours? \u201cI thought you needed to feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but I won\u2019t be feeding for a while.\u201d</p><p>She followed him, despite knowing better, eager for any crumb of information. \u201cHow long is a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple of weeks. Maybe longer. Depends on how quickly you deal with my venom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause too much of my toxin at once will kill you.\u201d</p><p>She remembered his explanation from the night before. \u201cYou said your venom hurts you. Does it hurt now?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAlways?\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked at her. \u201cAlways. Worse after I am injured and much worse after I phase out of the attack variant. Sometimes I have seizures after phasing out.\u201d</p><p>If he hurt always, he would have to feed always . . . \u201cHow often do you . . .\u201d</p><p>As if reading her thoughts, he shrugged. \u201cOnce the optimal ratio of my venom to your hormones is reached in my blood, I\u2019ll need to feed every three weeks to maintain it. I won\u2019t be drinking as much as the last time. Come on. You need a shower and I need to sit down.\u201d</p><p>He stepped out of her way. During the day she had used the bathroom in the hallway, near the kitchen. She had assumed this one would be the same.</p><p>A room almost as big as the bedroom itself greeted her. A dark green hot tub was sunk into the sealed wooden floor. Beyond it a shower stall stretched the entire length of the wall. Its frame matched the hot tub, but the stall itself consisted of wide, dark green panels, either glass or plastic, thick and frosted from the inside. Lucas hadn\u2019t lied\u2014he might be able to discern her shadow, but that was about it. To the right was another stall, which she assumed hid the toilet, next to a large sink.</p><p>Lucas flipped a switch on the wall and the hot tub jets started, whipping the water into froth.</p><p>The shower called to Karina. To go on and disrobe while he was in the tub was insane, but she was covered in food and his scent from the previous night still stained her skin. She could wash him off.</p><p>Karina bit her lip and slipped past Lucas to the shower. She closed the door and saw a latch. Relief flooded her. She could lock herself in and for a few minutes pretend she was safe. She slid the latch closed and almost cried.</p><p>The shower stall was divided into a dressing area and the shower itself, separated by a curtain. Karina dug into the pocket of her jeans and fished out the knife. The blade seemed so small compared to Lucas. If she stuck it into his back, he might not even notice. She put it on the small metal shelf next to the soap and, pulled off her clothes, dropping them into a rumpled pile on the bench. An array of shampoo bottles and soaps waited her selection. She took the bottle with the picture of a green apple on the side, picked up a bar of soap at random, and stepped into the shower. Jets surrounded her on three sides. She turned the big wheel of the faucet and a wide sheet of water spilled on her from above in a warm, soothing waterfall. She dropped the shampoo and the soap. All around her water sprayed and cascaded, drenching her, washing away the scent of warm copper. She stepped into the deluge, closed her eyes, and swayed.</p><p>Lucas slid into the hot water. He liked it near scalding. It wasn\u2019t quite hot enough, but it was getting there. The currents pummeled his body. He switched the two nearest jets off. The sharp claws of pain that scraped his ribs dulled to a low ache as he healed. His right arm still throbbed. Daniel was getting stronger.</p><p>One day one of them would get careless and they might finish each other off. Lucas closed his eyes and submerged. There were worse ways to go than being killed by your brother.</p><p>The rage that had driven him these past few days was gone, burned out in an adrenaline rush of violence.</p><p>He came up for air and settled with his head on the ledge, positioned in the dip of the shelf, the only place he could sit with the water lapping at his neck.</p><p>So tired . . .</p><p>The healing was draining his inner resources and he felt thin and weak, as if all of his muscles were a threadbare shirt hanging off his bones. From here he could see the door and the shower stall. She was in there. Naked. Wet. A fruity synthetic scent teased him\u2014she was washing her hair. He pictured her body under the water, her hands sliding over her breasts and down . . .</p><p>A dull thud made him lift his head. In the shower, a dark shadow slumped, pressed against the glass.</p><p>It had hit her finally. He\u2019d waited the whole day for it.</p><p>Lucas climbed out of the hot tub. The shower-stall door was locked. He hit it with his palm and the lock popped open. Karina lay curled in a corner of the shower, a small wet clump. Her legs shivered. Her skin had gained a pale, almost gray tint. He scooped her off the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she stuttered. Her lips had turned blue. Not a good sign.</p><p>He bent down. She lashed out. He caught a glint of metal and pulled back, letting the knife blade miss him. Where had she even gotten one? Ah, yes. The kitchen. He plucked the knife out of her fingers and picked her up off the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She pushed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He carried her out. Her wet skin was ice-cold against his.</p><p>She fought him even as he climbed into the tub and lowered her onto the shelf, sinking her up to her chin in the hot water. \u201cLet me go . . .\u201d</p><p>Afraid to agitate her any further, he put the full width of the tub between them, giving her room. No need to strain her. If she passed out, the chances of her survival would drop to almost nothing.</p><p>It took a full three minutes before her teeth stopped chattering. She looked at him. \u201cEverything hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour body is reacting to the venom,\u201d he said. \u201cHot water will help. It soothes the muscles. It\u2019s normal.\u201d Technically everything he said was true. He just didn\u2019t go into the rest of the details. Not yet.</p><p>A short bitter laugh slipped from her lips. \u201cNormal? Nothing about this is normal.\u201d</p><p>True. Not for her anyway. For him, it was business as usual. \u201cThirsty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He waded through the tub, reached for the small fridge beside it, and extracted a bottle of water.</p><p>She took the bottle, clamped the plastic cap in her teeth, twisted it off, and drank, draining nearly a third in a single long draft. That\u2019s it . . . Drink, Karina.</p><p>He recalled Galatea\u2019s first time. She\u2019d known exactly what would happen. She had been raised for precisely this purpose: to support him. And she loathed him for it. Hate would\u2019ve been too personal of a word; he didn\u2019t rank that high in her mental roster. Galatea hated the family; she hated Arthur because he was in charge; but Lucas she merely despised, disgusted by his touch. The older he got, the more he realized that sex with him was her way of revenge. In feeding he dominated her and she had no choice but to submit. In bed, for a few fleeting moments Galatea dominated him. That first time, when she cried and screamed as her body struggled with its initial dose of his venom, he had tried to hold her. She was so pretty, so fragile . . . He didn\u2019t want to break her. She had sensed that small spark of compassion in him, clutched on to it, and twisted it, used it against him again and again, until finally he could stand it no longer. Living with Galatea meant fighting a constant war. Living with Karina so far was like sparring with an honest fighter. She defied him, but she would never stick a knife in his back. She would try to stab him in plain view.</p><p>Lucas sank down into the water and closed his eyes. Thinking about Galatea left a foul taste in his mind. His ribs ached again. Drowsiness came, threatening to smother his mind like a heavy blanket.</p><p>Karina\u2019s voice tugged on him before he passed out. \u201cWhy are you being nice to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Nice\u2019 isn\u2019t in my vocabulary. I\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ribs are bruised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see him hit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to. I\u2019m a Demon, and he\u2019s an Acoustic. He can mimic voices and wrench the bones from my body with a focused sound wave.\u201d He raised his arms and stood up, showing her the long angry welts outlining his ribs. \u201cIf he really pushed, you\u2019d see bone shards puncturing the skin.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared at him in horrified silence. He sank back down and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you fight like that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no single reason. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t like something I\u2019ve done. Sometimes I do it because he annoys me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about today?\u201d</p><p>Lucas sighed. She wouldn\u2019t let him be. \u201cToday we fought because Daniel argued with Arthur. Daniel wants to evacuate. Arthur doesn\u2019t. Daniel insisted and Arthur bruised his pride. I took Arthur\u2019s side. Evacuating the base is costly. One scout isn\u2019t reason enough to do it. It\u2019s a bad sign\u2014we had seen scouts before in the neighboring fragments, but never this close. But we can\u2019t just run at the first hint of trouble.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cSo twisting bones out of your sockets is the way he demonstrates his displeasure at being pushed around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. Daniel wants to be taken seriously. So I treated him as a serious threat and made a big production of it. I was a substitute fight. What he really wanted was a shot at Arthur, which I can\u2019t let him take, because Arthur will kill him.\u201d Lucas thought of leaving it at that, but something nagged him to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. We live by different rules. In your other life, people undergo strict social conditioning that evolved over hundreds of years. They grow up in relative safety and under constant supervision. Parents, schools, peers\u2014all of their interactions fine-tune their behavior until they are . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe?\u201d she suggested.</p> <p>\u201cSocialized. But Daniel and I grew up as outcasts, with only the extremes of our behavior corrected\u2014so we don\u2019t murder someone whenever the urge strikes us. Our interactions are simpler than yours, less layered and closer to . . .\u201d Lucas grappled for the right word. When it came to him, he didn\u2019t like it. \u201cAnimals. Both of us reached sexual maturity a while ago. We have a strong urge to mate and have our own territory, our own families, and separate lives. Instead we\u2019re stuck with each other, in this house, with an illusion of privacy and an excess of aggression. And now there is you. Daniel doesn\u2019t really want you for your own sake. He wants you because he views me as competition and now I have something he doesn\u2019t. I am the only consequence he fears. He\u2019s hostile and defensive, and Arthur made him sit down and shut up today. Daniel had to vent and I\u2019m the only one who would put up with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cBecause he is my brother.\u201d</p><p>There was a tiny pause. \u201cBut he is not a Demon like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent fathers,\u201d he told her. \u201cAll of us within the House of Daryon carry genes from many different subspecies. Our mother was a Demon. My father was a normal human. Daniel\u2019s father was a powerful Acoustic. We both played the genetic lottery and got different prizes.\u201d</p><p>He left out rape, imprisonment, and murder. It sounded much better this way.</p> <p>\u201cDid Daniel hoard food as a child?\u201d</p><p>She was perceptive. He would have to remember that. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you took care of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Because nobody else would.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he just leave?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you? You don\u2019t seem to like living here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we have a job to do. We guard you from genocide.\u201d The mission overrode everything. A logical part of him assured Lucas that life outside of the original mandate existed. He just couldn\u2019t picture himself living it. \u201cAs long as we exist, you survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. This was another long explanation and he had no energy for it today. Nor did he want to shock her again. She\u2019d been through enough. \u201cMonsters exist. They call themselves Ordinators. They want to kill people like you. Normal ordinary people. We exist to keep them from succeeding. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what do they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want you to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do they hate us so much?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThey don\u2019t hate you. They simply want you not to be. It\u2019s a genetic cleansing, a mass extermination. They view the current situation as a mistake, which they\u2019re trying to correct. They feel that they are ordained to take your place. Subspecies 61, the \u2018normal\u2019 human, has no value to them, except maybe as an occasional food source in a pinch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re cannibals?\u201d Her voice spiked a little.</p><p>\u201cOnly some of them. I meant a food resource for their war animals. Do you know what a daeodon is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nasty breed of entelodon, a prehistoric boar. Picture a predatory pig, twelve feet long, seven feet tall at the shoulder, jaws like a crocodile. It eats anything, and once you mess with its genetics, it gets smart and breeds fast. They need a lot of meat.\u201d</p><p>When he opened his eyes, he found her looking at him. Karina sat submerged so deeply, only her face floated above the water. Warm color had returned to her cheeks. Her hair, slicked by the shower, swirled in the roiling water.</p><p>Mmmmm. Mine.</p><p>Lucas could reach out and pull her to him and run his hands up and down her body, to feel the heavy fullness of her breasts, the curve of her ass . . . If it wasn\u2019t for fatigue, and the fact that she trusted him, anchoring him to the spot, he might have done it.</p><p>His thoughts must\u2019ve reflected on his face, because she pulled as far from him as the tub would allow. A haunted look claimed her face, sharpening her features. Like a stray dog, he thought, shivering, scared, and ready to bite. He held the key to her: turn it one way and break her; turn it the other and the pressure would ease. He\u2019d been just like that a few years ago. The memory of being scared of everyone was still fresh.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t stop you. What consequences do you fear?\u201d Karina asked.</p><p>\u201cRight now I just don\u2019t want to fight with you,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI fight with Arthur, with Daniel, with Henry. I\u2019m tired.\u201d And he wanted her to stop jerking back every time he looked at her. It made him feel like he was a monster and he had enough help with that already.</p><p>\u201cIf you want peace, let me have Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She clenched her teeth.</p><p>\u201cMaybe later. Down the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not now?\u201d</p><p>Irritation flared in him. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t watch the two of you every moment of every day and you are stealing knives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe knife was for protection. I won\u2019t take another one. I won\u2019t try to stab you again . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me I\u2019m worried about.\u201d</p><p>She became utterly still. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cYou think I would hurt my own daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be the first one.\u201d Not by a long shot. \u201cShock is a bitch. Especially when mixed with venom fucking with your hormones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is everything I have.\u201d</p><p>She looked on the verge of tears. He forced himself to sound calmer. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you could slit her throat the second I gave her to you. You\u2019re both my responsibility. I said I would keep you safe. I don\u2019t want you to hurt her or yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had the knife since breakfast,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou sent me into the room with Emily. I didn\u2019t kill her. If I\u2019d tried, you couldn\u2019t have stopped me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry was monitoring your mind. Had your stress level spiked, he would\u2019ve shut you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen ask him if I tried to kill her or myself. I had the opportunity. I got the knife so I could hurt you. Not myself.\u201d</p><p>Lucas rose and crossed the tub, pinning her between his body and the tub wall. The feel of her body against his shoved him right to the edge. In his mind all the leashes he put on himself were snapping one by one. Karina turned to the side, trying to hide from him.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Karina looked at him. Lucas peered into her eyes, looking for some sort of indicator of sanity. \u201cIf you had a loaded gun in your hand, would you shoot me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If I killed you, I would be next. Either Daniel, Henry, or Arthur would murder me, and Emily would have nobody.\u201d</p><p>An honest rational answer. \u201cDo you want to die?\u201d He wanted her. He wanted to crush her in his arms and see her want him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He knew what he wanted. She was right there, caught against his chest. His heart was beating too fast.</p><p>\u201cI want to escape,\u201d she told him. \u201cI want to go back to my life.\u201d</p><p>She was sane and stable, or as sane as he could expect. Lucas released her and Karina scrambled away from him.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if I let you have your daughter, Karina?\u201d</p><p>She stopped. He read the answer on her face. Anything. She would do anything. She would let him do anything, and if he demanded, she would pretend to like it.</p><p>It was the answer his mother would\u2019ve given.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked hoarsely. He felt the tension hidden in her words, as if she stood on the edge of a chasm, waiting for him to push her in.</p><p>\u201cCan you bake a chocolate cake?\u201d</p><p>There was a tiny pause before she answered. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake one. For Daniel. It\u2019s his favorite.\u201d</p><p>She waited. When he didn\u2019t say anything, she finally asked, \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lucas waited for relief on her face, but she just sat there, clenched up. Still looking for the catch, he realized.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll really let me have her?\u201d He barely heard her voice. \u201cNo conditions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And the more fool he for it. Nothing good would come of it, not with the way they fought. Henry would think him insane. But Lucas felt weary. He didn\u2019t have the strength to fight yet another war. And he didn\u2019t want her to be miserable. \u201cMake a list of what you both will need, and I\u2019ll send it to the main house tomorrow. Last time I checked, you could buy Hello Kitty blankets in any department store . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Karina covered her face and cried.</p><p>He sat there and watched her shudder and sob, not knowing what to do with himself.

No more talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 6</p><p>Karina awoke alone. She dimly recalled seeing Lucas get out of the water, his huge muscled body wet, and feeling a sharp inner clench, the same clench that gripped her when he\u2019d caught her in the tub. She would\u2019ve liked to pretend it was fear or anxiety, but that would mean lying to herself. When he rose to show her the bruises Daniel had made, she stared at him for a moment too long and it wasn\u2019t to study his injured ribs.</p><p>Lucas had brought her a towel and when he turned away, giving her a fragile illusion of privacy, she\u2019d draped it around herself and escaped into the bedroom. He didn\u2019t follow her. She toweled off, slipped on the giant T-shirt he\u2019d given her, and slid into bed, curling under the blanket into a worried ball. Her nervousness should\u2019ve kept her awake, but her body simply gave out. Lucas took his time getting to bed and by the time he lay down on the other side, she was half asleep. He asked her something, but her feverish haze mugged her and dragged her under into a dreamless sleep.</p><p>Karina struggled to sit up. She felt the steady heat of her slowly burning, low fever. At least she was alive. She forced herself all the way up. Her head swam and the dizziness nearly took her back down.</p><p>Up. Up, come on, you can do it.</p><p>And now she was talking to herself. Outstanding.</p><p>Karina walked to the shower, swaying on wobbling feet. She\u2019d rinsed her underwear last night, and it still hung on the towel hook where she\u2019d left it. Karina touched it. Dry. She slipped the panties on and went to use the bathroom.</p><p>A couple of minutes later she made it to the sink. A new toothbrush, still in its case, waited for her. Karina stared at it.</p> <p>Lucas hadn\u2019t kidnapped her. He hadn\u2019t forced her into human slavery at gunpoint. She\u2019d been attacked by Rishe and the shark-toothed man, and she\u2019d been given a choice: to die or to live on Lucas\u2019s terms. She was a victim of circumstance. That didn\u2019t change the fact that Lucas owned her now.</p><p>The House of Daryon had stripped every shred of independence from her. She depended on Lucas for everything: her food, her safety, her clothes, the safety and survival of her daughter. He had the power to tell her when to go to bed, where to sleep, when to shower . . . He was protecting her and Emily from some sort of terrible enemy she couldn\u2019t understand and he could kill them both at a moment\u2019s notice. Any relaxation of the rules became a kindness on his part. A small thing, like a toothbrush, seemed like some great favor. But it wasn\u2019t, she told herself. It wasn\u2019t. It was a basic necessity for any human being.</p><p>Then again, she could\u2019ve been a slave without any freedom at all. She could\u2019ve lost her daughter. She could\u2019ve been raped. All he had to do was say, \u201cI\u2019ll give you your daughter,\u201d and she would\u2019ve done anything. The very fact that he thought to leave her a toothbrush was a small miracle.</p><p>Her own drive to survive was interfering with her sense of reality. Her instincts drove her to forge an emotional bond. The more Lucas liked her, the less likely he was to murder her or Emily. The more she liked him . . .</p><p>Karina took a deep breath. Lucas was physically overwhelming. The memory of his arms around her flashed before her. Lucas was . . . He was . . .</p><p>She stared at herself in the bathroom mirror. Just say it. Say it, acknowledge it, and walk away from it.</p><p>Seductive. Desirable. Shocking. He was masculine in the way women fantasized men to be: powerful, strong, dangerous. If she had met him at a party or in a professional setting, when he wore a suit and she wore something other than his T-shirt and a pair of underwear she\u2019d washed in the shower, she would\u2019ve sought him out. If he had spoken to her, she would\u2019ve been flattered.</p><p>For a while, after Jonathan\u2019s death, she was so wrapped up in guilt, and in Emily\u2019s well-being, she forgot men existed. It took almost a year before she became aware of them again: a man with a nice smile in the checkout line, a random stranger in good shape stepping out of the car in the parking spot next to her. A small part of her wanted to be noticed again and checked to see if she was. She was vulnerable and the way Lucas looked at her left her no doubt that if she gave him the tiniest indication that she wanted him, he would rush to oblige and mow down whatever stood in his way.</p><p>There was an odd desperation in Lucas under all that violence. Karina sensed a deep overpowering need to be . . . not accepted exactly, but to be liked. If she were ruthless, she would seduce him to make sure he would become dependent on her, but that kind of manipulation was beyond her. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to do it.</p><p>Karina looked at her reflection. She could practically see him in the mirror next to her. She could recall him with crystal clarity: every powerful line of his body; the promise of raw violence in the way he moved; the precise curve of his mouth, almost sardonic; the look in his eyes, the wild, unfiltered look of pure male lust. No, more than lust. Need.</p><p>Thinking of him was like playing with fire.</p><p>She had been married; she knew very well that a healthy relationship hinged on respect and constant compromise. With Lucas there could be no respect and no compromise, because they were not equals. He owned her. She was his property and once she opened the door to a relationship, he wouldn\u2019t let her close it.</p><p>Karina shut her eyes. She could picture herself wrapped in those powerful arms. It would feel safe, so safe. Her life was broken like a mirror and the shards kept cutting her fingers. She was desperate to forget that she was little more than a slave. She craved that illusion of safety as if it were a drug and she had to score a hit. She wanted to feel the heat of his strong body warming her skin. And she wanted to see him bend, to find out what it would be like to see the vulnerability of intimacy in those hard eyes. She was completely powerless and she needed to feel powerful, as a woman does who is wanted so badly by a man, he would do anything for her.</p><p>There it was. All of it, out in the open.</p><p>You\u2019re sick, she told her reflection.</p><p>Well, now it was out. She owned all of it.</p><p>She had to keep things in perspective. He was strong and she was weak and vulnerable and not in her right mind. She would take it one day at a time, wait until the last of the poison cleared out of her system, and when a chance to escape presented itself, she would take it\u2014and they would never find her and Emily again. And if she let herself buy into her own lies, she would never wonder what it would have been like to feel him inside her . . . She cut off that thought. The less she imagined it, the better.</p><p>Karina opened the toothbrush. She would brush her teeth, locate her jeans, and check on her daughter. And then she would go out there and make a chocolate cake.</p><p>Emily seemed to have no memory of Lucas and Daniel\u2019s fight the previous night. She slept well and when Karina had come to get her, she got a hug. The violent episode had passed her daughter by completely. Karina held her for a long time, breathing in the scent of her hair. They were both alive. She would get to keep Emily with her. It would be okay. It would be hard and painful, but it would be okay.</p><p>Karina took Emily to the kitchen. Sunlight poured in through the open window. Nobody waited for her. Nobody demanded breakfast. The house was quiet and serene. Karina exhaled her tension, pulled the ingredients from the pantry, and started mixing the cake batter.</p><p>Henry walked into the kitchen, looking a bit lost. \u201cGood morning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d Emily chirped.</p><p>\u201cI have something for you.\u201d Henry put a drawing pad and a set of watercolor pencils on the table.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>Emily pried at the pencil case.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d Karina murmured on autopilot.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Henry offered her a small smile.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve gone to check the perimeter net. What is it you\u2019re making?\u201d</p><p>Karina glanced at him. \u201cA chocolate cake. Did they go to check for signs of those people who sent the lizards to spy on us?\u201d</p><p>Henry nodded.</p><p>\u201cLucas called them Ordinators. Henry, who are they? Who are you?\u201d</p><p>Henry smiled again and slid his glasses up his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s a long and complicated explanation. It\u2019s better to wait a couple of days. Too much new information too fast will only make things worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to know.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through a great deal of violence in the past two days and you\u2019ve been exposed to things that conflict with your worldview. I don\u2019t want to be the one to add to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry, not knowing is worse. All I\u2019m asking is that you don\u2019t treat me like a slave who is told where to be and what to do and isn\u2019t owed any explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>They looked at each other over the table. Karina held his gaze. It might not have been wise, but she wouldn\u2019t back down now.</p><p>\u201cLook, Mom, I drew Cedric!\u201d</p><p>Karina looked down at the ball of brown fluff that looked like a sheep with a sabertooth\u2019s fangs. \u201cThat\u2019s looks very nice, Emily.\u201d</p><p>When she looked up, the kitchen was empty. Henry had escaped.</p><p>The cake smelled of chocolate and vanilla. When Karina took the two round pans out of the oven and set them out to cool, the familiar scents floated through the kitchen, so reminiscent of home and happy times, she almost cried. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A door banged. She looked up just in time to see Lucas loom in the doorway. His face was grim. He glanced at the cake, then at her. She stared back, suddenly terrified that all her thoughts would pour out through her eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cWould you like new clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Oh, God, yes.</p> <p>He jerked his head toward the door. \u201cThey have some things prepared for you at the main house. I didn\u2019t know what size, so you have to come and try them on. Come on, I\u2019ll walk with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come?\u201d Emily slid off the chair.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cThey have clothes for you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Cedric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCedric doesn\u2019t need clothes,\u201d Lucas said.</p> <p>\u201cCan he come with us?\u201d Karina asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Karina washed her hands, wiped them on a towel, and followed Lucas out. The sun shone bright. Cedric already waited for them at the foot of the stairs. Emily stepped down and the bear-dog rolled to his feet and trotted next to her, nearly as tall as she was.</p><p>Lucas led them out of the yard and down a dirt path. It wound around the hill, flanked on the left by stunted oaks and shrubs climbing up the slope and rolling off to the prairie on the right. Cedric and Emily pulled ahead a couple dozen yards. Karina watched them, aware of Lucas striding next to her, like some tiger who had learned to walk upright. The air was dry, and the heat beat down on them from the pale, burned-out sky, painting the path in stripes of bright yellow sunshine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a fragment of reality,\u201d Karina said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lucas said.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is the sun shining? Why is there air?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the fluctuation occurs on the universal level,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s a duplicate sun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the same sun the Earth has. We just get access to it on a different level. Think of a house with many rooms. We walked out of the main room into a smaller side bedroom, but we\u2019re still under the same roof.\u201d</p><p>Karina sighed. \u201cIt makes my head hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about dimensions to any Rippers, then,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cRippers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey make inter-dimensional rents that let people like you and me travel back and forth. You get one of them started on the subject and the insanity pours out until you want to stick your head in a bucket of water just to wash it out of your mind. When a man has to continuously cut himself, because pain helps him punch through dimensions, you can\u2019t expect him to be lucid anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Karina glanced at him. \u201cYou seem irritated.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s thick black eyebrows knitted together. \u201cWe found out how the lizard got through the net. It tunneled under it. A long, deep tunnel, almost twenty-five meters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was more than one tunnel,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>More than one tunnel meant other lizards. \u201cDid you track them down?\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid they transmit what they saw?\u201d</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>\u201cSo the enemy knows where we are?\u201d</p><p>Lucas grimaced. \u201cDifficult to say. The Rippers are saying there was too much inter-dimensional interference for the transmission to have gone through fully. But it\u2019s possible.\u201d He clenched his teeth, pondering something, and said, \u201cWe had perimeter alarms, infrared, microwave, and frequency sensors. The sensors are very specific: if you look on Cedric\u2019s collar, you\u2019ll see a transmitter. The transmitter broadcasts a code. The sensors check this code against the database and if the code is active, the sensors don\u2019t register an alarm. For some reason someone loaded an old set of codes into the system. The lizards came through fitted with transmitters of their own and when they broadcast the outdated set of codes, the system didn\u2019t flag them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did they know which codes to load?\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s eyes turned darker. \u201cThere was a woman. Galatea. She was a donor like you.\u201d</p><p>He said her name like she was a plague. \u201cWas she your donor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She defected.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d clenched his teeth again. There was more to this story. \u201cWere you lovers?\u201d</p><p>Lucas stopped and for a moment she thought she might have pushed him too far. \u201cWe fucked,\u201d he said.</p><p>Aha. She kept pushing. \u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>There was a short pause before he answered. \u201cFor four years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s some long fucking,\u201d Karina said. He\u2019d loved Galatea. He was in love, and she betrayed him, and now he wanted to kill her. Any woman past the age of fifteen would\u2019ve connected these dots. He must\u2019ve been young\u2014it had obviously left a deep scar. \u201cWhat was she like?\u201d</p><p>Lucas took a step toward her. A wild thing looked back at her from his eyes, the thing full of lust and aggression. She realized that in his mind he was peeling off her clothes and thinking of what it would be like, and suddenly she was back in the tub, naked, sitting two feet away from him and afraid he would cross the distance.</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cWould you like me to tell you about it?\u201d</p><p>She squared her shoulders. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d</p><p>He turned and they sped up to narrow the gap between themselves and Emily. Karina kept the pace, exhaling quietly. He had no brakes, at least not the ones she was used to as a woman. Ordinary men didn\u2019t end dinners by breaking the table with their brother\u2019s spine, they didn\u2019t kill lizards by caving their heads in, they didn\u2019t turn into monsters, and they didn\u2019t feed on women. Ordinary men didn\u2019t behave like this outside of movie screens and when they did it on the screen, other men ridiculed them for it. This was a game she couldn\u2019t afford to play, because he held the best cards. She had to survive this.</p><p>Karina chanced a glance at him. The wild, hungry thing in his eyes was still there. \u201cSince someone had to have uploaded this old code, someone on the inside is helping Galatea,\u201d she said, trying to steer him away from whatever he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cLooks that way. And when I find them, they\u2019ll wish they were never born.\u201d His voice contained so much malice, the hairs on the back of her neck stood up.</p><p>If this enemy was coming, Emily would be in danger. \u201cShould we evacuate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up to Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should?\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced at her. \u201cIt depends on how many people they bring to the fight. This is an old base, and we are actively mining this fragment for aluminum and beryllium. If the Ordinators are coming, they\u2019re coming fast. So even if we begin full base evacuation now, we\u2019ll take a hit in equipment. The base is run by means of a fiber network. It\u2019s a sophisticated computer system that coordinates mining operations, bio-support, communications, and so on. It also has the locations of the nearest bases. If the Ordinators gain access to it, a lot of us will die, which is why the network must be destroyed before the evacuation is complete. Detonating it will make this base uninhabitable. Fragments like this, with a stable climate and ecosystem, are rare. Most fragments we find are dead: no plants, no animals, often no atmosphere. You have to wear a suit and live in a hermetically sealed bunker. And popping back and forth through dimensions leaves a trail. If the Ordinators don\u2019t know where we are, they will once we start ripping.\u201d</p><p>The path ended, joining a larger road that rolled down the hill toward the prairie. In the distance a group of small horses galloped across the grass, ducking in and out of the brush. The vast prairie rolled to the towering mountain ridge, savage and ancient and somehow so much bigger than the modern landscape, that for a moment Karina stopped and simply stared, caught by the natural majesty of it.</p><p>\u201cThis is paradise compared to some of the fragments I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cIf we have a chance, we\u2019ll fight for it. Come on.\u201d</p><p>He turned and strode up the hill. She sped up to keep pace, Emily and Cedric in tow.</p><p>They rounded a bend and suddenly before them stood two tall white columns marking an entrance. Thrusting twenty feet up, they curved like the ribs of some prehistoric giant. An intricate network of designs covered the columns, etched into their surface. It drew the eye, hypnotic in its complexity. Once you looked, your gaze just kept sliding and sliding, up along the grooves and curved lines . . .</p><p>A hand rested on her shoulder. Karina turned, saw Lucas\u2019s fingers on her shoulder, and jerked away. He held his hand in empty air for a second and lowered it.</p><p>Karina turned to Emily. Her daughter stood next to her, staring at the column, her expression blank.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>Karina bent down and took Emily\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on, baby.\u201d</p><p>Emily blinked, as if waking up from a deep sleep, and walked with her. They passed through the arches and Karina stopped again.</p><p>Pale buildings with curved roofs spread before her. On second thought, the complex was all one huge building in the shape of a horseshoe, rising three stories high. A beautiful garden lay in the crook of the horseshoe, crisscrossed by covered passageways, stonelined paths, and lush flowerbeds, artfully bordering artificial ponds. Picturesque shrubs spread their branches. Flowers bloomed, blue, orange, yellow . . . The wind brought the by-now-familiar tart flower scent.</p><p>A large white sign stood next to the wide path leading into the garden, its smooth surface marked with an odd script. It had to be writing of some sort\u2014groups of symbols separated by spaces\u2014but it wasn\u2019t any language Karina was familiar with.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>A string of odd words spilled from Lucas\u2019s lips, lyrical and surprisingly familiar. She waited for the meaning.</p><p>\u201cIt says \u2018The Mandate is everything.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the Mandate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Original Mandate. It\u2019s hard to explain in English. There is a word in the primary language, ile. It means \u2018we,\u2019 \u2018us,\u2019 but it also means civilization, the best of us, the best of our kind. The mandate is \u2018Ile must survive.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That explained nothing. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. On this world, under this set of circumstances, the people among whom you lived are ile. We exist to make sure they survive. When we\u2019re no longer needed, we\u2019ll die out like many other subspecies before us.\u201d</p><p>The more he explained things, the more confused she became. For now she had to just gather the crumbs of information and hope all would make sense sooner or later.</p> <p>Lucas walked on, down the wide path of smooth stones. Karina scrambled to follow. They walked side by side along the path and over a bridge. The gardens burrowed into nooks in the buildings here and there, forming small sitting areas. To the left two women sat on a bench, discussing something. They looked so normal. Both wore jeans; the older of the pair had on a flowered top, white on blue; the younger woman wore a familiar yellow blouse\u2014Karina had looked at it in J. C. Penney last week.</p><p>Last week. A lifetime ago.</p><p>The women saw Lucas. Their faces took on a certain tightness, as if they were straining to keep calm. They looked her over next. Karina met their gaze and saw pity in their eyes. Suddenly it made her furious. If Lucas grabbed her throat right now, they wouldn\u2019t lift a finger to help her. They would just sit there and watch him choke her to death and feel sorry for her. She raised her chin and stared at Lucas\u2019s back. No, thank you. She didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s pity.</p><p>Henry\u2019s words came back to her. Lucas is the most feared. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the security specialist here; I have the right of judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cI can kill anyone on base at any point without any retribution.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou protect them, and all you get in return is fear. Why do you keep doing this?\u201d</p><p>Lucas kept walking. \u201cBecause everyone must have a purpose. The Mandate tells me what I am doing is right and must be done and because I\u2019m the biggest and the strongest it\u2019s my duty to put myself between my people and danger. I would do it for you.\u201d</p><p>He would. She believed him. \u201cLucas . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to tell him that if he ever shielded her or Emily, she wouldn\u2019t be afraid of him. She wanted to tell him that he didn\u2019t have to put up with people shrinking away from him, but inside a cold rational voice warned her that she was losing her grip on reality. The plan had to be to escape. The plan couldn\u2019t be to fall for Lucas and be that one sole person who comforted him.</p><p>He was looking at her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really confused right now,\u201d she told him. \u201cSo this actually doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBend your arm at the elbow.\u201d</p><p>He did. Karina reached out. What am I doing? She put her hand on his forearm and raised her chin. The two women on the bench stared at them, openmouthed.</p><p>\u201cNow we walk,\u201d she murmured, avoiding looking at him.</p><p>\u201cWe can do that,\u201d he agreed. They started down the walkway. His arm was rock-steady under her fingers. A few moments, and the dense greenery of rhododendron shrubs hid the women from their view.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Because she lost it, that\u2019s why. \u201cWould you hurt those two women?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot unless they tried to hurt someone else first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019re in no danger and they know it, but they still make a big production out of you walking by, minding your own business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t answer my question,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCan we stop talking about this?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything. They simply kept walking. It was surreal, Karina reflected. Beautiful flowers, Emily and a tame bear-dog, and she and Lucas striding side by side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>Karina bent down and picked her up. The effort nearly made her lose her balance. Apparently she was weaker than she thought.</p><p>Cedric sniffed at her feet.</p><p>\u201cLet her ride him,\u201d Lucas offered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her ride him. He doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to ride!\u201d Emily squirmed in her arms.</p><p>Karina surveyed the bear-dog. He was almost as big as a pony. Gingerly she lowered Emily on his back.</p><p>\u201cHold on to his fur,\u201d Lucas said. Emily dug her fingers into Cedric\u2019s brown mane and they were off again.</p><p>They emerged from the stand of rhododendrons. Lucas stepped aside, revealing a round plaza paved with dark red stone. A bronze statue rose in the center, a nude man, muscled with crisp precision. Enormous wings thrust from his shoulders. An angel, but not a garden cupid or some mournful cemetery statue. The angel leaned forward, one arm stretched out, his muscles knotted on his frame. The wings thrust up and out, featherless, as if made of sharp bone. The angel\u2019s perfect face stared into the distance, its gaze focused. Everything about it communicated fury and power. This was a predatory being about to kill its victim. Metal letters beveled on the side of the statue read \u201cA. Rodin.\u201d</p><p>Karina glanced at Lucas. \u201cA. Rodin? The sculptor who created The Thinker?\u201d</p><p>Lucas shrugged. \u201cHe says so, but I wouldn\u2019t put it past him to have the name slapped on there over the actual sculptor\u2019s signature. He is vain enough.\u201d</p><p>What? He who? She scrutinized the statue.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>The angel wore Arthur\u2019s face. It had to be figurative\u2014she hadn\u2019t seen any wings on Arthur\u2019s back when he offered her tea.</p><p>\u201cBut Rodin died in the beginning of the last century.\u201d</p><p>Lucas circled the statue and kept walking.</p><p>\u201cLucas!\u201d</p><p>He turned and looked at her over his shoulder, light eyes under black eyebrows like two chunks of ice. \u201cArthur is a Wither. Subspecies 21. They live a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough to have met Rodin. Come.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to freak out. She wanted to scream and kick her feet in panic, because right here, in cold bronze, was the final proof that this was not a nightmare. Instead Karina waved Cedric ahead of her and they kept going deeper into the garden.</p><p>Lucas turned left, down a path leading to a section of the building structured with an almost Japanese flair. Except for the white roof, it could\u2019ve been part of a teahouse. An older woman waited on the covered porch, a stack of clothes neatly folded next to her.</p><p>They were twenty feet away from the porch when the siren ripped the quiet into shreds.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Karina pulled Emily off the bear-dog and into her arms.</p><p>\u201cStay close,\u201d Lucas barked as he turned and ran back up the path. She followed him, trying not to stumble. They pounded over the bridge they\u2019d crossed on the way in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Mommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, baby. Hold on tight.\u201d</p><p>Emily was so heavy. Karina never remembered her being that heavy. It was like all of the strength had somehow gone out of her arms.</p><p>They cleared the garden and burst into the open space between the two spires, Lucas ahead and she, out of breath, a few dozen yards behind. A group of people stood by the spires, where the road out of the settlement rolled down the hill. A familiar face looked at her with merciless sky eyes. Arthur. Daniel\u2019s golden mane swung into view. He grinned at her, a deranged wild grin that had too much mirth. On the periphery a few yards away, Henry stood with his eyes closed, tense, his face raised to the sky. A young girl, barely a teenager, stood next to him in an identical pose. To the right an older, dark-skinned woman and another man, tall and gaunt, imitated them.</p><p>\u201cGood of you to join us,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>Lucas walked up to stand next to him.</p><p>A huge sound came from the distance, deep, booming, as if someone was playing a foghorn like a trumpet.</p><p>The girl at Henry\u2019s side inhaled sharply and dropped to her knees, breathing in ragged, painful gasps. Henry\u2019s eyes snapped open. He thrust his hand out and clenched it into a fist. \u201cOh no, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A desperate scream of pure pain came from the distance.</p><p>Henry smiled. His face glowed with vicious joy, so shocking that Karina took a step back. He stared into the distance. \u201cNot as fun to pick on someone your own size?\u201d</p><p>The scream kept ringing higher and higher, pausing for the mere fraction of a second that it took the agonized being that was making it to gulp some air.</p><p>Behind Henry the fallen girl opened her eyes and rose to her feet. The older couple awakened from their trance.</p><p>Henry twisted his fist and jerked it, as if ripping something in half.</p><p>The scream died.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the girl said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Next time remember to cloak.\u201d Henry turned to Arthur. \u201cThey have two hundred civs, fifty pigs, two heavy field artillery batteries, six squads of twenty-five men each, and seven Mind Benders. Minus one.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d killed an enemy Mind Bender, Karina realized. Kind, shy Henry crushed him, but not before he made him suffer.</p><p>\u201cToo many,\u201d someone muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s overkill,\u201d Daniel said.</p><p>\u201cThere is at least one Demon, too,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>Lucas laughed, a bitter, self-assured chuckle.</p><p>They had a Demon like Lucas. Lucas would fight it. She saw it in his face. She didn\u2019t want him to die.</p><p>Something climbed over the crest of the distant hill, spilling onto the prairie. Karina squinted. What in the world . . .</p><p>Arthur\u2019s face remained serene. \u201cBegin immediate full base evacuation.\u201d</p><p>A dark-haired woman on Karina\u2019s left held out binoculars to her. \u201cHere. Looks like I won\u2019t need them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Karina lowered Emily to the ground and took the binoculars. \u201cStay with me, baby.\u201d</p><p>The woman turned and ran, back toward the garden. A moment later the alarm sounded again, but this time in two short bursts.</p><p>People peeled off from the group and headed back, deeper into the base. Now was her chance. If she could slip away and go through the gate, she could get away. Nobody would find her in the confusion . . .</p><p>\u201cLady Karina,\u201d Arthur\u2019s voice rang out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She snapped back to look at him.</p><p>The gaze of his blue eyes bore into her. \u201cStay close. We must hold until the evacuation is complete. Lucas may have need of your services.\u201d</p><p>His voice was soft but his eyes left her no doubt\u2014he knew what she was thinking and escape was futile.</p> <p>Arthur turned and looked out to the plain. She looked, too, raising the binoculars to her eyes. The mountains swung into view, suddenly clear. She tilted the binoculars lower . . .</p><p>People came walking over the hill. To the right a middle-aged man in filthy khakis and a ripped shirt with thin blue stripes climbed over a rock. Next to him two dark-skinned men in jeans helped a third limp forward. On the left a woman in business clothes walked on, stumbling. The binoculars captured her face. Her features, caked with grime and dust, twisted into an expression of abject terror.</p><p>Karina inhaled sharply. A red-haired teenage girl followed the woman. Her ruffled black skirt hung limply around her skinny legs in torn stockings. She shuddered as she walked and Karina realized she was sobbing.</p><p>Karina jerked the binoculars down. \u201cThere are people out there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are captives,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cPeople the Ordinators snatched up here and there, the missing. The pigs are running them at the net. It\u2019s designed to stop high-impact projectiles, but if enough body mass hits it at once, it will overload and collapse.\u201d</p> <p>The memory of the bird shocked by that red glow flashed before her. \u201cThey will die!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to break through before we have a chance to detonate the network.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t they just use a tank or a vehicle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe net would fry it,\u201d Lucas said grimly. \u201cBiomass is the best way to go.\u201d</p><p>The people on the right broke into a run. Karina raised the binoculars.</p><p>A creature bounded over the hill. Huge and brown, it looked like a seven-foot-tall boar moving too fast on surprisingly long and skinny legs. The pig paused. Its long crocodilian jaws gaped open, flashing fangs as large as her fingers, wider, wider, until the pig\u2019s entire head seemed to split in half. A hoarse roar burst forth. The daeodon.</p> <p>The people in front of the creature scattered like minnows, sprinting across the rough ground toward the net in a ragged herd, a blond man in a once white tank top leading the run. The daeodon roared again and gave chase.</p><p>On the left, a second pig crested the hill, sending another group of prisoners into flight. An older man in a torn flannel shirt stumbled and fell, splaying in the dirt. The pig bore down on him. The long jaws dipped down. A shriek rang out, vibrating with the sheer terror of a man who knew his life was ending, and vanished, cut off in midnote.</p><p>On the right, the blond man ran headfirst into the net and jerked, caught by a deep carmine glow. His body convulsed, his legs and arms flailing, as if he were being shocked by a live wire. The man directly behind him tried to slow down, but his momentum carried him right into the red glow and he shook, caught in a similar seizure.</p><p>Karina whipped to Lucas. \u201cCan\u2019t you do something? Anything? They\u2019re dying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can give them a quick death once they break through,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas is correct,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cWe will spare them the pain.\u201d</p><p>The air around Arthur shimmered. People backed away. He bowed his head and stood very still.</p> <p>On the prairie, the prisoners tried to swerve away from the red glow, but the pigs drove them forward. One by one the bodies crashed into the net. Karina turned Emily around. \u201cDon\u2019t look, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d</p><p>Lie, she told herself. Lie. But the words spilled out on their own. \u201cThey are dying, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the bad guys are killing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the bad guys going to get us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, little one,\u201d Henry said. \u201cArthur and Lucas will kill them.\u201d</p><p>The red glow bent forward under the weight of many bodies, and still more people were coming across the prairie, herded by the daeodons like sheep. Arthur didn\u2019t move. His eyes stared into the distance, somewhere far away.</p><p>\u201cHow long till the detonation?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>Henry closed his eyes and opened them. \u201cThree minutes.\u201d</p><p>Lucas rolled his head right, then left, cracking his neck.</p><p>With a bright flash the net collapsed under the weight of the bodies. People fell into the gap, tumbling over each other, convulsing on the ground. The four huge pigs who\u2019d herded them to the net galloped into the gap, trampling the bodies beneath their hooves. The daeodons charged up the slope.</p><p>Lucas grunted. His skin seemed to peel off his bones in thick slabs. Bloody mist filled the air. Karina stared, unable to look away. Bones bent, ligaments twisted, and the beast burst forth. It was bigger than she remembered. In her memory, he had morphed into a dark, featureless shadow, but here, in the light of day, she saw every bulge of terrifying muscle, every fang, every sickle claw, every hair in the black crest of his mane.</p><p>Fear washed over her, setting every nerve on fire.</p><p>The beast turned his head. Lucas\u2019s green eyes looked at her from a horrid face.</p><p>Don\u2019t flinch, she told herself. He was about to fight for them. He could die in the next few moments. She didn\u2019t want him to go into it thinking she was disgusted by what he was. Whatever Lucas\u2019s faults were, he was about to put himself between the pigs and her daughter. He deserved better than the blind fear the two women in the garden showed him.</p><p>She met his gaze. They looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d she said.</p><p>The daeodons roared, pounding up the slope.</p><p>The beast who was Lucas nodded to her, leaped down, and smashed into the first pig. His claws sliced across the daeodon\u2019s neck and it went down. Lucas swerved away from the gaping jaws, leaped onto the second daeodon, and thrust his claws through the brown hide and wrenched a bloody shard of its spine out.</p><p>The third pig halted, unsure. The fourth veered left, around the carnage, and charged up the hill, digging into the hard dirt with its hooves.</p><p>Karina clenched Emily closer. Her instinct told her to run, but around her nobody moved.</p><p>Twenty yards. Fifteen. Ten.</p><p>Daniel stepped forward and clenched his fist. With a dry crunch, the bones of the pigs\u2019 front legs snapped. White bone sliced through the muscles and skin. The pig squealed, crashed on its side, and rolled down the hill. Lucas rose from the body of the third pig, leaped over the fallen daeodon as it tumbled down, and smashed its skull with one brutal punch.</p><p>\u201cAre we in a story, Mommy?\u201d</p><p>Karina looked down into Emily\u2019s big brown eyes. I wish we were. I wish we were dreaming. She reached deep inside herself, through the fear and anxiety and disbelief, and when she spoke, her voice was calm and confident. \u201cIt will be okay, baby. We will be just fine.\u201d</p><p>More daeodons spilled from the prairie, dashing toward the base; so many, she couldn\u2019t even count. A huge beast led the charge. He looked just like Lucas, except for the reddish fur. The red beast sprinted, widening the distance between himself and the mass of daeodons, moving in powerful leaps that devoured the prairie.</p><p>Lucas backed two steps up the slope and planted his giant feet.</p><p>The beast thundered at them, hurtling like a cannonball. It jumped and sailed over the mass of writhing human bodies.</p><p>Lucas leaped. The two monsters collided in midair and Karina realized that Lucas was visibly smaller. They rolled down the hill, snarling and tearing at each other like two massive feral cats.</p><p>The larger beast raked Lucas\u2019s side. Blood wet the dirt in a hot spray.</p><p>Karina spun to Daniel. \u201cHelp him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he growled. \u201cI need a clear target.\u201d</p><p>The beasts brawled and snapped, biting and ripping in a tornado of claws and teeth.</p><p>The alarm blared again, this time a single long note followed by a short beep. Daniel whirled to an older woman standing next to him. She was short and plump, with an elaborate knot of tiny braids on her head. Her gray pantsuit was pristine, her makeup flawless. She looked like a secretary or a receptionist for an upscale business firm.</p><p>\u201cRip it,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>The woman pulled a knife out of her pantsuit, jerked the sleeve back, and slashed a gash across her skin. Blood welled. The pain must\u2019ve been excruciating, because she bent nearly double, cradling her arm.</p><p>At the bottom of the hill, the larger beast hurled Lucas aside. He flew, flipped in the air, and landed on all fours. Blood streamed from his flanks. The two creatures squared off and collided again.</p><p>The woman straightened. A pale green glow burst from her stomach, twisting into thin strands of light. The strands snapped out, flared, and split the empty air in half. A seven-foot circle appeared, filled with darkness.</p><p>So that\u2019s what the dimensional rip looks like.</p><p>Arthur raised his head.</p><p>The ground shook under his feet. Tiny rocks bounced up and down. The vibration pounded the bottoms of Karina\u2019s shoes.</p><p>\u201cLucas! End it!\u201d Daniel screamed. \u201cEnd it now!\u201d</p><p>The reddish beast leaped, striking with an enormous paw, claws out like daggers. Lucas spun, rolling to the side, inhumanely fast. The large beast landed in the dirt. The moment his paws touched the ground, Lucas vaulted onto his back. Huge teeth flashed and he clamped onto the rival beast\u2019s neck. The creature screamed, kicking and trying to roll. Two beasts plunged down.</p><p>Karina held her breath.</p><p>The black beast rose, slowly.</p><p>She exhaled.</p><p>Lucas pondered the body of his fallen opponent as if he wasn\u2019t sure where he was or what he was doing there. Behind him, the captives, caught between him and the sea of pigs, scrambled to their feet.</p><p>The vibration below the surface increased, hitting Karina\u2019s feet like the blow of an underground hammer. Tiny red sparks flickered around Arthur.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d Henry whispered next to her. His gaze was fixed on Lucas, his voice an insistent low whisper, almost a command. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>Lucas jerked. His head snapped up. He saw them and bounded up the hill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sparks around Arthur danced faster. Arthur\u2019s feet left the ground. He rose three feet into the air, his body tense, looking down at the prairie stretching before him.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>The beast reached the apex of the hill, crashed down in a sickening revolt of flesh, and rose again, as Lucas, bloody and shaking. He shuddered on his feet, careened, and Karina caught him. For a moment his entire weight rested on her. She looked into his eyes and saw pain. And then Daniel pulled him off her and dragged him forward to the rip.</p> <p>In the distance the foghorn blared frantically. The daeodons closed in. Karina swept Emily into her arms.</p><p>Henry wrapped his arm around her. \u201cWe must go. You don\u2019t want to see this.\u201d</p><p>They hurried to the rent. She looked back over her shoulder, as if pulled by some invisible force. The sparks darting around Arthur\u2019s shoulders paused. For a fraction of a breath they hung motionless, then blinked, then sparked into brilliant light. Red radiance burst from Arthur\u2019s shoulders in twin streams, boiling with flashes of white and orange, unfurling into two enormous wings knitted of lightning.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Henry pulled her toward the rip. It loomed before them, lightless and frightening, a hole in reality itself.</p><p>The red lightning flashed. The front row of captives fell to their knees. Fire spilled from their eyes and mouths, as if they were being incinerated from the inside out. Their faces turned to ash. The second row followed and on and on and on . . . Jets of flames spurted from the ground. The whole hill quaked as if caught in the grip of a powerful earthquake.</p> <p>Oh, dear God. So that\u2019s what a Wither does . . .</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Henry barked.</p><p>Karina took a deep breath, cradled Emily, and stepped into the darkness.</p><p>It was like being underwater. As if she were walking through a flooded tunnel of crystal-clear liquid filled with sunlight. Her body was very light, almost weightless. It lasted a lifetime or a single moment\u2014Karina couldn\u2019t tell\u2014and then she stepped onto beige carpet.</p><p>For a second she was afraid to move, afraid to do anything, and then she remembered to breathe. The air tasted sweet.</p><p>Emily looked at her, blinking.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Karina whispered, her voice strained.</p><p>Emily stirred. \u201cI know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what, Emily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I know, I know! I am the Courageous Princess. Like in the comic book.\u201d</p><p>Karina exhaled and hugged her. For some reason, she wanted to cry.</p><p>They stood in a foyer. There were people around her, both men and women. In front of her a glass wall guarded a conference room, a long black table with matching chairs; and beyond that a floor-to-ceiling window offered a view of an evening city from above, lit up with electric lights. They had to be on the twentieth floor.</p><p>They had gotten away.</p><p>In her mind the bodies still burned, vomiting fire and ashes. What the hell was Arthur? What were all of them?</p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Henry said next to her, his voice vibrating with alarm. \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d</p><p>A woman behind her snarled. \u201cThe fucking Ripper dropped us into the wrong base.\u201d</p><p>A soft thud made her turn. Lucas crashed onto the carpet and Daniel tried to pick him up. Lucas\u2019s eyes were closed. He looked so pale, his skin had gained an almost greenish tint.</p><p>She set Emily down and knelt by him, sliding her hand on his forehead. His skin was cold, almost clammy. Blood clung to his rib cage and a big purple bruise stained the right side of his stomach. He looked like he was dying. The heavy metallic scent rolled off him, so thick she almost choked. He wasn\u2019t just hungry for her blood. He was starving for it and he hurt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much venom,\u201d Daniel spat out. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have phased into the attack variant so soon after the last fight.\u201d</p><p>Arthur stepped onto the carpet out of thin air. \u201cHe will be fine.\u201d</p><p>A grimace skewed Daniel\u2019s face, stretching his scar. He looked like a rabid dog. \u201cWe should\u2019ve evacuated yesterday. You overwork him. You know he needs at least two weeks between phasings, but you counted on him to save your ass anyway, because you knew he would do it. Look at him. Look at him, Arthur. He\u2019s dying from the venom.\u201d</p><p>Arthur glanced at the skyline. \u201cNot now, Daniel. Where is the Ripper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a fucking asshole!\u201d</p><p>Henry closed his eyes and opened them. \u201cShe isn\u2019t in the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniel, stop your hysterics and search the building . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill the two of you shut up?\u201d Lucas said. His eyes were still closed. A shudder gripped him. He arched his back, his heels digging into the carpet, his arms rigid, his massive body straining against the pain.</p><p>Idiots. Karina wrapped her arms around Lucas, trying to hold him down, but it was like trying to hold down a bull. \u201cWe need something for his mouth. He\u2019s grinding his teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVault, now,\u201d Arthur snapped. \u201cPick him up.\u201d</p><p>People swarmed Lucas, brushing her away. He lashed out, convulsing, throwing a man aside like a rag doll. They pulled Lucas up and dragged him down the hall.</p><p>Arthur bent down, grasped her by the elbow, and pulled her to her feet. \u201cCome with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter . . .\u201d</p><p>Arthur\u2019s fingers clenched her arm like a vise. He pulled her down the hallway, after the clump of people trying to move the convulsing Lucas forward.</p><p>Emily ran after her. \u201cMommy!\u201d</p><p>Karina jerked. \u201cLet go of me! You\u2019re scaring her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want your daughter to live?\u201d Arthur asked.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Bastard.</p><p>\u201cThen do as you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>They were almost to the end of the tunnel. Something swung open with a heavy metallic sound. Karina caught a glimpse of a huge vault door standing ajar. The people carrying Lucas ducked into the round opening and parted, and Karina saw a room beyond the door. It lay empty and the light of the white fluorescent lamps reflected off the metal floor and walls.</p><p>They would put her into the vault with him. Lucas hurt so badly, he was convulsing. He required her blood and he\u2019d rip her to pieces to get it. If she crossed that threshold, she would die.</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d</p><p>She dug her heels in. \u201cEmily!\u201d</p><p>Henry picked Emily up. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, little one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou agreed to the contract,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cTime to honor it. Get in there and do whatever you have to do to keep him alive.\u201d</p><p>If she didn\u2019t go in, they would throw her in. She heard it in Arthur\u2019s voice.</p><p>Karina jerked her arm out of his hand. \u201cTake care of my baby, Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Karina took a deep breath and walked inside.</p><p>\u201cNo sudden movements,\u201d Henry called out.</p><p>The door behind her clanged shut.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Lucas curled into a ball on the floor. The pain scoured the inside of his spine as if someone were scraping his vertebrae with steel wool. It stretched in tight strings through his ligaments; it pooled in his joints, in his fingertips, under his tongue. He felt it in his teeth. It ground him like a grain of wheat between two millstones.</p><p>His ears caught the sound of approaching steps.</p><p>He forced his eyes open.</p><p>Karina knelt by him. He inhaled her scent and felt it spark a deep, angry hunger inside him. She pulled him like a magnet. His body screamed for her blood and the end of the pain. Tearing into her would be bliss.</p><p>She was rolling up her sleeve. Her lips were pinched together.</p><p>He had to speak now. It hurt and he was tired, but he managed. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur said you had to feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur is a sick fuck. I told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can smell you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I feed now, you\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, you will, and then they\u2019ll kill Emily.\u201d</p><p>Ah. For a second he thought she had felt sorry for him, but no. \u201cNobody will touch Emily. And I\u2019m not dying. Just hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look awful.\u201d He heard a soft note in her voice. In spite of everything, she cared a little bit. He would take that. That was more than he usually got from anyone.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t shied back when he phased. Her knees had trembled but she didn\u2019t flinch. For that he was grateful.</p><p>Karina brushed the grime off his face, her eyes kind, her voice gentle. \u201cLucas, don\u2019t be an idiot. Feed. It will make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pain isn\u2019t fatal. It will pass. You\u2019ll need all of your blood before long.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Lucas, what is happening to me?\u201d</p><p>He almost told her the truth. \u201cI told you before, you\u2019re reacting to the venom.\u201d</p><p>The ache had burrowed deep into the base of his spine. Lucas forced himself to turn, trying to shift his weight, and it exploded into a blinding white, mind-numbing haze, twisting his limbs. Like being punched in the mouth by a star. He passed out.</p><p>When he awoke, her scent was everywhere. The hunger stirred inside him, demanding. Lucas clenched his teeth and felt a light touch on his cheek. His eyes snapped open. She was sitting next to him, her back resting against the wall.</p><p>\u201cHow long was I out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a minute or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to time the next one. I need to know if they\u2019re getting shorter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I can do?\u201d</p><p>The ache rolled back at him. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never did tell me exactly why Emily hoards food.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and brushed the brown lock of hair from her face. \u201cIt happened after Jonathan died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze. \u201cBecause then you will know things about me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd that would be bad?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Now he wanted to know more.</p> <p>\u201cDoes it hurt to be the beast?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Phasing is like being a superhero. I\u2019m faster, stronger. Everything is sharper. There are no consequences. I can let myself off the leash. But my attack variant\u2019s venom is toxic to my human phase variant. Turning back into a man is a bitch.\u201d</p><p>A small tremor shook his legs. Lucas grunted and closed his eyes, trying to will the pain away.</p><p>\u201cHow long will we be locked in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I pull through. Hours. Arthur is trying to keep me safe. I\u2019m an asset and I\u2019m rare and difficult to replace. We shouldn\u2019t have come here, to this building.\u201d The words came slowly. \u201cThis base is not secure. We rent five floors here. We don\u2019t own the buildings and don\u2019t control access to it.\u201d</p> <p>Karina bent down, looking closer into his eyes. Tiny red rosettes marked the skin on her cheeks and forehead. Her own transformation was closing in. Shit. He hoped she would have another day. He didn\u2019t want her to phase here, in the vault, without medical help, without Henry to keep her calm. She could die and he wanted her to live. He had to heal fast.</p><p>Heal, Lucas willed in his mind. Heal.</p><p>The pain exploded in a white burst and dragged him under.</p><p>When the light faded he heard her voice, soothing, calm, warm. Like sitting back in the hot tub, soaking his exhausted body while she floated nearby. \u201c. . . met in college. Jonathan was handsome. Funny. His father was the CFO for Drivers Company. It\u2019s a big insurance company in the Southwest. Brian\u2019s very driven, very conscious about his appearance. Brooks Brothers suits, expensive watch, a new BMW every couple of years. He and Lynda had Jonathan when they were much older, in their forties. Jonathan could do no wrong. He was their golden child. Good at sports, good at academics. He was easygoing and charming. The perfect son.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her head against the wall. He moved closer to her and rested the back of his head on her ankle. She let him do it. From here he could see her face. He could touch her hand. Lucas closed his eyes and let himself sink into her voice.</p><p>\u201cThings always went Jonathan\u2019s way. I used to watch a cartoon when I was younger. Two mice were living in a lab, and one was very smart and the other one was a knucklehead. So every night the knucklehead mouse, Pinky, would ask the smart mouse, \u2018And what are we going to do today, Brain?\u2019 And Brain would say, \u2018Try to take over the world!\u2019 And Pinky would get all excited. See, Brain was serious. He was trying to take over the world. But to Pinky it was all a big game. That\u2019s kind of how Jonathan was. The world was his huge playground and every day he\u2019d play at taking it over. Some days he was an athlete; other days he was a student. When we met, he was finishing his MBA and I was getting my bachelor\u2019s in accounting. My parents had died in a car accident when I was a senior in high school. I had just turned eighteen when they passed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lucas said and meant it.</p><p>\u201cThank you. They left me just enough money to get me through college and I had to work to feed myself. Before they died, I wanted to go into art history.\u201d She laughed a little, a bitter, quiet sound. \u201cI wanted to be an art appraiser. You know, the person who examines art for auctions and museums to determine if it\u2019s authentic. I always thought it would be so neat. But I was on my own then, so I went into accounting instead. It seemed . . . sensible. I was trying to be sensible. To have some structure. And then Jonathan shot into my world like a comet. He could make anything seem exciting. He made things fun. His parents were always very formal with me. I don\u2019t think they ever understood why he liked me, but Jonathan picked me and he could do no wrong.\u201d</p><p>He very badly wanted to murder Jonathan.</p><p>\u201cIt was great at first. Jonathan\u2019s father\u2019s connections got him a position in a private equity firm. During the day he got to play a businessman and during the night he got to play a husband. And then Emily was born. Well, you\u2019ve seen her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is pretty,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cShe is. Jonathan loved her. It was yet another new game: being a dad. He used to show her off like a cute purebred puppy.\u201d She sighed again. \u201cI should\u2019ve seen it then. Anyway, everything was great for a few years and then the bottom fell out of the economy. Suddenly it wasn\u2019t fun anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe party was over,\u201d Lucas guessed.</p><p>\u201cYes. Jonathan had to start working for his living and buckle down, or the firm would cut him loose. I worked, too, and we were doing okay, but we had to mind our p\u2019s and q\u2019s and Jonathan didn\u2019t want to be bogged down with details. We used to have the stupidest conversations. He couldn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t drop thirty grand on a membership at a country club. It\u2019s like his brain couldn\u2019t digest the concept of a budget. I mean, the man had a master\u2019s degree in business management, for crying out loud.\u201d Her voice rose too high and Karina fell silent.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cFinally he decided he was tired of playing with us. He started sending me these long rambling e-mails about how he felt constrained and unhappy and about the need to find himself. He wanted to live fully, he said. To find the zest in life. At first I was concerned, then I thought he was cheating, but he wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s not like we were ever on the verge of bankruptcy. We just couldn\u2019t do exciting things anymore, like ordering champagne for the entire bar. I offered to move; he didn\u2019t want to do it. No solution I suggested was good enough. He tortured me like that for about four months. In the end I didn\u2019t even care anymore. I should\u2019ve fought harder maybe, but I remember one of my friends calling and telling me she saw Jonathan at her office party without me, and you know what I thought?\u201d</p><p>She paused. Her dark eyes were huge on her pretty face. \u201cI thought, \u2018Good. Maybe he\u2019ll meet someone and I can divorce him.\u2019 That\u2019s an awful thing to think about your husband. That\u2019s when I knew the marriage was over. We were heading downhill, except there was Emily. How do you explain to a four-year-old that Daddy decided he doesn\u2019t want her anymore because he needs to go find himself? So I spoke to his parents. I thought maybe they would talk some sense into him.\u201d</p><p>Lucas grimaced. \u201cYou said he could do no wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was stupid, but I was desperate. They called him over to have a heart-to-heart. Jonathan took me out to dinner at the end of the week. I knew something was up; I could just tell. It wasn\u2019t a date. He told me he had filed for divorce. He had no problem paying me alimony, and I could retain all my parental rights.\u201d</p><p>A shadow passed over her face. She seemed small all of a sudden.</p><p>\u201cWe were in the car, going to pick up Emily from the sitter\u2019s. We were fighting about his generosity in regard to my \u2018parental rights.\u2019 \u201d Her voice dripped with bitterness. \u201cHe wanted to leave and stay gone. I insisted that Emily needed a father and he couldn\u2019t just take off. He was mad. He told me that everyone had a right to be happy. He wanted to be free of me and Emily but he didn\u2019t want to be judged for it. And then, all of a sudden, he lost consciousness. It was like someone had flipped a switch. We shot into the opposing lane. I remember headlights. I woke up in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>She fell silent. \u201cHe had a stroke,\u201d Karina said finally in a flat voice. \u201cHe had fibromuscular dysplasia. Nobody knew. He was healthy as a horse, played racquetball, and then he just died. It was touch and go for me for a little while but I bounced back. I was in the hospital for two weeks. Emily had to stay with his parents. They didn\u2019t feed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian, Jonathan\u2019s father, always eats out. When Jonathan died, he spent all his time at a country club. He said it was his way to cope. Lynda is in her seventies. She has a touch of dementia. All she did was eat candy all day, but she wouldn\u2019t give Emily any\u2014it would ruin her teeth. She would forget to give Emily lunch, and when she did remember to feed her, she would either try to cook and burn it or she\u2019d give Emily food that had been in the fridge for so long, it wasn\u2019t just moldy, it was blooming.\u201d</p><p>She was crying, not from pity but from anger. There were no tears, but he heard it in Karina\u2019s voice, hidden behind the flat tone.</p><p>\u201cThey had a bowl of nuts set out and Emily told me she would pretend to fall asleep and then sneak out and steal them. When I got out of the hospital, she was six pounds lighter. She barely weighs anything as it is. So now you know why she hoards food. She was terrified, her father had just died, her mother was in the hospital, and her own grandparents wouldn\u2019t feed her. I told Arthur she doesn\u2019t have anyone except me. I meant it. We are not welcome at that house. They blame me and Emily for Jonathan\u2019s stroke. We made his life so difficult, he died to escape.\u201d</p><p>The red rosettes on her face were turning darker. Karina touched her hand to her forehead and looked at it. Her eyes widened. She rubbed his forearm.</p><p>\u201cThis is another reaction to the venom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhh-hhm,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cI told you my story. Tell me yours now. It\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d he asked, wondering what she would think if she looked inside his mind and saw him strangling her husband.</p><p>\u201cWho are you? All of you. Who are you really? I need to know what\u2019s happening to me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas sighed.</p><p>She had told him too much, Karina decided. As much as she wanted for it to be a bribe, a down payment for the information he held, at least in part she told him what she did because he was lying beside her, bruised, beat up, bloody, and hurting. He needed a distraction and she had enough compassion to give him one. But she hadn\u2019t meant to pour her heart out. It just happened. He was in pain, and although she had the means to ease his suffering, he refused to feed, because he didn\u2019t want to hurt her. He wasn\u2019t willing to trade his pain for hers. The least she could do was talk and try to distract him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Karina reached over and touched his hand. His fingers closed on hers. Lucas glanced at her, surprised. They had that in common now\u2014both of them treated any act of kindness with suspicion. She didn\u2019t expect kindness anymore, except from him. But she was an outsider. He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThere are no scared women here to watch us,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cIt was never for them. It was for you.\u201d</p><p>She almost cried and couldn\u2019t even understand why. It was the stress, Karina told herself. The trauma of watching hundreds of people die at once. And the fever, which kept rising and rising. Her breath felt hot when she exhaled. Her skin was dry and too tight. And now there were rings of red dots all over her arms.</p> <p>She had never told the entire story of her marriage to anyone. It\u2019s the fever. Of course it is.</p><p>Lucas was looking at her. Sprawled like that, even battered, he looked enormous. If a week ago someone had told her she would be locked in a vault with a nude, bloody man who was trying his best not to devour her to stop his pain, she would\u2019ve dialed 911 to report a lunatic running amok.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a story,\u201d Lucas said. His voice was laced with fatigue. \u201cYou can choose to believe it or not. It can be the truth or just a story. It\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Lucas closed his eyes. \u201cSuppose there is a civilization. A powerful country. It has taken over all of its available territory, but it knows that it must expand. It must continue to grow outward, or it will rot and collapse. This civilization sends colonists out to explore new territories. They find fertile lands and colonize them. When they succeed, they let the knowledge of the large civilization fade. The small colonies grow and prosper on their own, and when they develop enough, they rediscover their mother civilization and rejuvenate it with their unique achievements.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Karina said. \u201cI can see how that would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuppose a new island was found for colonization. An island with an abundant ecosphere and great resources. The civilization had done this many times before and they had developed a protocol. The colony ships arrived and the colonists created thirteen small settlements, Houses, one for each colony ship.</p><p>\u201cGenetically, all the colonists belonged to the Base Strain. It\u2019s a very stable breed of human, long-lived, resistant to diseases, armed with superior DNA repair mechanisms to counteract mutation. To successfully colonize a new environment, a species must adapt to it. To facilitate this adaptation, most of the colonists were exposed to an agent inhibiting their cellular and DNA repair and vulnerability to native viruses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey deliberately made their people weaker? How does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t just want a colony,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cThey wanted a unique colony, perfectly in tune with this new island. That\u2019s how the civilization kept itself from stagnation. The colonists wanted an explosion of mutations in the future generations, and they needed a shorter life span and faster sexual maturity to pass the new changes on to their offspring. That\u2019s why scientists experiment on mice: they breed quickly and don\u2019t live very long. The shorter life span goes hand in hand with faster sexual maturity. But it also brings negative anthropological consequences: immaturity, inability to pass on knowledge, loss of ethics and culture, and so on. These consequences were considered acceptable. The colony had to develop on its own without the knowledge of its origin anyway. The sooner people forgot where they came from, the better. A small group of the colonists remained as Base Strain for control purposes. They lived in the settlements, the Houses, and monitored the whole thing. With me?\u201d</p> <p>Sort of. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMutations bloomed. A succession of several dozen subspecies of human followed. Some subspecies developed variations, people with similar powers or physiology. Subspecies 29 showed all of the adaptations necessary for survival, but all eight of its types were plagued by sensitivity to heat and alarmingly low fertility. Subspecies 44, type 3, produced exceptional Mind Benders, who were prone to insanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what Henry is?\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about islands, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome say islands,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cSome say planets. It\u2019s just a story.\u201d</p><p>A story, right. \u201cAliens.\u201d She stared at him. \u201cAre you trying to tell me that all of us are aliens?\u201d</p><p>Lucas sighed. \u201cYou could say that. You could also say that once the planet shaped us and twisted our DNA, we are now just as native as anybody else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Subspecies 30?\u201d What about you?</p><p>Lucas\u2019s eyes fixed on her. \u201cSubspecies 30, types 1 through 5, otherwise known as Demons. A venomous, carnivorous, predatory variant of human with the ability to drastically alter its morphology. They were powerful, aggressive, territorial, and they dominated their point of origin for a few hundred years, hunting in small packs, but this subspecies was not viable long term. They were crippled because their bodies couldn\u2019t produce a set of small molecules necessary for their survival, so they had to cannibalize other humans to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCannibalize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt that point the various subspecies of human had only a rudimentary language and no memory of where they came from,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cNo ethics, no morals, nothing. They were forming fledgling societies and \u2018might is right\u2019 was the law. If I need your blood, and there is nothing in my upbringing or experience that tells me I shouldn\u2019t, why wouldn\u2019t I kill you and eat your flesh? Being a nice guy is a modern concept.\u201d</p><p>He was serious. He was actually serious.</p><p>\u201cShould I keep going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis went on for hundreds of years. The small remaining pockets of Base Strain, the original colonists, kept as a control group, meticulously documented all of it from their Houses. They didn\u2019t interfere. They just cataloged what occurred.</p><p>\u201cThen suddenly Subspecies 48 popped on the scene. The Rippers had a fatal vulnerability to cancers but also the ability to rupture holes in reality, accessing dimensional fragments. This was a new development, unknown to the colonists, and nobody knew what to do about it. Some Houses took Ripper children and raised them within the settlements to study them.</p><p>\u201cThe mutations bloomed and bloomed, until one subspecies emerged as best adapted. It did well in almost every climate. It reproduced quickly, showed mental agility, and demonstrated decent DNA repair. At approximately six thousand planetary cycles, Subspecies 61 was declared viable. The colonists had done their job: they had created the type of human with the best ability to survive and prosper. Now nature needed to take over. All support for other strains ceased, as dictated by the Original Mandate. Ile must survive. Subspecies 61 became ile. Everyone else needed to die to make room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubspecies 61. Humans,\u201d Karina guessed. \u201cUs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cThem. Your neighbors, your friends. But not you.\u201d</p><p>Her fever was now so high, she was freezing and melting at the same time. \u201cYou said them, not me. What do you mean, not me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to that. Other subspecies were dying out, while Subspecies 61 went on to multiply and claim the island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe planet.\u201d Karina didn\u2019t need him to keep babying her.</p><p>\u201cThe planet,\u201d he agreed. \u201cThe colony cities began to gradually phase out their technology. They were letting themselves disappear. But there was a protocol breach at one of the cities, as a result of which Subspecies 29, the one that had trouble with heat, discovered where they came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Lucas sighed. \u201cI mean that the scientists at the Mare House fucked up. Subspecies 29 produced several unusually smart children. A sudden explosion of kids with genius-level intelligence was rare and odd, so the idiots thought it would be a good idea to study them further. They extracted these children and raised them within Mare with the full knowledge of their history. Well, the kids grew up and decided they didn\u2019t want to go gently into that good night while some other breed of human took over.</p><p>\u201cThere was a quiet coup. By the time it was discovered, Strain 29 and their captive personnel had genetically corrected their shortcomings. Now they had no trouble with heat and they bred like rabbits. They decided that they were more viable than Strain 61. They, not humans, were ile. A mistake was made and they decided it had to be corrected. They were ordained to take over the Earth.\u201d</p><p>Now it made sense. \u201cThey became the Ordinators?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is it? They\u2019ve been trying to kill us off for thousands of years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less. They went to war, using the colonists\u2019 original technology. The other cities opposed them, but they were weak by that point and in the process of dissolving themselves, so they plucked people from different strains with combat potential. The Ordinators were broken and would\u2019ve been wiped out, except they acquired Rippers and began hopping through dimensional fragments. Eventually, so did we.</p><p>\u201cStrain 61, the ile humans, was reproducing too quickly, and their numbers grew too numerous. They saw us and started forming religions and folklore. We had to disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is how it is,\u201d Karina said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cPeople like me have been keeping the Ordinators at bay for over thirty thousand years. Occasionally they break through with a new weapon. Sometimes it\u2019s a virus that kills the food supply. Sometimes it\u2019s bubonic plague. Sometimes they find a way to fiddle with the climate. The problem is that the Ordinators breed faster than us, they\u2019re better organized, and their job is easier: it\u2019s much simpler to destroy something than to protect it.</p><p>\u201cThere were thirteen Houses, one for each landing site. They have one House, the House of Mare. There are probably between one and two hundred thousand of them. We are the soldiers of the remaining twelve Houses. There are maybe fifty thousand of us. We crossbreed and have children with weird powers instead of dying out the way we should. This is the planet where everything went wrong. As humanity moves closer and closer to interstellar space flight, the Ordinators are getting desperate, because once we reconnect with the root civilization, it\u2019s all over for them. They abandoned the original mandate and they will be exterminated. They\u2019re attacking with everything they\u2019ve got and we\u2019re losing the fight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared at him. \u201cAnd where do I fit in?\u201d</p><p>He took her hand and squeezed it gently. \u201cYou know why my people died out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause their own venom poisoned them?\u201d Karina said.</p> <p>\u201cThat. But also because the colonists had done some projections. It was decided that if we were allowed to exist, we would destroy the other subspecies and then die out before reaching the level of medical sophistication necessary to fix our defect. They poisoned us, wiped out the entire species almost completely. They were right\u2014even now the synthetic substitutes are just a Band-Aid. See, if we could\u2019ve overcome this handicap, they would\u2019ve let us murder everyone else, but the problem is that only one very specific subspecies produces the hormones we need. The Base Strain. The donors. The ones who gave rise to all of us.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her hand back. \u201cYou mean I am a descendant of the original colonists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Your type has a remarkably stable genome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut my parents were normal people!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may not have known who they were. Maybe only one of them was a donor. A donor and Subspecies 61 will produce donor offspring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about this?\u201d She held out her arms, speckled with brilliant red. \u201cExplain this!\u201d</p><p>Lucas sat up. \u201cWhen I fed on you, the mutation agent entered your bloodstream. In normal humans the mutation agent has grown weak over the generations. But I am carrying a near-full dose and I gave it to you during the feeding. You are changing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInto what?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your DNA besides the donor genes. The mutation agent is an inhibitor. It will release the brakes within your body, short-circuiting your DNA repair, and let you develop into something that\u2019s already there in your genotype, acquired over the centuries of crossbreeding with different human subspecies but suppressed. You could become Subspecies 61, but I doubt it. Chances are, it will be one of our subspecies instead.\u201d</p> <p>They had taken her freedom, her home, and her dignity, and now they were taking away her body. \u201cNo! No, I am not doing it! I won\u2019t! You hear me?\u201d Karina surged to her feet. She managed two steps. Pain shot up through her bones. She cried out. The world went red and she crashed onto the floor.</p><p>It hurt. It hurt more than any pain she could remember. At first she begged, then she prayed, then she screamed and whimpered, squeezing her eyes shut, opening them again, glimpsing Lucas\u2019s face against the harsh light of the vault, and then sinking into more pain. If only she could pass out completely and be done with it, but no, every time she tried, he shook her back, into the place of hurt.</p><p>\u201cCome on, stay with me. Stay awake. Snap out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me be,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>\u201cYou pass out, you die. Come on. Stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you! You did this to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Lucas snarled right back. \u201cHate me. Fight with me. Stay awake. You die, Emily will be alone. You don\u2019t want to leave your daughter with an asshole like me.\u201d</p><p>She just wanted the torture to stop.</p> <p>Another bout of agony rocked her. When it was over, she was so tired, she could barely breathe.</p><p>\u201cThe other woman . . .\u201d Karina whispered. Forcing the words out felt like trying to swallow glass. \u201cDid she have to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you kidnap her, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lucas gathered her closer, holding her against him. \u201cShe was one of us. Her family were donors of Daryon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she hurt, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s eyes were so dark, they seemed almost brown.</p><p>\u201cTell me about her.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure why she wanted to know, but she did.</p><p>\u201cShe was very smart. And she looked beautiful. Very graceful, fragile, elegant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like me, then?\u201d Nobody would call her fragile. Or elegant, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cNothing like you,\u201d he told her quietly.</p><p>The agony burned through her in a crippling spasm. \u201cWhy does it sound like a compliment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she only looked beautiful. In our world nobody has the luxury of doing nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone has a function. I protect. Someone else oversees mining. Someone else oversees stocks and finances. Galatea\u2019s family had only one function: to provide Base Strain to the House. For that they were sheltered, fed, and protected. Galatea never worked a day in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be nice,\u201d Karina whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t think so. She wanted the mutating agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted this? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cShe thought she would become something much more prized than a donor and she would be free of me. Her father was my first donor. She wasn\u2019t supposed to become one, but he died, and she had to take his place. She thought I was an animal. She was convinced that once I fed, she would become a Ripper and could use it as leverage to be free of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she become?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn Electric. She senses electric currents. It\u2019s not an uncommon subspecies. A lot of technicians come from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Karina managed. Her lips were so dry, but there was no water. \u201cLet me guess: it was your fault, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt was everyone\u2019s fault. She used to scream and throw fits, and then she wanted to fuck and she wanted me to beg for it. I was young and stupid. She was older, smarter, and beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Karina raised her hand and touched his haggard face. \u201cYou loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I was so dumb, I thought it was enough. That\u2019s why I let it go that far. She once told me that we, the House, had stolen her life. She wanted to stroll the streets of London, visit the Tate Modern, go to concerts in Royal Albert Hall. I offered to take her. She told me that it wouldn\u2019t be the same. My presence would poison London for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds charming,\u201d Karina managed.</p><p>\u201cI am what I am,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cNo illusions. Life with me is hard, but she made a personal hell for me and her. I wasn\u2019t the one who started sex, but I finished it. I dealt with it for four years and when I turned twenty-two, I decided I was done. I went on synthetics and told Arthur to find her a different place. He transferred her to a technical work crew. She tried to stab me with a knife when she found out. Galatea was never fond of getting her hands dirty. Three months later, during an attack, she disappeared. The next time Henry sensed her presence, we ran into the Ordinators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe betrayed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she did.\u201d Lucas shifted her carefully. \u201cAnd now you know the whole story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you miss her?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He peered at her face. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss my husband,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor any of it. For the motel, for the feeding, for this.\u201d Karina tried to swallow the pain away, but it remained. She wouldn\u2019t make it. She could feel death crouching just a few feet away. \u201cLucas, you\u2019re not a bad person. You have no idea how scary you are, but you\u2019re kind and patient. If things were different . . . It has to start right . . . And we just can\u2019t, because I would never be more than a slave and you would always own me. Please take care of Emily for me. Don\u2019t let anyone hurt her. She\u2019s a great kid.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He just held her.</p><p>Karina awoke slowly. Within her body, the pain subsided, gradually, like a receding tide, fighting for every step of its retreat.</p><p>She opened her eyes and saw Lucas\u2019s neck. Her face was buried in it.</p><p>He was kneeling on the floor, looking up. She was wrapped in his arms.</p><p>Her voice shook. \u201cWhy are you holding me?\u201d</p><p>Lucas turned to look at her. His face was too close to hers. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to die alone on the floor.\u201d</p><p>She said things. Stupid, stupid things. Maybe it was a dream. His eyes assured her that it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cPlease put me down.\u201d</p><p>He let her go slowly. Karina slid down onto her knees and sat clumsily on the floor. Her legs shook a little. She felt light, so light and cold. \u201cIs my change over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said.</p><p>She had survived. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe change isn\u2019t always obvious. Something will trigger it sooner or later.\u201d He was looking up again. She glanced up, too, and saw a monitor in the ceiling. It showed an empty hallway.</p><p>A man in dark clothes darted across the hallway, brandishing a machine gun, and hid behind the wall.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re being attacked,\u201d Lucas said. His voice was calm, almost casual.</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Emily. Henry had her. If they were being attacked, her daughter would be in danger.</p><p>More people flickered past on the screen.</p><p>\u201cThe Ripper must have been an Ordinator mole,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cWe should\u2019ve gone to a ranch in Montana\u2014that\u2019s our evacuation route from that base. Instead we\u2019re in Detroit. This building is nearly abandoned; only the bottom three floors and the top five\u2014those are ours\u2014are operational. The blocks in a one-mile radius around it are basically deserted. We\u2019re sitting ducks here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Arthur evacuate us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cThe Ordinators likely blocked the exits. We landed into a trap.\u201d His face was dark. \u201cOur best chance is to stay here.\u201d</p><p>No. No, she had to go and find Emily. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at my limit. Normally I would be drugged and sleeping this off for the next two or three days until my body came to terms with my venom. I could barely hold you. Most likely Arthur has sent for reinforcements. The vault is solid and must be opened from the inside. It will take them several hours to get through the door, so it\u2019s likely they won\u2019t bother with us right away. By the time they get around to it, we might be reinforced. Our best bet is to stay here and wait it out. We probably die either way, but here we have more of a chance. Especially if we\u2019re quiet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have to let me out.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, obviously trying to decide if she was crazy. She had to convince him she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHenry has Emily,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s out there somewhere.\u201d Out in an abandoned building full of people with guns and God knows what sort of weird powers.</p> <p>Lucas looked at her for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cI have to find her, Lucas. You don\u2019t have to come with me. All I ask is that you help me open the door, because I don\u2019t know how. I\u2019ll find her myself.\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked at the door. If they opened the vault, he would walk out of it a dead man. She stood before him, her eyes huge and brimming with worry. She just wanted her little girl back and she didn\u2019t understand how far gone he was or how many enemies they would face.</p><p>Everyone dies, Lucas reflected. He\u2019d been a selfish bastard all of his life. If he walked out of that door and died helping her find her child, at least he\u2019d die doing something worthwhile, not cowering like a dog in the vault, waiting to be gunned down.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t go out there alone. She would be dead in minutes.</p> <p>He sighed, rose, and stepped to the wall. Karina clenched her hands. She couldn\u2019t read his face. He touched it and a section of it slid open, revealing a number keypad and a small speaker. His fingers played with the keys. \u201cCousin?\u201d Lucas said softly.</p><p>A faint hiss of static issued from the wall, then Henry\u2019s faint voice came through. \u201cLucas. Red, gray, seven, pinned.\u201d</p><p>Lucas grimaced. \u201cIs the little girl with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t move. I\u2019m coming to get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unwise,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>Lucas slid the panel back in place. \u201cHe is two floors below us. He\u2019s been shot. Emily is okay; he is keeping her under. He can\u2019t move because it\u2019s too dangerous and he is cloaking, which makes him harder to find, but they will locate him eventually. The moment we leave this vault, you and I must fight to survive. Remember how you tried to cut me with your knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind that woman and be her.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea how hard she had worked on hiding that woman and how ready she was to let her out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Lucas walked over to the vault door, punched in a combination in the small number pad, and turned the wheel in the door\u2019s center. Something clanged inside the door. Lucas moved to stand on the side. With a soft hiss, the door swung open and Karina stared straight at a man with a gun.</p><p>\u201cHands up!\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>The barrel of the machine gun glared at her, black and huge, like the mouth of a cannon.</p><p>\u201cI said hands up!\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded at her. She raised her hands.</p><p>\u201cSubspecies?\u201d the man demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a donor,\u201d she said.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cGet up and walk to me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Karina said, keeping her voice monotone. \u201cI\u2019m sick. I can\u2019t walk.\u201d</p><p>The man moved into the vault, one step at a time, careful, the gun pointing at her. He took three steps in. Lucas lunged, so quick she barely saw it. His hands closed about the man\u2019s neck. Bones crunched, and the man sagged down on the floor, limp.</p><p>A week earlier, she would\u2019ve screamed. Now she just got up and ran over to the body.</p><p>Lucas staggered, leaned against the wall, and pushed himself upright. He wasn\u2019t joking. He really was at his limit.</p><p>She crouched by the body and began going through the man\u2019s pockets. \u201cI can do this alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d He picked up the man\u2019s machine gun and handed it to her. \u201cSafety here.\u201d He flipped a small switch. \u201cPoint and pull the trigger. Your instinct will tell you to keep clenching it. Don\u2019t. Count to three in your head and let go of the trigger. Short bursts.\u201d</p><p>Karina took the gun and raised it. It was heavy like a cement block. \u201cYou do realize that I can kill you with this.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to say it. It just came out.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He turned his back to her and went out of the vault. A pair of jeans and a sweatshirt lay by the door. Lucas pulled on the clothes and started down the hallway. She followed him. He moved like a cat, soundless on bare feet.</p><p>They came to the end of the hallway. Lucas leaned against the wall, glanced around the corner, and looked at her. \u201cPoint and pull the trigger,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cCount to three,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>There were people at the end of that hallway. People she would have to kill. It\u2019s them or us. Kill or be killed.</p><p>She took a deep breath, stepped into the hallway, and pulled the trigger. The gun spat thunder. Bullets ripped into four distant shadows. She thought there would be blood, but no. They just jerked and went down, screaming. She pounded the bullets into the bodies for another long breath and let go. Lucas moved next to her.</p><p>It was a test, she realized. He had to know if he could rely on her. Well, he could. She\u2019d kill every one of them to get to Emily.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to letting go on three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were four of them,\u201d she said. Movies and books told her she should be throwing up now, but she didn\u2019t feel queasy. Her mouth was dry. It would probably hit her later, but now only Emily mattered. \u201cI decided to take two extra seconds.\u201d</p><p>Karina followed Lucas through the dark passageways as fast as she could. She was squeezing everything she had out of her exhausted body. Now that the first flush of adrenaline had worn off, fatigue set in. She didn\u2019t walk, she dragged herself forward, shot when Lucas shot, stopped when he stopped. Only the next step mattered and she gritted her teeth and managed it again and again.</p><p>They made it to a small door. Lucas punched a code into the lock, the door snapped open, and they went through onto a concrete landing. Lucas punched the lock and the small square light in its corner turned red.</p><p>\u201cWe rest,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo minutes.\u201d</p><p>Karina sank down to the concrete and he sprawled next to her. The grimy floor was like heaven.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you helping me?\u201d</p><p>His voice was a quiet growl. \u201cBecause I like you. And your little girl.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, feeling the cold concrete under her cheek. That wasn\u2019t it. Lucas was making up for his past sins, but that wasn\u2019t all of it, either. She knew the true answer. She could read it in his worn-out face. He wanted to save her, because he wanted her to stop flinching when she looked at him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she told him. \u201cThank you for helping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to get up.\u201d He rose.</p><p>She cried out as he pulled her off the floor and followed him down the stairs. An odd sensation clenched her, almost like some internal spring had compressed inside her and now begged to be released. She stumbled, and it vanished.</p><p>One floor. The landing. They were midway down the next flight of stairs when the door below swung open.</p><p>An icy presence clenched her mind in a hard grip. It shut her off, trapping her. She couldn\u2019t move; she couldn\u2019t speak. Time slowed to a crawl.</p><p>The door kept opening, wider and wider. She saw inside it; she saw armed people pour out onto the landing. She knew she had to fire. Instead she just stood there, disconnected from her body.</p><p>And then Lucas shoved her down and sprayed the landing with bullets.</p><p>The presence gripped her mind and squeezed. She couldn\u2019t even scream.</p><p>Orange sparks flared on Lucas\u2019s gun. It died.</p><p>More people spilled into the landing over the bodies. Lucas leaped into the attackers. He smashed one out of the way, cracking the man\u2019s skull against concrete like a walnut. The man slid down, leaving a bright red stain on the wall. Lucas ripped a woman\u2019s throat out with his hand, backhanded another man down the stairs, and shuddered as a handgun barked. Red spray shot out of Lucas\u2019s side. He lunged forward and broke the gunman like a twig and dived into the doorway.</p><p>The sound faded. She was completely disconnected from her body now. Only her vision worked.</p><p>Lucas emerged from the door, bloody, his eyes furious. He must\u2019ve jerked her up, because her view changed and suddenly he was directly above her. He barked something, angry. The world shook. He dived down. His lips closed on hers. She felt nothing. He jerked back up and rocked back and forth, screaming again.</p><p>Henry, she read his lips calling. Henry.</p><p>He kissed her again and rocked, his face jerking up and down. His hands pushed on her chest. She saw the muscles on his arms flex, but felt nothing. The red stain on his sweatshirt spread wider. Was he doing CPR? Was she dying?</p><p>Henry.</p><p>The ice cracked. She heard a distant female scream somewhere impossibly far. Warmth flooded into her. Something popped inside her mind and she saw a radiant light, bright and glorious.</p><p>She\u2019s gone now, Henry\u2019s voice said in her mind. She won\u2019t bother you again. You\u2019re free. Breathe, Karina. Breathe.</p><p>The world snapped back to its normal speed, jerking her back into her body. She felt everything at once: pain, the hardness of the stair under her back, and the rhythmic push of Lucas\u2019s hands on her chest. She gasped. He pulled her up, into his arms.</p><p>\u201cMind Bender attack,\u201d he told her. \u201cUp. Keep moving.\u201d</p><p>The scent of heated metal rising from Lucas was so thick, she almost choked. He wasn\u2019t just hurt. He had to be close to dying. If he died, she would be free, but in this moment she didn\u2019t care. She just wanted him to survive. \u201cYou\u2019ve been shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must move,\u201d he told her and pulled her up to her feet. \u201cFaster!\u201d</p><p>He drove her down the stairs, through the door, and along the narrow hallway. They dashed past a row of offices. Lucas rammed a door head-on and they burst into a small conference room. Henry lay slumped in the corner, his back pressed against a wall that was mirrored floor to ceiling. His cracked glasses sat slightly askew on his blood-smeared face. Emily was curled in the crook of his arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Karina cleared the room in a desperate sprint and dropped to her knees. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Henry said softly. \u201cShe woke up a little when I had to help you, but now she\u2019s sleeping again.\u201d</p><p>Karina hugged her, cradling Emily\u2019s small body. Finally.</p> <p>Lucas shoved the table against the door and landed next to them.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re bleeding, too, cousin.\u201d Henry smiled. \u201cNice of you to join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d Lucas growled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We were hit two minutes after you went into the vault. It was a concentrated assault. They came prepared. The seventeenth floor fell within ten minutes. We were retreating, when I got cut off. I went into cloak almost immediately. Our people may have evacuated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout us?\u201d Karina stared at them.</p> <p>\u201cArthur probably thought I fed,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cYour blood would give me enough of a boost to either get Henry and me clear or to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are surrounding us,\u201d Henry said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I go. They stay,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Henry nodded. \u201cI thought it might be something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Karina gathered Emily closer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to open that door,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cHenry and I will take off. Henry will make sure they concentrate on us and I will make sure to keep them busy. They will follow us. You will wait here for three minutes, then you will take Emily, go out into the hallway, and turn right. You will come to an intersection. Turn right again. That will get you to the stairs. Shoot anyone you see. Then you get the hell out. If you make it out of the building, Arthur won\u2019t look for you right away, since I\u2019ll be dead and he won\u2019t need a donor immediately. Don\u2019t use credit cards, don\u2019t stay twice in the same\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey will kill you!\u201d No, that was not how this would go. The spring of tension inside her shivered, compressing.</p><p>\u201cIt was never about me surviving,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI died when we opened the vault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>God, he pissed her off. \u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, trying to keep a lid on her anger. \u201cWe go to the stairs together and fight our way down. Together.\u201d</p><p>Lucas grabbed her, jerking her close. \u201cYou will do as you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said into his snarl. \u201cI won\u2019t. We go together.\u201d</p><p>The pressure inside her built.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a democracy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLucas, I can\u2019t carry Emily and shoot at the same time. I can barely hold this stupid gun with two hands. Do you think I\u2019m Rambo? It\u2019s suicide for me, Emily, and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a point,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>\u201cSee? They will kill me and your grand sacrifice will be wasted. I don\u2019t want you to die for nothing. I don\u2019t want you to die at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I care if you live or die! My God, you are a moron! We fight our way to the stairs together. We have a better chance that way.\u201d</p><p>He shook her. \u201cI\u2019m trying to save your daughter, you idiot! I\u2019ve been doing this a long time and I am telling you, if we go out there, we\u2019ll all die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also has a point,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>Karina exhaled. Emily\u2019s life was all that mattered. \u201cThen drink my blood and get her out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have to drain you dry. I\u2019m barely conscious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d Karina told him, furious. \u201cYou have the best chance of getting out of here with Emily alive. Drain me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cDo it, Lucas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d Henry said. \u201cBut the Ordinators are coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrain me or we go to the stairs,\u201d Karina said.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll do this my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour way, I die, you die, Emily dies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no time,\u201d Henry said calmly. \u201cYou missed your opportunity. We are all about to die. Don\u2019t let them take you alive. You will regret it.\u201d</p><p>The back wall of the conference room shuddered. Cracks crisscrossed the wood. It shattered and rained down in a waterfall of tiny splinters. People stood behind it, people with automatic weapons and dark helmets shielding their faces. In front of them a tall man with pale hair down to his waist slowly lowered his hand, smiling. She looked into his face and saw her own death there.</p><p>It hit her like a punch. Emily, she, Lucas, and Henry\u2014the four of them really were about to die.</p><p>For nothing. They would die for nothing.</p><p>Lucas surged to his feet, trying to shield her.</p><p>No. No, this was not happening. She was tired and scared and pissed off and she was done with this shit.</p><p>Fuck them all.</p><p>The coiled spring inside her snapped free. Fiery power surged through her in a glorious cascade. It was time to set things right.</p><p>The smile slid off the blond Ordinator\u2019s face. He opened his mouth.</p><p>The power surged from her, up and over her shoulders in twin streams.</p><p>She looked right into his eyes and said, \u201cDie!\u201d</p><p>His face turned green, as if dusted with emerald powder. He crumpled and fell to the floor. She stared at the men behind him and they collapsed like rag dolls.</p><p>Two others burst into her view from the left. She turned and looked at them and watched them die in midstep.</p><p>\u201cAnybody else?\u201d she called out. Her voice rang through the building. \u201cDoes anybody else want some? Because I\u2019ve got plenty!\u201d</p><p>Nobody answered. She marched out into the hallway, turned the corner, and saw a hallway full of people.</p><p>Die.</p><p>They collapsed as one.</p><p>They wanted to exterminate humanity. They had declared a war. Fine. If the Ordinators wanted a war, she would introduce them to one.</p><p>Karina turned. Lucas was staring at her, his mouth hanging open. Next to him Henry stood, blinking as if he hoped that one of the times when he reopened his eyes he would see something different.</p><p>Karina looked above them and saw her own reflection in the mirror wall. Twin streams of green lightning spread out from her shoulders in two radiant green wings. Like Arthur\u2019s red ones.</p><p>\u201cA Wither,\u201d Henry said in a small voice, still blinking. \u201cShe\u2019s a Wither.\u201d</p><p>The memory of burning faces flashed before her and she brushed it aside. Fine. She was a Wither and nobody would ever push her around again.</p><p>Lucas closed his mouth. His gaze met hers and she saw pride and defiance in his eyes. \u201cDo it quick,\u201d he said.</p><p>He expected her to kill him.</p><p>After everything she\u2019d said to him, he expected her to kill him.</p><p>Karina stepped to him. Her lightning wings burned around them. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m the biggest and the strongest and I\u2019ll protect you. We are walking out of here.\u201d</p><p>Henry stopped blinking.</p><p>It took them forty-five minutes to get down the stairs. Karina inhaled the night air. It smelled of acrid smoke and rotting garbage, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Behind her the building rose like a grim tower. It now belonged to the dead. She had walked through every hallway and checked every room, while Henry and Lucas sat waiting and bleeding on the stairs. She had no idea how many people she killed, but it had to be dozens. She checked their faces to make sure they were dead. They all looked the same: features sunken in, emerald green tint painting their skin.</p><p>And now, finally, she was done.</p><p>Her lightning wings had vanished, her power exhausted. Reality returned slowly, in bits and pieces.</p><p>Next to her Lucas stirred. \u201cIf you want to disappear, now is the time. You killed them because they were caught unaware. The House of Daryon won\u2019t be. I don\u2019t know what your plan is but I know that once Arthur realizes what you are, he\u2019ll do everything he can to keep you within the House. You are too powerful to cut loose. He\u2019ll kill you if you refuse, and I don\u2019t know if I can stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Henry said. \u201cIt\u2019s alarming how often I keep repeating that. Withers, Subspecies 21, have several types. You\u2019re type 4. Arthur is type 7. He is more powerful and he has a lot more experience. At your best you can\u2019t take him, and it will take you a long time to build your reserves back up to do anything on a massive scale again. Sometimes it takes years. Not to mention that we will have to fight you if you try to kill Arthur.\u201d</p><p>Karina looked at Lucas. \u201cIf I leave, how will you feed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSynthetics,\u201d he said. \u201cThey take the edge off.\u201d</p><p>His entire body was tense, like a string pulled too tight. He didn\u2019t want her to go. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you want,\u201d he said. \u201cFreedom. One more day or maybe many. It\u2019s yours. Take it.\u201d</p><p>Henry cleared his throat. \u201cThe Ordinators . . .\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked at him. Henry closed his mouth with a click.</p><p>Karina peered at Lucas\u2019s face. \u201cDidn\u2019t you promise me you would find me if I escaped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I promise you it will take me a really long time to find you. Go now.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. Emily stirred in Lucas\u2019s arms, waking up.</p><p>Lucas could find her\u2014she saw the certainty of it in his eyes. If he could find her, the Ordinators could find her as well, and they would be much more motivated. And even if she did escape, she would always be living on the run, hiding from everyone and afraid of every shadow. She had no doubt that Emily was a donor. She had a responsibility to her child\u2014she had to teach Emily how to protect herself or when they would be found, Emily would be caught unaware, just like she was.</p><p>Karina looked out into the city. That way lay freedom. Even twelve hours before, Karina Tucker would\u2019ve taken it in a blink. But she was no longer that Karina Tucker. Nothing would ever be the same. There was a chasm between her old self and her new self, and it was filled with Ordinator bodies. Too much had happened. It changed her and there was no going back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman who only days before had driven four children on a school trip was dead. She had been a nice girl, kind and a little naive, because she thought she knew what tragedy was. That woman had a small, secure, cozy life. Karina missed her and she took a moment to mourn her. It hurt to let go of that life. She shed it anyway, but not like a butterfly breaking free of the cocoon. More like a snake leaving its old skin. And this new Karina took risks. She was stronger, harder, and more powerful. There was a war going on and she would take part in it.</p><p>And even if she chickened out and tried to walk away, the memory of Lucas would keep her from going too far. She had more in common with a man who turned into a monster than she did with Jill and her endless worry over seat belts. She couldn\u2019t leave him behind now, back in the place where everyone was scared of him, where Arthur used him with no regard for Lucas\u2019s life, where his brother continuously bickered and fought with him. She had Emily. Lucas had no one and he wanted her so badly. And she wanted him. Right or wrong, she no longer cared. It was her decision and she made it.</p><p>\u201cDecide,\u201d Lucas told her. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay out in the open.\u201d</p> <p>Only one question remained. Karina took a deep breath and closed the distance between her and Lucas. She lifted her face and looked into his green eyes and kissed him.</p><p>For a moment he stood still and then he kissed her back, his mouth eager and hungry for her. When they broke apart, Henry was staring at them.</p><p>\u201cI am confused,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t let you go back on your own,\u201d Karina said. \u201cAll beat up and sad. Arthur might kill you somehow, or Daniel will bring the house down, or Henry, you might poison everyone with your cooking.\u201d</p><p>Emily opened her eyes. \u201cMommy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Detroit. We had to make a stop here for a little while, but Lucas and Henry are taking us home with them now.\u201d</p><p>There had to be words to describe the look on Lucas\u2019s face, but she didn\u2019t know them. He probably didn\u2019t know them, either. He looked like he wasn\u2019t sure if he were surprised, relieved, happy, or mad.</p><p>\u201cI believe there is a fast-food place three blocks north,\u201d Henry said. \u201cWe could go there, use their phone, and drink coffee while we wait to get picked up. I could use some coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make it?\u201d Lucas asked.</p> <p>\u201cIf I faint, just leave me in the street.\u201d</p><p>Lucas slid his shoulder under Henry\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>They started down the street.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t own me anymore,\u201d Karina said quietly.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I will have my own room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if you need to feed, you will ask me. Nicely.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and glared at her.</p><p>\u201cNicely,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all kidding aside, you will still cook, right?\u201d Henry asked. \u201cYou said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I will definitely cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Henry said. \u201cI was afraid you would quit and we would have to eat Lucas\u2019s cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cooking is fine,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>Ahead, the familiar yellow-on-red sign rose on the corner.</p><p>\u201cAre we going there, Mommy?\u201d Emily pointed at the sign.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have money to get ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have twenty dollars,\u201d Henry said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bloody, but they will take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll take it,\u201d Lucas said grimly.</p><p>Karina pictured Lucas, a little bloody and a little pissed off, breaking the McDonald\u2019s counter in half. Hopefully it wouldn\u2019t come to that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby. We\u2019ll get you all the ice cream you want.\u201d Karina glanced back at the husk of the skyscraper. For a second she thought she saw her own self waving good-bye. Her new self smiled back. People who knew the old Karina would judge her, if they knew, but that didn\u2019t matter. She made her own choices now.</p><p>She put her hand on Lucas\u2019s arm. He bent it at his elbow, letting her fingers rest on his muscled forearm, and they walked side by side into the night. </p> </body></html>"]
